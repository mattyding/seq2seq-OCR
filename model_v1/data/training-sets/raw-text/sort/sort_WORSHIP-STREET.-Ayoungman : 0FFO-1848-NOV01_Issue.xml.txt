 - A young man named William Morell was placed at the bar before Mr
 HAMMILL, charged with having broken into the house of Mr
 John Freemantle, a warehouseman in Singleton-street, Hoxton, and stolen therein a large quantity of wearing apparel and other property
 The prosecutor stated that while taking tea with his wife on the basement story of his house on the preceding evening, a female lodger entered in great alarm and told them that she had just heard the sound of footsteps in an upper room, and felt satisfied that some thieves had effected an entrance
 He immediately hastened upstairs, and finding that the street-door and also the door of a parlour communicating with the passage were partly open, he at once closed and locked them both, and proceeded to his bedroom, upon entering which he found the whole of the drawers, in which his own and his wife's wardrobe were kept, had been drawn out and emptied of their contents
 Every other part of the room had been also thoroughly ransacked, and on looking under the bed for a pair of new boots he had left there, he found that one of them had disappeared
 After searching every other room in the house without making any further discovery, witness returned to the parlour, and the moment he unlocked the door his wife directed his attention to a man's leg which protruded from underneath a table in the centre of the room, and which was encased in the new boot he had missed from his bedroom
 He instantly caught hold of the projecting limb and dragged out the prisoner, whose other foot was uncovered, and his own shoes, which he had taken off to effect the exchange, were found under the table, where two bundles, containing silk dresses and cardinals, together with other property belonging to his wife, and the whole of his own clothing, were also discovered
 Holland, the warrant-officer, who happened to be passing at the time, and apprehended the prisoner, stated that two men, who were supposed to be the prisoner's confederates, were seen lurking about the house just before the alarm was raised, and they had no doubt admitted him by means of skeleton keys, as nothing was found in his possession but a large knife and a box of lucifer matches
