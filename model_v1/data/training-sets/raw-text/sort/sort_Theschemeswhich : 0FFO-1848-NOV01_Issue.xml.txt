The schemes which have been propounded for the regeneration of the German Empire are so numerous, so conflicting, and still so incomplete, that we have abstained from a close examination of the fleeting shapes which the fancy of German legislators or the accidents of the time have assigned to the Imperial Constitution
 Our attention is, however, recalled to the subject by the progress actually made by the Frankfort Assembly in its momentous task; and as that body has wisely resolved to abstain from settling by way of preliminaries the axioms of political science and the precise limits of the fundamental rights of man, there is more reason to hope that they will proceed to handle the practical and essential parts of government
 One of the most important contributions which we have seen to this great object is a second pamphlet or address from the pen of Chevalier BUNSEN, the Prussian Minister in London in which he has pointed out several of the principles which are most essential to the construction of this vast and complicated structure
 If it be desirable in the government of a well-regulated commonwealth to erect any checks or barriers to the absolute power of the multitude, and to trust no class with unlimited means of exercising a predominant authority, it is clear that the distinction between federal power and separate sovereignty affords a natural and permanent means of accomplishing this object
 We have seen the attempt to create a second Chamber on the principle of the British House of Peers fail in a variety of instances, because the materials of such an Assembly were wanting, and it was impossible suddenly to invest individuals with the traditions, the independence, the wealth, and the influence attached to hereditary rank
 But in a Confederation, the several members of the nation and their representatives in the Senate may be regarded without a metaphor as peers of the realm, and their natural opposition to the central or predominant power of any one State, or even of a popular majority, raises a barrier and applies a check not dissimilar in its effects to that which is supplied by an aristocratic Assembly
 In the present state of Germany, where the aristocracy has suffered even a greater diminution of power than the Sovereigns, this expedient seems to be the only effectual means of opposing the uncontrolled force of a democratic Assembly
 Chevalier BUNSEN therefore insists on the creation of an Upper House of States, not very unlike the late Diet of the Confederation or the Senate of the United States
 The American Senate, however, discharges two distinct functions - the first legislative, in concert with the House of Representatives; the second executive, in concert with the President alone
 This latter power Chevalier BUNSEN proposes to place in the hands, not of the Senate of Germany, but of a Council of the Empire, composed of the reigning Sovereigns of the larger States or their proxies, who would thus have a veto and an influence on questions of peace and war, on the conclusion of treaties, and on the patronage of the central Government
 As the number of German States and the inequality between them is extreme, he recommends the revival of a division of Germany into Circles of the Empire, based on the existing military divisions of the Federal army
 These circles would be so distributed that without any alteration of the territorial rights of each State, three or four of them would fall to the share of Austria and Prussia respectively, two to Bavaria, &c
, whilst several of the minor States would be united in one circle, and represented accordingly in the Upper Chamber of the Empire
 The plan is, as it appears to us, extremely ingenious and equitable, and it combines several of the happiest parts of the American constitution with the historical idiosyncrasies of Germany; but though it might well deserve the consideration of a congress of Sovereigns and statesmen, it will probably tend to defeat rather than to promote the real designs of a considerable portion of the Frankfort Assembly
 It cannot have escaped our readers that when the extreme Radical party in Germany so loudly took up the cry of German unity and a revival of the Empire, their first object was to subvert and trample on the dignity and power of all existing Sovereigns and Governments, from the obvious calculation that if they crushed the independence and the resistance of established institutions, the central Power, scarcely raised upon a tottering soil, would infallibly be at their mercy
 Hence the insults which have been offered to the most glorious symbols of the Prussian nation in the heart of its capital - hence the participation of the German faction of the extreme Left in the rebellion of Vienna
 In every Federal Government the balance of power inclines either to one side or the other: either the federal authority is decidedly and constantly superior to that of the States, as in America, or the States are comparatively independent of any supreme control, except in certain instances, and this was the case with the late Swiss and Germanic constitutions
 These bodies were not so much confederations as leagues
 The Swiss and the Germans are now resolved to throw the balance decidedly to the centre, and to form a real confederation at the expense of an equal amount of state-independence
 But in the case of Germany there is this peculiarity - that the proposed union is a confederation of Kings, to be combined with, and under the authority of, another Sovereign
 That is the novelty of the experiment, and the German Republicans may certainly be pardoned for anticipating that the principle of monarchy can ill support so severe a trial
 Sovereignty is one of those ideas which admits of no subtraction
 It is either complete or nothing; and if the German Sovereigns assent to the conditions of the Frankfort constitutions, they pass at once into the condition of subjects; there is no intermediate stage
 These difficulties of principle and theory have been greatly increased by the decision just taken by a large majority in the Frankfort Assembly to the effect that no non-German possession is to be united in one State with German territories
 This article of the Federal Constitution of course implies the exclusion or dismemberment of all the mixed States of which part belongs to the Germanic body and part does not, as, for instance, Holland, Denmark, and especially the empire of Austria
 The last intelligence we received from Copenhagen clearly intimates the resolution of the Danish Diet to maintain the rights of that Crown in Schleswig
 Limburg forms a province of Holland, and some of the non-German possessions of Austria are an essential part of her power
 The rulers of these States, and above all of Austria, can never consent to reduce their national system of government and defence to a mere personal union of their respective titles, for the sole purpose of reducing their German provinces to a dependency of another central Power
 Whatever be the amount of territory and force retained by Austria after the present convulsion has subsided, her possessions must form one distinct and undivided State
 As Baron GAGERN ably pointed out, her independence and unity are essential to Germany as well as to herself; and although his amendment was defeated at Frankfort, we have no doubt that the Austrian Government will reject a condition which is inconsistent with the united government of the Imperial dominions
