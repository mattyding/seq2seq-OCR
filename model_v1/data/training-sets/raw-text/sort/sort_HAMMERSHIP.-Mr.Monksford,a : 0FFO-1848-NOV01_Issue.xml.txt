 - Mr
 Monksford, a respectable grocer and teadealer in High-street, Notting-hill, applied to Mr
 BEADON, the sitting magistrate, for his advice and assistance under the following circumstances:- Mr
 Monksford stated, that on the 7th of September last he was called upon by a person of gentlemanly appearance, who announced himself to be the "celebrated Captain Pidding," the well-known importer of the famous Howqua tea, and said, he called on applicant, on the recommendation of Mr
 Way, of Oxford street, who had succeeded him (Mr
 Monksford) in business there, to offer him the agency for the sale of his tea for Notting-hill
 He stated, that the advantages of the agency would be very considerable; that a sale of 300l
 worth of tea might be effected in such a populous district as that in the course of a year; that he would send down a number of Chinese ornaments to put into his window, one of which would be a battle-piece, worth 50l
; that he would also send down some Chinese ornaments and some printed cards, the latter to be presented to each of the purchasers of a quarter of a pound or a larger quantity of Howqua tea, which card, on being shown on the next visit to the shop, was to entitle the purchaser to one of the images
 He also promised that he would advertise his (Mr
 Monksford's) name amongst his list of agents in four of the daily papers and in all the weekly journals, as well as most of the periodicals
 He would also, for the purpose of making an extraordinary sensation in the neighbourhood, send down some men with printed handbills to distribute outside the shop, by which course a crowd would be caused to collect and public notice drawn to the teas
 He further stated his residence to be at Assam-hall, Sydenham, Kent; that he had also an estate at Dartmouth, and was a merchant of the city of London
 By these and other representations of Captain Pidding applicant was induced to accept the agency, when the captain told him, in order to secure himself (Captain Pidding) from loss by applicant resigning his agency, that shortly after the distribution of the printed bills it would be required that applicant should sign an agreement to undertake the agency for a year, and pay down the sum of 10l
, which would be allowed him in the payment of the first order for 50l
 Applicant accordingly signed the agreement, and gave the captain a check for 10l
 Nearly two months having elapsed without having received any tea, although the captain promised to send him 100l
 worth down that week, he began to suspect that he had been duped, and accordingly went and made inquiries about Captain Pidding, and found that he did not live at Assam-hall, Sydenham, that he had no estate at Dartmouth, and upon going to the captain's brother in the city he was told that no order had been received from the captain to send applicant any tea, but that if he gave an order it would be supplied to him on its being paid for
 Since then he had seen Mr
 Hobler, the solicitor, who advised him to go to the Lord Mayor at the Mansion-house, and there publicly state his case, but, on applying there, Mr
 Goodman, the chief clerk, informed him that he did not think the Lord Mayor would entertain his application, it not being within his Lordship's jurisdiction, and that he had better lay his complaint before the magistrate of the police-court of the district in which he resided, which had caused him to come to that court
 BEADON said he did not see how he could help him
 He thought that the applicant's only remedy would be by action in the County Court for the recovery of the 10l
 Monksford said, Mr
 Hobler had considered that a charge of obtaining money under false pretences might be sustained under the circumstances
 BEADON reminded the applicant that there were many cases in which money was improperly obtained where the pretence was not a false one
 As the applicant's object was that the members of his trade and the public generally should be cautioned on the subject, he had no doubt that the present application would fully answer the end desired
 The applicant then thanked the magistrate for his attention and kindness, and quitted the court
