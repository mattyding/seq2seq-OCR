 THE WAR IN MOOLTAN
 We have received by express from Marseilles our advices and papers from India in anticipation of the overland mail of the 3d of October from Bombay
 The dates thus received are from Calcutta to the 22d of September, Madras to the 25th, and Bombay to the 3d of October
 Frontier affairs have assumed a much more serious aspect
 The intelligence is unsatisfactory alike respecting the operations before Mooltan and the general state of the Punjab
 Our forces in that direction have suffered a check in consequence of the defection of the auxiliary Sikh troops
 Just as the operations of General Whish's Brigade had commenced in the most brilliant manner, Shere Singh, with the force of nearly 5,000 men under his command, went over to the Dewan, evidently upon a pre-arranged plot - an event which compelled General Whish instantly to change his tactics, to raise the siege, and having made a retrograde movement, to unite his forces in an entrenched camp at some 15 miles from the citadel, there to await in a more favourable position the junction of the reinforcements from Ferozepore and Scinde
 Two engineer officers had since, it appears, fallen into the hands of the enemy
 Moolraj, by Shere Singh's defection, had augmented his adherents to about 20,000 men, with the probability of a further accession of nearly as many more
 Chutter Singh, the rebel leader in the Hazareh, was marching with about 10,000 men to join the Dewan; and although Gholab Singh had not more positively than heretofore gone over to the conspiracy, two of the regiments, with stores and baggage, had left to join the Hazareh Sikhs
 At Lahore the features of this frontier rebellion were not less pronounced, although happily from our excellent measures of defence there the circumstance occasions no ground for ultimate apprehension as to our hold upon the capital
 We find, however, that several other Sirdars of the Durbar had been found to be implicated, and that in consequence of this fact the Resident, on receipt of the intelligence from Mooltan, had at once secured under a guard the person of Dhuleep Singh, as a hostage, to influence those who wavered, as well as to frustrate attempts made by the Sikhs in arms to get possession of the Maharajah's person
 The Resident had also, we are told, laid hands on the famous Koh-i-noor diamond, as a measure of similar precaution
 Troops were being poured into Scinde by sea from Bombay, to occupy the line of the middle Indus, and to march, should their services be required, upon the Punjab
 The Bombay force when united would amount to about 10,000 men
 Some of the Madras regiments would reinforce the Bombay stations, at the same time that a general advance was preparing from the Bengal frontier
 From the latter direction a well-apportioned force, amounting to about 20,000 men, would march upon Mooltan, under General Gilbert
 No troops could, it appears, be spared from Lahore, but it was considered the cavalry regiments still left in Ferozepore would be quite sufficient to keep open the line of communication with the camp of General Whish; in other words, to frustrate any rising between him and the capital
 Under these circumstances, the position of the British force in the field, strongly entrenched, with a park of artillery of 70 guns, and their flank on the river, at some 15 miles from Mooltan, may be regarded as secure under any contingency
 On the whole, happily, there appears every ground for belief that the preparations announced from all sides of India to retrieve the check we have described are on a scale of magnitude probably commensurate rather with the extent of past supineness in its exaggerated reaction than the actual degree of danger
 Such at least is the opinion of parties who from the first were urgent for the adoption of active measures, and who at present are the least alarmed by the ultimate features the outbreak has assumed, or inclined to doubt of a speedy and successful termination
 Mooltan would now be attacked by separate armies from the south and from the north, when, it has been affirmed, mere detachments in the earlier months would have sufficed, but it is added that there now appears every probability that long before the Bombay army shall have reached the seat of war the few regiments that have already arrived without orders from head-quarters - namely, the Rifle Brigade from Scinde, and the European cavalry from Ferozepore, will supply what is wanting to our troops who are in the presence of the enemy, and that General Whish, with a body of picked infantry, European and native, and some 3,000 cavalry (an arm hitherto deficient), which will have reached him, with a park of field and siege artillery, and under the prestige of recent success, will certainly reap the honours of the campaign, should the temerity of the Dewan, or the precipitancy of his forces tempt them, as is not unlikely, to an attack
 This opinion seems borne out by other details which have reached us as to the recent conduct of our troops, who, in the siege operations, stormed the outworks, forestalling the work of regular approaches, and up to the hour when breaching distance had thereby been attained - an hour marked by the instant defection of the Sikh Chief - every rencontre, without exception, told the same lesson of superiority in strategy as in conflict that Edwardes and his Pathaus before taught the insurgents under earlier and still more desperate circumstances
 The following officers had fallen in the siege operations during an attack on an outpost unrivalled for desperate gallantry in the annals of the army, namely, Colonel Pattonu, Major Montizambert, Quarter-Master Taylor, Lieutenant Cubitt, and Ensign Lloyd
 The following casualties by death in the armies of India are reported since the departure of the mail on the 15th of September:- Her Majesty's Troops
