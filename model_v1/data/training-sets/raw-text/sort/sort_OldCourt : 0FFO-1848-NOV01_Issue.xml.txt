 (Before Mr
) Sarah Freeman, 23, spinster, was charged with the wilful murder of male illegitimate child by choking and suffocating it
 Bodkin prosecuted; Mr
 Although the prisoner in this case was charged with the serious crime of wilful murder, the evidence was utterly inadequate to support that charge, and, indeed, the grand jury ignored the bill for murder; but the coroner's jury having found a verdict of wilful murder against the prisoner, it was necessary to dispose of that inquisition
 From the statement of the witnesses, it appeared that the prisoner was in the service of a family of station at the west end of the town as cook, and in the early part of last month, in consequence of a communication that was made to the police, an inspector named Cumming went to the house of the prisoner's master, and questioned her upon the subject of her having been recently delivered of a child
 She admitted she had been, and also said that it only lived a minute or so
 The inspector then asked her where the child was, and a basket was produced which was found to contain the body of an infant thrust into a stocking
 The medical testimony went to show that the child was full grown, and there was some evidence that it had respired; but it was stated that this might have occurred during delivery, and there was an absence of anything like positive evidence that the child was born alive
 Justice WIGHTMAN, in summing up, told the jury that the main question in the case was whether the child was born alive or not, and if that fact was not proved affirmatively to their satisfaction of course there was an end of the charge of murder
 The jury immediately returned their verdict, Acquitting the prisoner of the murder, and finding her Guilty of concealing the birth
