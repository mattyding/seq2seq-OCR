 A public meeting of the "Friends of Peace" was held last night in Exeter-hall, to receive the President and Vice Presidents of the late Peace Congress at Brussels, and to hear a report of the proceedings at that Congress
 The hall, galleries, and platform were crowded, and a very large proportion of the audience were of the male sex
 The chair was taken at 6 o'clock by Mr
 Hindley, M
, and we observed upon the platform M
 Visschers, Councillor to the Belgian Government, and President of the late Peace Congress at Brussels; Dr
 W
P
 Burritt, Lord Beresford, and Sir W
 M
 Bouvet, Member of the French National Assembly, and Baron Suringar, of Holland, who had taken part in the proceedings at Brussels, and whose presence had been expected at this meeting, were unable to attend
 Shortly before the commencement of the proceedings a gentleman in the uniform of the French National Guard, fully accoutred, and wearing side-arms, who stood at the back of the platform, was observed by the audience in the hall, and was greeted with loud cheering
 He was invited to come forward, and took his seat in the first row on the platform, amid renewed applause
 He was announced to the meeting as M
 Jousselin, deputy of the Procureur of the French Republic
 The CHAIRMAN said he felt some difficulty as to the terms in which he ought to address them on this occasion
 He would not call them "ladies and gentlemen;" he would not even address them by the kinder term "friends;" but, following the practice of a religious society with which he was connected, he would call them "brethren and sisters
) The objects of the society by which this meeting was convened were based on the Scriptural principle, "Peace on earth and good will to man
" Let those laugh who would, he was quite certain this principle would prevail, and, while the laughers and scoffers would hereafter be in derision, the friends of peace would be triumphant
) They were aware that, a few months ago, it was thought desirable that a congress of the friends of peace should be held at Brussels
 It was with great regret he stated that, although President of the Peace Society, he had been unable to attend that Congress; but he rejoiced to learn, even from the reports of the enemies of the cause, that that Congress had been a most decided movement in favour of the principles of peace
 They were now assembled to receive the President and Vice-Presidents of the Brussels Congress, and to hear from them a report of its proceedings
 Before those gentlemen addressed them, however, Mr
 Scoble would give the meeting some information as to the arrangements and proceedings of the Congress
 Scoble said that, in complying with the request of the chairman, he would not dwell on the various preliminary arrangements which were made previously to the Brussels Congress
 The original intention had been to hold the Congress at Paris, but circumstances to which it was unnecessary for him further to allude prevented that intention from being carried out
 An application was then made to the Belgian Government to allow the Congress to be held in Brussels
 The reply of the Belgian Minister was, "It is written in the constitution of Belgium that public meetings are open not only to its citizens but to foreigners;" and the Belgian Government afforded every facility in their power to promote the comfort and convenience of the members of the Congress
 There were present at the Congress 130 gentlemen from England, who were accompanied by about 40 English ladies; and 170 gentlemen from Belgium, France, Germany, and Italy
 The Congress sat for two days, and held four sittings, at which resolutions were - with one or two exceptions - unanimously adopted, expressing their opinion that an appeal to arms for the purpose of deciding disputes among nations was a custom condemned alike by religion, justice, reason, and the best interests of the people; that the Governments of Europe and America should be urged to introduce provisions into their treaties for settling national disputes by arbitration; and that it was most important that a general national congress should be held for the purpose of framing a well-digested and authoritative national code, as the unanimous adoption of such a code would be an effectual means of promoting universal peace
 The Congress also urged the necessity of a general and simultaneous disarmament, as a means of greatly diminishing the financial burdens which pressed upon this and other countries, and of promoting an interchange of mutual good offices
 Two important addresses were agreed upon by the Congress - one to the Governments of the civilized Powers of Europe and America, and another to the people of those continents
 The address to the British Government was presented yesterday to Lord John Russell, by a deputation comprising M
 Ewart, M
P
, Mr
 E
 Burritt, and Mr
 Bouvet
 The noble lord received the deputation most courteously, and expressed himself in terms of the deepest interest in reference to movements of this kind, stating that he considered the great gathering at Brussels to be a means of promoting moderation and mutual kindness among the people of Europe
) The noble lord also expressed himself, in general terms, anxious to promote the peace of the world
) Subsequently to the Congress at Brussels letters had been received from men distinguished for their ability and for their position in society in Italy, German, France, Denmark, Schleswig-Holstein, and other parts of Europe, expressing their anxiety to co-operate with the friends of peace in this country to promote the settlement of national disputes by arbitration
