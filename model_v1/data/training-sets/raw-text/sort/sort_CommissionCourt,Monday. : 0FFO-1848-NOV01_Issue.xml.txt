 STATE PROSECUTION
 The Judges sat this morning at 10 o'clock
 O'DOHERTY
 Kevin Izod O'Doherty, one of the proprietors of the Irish Tribune newspaper, was again placed at the bar to stand his trial under the Crown and Government Security Act, having been already twice tried at the last commission, on both of which occasions the jury disagreed
 The Attorney-General, the Solicitor-General, Sergeant O'Brien, the Hon
 Plunket, Q
, Messrs
C
 Pennefather, and Perrin, were of counsel for the Crown; and Messrs
C
, and John O'Hagan acted for the prisoner, with Mr
 The Clerk of the Peace, having called over the panel, proceeded to swear a jury
 Edward Milliken, the first who answered, was desired to stand by by the Crown Solicitor
 BUTT objected to Mr
 Kemmis telling a juror to stand by, as it was the Attorney-General who had that exclusive power
 - I see no necessity for the Attorney-General objecting to a juror in person
 It is not the practice
 - There is one that arises under the statute, which says - Judge CRAMPTON
 - This is a mere matter of form
 It is no matter who desires the party to stand by on behalf of the Crown
 SMYLY
 - The words of the statute are, "as heretofore were accustomed," and the practice was for the Crown Solicitor to act
 BUTT read a section of the statute, to show that the Attorney-General should object in person
 - Then we should make you challenge for the prisoner
 - I would have no objection; but it is the prisoner himself who should do so strictly
 My reason for this objection is, that so great a power should be exercised by an irresponsible party
 - For the reason you have assigned, I will not depart from the ordinary course
 There are some slight differences between the practice in England and Ireland
 In England, if the book is in the hand of the person, it is too late to challenge; here you can challenge any time before the beginning of the oath is administered
 - Any time before the Clerk of the Crown says, "You shall well and truly try
 - We refuse the application
 After several challenges, both on the part of the Crown and the prisoner, Edward Evans was called
 BUTT
 - I live in Nassau-street, and am fruiterer to the Lord-Lieutenant
 - That won't prevent you challenging him peremptorily, Mr
 BUTT
 - We challenge for cause
 - That is no cause
 The effect would be, if allowed, that every tradesman of the Lord-Lieutenant would be disqualified, and he could not deal with the shopkeepers of Dublin
 Put in your challenge, if you like
 BUTT, after a very short delay, put in a formal challenge upon the ground stated
 - This challenge would make the prosecution appear a private one at the suit of the Lord-Lieutenant
 The ATTORNEY-GENERAL having demurred, Mr
 BUTT proceeded to contend that Mr
 Evans could not exercise his office of juror conscientiously, owing to the pressure his official capacity might have upon him
 - We would not waste time on such a point but for the bad attendance of jurors; however, I will not press to have Mr
 - Very well; and your acquiescence is not to be considered as a precedent
 The challenge was then withdrawn, and Mr
 Evans was desired to stand by
 BUTT
 - We challenge this gentleman for cause
 Triers having been sworn, Charles Barber was examined, and swore, that on the first occasion the prisoner was tried he heard Mr
 Austin say outside the court-house (alluding to one of the jurors, a Mr
 Birmingham), that he would find no verdict, and get absolution for 13d
) The SOLICITOR-GENERAL
 - The witness overheard, he says, one gentleman speaking to another
 - I suppose I cannot make any observation? Judge TORRENS
 - You had better not at present
 - There is no evidence, my Lord, to support the challenge
 Judge CRAMPTON
 - I will tell the triers, &c
, there is nothing to show that Mr
 Austin will not give a just and proper verdict
 BUTT contended that what Mr
 Austin said (which was not denied) was certainly evidence to show his feelings towards the prisoner
 - If the case is to go to the triers I will examine Mr
 Austin
 George Austin sworn
 - I heard Barber's evidence, and I can't charge my recollection as to having used the sentiments he imputes to me; but I have no ill feeling to Mr
 O'Doherty, and, even if I said it, it would have no influence on me as a juror The ATTORNEY-GENERAL
 Austin is in doubt whether he used these words or not, I will let him stand by
 The following are the names of the jury as sworn: - Thomas Clarendon, Great Brunswick-street; Thomas Read Milliken, 4, Parliament-street; George Bowles, 1, Lower Ormond-quay; Isaac Farrell, 210, Great Brunswick-street; Joseph Kirk, 22, Jervis-street; Thomas Figgis, 22, Abbey-street; Maurice Brooks, 70, Middle Abbey-street; William Frazer, 37, Arran-quay; James Charles, 61, Mary-street; William Dunbar, 1, Dawson-street; David Foster, 24, Ormond-quay; Richard Connell, 54, Anne-street
 The prisoner was then given in charge of the jury, for having, after the passing of the Crown and Government Security Act, viz
, on the 1st of July last, devised and intended to deprive the Queen of her Royal style, title, honour, &c
, and did express such intentions by publishing numerous articles in the Irish Tribune newspaper, of which he was the registered proprietor, entitled, "Our Harvest Prospects," "Courage," &c
 The ATTORNEY-GENERAL then rose to state the case for the prosecution, which has been published fully on the two former trials
 It was but right, observed the learned gentleman) that he should inform the jury that the prisoner had already been tried by two juries of his countrymen, and that on both occasions the juries had disagreed as to his guilt
 He should remark that the evidence given upon the first of these two trials was not precisely the same as was given on the second; but the evidence adduced for the Crown on the second trial was substantially similar to that which would be given in the present investigation
 Now, no one could entertain a more sincere respect than he did for the opinions of a jury; and if he found, when engaged in the discharge of his official duty, that one, two, or three jurors only had come to a conclusion that the prisoner was guilty, he would certainly not have put him on his trial a second time; but such, he had reason to believe, was not the case; and his present impression was, that they had then an opportunity of considering with greater care than before a new doctrine, which was propounded at the last commission, and, if possible, effect a final settlement of the law which related to the responsibility of newspaper proprietors
 Under these circumstances, he felt it to be his duty to submit the case of Mr
 O'Doherty to a third jury, in order to ascertain whether, under the direction of the Court, they could have any doubt whatever that he was not only legally but morally guilty of the offence with which he was charged
 The learned gentleman then defined at some length the state of the law as applicable to the proprietors of newspapers, and contended that the prisoner, as one of the proprietors of the Irish Tribune, should be held responsible for every article published in that paper
 On this subject, however, he called on them to receive the law as it would be stated to them by the Court, and to place no reliance upon any legal definition that might be given to them by himself or the counsel for the prisoner, except it was in perfect conformity with the opinion of the Court
 Of matters of fact, however, he should at the same time inform them, they (the jury) were the sole judges, and they alone were competent to draw inferences from the facts proved in evidence
 The learned counsel then stated that the publications for which the prisoner had been indicted consisted of five distinct articles, which appeared in two consecutive numbers of the Irish Tribune, published on the 1st and 8th of July, entitled as follows: - "Our Harvest Prospects," "Courage," "A Lesson from the Insurrection of Paris," and two other articles, each headed, "Our War Department
" Having read through all these articles, and having commented upon various passages contained in them, the Attorney-General, in conclusion, proceeded to observe, that so far as himself was concerned, he entertained no personal feelings of hostility towards the prisoner, and that, whatever any portion of the public might think to the contrary, he was resolved to discharge the duty he owed to his Sovereign to the satisfaction of his own conscience
 With respect to any expressions that might be used towards him for the part he had taken in any of the state prosecutions which he had found it necessary to institute, he could only say that there existed in his own mind no feeling of hostility to the writers of any newspapers, and he looked forward with confidence to the good sense of the public to justify him in every step he had taken in the discharge of the duties of his office
 It was necessary, also, to mention that when the case was tried for the first time before the Lord Chief Baron at the last commission, the only evidence given upon the part of the Crown consisted of the mere publication of the newspapers themselves by the prisoner, as a responsible proprietor of the Tribune, and that under such circumstances it was quite impossible for the prisoner to prove that he was not, both in law and in fact, responsible for their contents
 At that trial the Lord Chief Baron charged the jury and told them that the act of publication was to be regarded as prima facie evidence against the prisoner to show his intentions, unless it was rebutted or explained, but never laid it down that it was necessary to give proof that he was the actual writer or author of the articles in question
 With every deference to the opinion of the Chief Baron, he (the Attorney-General) submitted that the offence charged against the prisoner was not the composition, but the publication of the documents given in evidence
 He was charged with having compassed the deposition of the Queen, and with having intended to levy war against her; and the allegation made upon the part of the Crown was, that he evidenced these two intentions by publishing, not writing, certain articles
 The learned gentleman, in support of his proposition, cited the cases of "the King v
 Walter," the proprietor of The Times newspaper, and "the King v
 Gutch, Fisher, and Alexander," with a view to satisfy the Court that the proprietor of a newspaper was both civilly and criminally answerable for the conduct of the servants or agents whom he employed to conduct his paper
 The Attorney-General then referred to the manuscript of the article entitled "Our Harvest Prospects," which he alleged to be in the prisoner's own handwriting, and drew the attention of the jury to the fact, with which the public are already acquainted, of the loss of one of the pages of the document
 Having, in the next place, compared the imperfect manuscript with the printed article in the Tribune, the Attorney-General proceeded to remark, that the jury would themselves see the document, and would have an opportunity of examining it
 It was impossible for him to say why the jury on the last trial had disagreed; but the learned counsel who defended the prisoner commented upon the circumstance that only one gentleman had been produced to swear to the handwriting of the prisoner
 He (the Attorney-General) did not say that the prisoner was bound to produce his friends and relatives to disprove that the document was in his handwriting, but the identity of handwriting was a matter of opinion
 The prisoner was a member of the medical profession; he served his time to Mr
 Donovan, the chymist, Clare-street, and in that establishment a Mr
 That gentleman would be produced to identify the handwriting of the prisoner
 Upon the last trial that gentleman deposed to his handwriting
 He was the only person that would be produced to prove the handwriting in the manuscript ascribed to the prisoner; and he (the Attorney-General) said, unfeignedly and truly, that if a single witness conscientiously told him that he believed the document was not in the handwriting of the prisoner he should feel it to be his duty to produce him
 Observations were made on the last trial in reference to the non-production of Mr
 If he (the Attorney-General) had believed that Mr
 Donovan would be able to swear that the handwriting was not that of the prisoner he would have brought him forward as a witness, and he should not be taunted with the non-production of persons who might have been produced by the prisoner's counsel, if their evidence could serve him
 Charles Vernon examined by the SOLICITOR-GENERAL
 - Was registrar of newspapers in the Stamp-office
 Produced the certified copy of the certificate of the prisoner's proprietorship of the Tribune newspaper, and proved the signature of the prisoner to two publications of the paper (the 1st and 8th of July)
 - Had no doubt about the handwriting

 - Was a sergeant of police
 On the 8th of July went to the establishment of Mr
 Purdon, on Bachelors'-walk; went there to apprehend Hoban, the registered printer of the Tribune
 Made a search for papers
 Got a great quantity of manuscripts and conveyed them to the Lower Castle Yard
