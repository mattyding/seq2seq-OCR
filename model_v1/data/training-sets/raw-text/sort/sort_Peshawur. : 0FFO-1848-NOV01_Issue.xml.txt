 (From the Delhi Gazette of September 16
) Our anticipations regarding the danger at Peshawur have been verified, but we are happy to say, only partially, and without any serious result
 A letter of the 5th inst
, which has unfortunately not come to hand, appears to have described what actually took place, but we gather from one dated the 6th that a conspiracy had been organized, the chief object of which was to seize the guns
 It appears, however, to have been defeated and to have been anything but general, as the greater part of the troops of each caste are said to have been much disgusted at the ringleaders of the conspiracy
 Guards were placed over the guns and kept on, according to the latest advices, to prevent accident, and no fears seem to have been entertained of their being rescued before the announcement of the fall of Mooltan, which is naturally looked for with much anxiety
 Major Lawrence appears to have at one time entertained the idea of sending Mrs
 Lawrence to Kohat, but everything was so quiet on the 6th that he had given it up
 The regular dak communication had been interrupted, but it is clear by the receipt of our letter that the Assistant at Peshawur had speedily opened another means of conveying intelligence
