 O'Brien prosecuted, and Mr
 It appeared that the prosecutor keeps the Fortune of War publichouse, Giltspur-street, and Maclaren was servant in the house
 On the night of the 22d of September there was a party at the house which broke up about 3 o'clock in the morning, when there was a great disturbance, and as they were leaving the prisoners were seen behind the bar on their knees near where the cashbox was kept, and a chinking of money was heard
 As soon as the party had left the cashbox was missed, and the circumstance being made known the fact of the prisoners having been seen where they had been was mentioned
 PARRY contended that there was no evidence to show the prisoners had taken the box
 The jury found the prisoners Guilty, and Maclaren was sentenced to seven years' transportation, and Boobner to one year's imprisonment
 Edwin James Lucas surrendered to take his trial upon an indictment charging him with having stolen a quantity of stereotype plates, the property of James Silverlock
 Parry prosecuted, and Mr
 The prisoner had been in the employ of the prosecutor, who is a printer in Doctors Commons, and the latter having a suspicion that he was being robbed set a watch upon his men, and the result was that the prisoner's premises were searched, and some plates, partly melted down, and some metal belonging to prosecutor, found there
 In cross-examination it was elicited that the prisoner might have taken the metal home to try experiments in type and stereotype casting
 The jury Acquitted the prisoner
 James Spackman, aged 33, and Mark Barker, 42, two labourers, were indicted for stealing 20 bushels of wheat, the property of William James Reynolds, the master of Spackman
