LOYDON, WEDArBSDAY, NOVETEMBER 1, 1848
It will be news to anybody in this kingdom to be told that he pays no taxes
 If there is one thing necessary to the idea of an Englishman- it there is one point of feUow feeling between all classes of the community, it is that, in some form or other, or rather in a thousand forms, and a thousand others besides, they all contribute to HER M&jsry's Exchequer
 SIDNEY SMITH ran through the career of an Englishman from the cradle to the grave, and found that the tax-gatherer had been -everywhere before him
 If the bright oasis could be found in these isles safe from the intrusion of the universal scourge, all men would rush into it
 The *nly thing that makes us bear the evil is its universal and inevitable character
 There is a certain propor- Lion appointedto us all
 Theknave,who in the goodold days of justice and decorum was whipped through the town at the cart's tail, tried in vain to procure a more comfortable distribution of his fifty lashes
 Whether the operator aimed high or low, or on this side or on that, it was impossible to please the fastidious gentleman
 We are inclined to think, too, that the broader the back the greater breadth of chastisement does it receive
 Notwithstanding what the poet says, we suspect that in the matter of taxes the giant suffers more than the beetle
 At least we never knew a wealthy man who did not talk ruefully of taxes
It is, then, with extreme astonishment that we findin a tract, or rather a handbil, by the Financial Reform Association, the following passage:-"On a careful examination of the sources whence tho public in-ome is derived, the Association aro astonished to find how completely the taxation is laid on the trade and industry of the ceuntry
 Contrasted with tho amounts of the expendi- ture, it divides the commnunity into two diltinct classes, one, those who pay-the other, thosc ?wlho srpot, the tacmes
 The jorter comprises the grcat mass of the popnt&ation, all who Ubour a?d pronete the wealth of the nation7; the other, the fatwored few, wcho from accident of birth or contexions, arccempt from the necessity of toil; and wvho seem, on that acqount (for no other reason can be discovered in the exami- nation of these documents but tho fact that such is the exEmption) to be rliOeved from the duty of contributing their fair and proportionate amount to the pecuniary require
"Uwe could, see the subject through the optics of qS writer some of us might live and die under the Veii%ig illusion that we pay no taxes
 Unfortu- Ipwy, -however, experience would supply a painful c0di~t~otion, But the writer, it seems, does not tnie , wlit he says
 Having put his best leg fore- float jii the shape of a bouncinog assertion, he pro- ceeds to explain that trade and industry pay all te iadirect taxes, and property all the direct; vhich latter, he says, are only a trifle
That there may be no mistake on this point, he eaumerates aU the items of taxation which he con- silers indirect, and assigns them to industry and ?traie, leaving a small remainder to be borne *t- ptoperty * The result of this classification is -bt the man' of property pays no customs, no pro J31te and legacy dutios, nQ dgty on insurance, no d0t on bRk ntoles, UQ newspaper or, advertse-mentduty, no duty on coaches posting, hired carriages, or railroads,no postage, and not a farthing of the casual and supplemental expenditure which taxation brings on the country
 He not only does not con- tribute to these taxes personally and formally, but not even virtually or effectually
 He does not pay one single penny postage, or one farthing on Iis claret, his coffee, or his tea This blessed invulnerability to the shafts of taxation he owes to the simple faot of his possessing I property
,He is one of " the favoured few who from accident of "birth or connezions are exempt from the necessityof toil' Customs and Excise reach not this con- seorated caste Like the deities of EPICURUS, they dwell in an atmosphere of their own, independent and careless
 To them the earth is free, and its fruits are cheap The East and West Indies vie for the honour of supplying their wants at cost price
 China pours her grateful products into their lap; Ocean casts his wealth at their feet For them the ground yields her pro- duce without a second curse
 But for a few tri- fling honoraria which the State ventures to ask in an easy and dignified form, it might be supposed they were some higher order of beings who vouchsafed to walk the earth and talk with men, and from whom we felt a pride in concealing the chief burdens of our condition
 Such men must be worth knowing
 We should like to see one Will the financial re- formers of Liverpool introduce us to an individuat of the species?Hitherto our own lot-has been cast in so different a sphere that we have never yet seen or heard of such a being, nor even read of him, till this moment
 We know a gentleman of 1o,0001
 a-year from land and collieries, not only free from incumbrances but pleasingly associated with the savings of a long minority
 Unfortunately he perspires at every pore with indirect taxation
 He drinks wine, spirits, ale, porter, tea, coffee, and sugar
 So do his servants So do the labourers on his farms, and so do the colliers in his pits
 He has just built a house and several farmhouses His bricks are taxed, and so is his timber He complains of his tradesmen's biUs They answer that they are so heavily taxed that they cannot afford to charge him less
 He has fur- nished his house His paper, his carpet, his nm3hogany and rosewood tables and chairs, his new service of plate, have all contributed to the revenue
 Knowing the expense of building, he is careful to insure his house, and pays a cent
 duty on the insurance His joint-stock bank charges a - percent on every farthing of his that passes through their hands He thinks it too high, and they plead the heavy duty on their notes, besides other ex- penses His lawyer's bill contains heavy items for stamps He takes in a London paper and half-a dozen country ones On every one he sees the red imprint of the exciseman He advertises his farms, his pits, and his coals, and pays eighteen- pence to the Crown for every advertisement
 lHe goes about a good deal on the rail, and oftenu:ua -v; b1,1uL-uu:r& Linow muon iower iares are on the Continent
 The station-olerks answer with'an allasion to taxes He comes up to London and falls out with the cabmen
 They give the same answer He makes every tradesman give him a receipt
 They take it out in one shape or another
 He writes and receives many letters, some of them with heavy enclosures; his wife has a hundred cor- respondents, and thinks the penny post a conve- nient thing for small parcels ; in fact a pound's worth of stamps goes in no time
 Besides al this he pays on French clocks, bronzes, and furniture, on foreign velvets and silks, on writing paper, and in- numerable etceteras
 But wherever he goes he finds the social atmosphere thick with taxation
 His men strike, his tenants fall into arrears, his oustomers get into the Gazette, his tradesmen are extortionate, his wife expensive-all on the plea of taxation
 There is nothing to be done without paying in this -country
" That is if you wish to make your way in a taxed country you must pay everybody's taxes in addition to vlinr nwrn
Now, of course we do not for a moment suppose that our friend belongs to the class described by the Liverpool reformers as possessing property and pay- ing only a few direct taxes
 It is true that he is a landlord, and exercises no industry nor trade, except when his farms or his pits happen to be thrown on his hands; and it is also true that he pays direct taxes
 He pays, for example, 3001 He pays 1,0001 a-year to the poor rates, chiefly for the relief of manufacturers out of wofic and Irishmen on the tramp
 He pays highway rate, church rate, police rate-the first and last to some extent
 His architect being a man of taste has saddled him and his heirs with a hundred windows of all sizes; so his window tax is no trifle
 His carriages, horses, and servants pay accumulated duties His dogs pay their quota
 He also pays a modicum of " land tax," not quite so burdensome as if his property lay further south He spends part of the season in London, and pays handsomely for the use of a furnished house, but is told that the proprietor of the house is still out of pocket through the quantity of rates and taxes he has to pay on al sides
 The poor's rate alone is annually 2s
 in the pound We had almost forgotten some trifles
 Our friend took a University degree and paid several heavy stamps
 He pays something, also, for the privilege of sealing his letters with the figure of apole- cat So there can be no doubt that he pays direct taxes to a fearful extent
 But, as we have shown above,he also pays indirect taxes to an equally fearful extent Thus at any rate it is quite impossible he can be of the class of persons alluded to by the Liverpool reformers
 What renders it still more impossible is, that he does not owe his position at all to birth or connexions, having no more acquaintance with a Lord than he has with the Great Turk, and is a man of honest mercantile parentage
 But what seems the oddest thing of all, is that so far from sticking up for the immunities of property he is a financial reformer, he has joined the League, and at this moment is fully persuaded that he would be a much richer man if indirect taxation were abolished altogether and a well regulated property tax imposed in its stead
The finanoial reformers of Liverpool will perceive our quandary
 We cannot for the life of us imagine the class they describe-at least we can imagine it, just as we can a sea serpent; but we have never yet had the pleasure of seeing it
 In a toler- ably wide experience of Fngland we do not know a single person who comes near to the description which they assume to be one of the commonest and most prominent types in our social system
 There is the Marquis of WEsT- MsnsR He is a public man He has a large estate near Chester, and another in the metropolis He, and his father before him, have paid 100,0001
 duty on brioks, if they have paid a penny; and other indirect taxes in propottion
 It is clear, therefore, that hc cannot be the financial hippogriflin, or rather the unicorn, described by the liverpool financiers as possessing property and paying a few directtaxes, but exercisingb no industry or trade, and entirely exempt fr9m indfeot taktina
 We Putreat them tv 6atisfr ar  When they come further south, we hope and trust they will bring a specimen with them
 We have a taste for curiosities
