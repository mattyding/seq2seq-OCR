E THOMAS RIDDELLfn2-P
 Ar-r- TAVV IThe mnaolvent, a coaLmerchaut and Michi hat-lining-ma- nufacturer, was opposed by a creditor named Manning, the holder of a bill of exchange for 201
, accepted by the insol- vent Manning stated that he took the bill from a person named Urquhart, hearing the insolvent fwas a respectable man,andbelievingfromthe billbeing payable at Weston and Young's bank that the acceptor had an accomnt there
 When the bill fell due it was presented at the bank, which had ceased business, but the insolvent had no account there
The insolvent, upon being examined, said that when the bill was presented Le had a balanice of 123 4d remainig to his credit at Weston and Cos, with whom he opened an ac- count in 1846, but had not paid in any money since the end of that year He accepted the bill for Urquhart on the pro- mise of the latter to do all printing that he might require
 Commissioner LAW thought the circumstance of making the bill payable at a banker's where the insolvent had had no dealings since 1846 was very much like a fraudu- lent deception
