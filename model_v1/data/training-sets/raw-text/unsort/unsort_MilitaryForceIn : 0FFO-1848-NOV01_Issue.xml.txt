 The original is tolerably wleU known to readers of such productions even in this country and though not partaking o4 tho featares by which English novels are cha- raetorized, it contains a good deal that will please
 English readers, wlthout, however, ever becoming very popular The great fault of the book i':that it wants compression-t itis toolong, and, though not absolutely tedious, it creates in- difference, and, consequently, the reader either gives up the task of perusa3 altogether, or skips a vast rnany pages, in 'which it may b that the best passages are con- tained
 The book beoig a series of -letter tinuous narrative,is not in accordance with the taste af noTel readers
