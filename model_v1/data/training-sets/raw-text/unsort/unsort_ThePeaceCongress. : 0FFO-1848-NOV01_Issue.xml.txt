" Let those laugh who would, he was quite certain this principle wouildrevail, and, while the laughers and scoffers would hereafter ba in derision, the friends of peace would be triumphant
) They were aware that, a ewy months 8go, it was thought desirable that a congress of the friends of peace should be held at Brussels
 It was with great regret he stated that, although President of the Peace Society, he had been unible to attend that Congress; but he rejoiced to learn, even from the reports of the enemies of the cause, that that Congress had been a most decided movement in favour of the princiDles of peace
 They were now assembled to receive the President and Vice Presidents of the Brussels Congress, and to hear from them a report of its proceedings
 Before those gentlemen ad- dressed them, however, Mlr
 Scoble would give the meeting some information as to the arrangements and proceedings of the Congress
iur in complying with the request of the chairman, he would not dwell on the various pre
 liminary arrangements which were made previously to the Brussels Congress The original intention had been to hold the Congress at Paris, but circumstances to which it was unnecessary for him further to allude prevented that inten- tion from being carried out
 An application was then made to the Belgian Government to allow the Ccngreso to be held in Bruassels The reply of the Belgian Minister was, " It is vwritten in the constitution of Belgium that public meetings are open not only to its citizens but to foreigners;" and the Belgian Government afforded every facility in their power to promoto the comfort and conve- nionce of the members of the Congress
 There were present at the Congress 130 gentlemen from England, who were ac- companied by about 40 English ladies; and 170 gentlemen from Belgium, France, Germany, and Italy
 The Congress sat for two days, and held four sittings, at which resolutions were-with one or two exceptions-nnani- mouslg adopted, expressing their opinion that an appeal to arms for the purpose of deciding disputes among nations was a custom condemned alike by religion, justice, reason, and the best interests of the people; that the Governments of Europe and America should bo urged to introduce provisions into their treaties for settling national disputes byarbitration; and thatit was most important that a general national congress should be held for tho purpose of framing a well-digested and authoritative national code, as the unanimous adoption of such a code would be an effectual means of premoting universal peace
 The Congress also urged the necessity of a general and simul'aneous disarmament, as a means of greatly diminishing the financial burdens which pressed upon this and other countries, and of promoting an inter- change of mutual good offices
 Two important addresses were agreed upon by the ConRress-one to the Governments of the civilized Powers of Europe and America, and another to tho People of those continents
 The address to the British Government vws presented yesterday to Lord John RusseU, b a deputation comprising M
 Ewart, MP
 E Richards, who represented M The noble lord received the deputation most courteously, and expressed himself in terms of the deepest interest in reference to movements of this kind, stating that he considered the great gathering at Brussels to be a means of promoting moderation and mutual kindness arong the people of Europe
) The noble lord also expressed himselrl in general terms, anxious to pre- mqte the peace of the world) Sub- sequently to the Congress at Brussels letters hal been re- ceived from men distinguished for their ability and for their posiion in society in Italy, Germany, France, Denmark, Schles-ig-Holstein
 and other parts of Europe, expreasiang their anxiety to co-operate with t,he friends of peace in this country to promnote the settlement of national disputesMIr ROWLY moved the first resolution:-"ï¿½!hat thismeeting cordialluyapproves of the convocation of the re cent Pcace Congress at Blrels, end ot the princ'ples and practical mcessures embodied In its resolutions, and would testify its gratitude to God for the unanimity aol woiozn wvhich characterized its entire pro- eedings; and It balls with delight the presence otf x

"He did not support the objects of the Peace Society on any grounds of political expediency; he was a man of peace because he was a Christian
) There was, in the neighbourhood in which he lived an Evangelical clergyman, who, iR speaking the other day on the question of peace and war, adrmitted that the prindiples of Christianity were destined ultimately to establish universal peace in the world
 But how did this gentleman practically carry out his principles ? One of his sons vwas educated for the army and another for the navy} If it was said 'that the objects of the Peace Sodety were im- practicable, he would remind the meeting that the diminu- tion of capital punishments, the abolition of slavery, and the proress of the temperance cause, had aU been declared impossile without great consequent evils; but wvith regard to all those subjects great Wrtmphs had bean achieved
 and he had yet to learn that -iny inconvenience had resulted) He believed thb,t if there were more teetotaUers there would be fewer Mlilitary service had been called an honourMble -profession

) There was a great delusion in the public miind as to the value of the possessions and territories which had been conquered or acquired by thia country
 He would like to know what was the value of the Cape of Good Hope to this country? (" Hear," and cheers) Why, it cost us 1,000,000  not long ago to put down the Caifres by war) They were told it was for the interest of the in- habitants of the territories this country had aequired that they should retain those possessions Now, suppose Louis Philippe had conquered this country a few years ago, who know but that the people might have been better off than they were now ? (Cheers and laughter
) It did not follow that people were always the worse og for be'g conquered
 Bven savage nations would not murder in cold blood those who would not fight; and he thought they might be prettv well convinced that their neighbours on tho other side of the Channel would not take their lives in cold blood
) It might be said, however, "Well, but they will set up a government over us and tax us
 Rowly) would just ask the meeting whether there was any other country in the world that was ever taxed so hilbly as England ? (Loud cheers
) Supposing a Governiment was set up which the people did not like, there was a very easy way ofgerang ra or 1i) Their neighbours on the other side the Channel had got rid of their own Government, though they had made a sad mistake in resorting to physical force to gain their liberty; and he believed that the people of this country might easily get rid of any Government that did not auit them by exerting moral instead of physical force
) The great point to which they should look in order to advance their objects was to influencing public opinion
 It was useless to find fault with the Go- vernmment ; the Government could not keep up an immense standing army if the people did not find the money) To necomplish the objects of the Peace Society they must have recourse to that Christian inslruction which subdued the passions, and brought into subjection the pride and animosity of the human heart He placed his cou- fidence upon Christianprinciple alone, and if the Clhljt^church in this country would consistently do itS dutv
