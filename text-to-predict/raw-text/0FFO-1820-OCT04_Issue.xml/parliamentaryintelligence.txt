admitted he contended not only that the evidence did not prove them but that it disproved them one admission he did malkc and let thelearned counsel who supported the bill talie it andl make the most thev could of it for it was the only admission that would be made to ihem he granted that ler majesty had left this country for italy  he grantewl that while abroad he had mnoved in snciety chiefly foreign in terior probably to that wthich under happier circumnstances she had ktnownand very diihrent certainly from that whicil she had pre viously ecijoyed in this country iie admitted that when the qaeen was here and happy not indleed in the protection of her own fi muilg but in the frierlsip of their lordships and their families that she moved in more choice and dignified societv than any in which she hassince sad the goot forttine to be placed ilie charge against her wasthat she went to italy aid that instead of associ ating with the peets and peeresses of england she took to her ssciety only foreigners he fullv adnitted that her majesty had been under the necessity of associatimg with italian nobility and sometimes with the comrrsonalty of that country but ho are they that bring this cluarfe  othiers might blame her majesty fox going abroadothers might saylthat she lhad experienced the conse quences of leaving this country and associating with foreigners but it was not for their lordships to make this ciarge they were the very last persons who should fling this at the queen for they who nowv presumed to sit as her judges were the very witnesses she must call to acquit lher of this charge they were in fact rot only the wibessss to acquitbut haid been the cause of this single adrtmtted tact wthile hermlajesty resided in this country she courteously threw opcn her doors to the peers of england and their families she graciously condescended to court their society and as long as it suitel certain purposes which were not hersas long as it served interests in which she hadl no concernas long as she could be made subservient to the ambitious views of others stc lid not court its vain but when a change took placewhen those interests were to be retained wlihl she had been made the in strument of graspingwhen that lust of power and place to which she was doomed to fall a victim lhad been sattisfiedthen in vain did shc open her doors to their lorlships and
