you have taken up the mattcr with much heat in the main you are right i feel that yoa are so but you have carried it too far it is true that brown has expressly and repeatedly insisted with mir albertonio that he slhould make known to you the dissatisfaction in that quarter towards you and the danger of the alien bill which you were going to encounter but nevertheless follow the judg ment of yoer father who knows by experience what is most expe dient and for the best in similar cases abandon the object and allow the couitsoversy thus to terminate since by persons of mean condition or inferiorrank as you and i are it is sufficiently well ter minated by what has been already done this instant a courier has arrived with letters ef the th and by the paragraph relative ta milan yotu imay see how completely what brown said here has been verified you treated and spoke with the person alluded to believ ing him quite a different character i will speak with peter at his return as i have today spoken with sperati but whatever happens what you said is right that you peter and sperati are well known for persons of sense and claracter and very different from that good fornothing individual qtel poco di bzono but the concluson is to keep every thing silent and to prevent all publicityi salute youi your affectionate fatherno lettert fror mxr arietti the elder to col brownmilan sept most worthy coloneli understood with great concern that your namehas been compromised in a subject of conversation which was supposed to have taken place between you and me rela tive to my son joseph at present in london i think it there fore a duty to declare as i now declare upon my honour that no conversation ever passed between you and me directly on this subject if thie expressions contained in a letter written by me to my son are somewhat strong that must be ascribed to the affection wvhich a lively interest in him created and a conformity to the advice i have always given himadvice tending to manifest the necessity of adhering to the system adopted by me never to mix in affairs fo reign to ones own basiness it grieves me exceedingly that an in terpretation has been given to my letter opposite to my irtentionsan interpretation which sutpplies materials to discussions irrelevant and ill founded uy displeasure in this case increases at seeing that a similar interpretation has caused doubts regarding the good faith of an individual whose distinguislhed and honourable character is known to me by long experiencei consider you moreover incapable of making use of the threats which are attributed to you as the british government is of exe cuting them in taking this mode of stating tp you the sentiments witli which i amanimated in the present emergency i experience thesweet satisfaction of fulfilling a duty which is incumbent upon me and i take the opportunity of assuring you of my perfect esteem no letter trox l albertonio to colonel erownatilan sep dl colonelit is with regret proportioned to the respect which i bear you that i learn that the sense of a letter written by al larietti to lhis son has been so ill understood as to have imputed to you the communication of ana intention on the part of the british government to watch over the latter and to send him out of england on account of his relations with sac chini a witness in the case of the queen i remember that you said to me one morning that i was present withi you on busi ness that you had received a letter from england stating the inter ference of joseph marietti itl this affair and that you could not but regard such conduct as a little unwise and foreign to his occupation in london i cannot at the same titne forget that i regarded this communication as a simple opinion emanating from yourselfand very far from the expression of authority or of menace as regards wvhat is said on the alien bill of the peovisions of which i am ignorant itis adatyi owe to your character always frank aind loyal in all re spects to say that you never gave ine the least reason to fear for the personal security or the protection of the said joseph mariettii can ade that i thought it my duty to beg dl diarietti the father to write to his son to advise himi not to mix in an affair so foreign from his occupations hut to restrict himself to the wise and moderate conduct which has always distinguished him and if in wvriting to him his father has made use of strong expressions they ought in no wise to be ascribed to you colorel brown but solely to the confidence and paternal afrection which dictated themno letter frobm mr arietti the elder to sis son inlondon not read yesterday by lord liverpool in parliamentilan sept qdearest soniani ever the more confirmed in my maxim that it is riglt to have as little as possible to do with the great i must say that the government in question has too strictly inter preted the letter i wrote you and which has presented to the minister of police other motives than those which really origi nated it since it is right to tell you that the english government has written an angry letter to colonel brown he colonel brown feeling hmself much disquieted on this account made such an ap plication to sig d ciceri and to sig albertonio that the farmer begged me to convey to the said colonel brown a letter of mine which in a certain way in ccrto qual inodomight justify him with his government from the tog rigorous interpretation given to mny former letter and after having written and revritten through the mc diup of the said signor ciceri draughts of such a letter to be shown tihe opy which i enclose to your address wasfixed upon you will like wise jind the copy of a letter which the said col brown desired from the saigsignoralbertoniowho gave me the accoant contaned in the letters formerly addressed to you to the honour of truth i have re garded whbatcolbrown said through the medium ofsigaoralbertonio as an act of friendshiptopreventhim from being brought into any dan gernor could i ever have imagined that suclia thing could havebeen of as much importance as it has proved however that be to facilitate the allaying of such a controversy and to preserve amity with all i have thought proper to second it as you will perceive by the copy they wislhed me to declare that my firstletter was the result of my own simple suspicion and bad no giound to rest upon lout this i would not allow because the havingnamed colonel brown in the way i did would have been charged on me as a calumnious imputa tion and therefore yoe will see in my letter sent yesterday to him col brown that i mention my not having direct conversation with him and derive my information from what he caused to besaid to me by sig albertonio regulate yourself therefore in every thing with the greatest prudence in order not to incur other annoyances and other dissatisfactions which can only produce evil to you  your affectionate
