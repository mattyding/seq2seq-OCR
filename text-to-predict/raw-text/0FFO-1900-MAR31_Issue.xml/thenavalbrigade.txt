to belmont being a long column it was necessarily a very siow march and the mules were troublesome on arriving within one mile of belmont i received orders through a staff offlcer to go back along the road and to be in belmont by  oclock neat morning to report mysclf to the general or arriving at head quarters at  a m i received orders to communicate with colonel hall commanding royal artillery having met him i marched out of belmont by road in company wvith colonel halls battery of field artillery after clearing belmont kopjes we turned off the road otx the opea veldt day was just danvnug rad we could see the top of the line of kopjes held by the enemy wve were then advancing towards the centre of his position over very rough ground intersected with dykes this tried our gunmountings very severelyunfortunately one gun capsized but was seoon righted and i was relieved to find that there was no dasage done and that the dockyard wvork stood the test so welucu proceeding to higher ground a view of the boers position was then obtaineda long line of kopjes which looked very much higher at dawn of day than they really were the light being very bad indeed end the sun coming up behind the kopies cast dark shadows which made it very bard to distinguish any oojects in addition to this there was a mist round the lower part of the kopjes firing wvas now going on in our front the boers evidently having been repulsed colonel iall here turned away to his left wad to the left of the boer position on the understanding that i should take up a position across the railway line on higher ground and ho wrould soon commnunicate with me hbis i did but had great difficulty in taking my heavy aimmunition wagons and guns across the railvay liee finally succeed mg i here brought the battery into action to try the rance of the extreme depth of the boer position bot after riring a rangefinding shot and not seeing it pitch i limbered up bearing beavy firing on the right of the position and not having had any communication froa colonel lhall i determined if possible to get the battery in range of the large kopje wbich a battery of the roval artillery wvere shelling the guns not being obile anrkd having to cover heavy ground i was unfortunaately too late to take part in shelling the top of the kopje which the guards carried i then turned to the left between two kopfes and found tho boers on the rear kopje liring upon advancing infantry i immediately got the battery mto action an t t yards shelled the boers who were firig on our troops the practice being excellent the boem were very soon silenced and retreated i received orders from the gtneral to take my guns if possible on to a low rkopje about  yards froma my frooit so as to shell the retreating boers from their position i limbered up and advanced as quickly as possible over very rough ground and advacing well ahead myself to survey the kopje i found when i arrived on top that it was impossible to take wheels over it so reluctantly had to givo it up here my officers men and mules were almost dead beat and the battle over having watered my mules i returned to camp with the remainder of the troops at  pn oext day the whole brigade marched out of belmont to the railway station where our guns were entrained the gun mules wero handed over to colonel hall to save his horses the gums and ammuni tion were

left of the boer position which rested on the railwary line the infanltry marching awfay to the right  had no further opportunity of observing the action of the guns after that the brigade was deployed into line single rank four paces interval and adtvanced on the enemys position the disposition of oficers was as followrs biajor flumube rlt i l in comamand of the leet commander sthelston in

rcurderous lire the behaviour of our oficers and men was beyond au praise they all showed great coiurage and cool determination although losing heavily both in ofmicers and inen i had the satisfaition of seeing after being wounded and being carried to the real our bluejacketa and mariees in pos scession of the enemys position to give some idea of the heavy fire several times i saw a man hit three

time en requests i received fromn the officer commanding royal artillery wyho was attacking the same positionriz two strongly fortified kopjes on either side of the railwy vdtk a well protected gun in each about  am i received verbal orders to retire from my position as the royal artillery were about to move away to the right and it would then be unteiaable for my two guns the royal artillery were already movizg off when i got the order and the boer guns having got our range accurately were pouring on us such en efcotive shrapnel fire that i judged it ilipossible to carry oat the order without either leaving the guns or suffering very heavy losses both amongst our own men and the company of royal engineers who were helping us if we attemupted to retreat with themi therefore continued to fire as briskly as possible at the boer guns vith such effect that we continuously put them out of action first one and then the other for as much as  or  minutes at a time their shells burst with utmost accuracy and both our guns and ammunition trolly were spattered all over with shrapnel balls but owing to my system of raking all hands lie down when we saw tair enas gash and remain tillthe shell burst and the bails flew by we had only six men wounded when at  so ama the boers hnally ceased dang and abandoned their position  beg that you will submit to the commandcrin chief that lieut

am and commenced sheluing the esvys tifn pits and gun posi tions but did not draw a single shotmeantime the brigades of generals htart and lyttel ton on the left and those under geenerals hildyard and barton on the right with the cavalry further out were working round to cross the river above and below colenso respectivelyafter we had beeu shelling for about half an hour and the troops had got within range the enemy opened a tremendous fire from every imaginable direction frora miles of rifle pits along the river and on three ridges behind entrenelments and kept up a continuous fire fromn guns planted everywhere right in the middle of a plain and on every ledge and hillock commanding every approachve kept our guns going on any un positions that offered and oa the trenches general quller being with us and directing the fire for an hour or so i think we silenced a few guns and am told the lyddite did tre mendous execution in the trenches that we could get attheir heaviest gurn and one that did tremendous damuage to our troops in both directions was placed very cunningly behind the three hills upon which their principal positions were commanding a broad valley on eact side of them running dowvn tow ards the river with out being visible froma our gunsat an early stage general harts brigade which had suffered tremendously from a front and flank fire retired and colonel lytteltoas brigade were ordered to cover their retreatthe artillery under colonel long which had approached to within  yards of the trenches before a shot was fired were raked at that range as they came into action and after a short time were driveni from their guns taking retuge in a  donga i hey lost s guns and most of their officers and many menaway on our left the field artillery with hat brigade were so roughly handled that they also were driven back leaving gnms which were afterwatds recoveredgeneral mildvads brigade pushed or doggedly and got into colenso and i was ordered to keep up as hot a fire as possible on the rile pits to enable him to carry out the withdrawal which was subsequently ordered the withdrawal appeared to be as hot a business as the attack and took a good long timeabout noon i was ordered to vithdraw the two  in guns and aa soon as the retreating brigade were abreast of uscvery one else having gone backthe remaiader of the guns wvere ordered to be withdrawn and we arrived at the kopje we occupied the day before about o pmthe enemy did not devote much attention to us being i suppose too busy with the troops only two guns that i could discover were firing at us and nonre of their shell did us any damage we silenced bothit was extremely diflicult to discover where the guns were fired from thle guns were beautifully concealed and were mostly firing smokeless powder we fired at ranges froml  to  yards the firing vas good and the lyddite shell burst wellit was blazing hot and all hands wvorked wvell have the honour to be sir your obedient servante p jois captain commaunding naval brigade rearadmiral sir robert h harri kcmgcoinmander lachief chieeley catmp december  siri have the honour to submit the following account of the part taken by the pr uns forming the battery under my command during the aetion i front of colenso acting on orders received from captain jones rn i reported myself to colonel long cra who directed me to attach myself toan uti the guns lad been placed in a suitanble position i therefore directed lieut james of tartar to lead the battery behiud the royal artillery field guns and told him that we were to form up on the left of the royal artiery guns when they came into aetion about  sa the gans bein in column of route march with naval gems in the rear i was riding in front beside colonel long about ards from colenso station wken he directed colonel unt to bring his guns into action just in front of a deep  donga  running across our front at right aes to the railway lhe then told me to come into acion on the left and proceeded to arrange our different zones of fire while the royal artillery guns were getting into position ia front of as was a line of trees up to which our sklrmishers had advanced also a few artillery outposts just as i was about to direct xay gnms where to go and as the royal artillery were tunlimbering the outposts tt rned sharply and a murderous fire both rifle and shell was opened on the guns and amamunition column i immediately galloped back to my guns and found that the fire had caught them just as the two centre guns were going through a drift across another donga parallel to the beforementioned one but about  yards hn the rear mhen i arrived i found that all the native drivers with the exception of those for lieut james gn teams bsd boltte these guns had just crossed the drift so i directed him to take up a position on the left and opened fire i on fort wyllie from which the majority of the shell fire appeared to corae about this time my horse was shot through the shoulder by a rifle bullet the two rear guns under lient deas of ims philomel not hawing crossed the drift i directed him to take ground to the left and open re also on fort lvyllie the two centre guns undet mr lyright gunner of hms terrible were unfortunately jammued with their ammunition wagons in the drift the wheels of the wagons being loaked and the oxen turned round in their yokes i managed by the aid of scme artillery horses td extitatb these guns from tbe drill and to bring tbem into action on each side of the drift to the rear of the donga oe of the horses being shot whilst doing this i could not manage to move the amxnuni tion wagons as the rifle and shell fire was too severe at the tine a  pr maximnordenfelt being particu larly attentive and sending tbree shells into the drift at every disebarge itepeated messages for more men came back from the royal artilery batteries and these were sent to the front by a royal artillery sergeant in charge of the ammunition column after about half anbours firnng as i should judge tbe royal artillery guns were silenced nearly all the men being auparently nlled or wounded soon after this the fire from fort wyllie slackened considerably the comranderin chief now rode up and directed me to move our guns and ammunition as soon as i could the guns were got away each by a team of artillery horses who galloped them up the hill to the rear the wagons were fur more dicalt owing to their weight the large circle they required to turn in and to the fact that they had to be got out from the drift and turned round by the guns crews before the horses could be put on about this time  most brillisnt feat was performed by two teams of artillery who galloped to the front aganst a most mnurderous fire lin ered upand rescued two guns a sirailar attempt by one other team at leastresulted in the entire tean as far s i eoul se being destrojed the advance of the infantry on an open plain with little or no cover against a most heavy rifle fire from intrenched positions was also a magnificent sight the conduct of our mnen without exception was particularly fine the day being a very hot one and tbe work harlthe way nes  and  guns crews of the terrible got their wagons out of the drift under hevy fire from shell and rife was quite up to the standard ex pected of all seamen i canot conclude without mentioning the way lieut
