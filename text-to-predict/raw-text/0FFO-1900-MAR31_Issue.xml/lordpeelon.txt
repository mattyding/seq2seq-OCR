lord peel on the licbngcommssioyviscount peel the late chairman of the royal com mission on lieensing iaws presided last night at a neeting held in the drillhail peterborough which aimed at securing legislation on the lines of the minority report there was a good attendance of ladies and gentlemen and among the speakers were mr t p vhittaker lp tho rev b philipson mr f eardey lvilmot mr h leewarner mr b winfrey and canon clayton a letter was read from e bishop of petcrboroush stating that he was particularly anxious to obtain legislation cn the lines of the miaority report lord pm who was received with choera said that he wished to put before the meeting some salient facts regarding the report of the licensing commissionl there were many points in which the majority and manority reports agreed but there were many points also on which they diflered and on many important points the differences were essential first of all there ws the evidence on which the reports were founded the witnesses were examined and there was not a state ment in the minority report which was not founded on the evidence to the best of human power cheers their friends who drew up the majority report said that the evidence was of so difficult a character that they would not give aly references to it at all on the other hand chapter and verse were given however for every assertion in the minority report of course it was impossible for any toe to rea i through this marss of evidence he recaued a story of a gentleman who read through johnsons dictionary and when asked how he liked it said it was very interesting but a httlo desultory laughter there was however one admission iu the report of the majority among whom there were members of  the trade which ought to be written over every temperance hall as a basis for further legislation the admission was this  it is undeniable that a giantic evil remains to be remedied and hardly any saerice would be too great whieh would result in a marked dirninutioun of this national degrada tion he was quite willing to accept that as the basis of future legislation heers as to the minoritv report a change had come over the publie mind and it was in a fair way to become adopted by a majority of the nation sir henry campbellbanner man had declared that this report which sounded so impracticable last year contained a series of effective and eguitable suggestions cheers was not tht sometbing gained  he wished that all sections of tem perauce reformers would agree upon some such basis of regislative action as this there were some present who advocated total tsunday closing cheers as chair man of the commission he came to the conclusion that it was wiser at first to try a reduction of hours on sun day why should not those who advocated sunday closing accept the report which said  not only will we limit the number of hours during which licensed houses shall be open on sunday but we will give dis cretion to the licensing authority in au parts of the country to curtail those hours still further or if they please to adopt sunday closing altogether  mthy then should not suedayclosers go with the minoritv report and say  do not let us rush ahead of public oimion but let us try what can be done in this direc tion and leave it to the responsible men in the locality to test the feeling of the loeality as to what shall be done p there were those who advocated the elimina tiou of the publichn by allowing the municipality to ake over a house and put in managers of their own who would have no interest in pushing the trade why should they not accept the miuority report p and why again should nlot the adtco of locl option mmd me pm hibitionists  the minority report included a plan which to his mind was the most farreaching of all the propositions they had madenamely that there should le on the licensing authority both in the couri of first instance and in the court of appeal represent tives of the people cheers further than that the court that first decided to abolish the licence would be allowed to sit on the court of appeal so that au the reasons which mfluenced them might ba fuuy stated after referring with satisfaction to the bill for includ ing lonmouthshire in xvales for sunday closing and the bill dealing with the cuestion of serving intoxicating liquors to persons under  both of which had passe their second reading he said that he was often asked  why do you insist upon havin alu your minorits report or nothing  lie did not do so he wantel as much as he could get naturally but all that was good lie would take if he were asked  wvould he take vhat he could get   he viould aunswer  yes   but they would never have any great and widereaching and deepcutting reform on this liensing question unless they altered the authority which administered the law before they could get real reform thoy must introduce the element of popular feeling sentiment and opinion into that authority as far back as the reign of edward vi an act had been passed giving the jubtices power to reduce what were called  ale and tippling houses and it might be said by prohibitionists  what was the good of restriction w en all the acts that had passed since then had failed   he could only pleadvill you give us one more trial  wvi you dopt a change of system such as i have endeavoured to point out   the licensing authority must be as pure as they could make it the court o apjeal must be as pure as they could make it unless they had a radical chane in the administration of the law all the reforms aavoceted would be comparatively valueless because they were not administered with the singlemindedness which ought especialy to prevail in such a matter loud cheerson the motion of mr t p whaxrrien lp the following resolution was adopted  that this smeeting notes with satisfaction that both reports of the royal commission on the licensing laws recognize the necessity for very cousiderable restrictions of the drink traffic and expresses the opinion that the recommendations of lord peels  minority  report provide a practical basis for immediate and effeciive leutelion
