the drlagoa railway awardon receipt of the award of the berne arbitration court a representative of iteuters agency called upon mlr capel slaughter who iustructed the british counsel in the arbitration in reply to questions mr slaughter saidin general i think the amount of the award is ridiculously inadequate if this was all the court intended to do such a decision could easily have been reached at the end of yo without all the elaborate machinery of experts and the many intricate calculations presented to the arbitrators i am entirely at a loss to understand the ratio upon which this imount had been arrived at nor do i see any prospect of being able to ascertain it it would in fact be a waste of time the amount of the first mortgage bonds of the english company is £ bearing  per cent interest  the second mortgage bonds bear  per cent interest also and have been issued to the extent of £ out of an authorized issue of  while the share capital is £ as i understand the award the arbitrators have now left it to the british and american claimants to settle upon what scale the amount shall be appro priated between these sets of bonds and i imagine that they expect us to arrive at sorne basis by the first mortge bondholders accepting some modifica tion of the rate of interest since the confiscation of the railway down to the time of payment assutming that the frst bondholders were disposed to take say  per cent interest that for  yearswould amount to £ which added to the principal of £ would absorb £ out of the £ the total amount of the award so that on that basis there would hardly be enough to pay the second mortgage bonds at par witiout any interestbecause in the foregoing amount nothing has been deducted for the expenses of the arbitration which must be consider ablein any case the award falls short of the british claims by about a million sterling snd does not give anything for the additional claim put forward by the americas while no one can for a moment doubt the bonaf ides of the court and their desire to deal impartially one cannot but regret the unfortunate result because the injury done was manifestly great and the compensation awarded wholly incommensurate even had it been awarded very much more speedily than has been the case it will umdoubtedly result in people becoming very shy of arbitration in the future and has dealt a great biow to the cause of arbitration in justice to the english counsel mr b  underdown qc mr malcolm mcllwraith until his alipointmcnt as legal adviser to the khedive and  boiceau the swiss counsel acting in the british interests it should be stated that the british case was most clearly put before the arbitrators and thc same must be said regarding tho claim presented by our american coclaimants the award will be as great a surprise and disappointment to the menricans as it is to us becauss it is incon ceivable that anything out of the award can come to the shares and it was that interest which the american party chiefly represented i cannot but feel great sympatny for mr trebane the american counsel who has spent  years in the most assiduous attention to the presentation and enforcement of the american claim and has displayed remarkable industry and ability in the lucid statements in which the american case has been incorporated he will feel heenly disappointed that his efforts have been so barren of resaltin conclusion mr slaughter said tho £ referred to in the award vas provided by portugal at the inception of tho arbitration and haaded to the british government to provide something towards the expenses of the arbitration so far as the debentures which are represented by the americans are concerned they are dealt wiith on exactly the same basis as the debentares held in great britain and mi boiceau bad just written me that the object of the arbitrators in recasting the form of their udgment and thus causing the delay since last mfonday was to provide against placing either of the claimants in a privileged position hlowever much we may all be disappointed at what has happened there is no aiipeal as the reference to abitration provided that the deciion of tho court wras to obe absolutely final
