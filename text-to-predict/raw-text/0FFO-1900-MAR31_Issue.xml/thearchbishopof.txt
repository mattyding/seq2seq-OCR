profession in accordance with the precedent set in ireland in the colonies and in most other civilized communities throughout the worldthe rev j hcuasnioy mcgcll seconded the resolu tion and dealt at considerable length with statistical mattemrs while the reverend gentleman was speaking admiral field mp who occupied one of th reserved seats on the floor of the hall gave vent fre qently to outbursts of impatience acompanying his restless movements with such observations as  hotnonsense wvaste of time and repeatedly avow ing his intention of o pposig the resoluetion on the conclusion of mr mcgill speech the airchbishrop put the motion to the meeting whereupon the galant admiral alertly jumped to his feetthe arnbishsorthose who are in favour signify the same by a show of handsanistrat fieldmy lord archbishop i want to enter a protest against this resolution if i am in order with much vehemence i am opposed to the time of the meeting being wasted by putting on the agenda paper a ridiculous resolution like this lagnhter parliament has dealt with the question and has done with it and why sheuld we be called upon to weep and to wail over what we cannot get  it is neither dignified nor common sense laughter mr talbot has delivered an excellent speech but he gave us part of it in the house of commons and we do not want it all over again renewed laughter it was suitable thercit is not suitable here interruption and cries of  order i enter my protest against the resolution those who approve of it will hold up their hands when the time comes i disapprove of it and have a right to hold up my hand against it i object to these jeremiads much laughter and i say the committee have erred in their duty in putting the resolution on the paper at all the govermment have a majority of  at their back but they did not deem it wise to do it and why should we be aslked to shed tears and loolk ridiculous because we cannot get what my right hon friend and other foolish people desire loud uhte arncisiop then put the resolution formally and on his calling for  those against  admiral field held up hishandthe arcnibinsopi see there is one againstaduliai fieldyes there is one sensible man here laughterihe resolution was accordingly declared carriedon the motion of mr hiolliday seconded by ir tomlinsox mp it was resolved  that this meeting strongly condemns the denial by many boards of guardians to members of the church of england under their care of the ministrations of the clergy to mhich they are by law entitled and urges upon churel prople throughout the country the importance of takmg greater interest in the election of district councillors and guardians in order to secure a due pro portion of members of the church of england as esndi dates with a view to ensure that chaplains are appointed to workhouses acoordina to law the ancasisltop of cantenaury then said we have completed the business on our agenda paper and i am glad to think that the resolutions we have carried even including the one which received a very urgent and vehement protest laughteraro likely if we are really in earnest about them to produce very real effect it is very important we should be perpetually bearing in mind that for such work as we are under taking there is need not merely for passing resolu tions but for a reiterated passing of such resolutions w e have to go on dinning the same truths into the ears of those whom we can reach and i think it well that every memnber of our great committee should con sider himself bound not to torget what he has agreed to at this meeting but wherever he has the opportunity to press upon those who are concerned in the matteryes and upon a great many who have no direct concernthe determinations to which our comriittee has come thec attack upon the church will of course be renewed and i think before very long but we must not wait until the attack comes bcause if we do we shall cer tainly find that a great deal that we have already done will have been forgotten and that a great deal will be put out of sight by au sorts of false arguments cnd false statementsfalse it may be without the know ledge of those who make them but still false enough to do an incredible amount of mischief all these different forms of attack will not be dropped altoether simnly because we have very completely refuted thaem already nwe have refuted them over and over and over eoain but it is the greatest possible mistake in any politfeai confict to suppose that because you have refuted an opinion which is already based upon the interest o the people who have been maintaining it and based upon prejudices which have long existed in their mindsit is a great mistake to suppose that because yon have refuted it it is therefore dead it is not dead in their minds at all and if you give time to have the arguments forgotten it is perfectly certain that the old fallacies and the old false statements will be revived to a degreo that you could hardly have believed beforeband to be possible it is very astonishing sometimes to talk to people and fad them reasserting what has been not only contradicted but completely refuted and reasserting it with the same assurance as they began laughter i venture to press this upon all the members of the committee for this reasonbecause it is quite certain that we have made a very real impression upon our opponents cheers i can see it in almost everything that they now write i can see jerpetually the tokens that they are not so sure in their own minds of what they were puttidg forth with such vppearance of doep convietion a rew years ago hear hear i know for all thaitatos u we allow the thing to go to sleep the old self confident assertion will come up again vahen perhaps we sball not be there to answer what is said hear hear i want to put you in mind of what the propbet said to the ing of israel the prophet told the king to take an arrow and strike upon the ground lie struck three times and stopped then the prophet remarked how he ought to havo gone on six or seven times because then ho would have crushed his enemies whercas after what he had done he would only defeat them on three srate occasions and the enemios would still be there ve must remember that it will not do to be content with one or two or three victories wve most go cn with our victories until we havo taken the courage and the spirit out of themuntil we have practically exterminatei their arguments laughtel and cheers lve shall certainly find that it will take a good deal of time aud very steady perseverance to set the truth clearly before the public if we are to succeed in thoroughly disheartening and discouraging all those who are now opposing us i know that it is something of a nuisance to be told this sort of tbing so many times over i have had to sav the thing before and no doubt if you come here again and i have to speak i shall repeat it i went to impress upon you not only by nrgumentbut by example not to let people suppose that we have given up the controversy because we have notbut we mean to go on until we win cheers wo have won one particular conflictwe have won it vcry successfully wve must go on until at last it is found that it is no use to make it an election crv at all that it will not do until in fact people wil hc a little ashamed to put it forward rear hear there are esses in which you can shame your adversaries out of reiterating old conten tions which have been over and over again refuted and this is one of them if you wiiu only persist steadily in the work you have taken up i know very well that this committee has had a very remarkable vsuccss in dealing with the whole country but success must not be a reason why we should relax our efforts if success in such a case as this leads to loss of warmth and deter mination and most resolute continunnce of the battle it is really better that we should not have a success at all the work entrusted to this committee on the part of tho church is a work of the very highest valuo and we cannot afford to allow ourselves to lose one inch of any ground that we have already occupied repetition may make people think me a bore and they may desire to hear no more of me but i mean never theless to go on saying this sort of thing i hope there will be some at any rate who will feel that to listen to an old archbishop who has not of course a very long time to trouble them with his observations is worth their while on such an occasion as this cheersa voto of thanks to his graco
