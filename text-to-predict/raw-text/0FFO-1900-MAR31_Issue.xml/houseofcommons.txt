with regard to drillisg the chinese army he hoped not for he believed that in so doing they would em ask on responsibilities of which they might never see the end lhe would also like to know whuether

waters of the yangtsze and of the west rlver in view o the correspondne with the united states in which it was stated that the united states would not commit itself to the recognition of exelusive rights in any power in any portion of the cbinese empire he would be glad to know whether the govern menlt were going to proceed further in the policy of spheres of interest and influence it did not seem to be a line of policy in which they were likely to have the cooperation of the united states or of jan after the action of the united states it was about time the government should reconsider the generals lines of their policy vwith regard to chinaand inform the house of their intentions hear hearon the return of the spraxxe after the usual intervalcaptain sinclair forfarshire said there was readiness to blame the government for a hesitating and vacillating policy in china but they would be more fair to them if they recognized the development of which the fruits were now being seen in china the great advance russia had made there ought to be dated not five years but  years back we had lost ground and russia had a position of far greater influence in china than she had  years ago during that time we bad been busy developing enterprise in canada africa egypt and other parts of the world other irons in the fire had prevented us from having a single eye and aim in the development of our policy in china if this debate did nothing snore than clear our minds as to the possibilities of the future with regard to china it would have done a great deal of good the bluebook showed that while there was tnuch of  china for the chinese  in the future there were many concessions for concessionaires in the present there were three conflicting policies in regard to our position in china the poliey of the open door the treaty of lientsin and the principle of spheres of interest or influence it was very desirable they should knoiw how far and in what respects the three policies overlapped and con ficted some of the privileges to be conferrel upon us we had had for all practical purposes in the pastwere the privileges with regard to the yangtsc valley really strong valid and potent for the purpcse which tho hon member for barnsley sought the undersecretary for foreign aflairs wouid gnd it diffi cult to answer the questions of his hon friend butwhen his hen friend suggested sweeping reforms iu i china by this country in concert with other plowers t at meant the international control of a fopulation of u millions of people which would ead to difficulties in the future as the juariiutcr national control of south africa and egypt might dtoour trade with china was  per cent of our w hole trade and he hoped it might he extended and developed he agreed that the chinese had proably no better friends than the british people but his sympathies wvere with a policy of caution and concentration in china and elsewbere because a policyof expansion multiplied tho points at which we were vulnerablemr brodrickalthougi the hon inember who moved this motion which is a severe condemnation of the policy of the government or of the conduct of the government during the past year although i must say that he introduced his motion with great command of his subject and with a comnanld of thc chinese nomencla ture which we might envy and although the house has listened to him with great pleasure i cannot help feeling that the condition oi the house during a cou siderable part of the liscussioa is perhaps the nest answer to the motion which he put down on the paper because those of us vwho recollect the character of the discussions on china two years ago and the full louse which was attracted when we discussed this question  mnonths ago must feel that there is something besides the absorbing interest wc feel in the military operations in south africa to account for the compara tive slackness of the discussion tonight i do not say that in order to diminish the importauce of the subject or to indieat e that it is the feeling ot the house that it is not the occasion for a vigorous eensure of the government or for giving the acute stimulus to their exertions which the hon member for barnsley believes is necessary the members who followed the hon nember for barnsley have to a large extent devoted themselves to answering hlim and in some cases to answering each other mv noble friend the miember for the chorley division who i venture to say is heard too infrequently iu this honse hear hear delivered an admirable and interesting discourse to night although he agreed wsith the conclusions of the ho gentlenian opposite he disagreed in toto with most of is premisses and his particular statement of policy vwith winch he concluded his speech bas also attracted the censure of the hon member iho has just sat down and therefore i may stand upon thisthat the govern ment although no member has spoken imrmediatelv in defence of it has not been without defenders bne other point which has struck me very much during this discussion is that we were discussing the bluebook which deals with the affairs of last yeara document which i regret could not be iput in the hands of hon memnbers earlier because the discussion caine on rather unexpectedly and in addition to that the desoatches come up to the end of last year and it is never possible to br ng out a chinese blnebook except after a con siderable interval althoagh we have been deal ing with the affairs of last year ractically hardly any of the criticisms which hve been pre sented against the government had to do vith their colduct during the past year we have had a strong impeachment of the original character of our negotiations with regard to port arthar and wth regard to the taklng of weihaiwai a great dcal has been said abotut the advantages gained by other nations in regard to concessions an the comparative in efficiency of the efforts of our government in the same direction wve have also heard  good deal about the state of affairs in manchuria but nearly all of these points refer to matters which were antecedent to the period which we arc now discussing and i think you will search the bluebook in vain bulky as it is for any clue to those diplomatic and commercial defeats which the hon member for barnsley declares had illustrated the whole of the efforts of her majestys government during the past year i will take one point alone the hon member points out how little we have gained during the past year but he does noti think suppose for a moment that we can deal withthese matters precisely as we please lis complaint is that we have too little influence with the yamnn that the yamcn keeps us at arms length that what we might achieve in a better governed country we ought to achieve in china if only we had not lost the whole of our prestige have foreign powers met with no diffi culties from the yamdn  is there not evidence even in that bluebook that every foreign power which has been dealing with the yamfn has found sometimes an obstructive spirit and in almost every case a difliculty in its dealings which it has not overcome  i do not wish to emphasize this too strongly i do not wish to put my finger on every case because possibly it might produce a certain amount of feeling in other quarters but in all the more important cases the hon gentleman will ufind either that there has been a direct refusal by the yaman as is shown in the case of that railway to peking on which ho said a few words or that there has been a refusal based on an objection taken by this government i saw it stated the other day that the organiza tion of the french concession at shanih had been entirely stopped and declined by the xamn because her miaestys ministers would not assent to it that is only one illustration and i am quite certain of this that for every illustration which he gave us of the impotence of sir claude macdonald in these negotia tions he would fid that we were able to give him similar instances affecting other powers i should like to say that i do not propose this evening to trouble the house with any detailed argument with regard to manchuria i know perfectly well that it is easily possible to mount up the large number of troops and the freat works which are being carried out by the russian gsovernment in manchuria but when i hear these arguments i am very much inclined to wonder at the temerity of the hen gentleman opposite knowin that we are a maritime power and that russia has a iand frontier of some  or  miles with china i am somewhat surprised at the spirit with which the hon gentleman the member for barnslev attacks the question as if her majestys government shouldhave challenged tbe government of russia for possession of a province which we do not desire to posseas otuselves and which china unfortunately is not able to keep without the vigorous sapport of her majestys government or of some other power but leaving that the hon member referred to other matters as having been grave failures on our ptrt he specially alluded to the ranlung extension the hon gentleman has been to kaulung and i have not and he has heard there opinions which no donbt he has repeated in this house as to the large extent of territory which it was desirable to take in order to seeure what he cosidered an effective boundary pdtlet us look into the question a little more ciosely what is it we asked for and obtained  we obtained  square miles addition to theo colony of hongkong that in itself is a not inconsiderable accession hear hear in takig possession of that it is quite true that we wero forced owing to the opposition which was threatened to us by disorganixed chinese troops to take this territory of san chun which the hon member seems to regret so much that we have given upmr j waltonhear hearmr brodrickyes but when the cause of offence baa gone i ask the house whether the punishment which we were forced to inflict for that cause of offence should not be withdrawn too  hear hear it really smouats to thisthat according to the hon gentleman we were to do an act not justified at all events by any legal con wention or agreement we were to take a considerable further tract of country because we were tem orerily obstructed in taking the extension at hongkong to which we were entitledmr j waltoni said we ought to have takbn a further tract of country in the first instance and thus have secured an effective boundarymr brodricki quite grant that but i would sk
