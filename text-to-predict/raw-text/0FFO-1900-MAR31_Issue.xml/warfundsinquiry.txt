warl funds inquibyat the westminster palace hotel last night lord justice collins presided over the committee which has bcen appointed to inquire into the administration of the runds available for the relief of the families of those engaged in the war in south africa and also to con sider bow these funds may be distributed to the best idvantage of those for whom they are intendedlord wantage was the first witness and in reply to she charman he said that he was chairman of the society for the aid of the sick add wounded in warmnd also of the central british red cross committee during the francogerman war the national aid society of which he was the promoter in a very short time accumulated nearly half a milliou sterling it wra expended and equally divided between the french and german soldiers and there remained a surplus of about £ which had been subsequently used iu various campaigns they had expended  upon foreign eampaigns aud tqoo undon amu z wr tro e out the secretary of state foreseeing the probability of great overlapping at the seat of war invited the national aid society to join with the army military service and one or two other bodies formed for the purpose of helping the sick and wounded in south africa the secretary of state for war had the power of saying that no societv going to the seat of war should be allowed to enter the field or in anway to operate without being in touch with the centrju red cross committee and in that way they were able to put a certain anount of control over the societies who were rushing to the front each one anxious to operate in its own particular way all of them having a most impetnous desire to gt up to the fighting line the secretary for war made regulations that no societ should work excepting under instructious from the central red cross society all the societies came into touch with the red cross societv and the tuischief which appeared in former campaigns had been obviated and there had been hardly any witerference or over lapping with the nunierous bodies who were acting under the red cross societyhave you any notion how much money you have spent so far in this war pyes we have received £ which baa been contributed from various bodies wve have now about £i still in hand but we have obligations that will wavallow up the whole of that amount at least we think so we have a vessel called the princess of wales which goes backwards and forwards equipped in the most complete manner ad she will have a good deal of work to do after the war is over m bringing home the sick in addition to that we have an obligatiou to keep a train which was coustructed in birmingham previous to the begining of the war and the fact of our having a nest egg in the bands of the national aid soeiety enahlde us to take action before the war began in that way we were able to send out a completelyequipped hospital train made in the most convemieut manner foz running on the rails that train has gone up and is doing very good work on the natal side thatof course was an obligation to be set against the £ vie have in hand of course wp cannot tell how much more may be needed and so it will be necessary to keep in hand as far as we can a oertain sum so as not to be left in the lurch because i think the publio purse is pretty well dried up nowin reply to further questions lord wantage said that in his opinion all appeals for war relief funds should be made generally as they always had been through the lord liayorthe lord mayor beingthrough long usage recognized as tho channel for public beuevolence and eiug also in touch with the provincial mayors the administration of such funds should not be left with the lord mayor but should be left to those who had started and promoted the funds tho usual course was that the lord mayor recommended aln appeal to the public and then handed over the funds collected to those who were prepared to administer them when the subscriptions were very numerous as they were on tho present occsion tho matter became very much more difficult the lord mayor then had to exercise a discretion in the allocation of the money without any machinery or soy special knowledge to iuide him the largest recipients of the preeent fund were the royal patriotic commissioners s per cent of the contributions snt to the lord mayor being earmarked to that fund there had a so been a handsome donation made to the red cross society tnose who started thcse funds were the best to administer them there was emulation and a considerable spirit of criticism btween what he might call rival funds which on the whole had a good effect although it led to the evil of overlapping the formation of some central committee on which the representatives of the various funds shoula have a seat wouli in a very great measure obviate the mnischief of overlapping ltat committee would pro bsbl be a sort of cl armghouse at first but it would ultimately grow into something more important he did not know whether some of the surplus fundso aftex this war could be banded over to such a central com mittee if they could that would at once give the com mittee a stronger position and it would then be able to act promptly in future campaigns in making eertain pro visions which always must be necessary and the earlier they were made the better there was nothing to be done for the present war except to form a committee which might act as a clearinghouse aud it would give confidence to the public if su eb c ommittee were pre aided over by one of the royal familyby the raw cotsso ilnche had sent to pretrito a friend of lord rothschilds a sum of between £ and £ for distribution among the british prisoners tberecolonel tully hon secretary of the imperial wdr fund said
