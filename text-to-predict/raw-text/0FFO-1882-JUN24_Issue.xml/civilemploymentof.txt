wvalker general warre colonel sir robert loydlinisay vc idp general hume admiral sir gcoffrey phipps horoby general sir e hodge and many otherstha dvxe of caebnridoe said he had been asked to preside ou the present occasion and lie had great pleasuro in complying with the request for he was quite in accord with the general desire which had been expressed by officers of the inavy and army to show respect and ad miration for the work which captain edward walter had successfudy carried out captain walter was as they aul lknew the founder of the corps of commissionaires which had been most beneficial to both of her majestys services and to the wvortby men who had served the country on land or sea tlear hear in the ftrst instance captain walter aimed at the employment of men who had been wounded in the service of their country and succeeding in fndiing civil employment for these he set about extending the circle of his good work with the result that in the course of the last  years a vast numuber of men from the tanks of the army and navy bad beeu found work who wvould otherwise have been unemployed and would have lacked the means of livelihood hear bear there could be no doubt of the advantages of the corps of com missionaires checrs but for captain llalter the corps would never have been established in the first in stance and but for his practical knowledge and experience and discipline it woulki not have been as etficient as it had proved itself to be alike by its usefulness and by its ex tension to various large towns in the kingdom hear bear moreover it was to be remembered the institution established by captain walter was not oniy a benefit to the servines and to the men who bad been employed in the services but to the public at large who had benefited by the labour of trustworthy men being made available to employers the men under the system of the corps were selected with great care and those who had proved them selves unfit for the service had been excluded in a summary way but certainly with great caution and for bearance hear hear the advantage of the corps to the iublic and to the army nad navy was enormous before its establishment old soldiers and sailors from the royal navy on being discharged from the services with a pension were left very much to their own devices with the resultwhichl vas to be looked for indeed in uch cir cumistances when mien lost the influences to which they bad been long accustonmedthab many good men were lost to the ranks of industry and lost the respect theo were entitled to after long and honourable service hear hear the establishment of the carps of commissionaires had pre served by the inaintenance of the reimental organization large numbers of miien for civil emprioyment to the benefit of all classes thiis systeni ivas now in work inot only in london but in large towns of enigland and ixeland cheers doubtless it would be extended by degrees still ftrther but to do this great woric for tho services and for the country wvould require the continuation of the arduous services which captain walter had unselshly and un rudgingly fiven for nearly a quarter of a century cjeers m ith the results of captain walters work before him his royal highness said he had felt boundand not orny was bh bound but delighted to act with the officers of the arnsy and navy in showing a sincere and honest regard for these valuable services and in maridng these feelings by the prcsenitation of a testimonial from the oficers of tile xoyal services cheers it had been con veyed to him that captain wvalter who was retired from the service wouold accept a testimonial fromn his old brother officers but that he objected to the addition of a public subscription in hiis koyal highnetss opinion it would be a great mistake to refuse all offered aid from thepublicat lcast lo thought if the public desired to subscribe they could do it to the eadowment fund of the corpswhich was necessary to keep up the machinery of the corps and necessary to press on its extension the public of london who had largely benefited dy the corps bad contributed only a small amount and therefore lie thought it was only reasonable that the offer of the public to do something on the occasion of this testimonial to the services of captain walter should be aecepted cheers the object of the resolutions to be proposed was to do justiceit might be late justiceto a gentleman who bad done good work for the state and to the state services he cordially entered into this and also gave his support to tho view that the amount of individual subscription should be limited in order tlhat the area might be extended as widely as possible cheersgraaerl lortd longford moveds tbas in view of the success which has attended the ormation of the corps of commissionaires and in acknow ledgment of the benefit which has resulted therefrom to the old and deserving sailors and soldiers of her
