mr russxl qci do not know what a  sculptors ghost  is i lad never before heard the expression until a fow months since i understand it to mean that the individual who is supposed to execute the work does not do it at allbut some one rarely seen does the work doubts as to the authenticity of my work were trst brouglht to my notice by the vnity fair libel or in  or  i heard it from the hon captain montagu and r alexander yorke  not before  or  i thinlr that was from persons wbhom i cannot remember i thoaght it a serious matter affecting my hondur cer tainly but i cannot remember a single person miller a sculptor since dead competed vith me for the conway memorial i did not think he alleged verhyden haid done the work attributed to me it was esomething not connected with sculpture  but that i had not drawn the canons portrait and verhyden had in  i tbreat ened if miller did not retract to place the matter in my olicitors hands i did not see verhyden about this matter or call aud see him atbattersea iwas not excited nor did i ask for tea from mrs verhyden nor did i say it would ruin me if not contradicted i did not ask him to sign a contradiction nor did he refuse to sign any lio about it no such conversation took place or interview or cup of tea laughter i wrote him a letter pro duced on july   about his sayizig ho had done the drawing he did not come to the meeting i proposed i did not meet him afterwards on batterseabridge nor did he say he would not say anything about it he came to my studio and told me he had never asserted anything of the kind about drawing the portrait or countycomting tae i did not see miller about it he died shortly after in  i did not tell verhyden that i wanted him as a witness in an action against mtillerdid you hear any such rumours after that objected to by sir h gitferd but adintted by his lord hip no particular work was doubted till the article in vanity fair even oaptain montatu particularized no work on tucsday

had made any reoenrks of that kind had only to come to me i did say that i believed it all came from msr loeem he is a slight acquaintance of mine i did not say the queen and the empress were in my

i saw anything in vanitv fair ihese acuastions are the result of jealousy among certain mmbers of the profession there aro a great many exceptions i hope ishould be sorry for the artists or for england if that were not sothe plaintiff wvas then crossexamined as to the course of competing for works of art the cornpetitor alone sbould do the work with the usual assistance he might direct a competent assistant  that is perfectly fairhow much of the lhyron memorial ought the aasistant to do as far as the competin master thought tit providedl the assistant did it under hmis directions and was com petent the assistant might have as much or more ability than the competitor it would be the difference between execution and mind the assistant might do the whole under directions  it is usual
