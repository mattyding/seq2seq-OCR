reported that lord f ftrroy and the mon a de tatton egerton had been reelected for three years as representatives of the parish of st george hadoversquare and mr bradfield or the parish of st mary islington in the place of bir c lilt deceased the soihcitor mr wvard reported that the select committee of the hfouse of lords had inserted in the shadwell fishmarket bill the compensation elauses promoted by the corporation of london mr f hi fowler regretted that the board had not the power to do something with refer ence to the amendments inserted in the bill by the house of lords legislation had entirely failed in accomplishing what the public vanted and that vwas another and much improved fishmarket mir jones submitted that the mletropolitan board of wvorks ought to be the market autbority for the metropolis had they been the moving authority claiming the power over the markets on behalf of the whole metropolis the corporation of london he thought would have had no chance of getting their tolls maintained the corporation had had a good feast out of the tolls raised from the ratepayers of the whole nmetro polts for many years but it was now time that those tolls should be done away with or if continued they should be enjoyed by the whole metropolis he much admired the corporation but thought it was very much too rich mir richardson said the board had power in their m oney bill to establish markets in the metropolis totally irresective of the corporation he hoped the board would eneavour to ge its views represented in the house of commons be cause be believed the twvo clauses which bad been inserted in the shadwell bill would be most destructi ye to the in terests of the metropolis le held that the corporation had no right whatever to compensation and all their pre tended power was a myth mir lloyd observed that up to the present time the board had distinctly declined to take any action with respeot to this particular market either on behalf of the promoters or on bebalf of the corporation therefore be id not think it would be within the province of the chairman to talce any action with regard to the clauses referred to mr edwards thought the board ought to ask the house of commons to reject these clauses from the bill mir runtz said the result was very much to be regretted and tbe board shculd petition the house of commons to recommit the bill mr j e saunders be lieved the majority of the board would have been quite content if the corporation of london had undertaken to build marlcets in the metropolis he believed the result would prove that tbe lords were nta far wrong in the course they had taken mlr cook said it was aeeat misfortune to london that the shadwell bill had feen dealt with in such a way by the house of lords he maintained that if they had two markets in london they had a much better chance of getting cheaper fsh tban with one market thh chairman in reply to a quetion said he was afraid the board could not petition the house of commons agaiust the bill mr cook moved that the matter be referred to the works and general purposes committee to consider and report alr tolhurst seconded the motion which was

on motions in efiance of the resolution the then chairman mlr freeman dissolved the meeting which a small minority endeavoured to carry on and desired now to obtain a record of their action tlhe board after an acri monious discussin decided by a large majority to con frmr the ninutes and to ignore the disorderly actioa of s few members mr bond who was elected at the last meeting in the place of mr t scrutton was introduced and took his seat mr sydney buxton presented a report from the bylaws committee proposing anl alteration in the system of dealing with children who came to school without their fees the present system is one by which the children wbo are poorest are turned from the schools if they have not their fees the committee now proposed that otber means should be taken to recover the fees where the phreiit could pay but that the children should not bc turned trom the schools the rev joseph dig le opposed the adoption of the report considering that the new departure would be a step in the way of free schools he moved the previous question and the rev dr wainwright secon ed the amendment the rev j j coxhead warmnly supported the report and urged that the exclusion of the poorest children because their parents had not or could not give the fees was to perpetuate the sys tem of children being brought up in the streetsa system which led to viciousness and crime in the course of a pra longed discussion fears were exnpressed tbat the proposal was the thin end of the wedge in the way of getting free schools the  previous question was rejected by  to eight mr
