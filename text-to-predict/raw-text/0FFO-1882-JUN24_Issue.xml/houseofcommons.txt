objection to allowing suno members as might think tiat any ques tion had then been sufficiently debated to give their votes by means of an instrument in writing personally delivered to some officer of the house appjinted for that purposeand whether if such an alteration in the mode of voting were pesmitted tho decision of the house of commons would noc practically be obtained whenever not less than an absolute majority of the whole house had thus voted on either side of any question and if it would not be possible so to ascertain the general sense of the house and to give effect to it by a process less objectionable than by a system of cuture borrowed from foreign assemblies where different conditions prevailoutrages in county libierickmr osullivan asked the cbief secretary to the lord lieutenant of irland whether any outrages had been committed in the parish of murroo county of limerick within the past four months if not why a number of special police had been sent to that district and who would bave to pay the cost of those extra policemr trevelyantin consequence of information in the possession of the police and which bad been communi cated to the lord lieutenant the extra men were placed in the murroe district to prevent intimidation tho county of limerick has been proclaimed under scotion  of gi wlniam iv and an extra police force sent there and one mooiety of the expense of such extra force is payablenational teachers irelandmr biggar asked the cbief secretary to the lord lieutenant of ireland whether it was true that national teacbers who attended the matriculation examination of the royal university were curtailed of salary for the days they were so occupied and whether the commissioners had on previous occasions invariably deducted salary when teachers attended university examinations and if not whether the change of rule was adopted at a regular board mcetingand formally approved of by the lord lieutenantmir tbevelyanit is the case that the salaries of tho national teachers who attended the matriculation ex amination of the royal university were curtailed for tbo days they were absent from their duties this has been the rule and practice of the board and so far as can be ascertained was relaxed on one occasion ouly when the teachers vacation was curtailed by the number of days he bad been absentsubconstable walshmlr healy sklzed the chief secretary to the lord lieutenant of ireland whhether lie could now slate whether subconstable walsh who was not paid off until after the date of colonel hilliers circular would participate in the extra gant to the constabulary and if not whether such refusal on the part of the governiment would not be a con tradiction of the terms of the circularwr treveelyani must refer the hon member to the answer which i gave him to his revious auestin onbeing inconsistent with the machinery and prineiplee of the bill could not be putur paiinelt said that their object was to alter the provisions of the alien act of  how was that to be done if provisoes such as those on the paper eould not be moved so as to be added to the clause the chairman said that there was no objectiob to provisoes being moved so long as they were not incon sistent with the portions of th bwil which thty tlad already passedfr sexton then moved to add at the end of the clause  provided that nothing in the said act contained shall affect any alien who shall have bee residing within this realmn for one yearnextbcefore the issingof thisact the object of the amendment was to protect alliens who were arrying on legitimate business in the countrysir iv harcourt thought the period of one year proposed by the amendment too short the act of  required a residence of three years and he thought that having regard to what was nowf taking place in ireland three years was not too long a ieriof disturbances ovwing to alien induences had been goingz on for twoo years and therefore the government could not fix a shorter period tlan three years len engaged in useful occupa tions would not be interfered withmr pallnell said the alien act would be productive of great hardship to large naimbers of aliens of good cla racter in ireland who had come over from america and were the holders of small farms the lord lieutenant would of course be guided by the reports of the plice who would recommend the removal of any man who dared to express any opinions upon the political questions of theday it would be very hard to disturb peaceable persons who had come perhaps from america and wrho desired to remain in their adopted country for the rest of their days and were carrying on business wvith the industryand energy that charaeterurei american citizenssit nv arcourt said he felt every sympathy with the class of persons of whom the hon member for cork had spoken and be agreed that such a class should be en couragd but such persons were alresdy protected by the biili or should there be any disposition on the part of the police to act harshlv towards them they had the right to come before the privy council and show that the acousa tions against them were falsemr t p oconnor thanked the home secretary for his expressions of sympathy but he was of opinion that there would not be much chance of an appeal to the privy council being successful for the privy council would feel bound to endorse the opinion of the lord lieutenant rather than weaken his authority by overruling him he would remind the right hon gentleman that the alien could be attacked under clause  as well as the present clause en the ground of his beinig a  strangersir w earcourt said he was very anxious to miti gate the severity of the bill and therefore he proposed to consult the irish government as to whether a shorter period than threo years might be safely takeu he hoped the hon member would accept his assurance that the matter should be duly consideredblr sexton said he was disposed to ccept the as surance of the right hon gentleman and accordinglyafter a few remarks from lmr wamton the amendment was witbdrawntr parnell then moved an amendment by adding to the clause a proniso that any alien imprisoned under the provisions of the act should betreated during such im prisonment as a misdeineanane of the hrst division within the meaning of section  of the prisons act  on the ground that the treatment of misdemeanants of that class was sufliciently severesir iv haroourt raid be was quite disposed to con sider tbe question of the treatment of prisoners in the most favourable manner the object of the clause was not punishment but the security of the prisoner and his re nooval and he would consider the question in this point of viewthe smendment was accordingly withdrawntr parnell moved to vdi a proviso that the time limited for the departure of any alien in any order made nuder the said act should not he less than  days on the ground that it would be acting harshly to require imme diate departuresir wn halrcourt agreed that the act should not be carried out with harshness due consideration would be shown in cases in which a man was carrying on busi ness but as to persons coming over to the country with treasonable and danferous designs it was only proper that they should be got rid of as speedily as possiblemr sexton asked whether the direction and scope of the clause should be governed entirely by the extreme class of cases supposed by the home secretary or whether the oommittee would not make some provision for the pro tectiou of persons of a different class there was a class of aliens who were engaged iu businessand whose presence in the country could not be supposed to be danpcrous to its peace and it could hardly be said that their imme diate departure was necessary to insure publietranquillity those persons might surely be allowed if not a month at least a fortnightor some other reasonable period for wind ing up their affairs end realizing their effecs before they were required to leavemr dillon thought it might be provided that ecept in tho caeo of those alens who had arrived in the oountry within one month of the passing of the act ten days at least should be given for winding up their affairs to aliens who were ordered to leavesir w haroourt did not like to decline to consider any suggestion that was offerel in a reasonable and mode rate spirit but he thought it highly improbable thatalien whom it would be safe to allow to remainfor a month would be one whom the government would be disposed to deport of ouarre the circumstances of different cases must rary somewhat and if the lord lieutenant thought a man might be safely granted a few days to prepare to go away there was no reason to induce the lord lieutenant to refuse to do so even ambassadors however some times received their passports and wre ordered to leave a country within  bours wbere the animosity existing was very violent and the relations between two nations were much strained napoleon once ordered the english ambassador away from paris at very short notice as to the suggestion of the bon member for tipperary an alien might uave bean long resident in this khngdom without any one suspecting that he was a dangerous person until they got a clue that ha was engaged in a conspiracy and connected with some secret society  and then it might nsot be safe or proper to suow him to remain ten days or a fortnight in the country hfowever he was willing to con sider the suggestion which had been offered from the other side of the house end to sue whether consistently witthwhwbaat he had himself urged anything could be donemr gregory was understood to say that the act of  itself met the point which had now been raised be cause under it if an alien could urge any reasonable groundwhyhe shouldbeallowed to remain some time longer in te country he had a right to represent it imme diately to the privy coancil who wvould advise liertajesty on the matter without reference to what had taken place before the secreta y of stateafr dillon remarked tha durirg the intervalallowed an alien for winding up his affairs the police could surely keep an eye on hin day and night to see that he did no mischief it should be romemberd that the man would be kept in prison until the daecisiom of the privy council wa givenmir labouchere thought tha the home secretary might make somo concession m favourof aliens engaged in business in ireland if it was reallj deemed neeessary to send them awaymr lowther said as he understood the bill the government desired power to remove any alien dangerous to life with all possible speed if the committee thought the government was to be trusted with suchpowors it seemed to him a farce to attempt to put small limitations upon itthe amendment was tben withdrawnmir parnell moved tn clause  page  line  to add words enabling en appeal to the lord lieutenani or the secretary of state to be made by any person affected by an order directed against him as an alien be thought it unfair that an alien against wbom an unwarranted order was made should not have the cbance of a direct appeal to some higb official who would be empowered to deal directly with the mattersir w harcourt pointed out tbat the anendment was objectionable in form apart however from the technical difficulty which could be removed byaltering the amendment ho thought the desire of the bon member was to give an alien an opportunity of satisfying the secre tary of state that the order made against hin was unjust that opportunity was already provided for by clause  and he trusted therefore that the present amendment would not be pressedir parikell said the effect of the clause referred to by the home secretary had escaped him but his ohject was not entirely satisfed he wished to lvoid the chance of a lie being put into prison it was treo that this might be avoided oy an application to the queens bench but the process w as both costly and dilatory and ha could not but regret that the governmnent bad refused to justices the power to take bailthe amendment was by leave withdrawnmr parnell moved to add at the end of the clause a subsection entitling any person suffering loss or injury in consequenee of any order made against him under this clause to recover damages in case he could establish that at the date of auch order he was not an alienthe solicitorgeneral for ireland said that the government could not accept this amendment becarse no action at law could be permitted in reference to steps taken under this billmr sexton said that under the circumstances he tbought the governmentought to agree to the amendment hew was the person to prove tbat he was not an alien  it would be absurd to tbrow the onus of proof on thatir parnell said this really was an important ques tion as to the onus of proof it was a matter of great difficulty for almost aiy person to prove that he was not an alien he understood the right hon gentleman the home secretary to say that in case the person proved ho was not an alien he had a remcdy by action against the lord lieutenant the hon and learned gentleman the solicitorgeneral for ireland had however said that al action could not be brought against the lord lieutenant the remedy by actions therefore would seem to be iullsoysir w harcourt said the hon gentleman was unoder a miapprehension as to what he had stated pre viously there could be no doubt that persons who were in tho execution of public duties could not be subjected to an action at law so long as they acted tnd ide he could not give any positive undertaking but he would ask the hon mernbar to postpone the amendment till the report that the government might consider the mattermir comidllns thought that the liability for false charges ought to be brought home to somebody and that some substantial person should be provided to answer for damagesmir sexton asked the home secretary wbether it would be suadiesut foe the ioq that the eou beopthbem vas tbe person named in the warrant or would it have to be proved also that he wu an alien the atborneygeneral said it would certainly bave to be proved that be was an alienmir sexton pdinted out that when a man came before the privy counil he would be put upot his  defence that wtas that be would have to prbithat he as not an aienie prove a negative wah in many cases would be impossible seriona difilcultigs might arise in the case of irnshmen vho had lived some yeara in america and returned homne without having become uaturalized in the united state ot in the ease of the children of such irish mnensir w haroourt said the contention of the bon member assumed that the privy council would not do its duty the privy council culd nly act upon evidence there were three responsible tribunals to wich a person who had been wrongly arrested a an alien could appeal and one could not assume that tbey would fail to do their duty on a satisfaetoryproof bein given that he was not anin auswer to mr parxzllsir w larcourt said he would consider the matter on the report there was nothingr to prevent a man wrongly arrested as an alien from smug out a habrs coifsilir eeialy said a man might be arrested as an lien upon false information he might be kept inirison for two months snd his character might be damnageid his arrest mighlt have been procured by a rival in business surely there aught to be redress in such a case was the person arrested to have or not to have an action ml parnell withdrew his amendment on the under standing that the question was to be dealt with on the reportmr mealy moved to add the following proviso to the clause  provided that such reasonable expenses of any alien againist whom any order shall be made under the said act as wiu enable him to comply with the terms of such order and travel to the country of which he is a citizen shall on application be paid to himsir w emarcourt could not agreo to this amend ment the hypothesis upon which a man would be ordered to leave the country vould be that he had come here to disturb the peace and tranquillity of the realm that being so he could not understand how the country could be expected to pay the mans travelling expensesmr mealy printed out that the fenian prisoners after their release were given money to pay the expenses of their banisbment from the country odonovan rbssas expenses were thus paid on the occasion of his departure to the  land of dynamiteat  minutes to  progress was reported and shortly afterwards the sitting was suspendedthe sitting was resumed shortly aiftr  oclockthe mouse having resolved into committee on the prevention of crime ireland bill the discussion on mr mealys proviso proposed to be added at the end of the th the alien clause was continued the proposal was to the effect that any alien ordered to leave this country should on application receive such reasonable expenses as would enable him to return to his own countrybir biggar said that the proposal seemed to hi m reasonable if a man were ordered to leavs the country how could he do so unless he were providod with his steamboat fare  if he were an american citizen and his traveuling expenses were paid only to france he might be unable to return to his own countrymr trevelyan said they had talked so much about this alien olause that certain geutletnen had talked themselves into tfie idea that these aliens were very amiable personsand that tbei r departure would be a loss to the country a laugh but this clause would never be put into operaton except against persons whose departure would beoa reat gain to tbe country and in the long run to themsrlves bceause if they wnerd to atono much longer here they would got thmselves iute a position comwpared with which their douerern would be a very little incon vnienco to them hear hear mr sexton said the question was not swhethor tilien was an amiable prson or notor whether his de parture would or would not abn gain t the country but whether he was to ho punished for not obeying an order which he had not the meeans of camalang with up posing the man had not the money when he bas in the hands of the qaeons miessenger the govermnent wvould have to pay his fare and perhaps that of his escortthe amendment was then negativedmr parnell moved to add the followinge subseotion  a copy of every order under this subsection shaul be laid before parliament within  days after thc issuing thereof if parliament be then sitting and if not within  days after the next meeting of parliamentmr trevelyan said that thu hfome secretary had promised to accept this amendment but the matter might he left to the report of the commlitteethe smeudmnoet was negativedon the question that the clause as amended stand part of the billmr dtilon said that while every one would acknow ledge that no powers such as those conferred by this clause ought to be granted to a government unless the necessity for them had been proved no such proof had been given in the present caso a very stringent clause as regards strangers had already been agreed to and he failed to sea how any further provisions of this character could be required it might be said of coursa tbat this clause was introduced with the object of preventing com plications witb foreign powers aud the appreheusion of such difficulties was not unreasonable but the clause deal ing with strangers would suffice for this purpose aud would permit the government to give notice to those strangers whom it was intended to remove an alien he presumed would be a stranger within the meaning of the clause and in that case there could be no reason why the government should not make the desired concession and allow the stranger about to be removed to have some notice of their intentionair sullivan asked what object the government could possibly have in merely annoying the people of ire land the pledges thist had beeu given had been notori ously falsified by the action of the executive at first the penalties of the bill were to be enforced only against criminals who were well known to the polico but it now came to this that any irishman who lovedl the right of public meting or had any of the aspirations of a free man would be made to suffermr arnold believed that the act of  which was never brought into operation was really directed against the importation of foreign ideas into this country it was now proposed to revive that act and he was surprised that so little had been said sbout the political bearing of the question the origin of the clause was the close con nexion of irishmen with america and he was reluctantly compcedd to support it as he thought that it might pre vent compliecations arising between this oountry and amrericamr osullivan thought that the clause might be used by local magistrates and officials in an unjust manner againtt persons who might from their strong opinions on political questions be distasteful to them he was sorry the home secretary had rejected the amendment which sought to exempt strangers who had lived twelve months in the country he hoped the right hon gentleman would on the report at all events exempt those who had liyed two years in a districtmir brigiti think that in the discussion on this clause reference bas been made by the bon member for tipperary to the course i took in the year  re did me the honour of reading my name as being one of the minority of  who opposed the act at that time it he had read through the wbole of the debate he would have found there was reason for objecting to that act which i believe does not now prevail and hba no influence with regard to the present time in the speeh of sir george grey wbo introduced the dil it was stated that the great object of the bill was to prevent the pread of be publican opinions which at that time had overturned most of the constitutions of europe and some people were afraid that some effect of the same nature might be pro duced in this country gentlemen from paris at that time called upon me to discuss the question whether it was possible that what had beeu done in some european capitals might be done in the capital of this country i said that i thought that what had been doue by people abroad would be resolutely opposed by the people of this country that act was intended to prevent the introduc tion of opinion this act is not so the object of this act is to prevent an incursion from a particuahr country no doubt this power is a hundred times more directed against persons coming from the united states than from any country in europe we need not be surprised at that because we know a great deal about a party in america called the american irish we have had some interesting books recently published which give us a great deal of information witb regard to that subject we knov further that their opinions are published to the world and that they are most violent not only against the govern ment but against the people of great britain and it bas been the boast of gentlemen opposite during the last few years that they bave had an alimost unlimited supply of money from that country for the purpose of conduct ing a political agitation in ireland we know further that in america there has been a series of conspira cies for some years past in connexion with tbid party not many years ago a soldier of tortune a man who was ready to fight anywhere came to this country under the expectation that his riends in ireland would put him immed ately at tho head of  meu he afterwards published an account of his experiences in one of the reviews of this countr
