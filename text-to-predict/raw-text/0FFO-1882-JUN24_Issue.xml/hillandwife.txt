the codicil devolved boine that mrs toddy made the codicil of her own free will and of her own motion because she had arrivad at the conclusion that har daugbter was incapable of a judicious management of money it was further stated that before mrs toddy ex pressed her intention of making the codicil the passibility of a marriage between her daughter and young bill was mentioned to her but it vas admitted that on bearing itshe said that so young a man might as well think ofl marrying her as hor daugbter ind that she would not believe it tbe plaintiffs denied that they had been on

the wifo of mr jones obtained beneats which they would not have under the will was concealod from her until after her mothers death the property left in mrs toddys will amcunted to about � but mrs hliu had under hor fatbers will some � and the entire of her property she settled on herself and her husband the ll family contfibuting nothing by way of marriage settlemeut at the close of the ovidencemsr wills addressed the jury for his clients he com monted on the main parts of the testimony on both sides and contended that it wen to show conclusively that previous to the making of the codicil mrs toddys mind had become enfeeblef though she could not be said to have been at any time positively insano  that she was positively afraid of jones and that the latter for his own nparposcs used an undue influence over her and there y procured the executionof the will he repudiated as against the evidence the suggestion that mrs toddy knew tbat her daughter and mr hill were likely to marry and he asked the jury to bear in mind that the plaintiffs had sworn that there were no relations of affection between them till after mnrs toddys deathdr deaxze in replying for the plaintiffs denied that there was any concealment of the codicil from mrs hill and in proof of this pointed to the fact that an entry of the cost of that instrument was contained in an account book which had been submnitted to mrs hiu before her mothers deaththe presidt in summing up the ctse said there was a failure of evidence to show that mr toddy changed her mind towards her daughter in consequence of a belief tbat a marriage between the latter and xr hill was a likely occurrence he thought it was pretty plain that mirs hill did not know of the execution of the codicil at the time it was signed and that it was not intended that s boshould know of it after a careful roview of the evidence his lordship told the zury the questions they had to determine were first whether the testatrix was of capable mindwhether she was capable of understanding the claim of those about her next whether supposing she was capable of under standing that she did understand itthat was whether it had been brought home to her mind that by the codicil she vas depriving her daughter of all but a life interest  and lastly whether supposing she was of capable mind and did understand vhat she was doing it was the result of a fear wlhich she entertained of jones and of the infuence which he exercised over herthe jury found for the defdndantsthe lvemlldrnt pronounced for the will ad codicil but aluowed the plaintiffs their costs out of the estate
