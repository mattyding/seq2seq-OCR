a variety of unofficial but important negotiations carried on between sir edward male and sir aucklsnd colvin on the one side and the cbiefs of the national egyptian party on the other neo tiations in which i engaged my personal honour for the loyalty of her majestys agents also that i have been iu close communication with those chiefs since my return to england he should also move for any publio

foreign affairs a ques ion of which i gave him private notice yesterday when he was unable to be present i wish to ask him whether the government propose to hold the conference at constantinople without the consent of the sultan and whether there is any precedent for such a stepearl granvilletbe noble marquis was good enough to give me notice of this question yesterday i lope be will not think me guilty of any discourtesy in no requesting one of my noble colleagues to answer him i bad to attend her majesty at windsor yesterday and hib notice did rot arrive till after i bad left london ivith regard to his question i have to state that the sultan has objected to the conference at constantinople and thab her majestys government is prepared with france germany italy ad russia to agree to meet in conference although austria has not yet signified her intention of doing so in consequence of the objections of the sultan we have reason to believe that she is not likely to separate herself from the other powers as regards holding the conference at constnntinopleit is tot from any want of respect to the due rights of the sultanthe marquis of salisbuiryof course it is very easy to say that it is not intended to show any want of respect to the due rights of the sultan but it is hardly possible to inflict more flagrant disrespect upon the rights of thc sultan wlho was admitted by the treaty o paris to the concert of the european powers and is entitled to all the marks of respect anid to all the benefits of the inter mational ratifications which affect the other signatory powers there is no doubt that the assembly of a confer ence at the capital of the sultan to deal witb the subjects of that sovereign against his will is as flagrant an inter ference with the independence of the porte as it is possible to conceive hear hear a e have the authority of the prinme mlinister for saying that no difference should be tmado between weak powers and strong powers and that vhatever is right for the weak is right for the strong what should we think if musurus pasha were to summona uonterence in londou against the wish of the queen to consider the condition of ireland cheers is is not only an indecorous and unfair proceeding to interfere with a power that has both historical and treaty rights to aur consideration but it is also under the present state of cir cumstances exceedingly imprudent on what power or fvbat assistance do you depend for attaining the objects of your policy in the difficalt problems that lie before you  for no one can doubt that they are problems of exceeding difficulty yon havc engaged to uphold the present jviceroy you have cngaged t o o darabi pasha from power you bare cngaged to restore the status quo ants and unless you do these things the english nameo will be a laughing stoek throughout the whole of the east cheers from egypt to japan the ridicule which you will bring down on your couutry will tell with powerful elect not onlg upon the commerce of its capitalists and its mer chants butupon the lives of its subjects this is the difflcult problem with wvhich you have to deal your diiculty arises from the fact thatyou have to meet a utrong feeling of mahomedans against the interposition of tbe christian pow ers so far as w e can trace anymean ing in this movement which has crossed our path it is art of the great panislamic movement of which we have heard so muchit is a war of fahomedanism ugainst ohristianity and we have taken the most unwise step in the world in inflicting a public affront on the head of the lmahomedan religion isupposo that the european conference goes on smoothly lyou wiiu enjoy all the moral aud material resources wlich that conference will place at your disposal but suppose that greater difficulties than you now contemplate arise it will be the sultan alone who can extricate you ifrom those diflultics my lords lier majestys govern mnent are taking a caurse for which there is no precedent hear which sins grievously against international law and which in the grave circumstances of the country is ithe most imprudent course they could take cheersearl grxnyillaetbe noble marquis the other day announced that being out of office no responsibility attached to him about a week ago the noble lord ad mitted that no thought it exceedingly inconvenient to discuss these matters in the present state of affairs the noble lord in that utter want of responsibility that attaches to him has thought at to take this coursehe either asks in the simplest manner a question answered by me or some other noble lord or contrary to the doctrine laid down by the late lord ohancellor he goes into the whole matter and in a case like thiswhere all the powers of europe are agreeleven since the answers i have given i bear that austria agrees with the other powers to enter into a conference eboers he thinks it to the advautiage of the practical settlement of this question when this con ference is being settled and is about to sit to get up and damage it as mueh as possible and to excite the sultan of turkey against his own interest to oppose the recom mendations in that conference my lords ireally will not argue the case with the noble marquis rearmunster and connaugtlord wavewey rose to move that an humble lddress be presented to her majesty for the appointment of a royal commission to investigate the social condition of the provinces of alunster nd connaugbt and to report ths present moment he thought was opportune for doin something which would be advantageous to irelandf the legislature ho thought ought t try to discover some oeans of removing the discontent which existed in the south and west of ireland it was knowgn that the farmers in munster and connaught led a very simple existence that they were largely tafluenced by tradition and that a close connexion was maintained between them and their countrymen in all other parts of the world beyond these facts little was known of the inhabitants of those proinces of ireland to which he wishad to draw attention nothing was more remarkable than the surprise caused even to the bestinformed people in irelandby the events of the last six months the number of farrners for example by whom the assistance of the land court bad been sraght bad been far larger than one would have ex pected from previous computations he would not at tempt tn forecast the reso ti that might follow an inquiry into tbe social condition of nunster and connaught posibly emigration might receive a nw

ws iot prepared on the spur of the moment to discuss tho ociat condition of those zwo provinces of ireland the practical question for the house and for his noble friend was whether anything would be gained as regarded the end be bad in viewvnamely the improvement of the social condition of ireland by the appointment of a royal commission it struok him that they did not suffer from wanb of knowledge hear hear they suffered from the great difficulty of dealing with one of the hardest and most dangerous political problems that any nation and espiecially a nation with a popular government had to deal vwth within its own borders as for sending this commiission through the length and breadth of ireland ho could not conceive what its effect would be upon the minds of the peoplo except that the government had undertaken to make every family in the country comfortable for the rest of their days  hear hear  and a laugh they bad recently hal two inquiries with respect to that most inporlaut matterthe agrarian relations of the country alud however opinions mnight differ amongtheirlord ships they were allin various degrees responsible for the legislation which had been the result he differed he weled fromn the majority of their lordships in loofpboplfa y tt the effects woich improved tenure would word in time e believed it wofld tork ion nito good in ireland and not fo the

assistance of their lordships and of par liamanb he hoped they would succeed when they should obtain the happy result of a restoration of peace and con sdunce in eirzand ho hoped that the legislation of vaeious kinds wvhich had been esiected for many years past would bear its fruits his noble friend would gain nothing by the appointment of such a roving investigation as he re commended even if the government vere to agree to it hearlord brabourne said his noble friend had spoken of his proposal aa a message of peace but ireland had had many messages of peace from her majestys govern ment and they had not been so successful as to encourage them to sena anothpr hear hear her majestys government by their legislation in  had created a social revolution in ireland the ordinary conditions of life in that country had been destroyed inquiry vwas super fluous anl au parliament had to do was to try to recon struct something out of the ruins hear hear lwhen her majestys government came into office they were told on the highest authority that ireland was in a satisfactory condition he could not tbink that that was intended meroly as a confidential communication to the eleotion committee of tho right hon gentleman there were three classes in irelandthe loyal the disloyal and those who were wavering between the two what the legislation of  had done was to strike a ruinous blow at tlhe most loyal part of the population hear hear then through the vacillation of her majestys government the disloyal had been encouraged and the tendency had been to con vert those were wavering into disfoyal it was at the class that was most faithful to the union between the two countries that her ajestys government had struck the blow they had throvn overboard all the principles of political economy and had placed the landlords of irelandn a position which they would have deserved if they were precisely the opposite of what they mere jhaar hear �vecy principle upon which property was retained in englan had been reversed in lreland and then it was pointed out that the condition of that country was not exactly what could eb desired the lord privy seal could not assent to the appointment of the proposed commission because he said if the government were to do so every man in ireland would believe he was going to be nmade happy and comfortable for ever was not that exactly the line that bad been taken by her mlajestys govern ment  they had given rise to false hopes the pe p le were led to expect something they could not possibly obtain having done that hler majestys government were wise now in not consenting to a commission which might serve to excite similar expectations lwhen ques tions vere asked and motions wre made with respect to the social condition of ireland be could not belp saying that the state of thecouncry bad been made worse by the action of her mlajestys government and yet any one who objected to the policy of the government vas always told that the case of ireland was wholy exceptional now he did not believe that any country in the world was ever in so exceptional a position as to justify a complete de parture from all principles of sound legislation hear hcar and it was because thie government had done that that the existing state of things in ireland was so bad and its future so dark that no light would be thrown upon it until the government abandoned messages of peace and displayed a determination to uphold the law hear hearlord waveney in reply maintained that a roving commnission such as he had advocated would be the means of gaining much knowledge at a time when every particle of informiacion as to irish affairs was especially valuablethe motion was then withdrawnroyal irise constabularyviscoujnt hidleton in asking whbether her majestys government were now prepared to state their intentions with regard to the officers of the royal irish constabulary said that the house would remember theproposalmade whlen the budget was introduced to grant a sum of money to the men of the force as compensation for the increased expeuse and respousibility that had been entailed upon them by recent events that expense and re sponsibility bad unquestionably been shared and iore than shared with the men by the oficers iho however were to receive no part of the intended grant three wacks ago he had asked a question on the subject and had been told that the matter was under consideration which stereotyped form of answer was only a shade less discouraging than the reply that  the question had been referred to the law ofricers of the crown iu ireland the noble lord who answered the question bad doubted at the time the accuracy of the hgaras he had then given as to promotion in the constabulary but ihere was abundant evidence of their correctness and of the disappointment that wae very geuerally felt by the offlicers of the force he hoped that the answer that would be given on the present occasion would stato not only that the matter was receiving careful consideration from the government but also that some defnite steps were to be taken to relieve the anxiety with which the officers of the con stabulary very justifiably regarded their future prospects hearlord dunsaxny supported the appeal of his noble friend and urged frotn a personal knowledpe of the irish constabulary that officers and lren alike were always loyal and energetic and ready to do their duty the members of the force had been true to theirallegiance although they had been exposed to greater temptation than a military body bad ever before experienced the country had been thoroughly demoralized so much so that probably for the first time in history a christian bishon hada a statement whiclh was tantamount to an avowa of socialistio principles it had been a olur on the in telligence of the force to know that about a thousand persons had been imprisoned as suspects and had been suddenly released suagestiug that it must have been wrong either to iinprison them or to release them if the country obtained home rule one of the first things that would probably be done would be to get rid of this body of men who up to this time had behaved so well lhe should be glad to hear that it was intended to do justice to the officers us well as to the menlord carlingford said he could assure both noble lords that the matter had not been in any sense shelved or postponed by the government they were quite as well aware as others of the high merits of the force and of its officers ho was not personally respon sible for the progress of the necessary zominunication between two departments of tha government but he was informed that the lord lieutenaut bad given tho matter a most thorough examination that the irish government had made a definite proposal for the settlem ent of the matter and tbat it was at this time beforo the treasury that being the state of the case a decision would probably be arrived

to inform the noble lord that the question was one which was con sidered of the greatest importance by the government and it had not been shelved or postponed in the slightest degree they were well

there had been esta hished in egypt by international arrangements european administrations forjthodaira lands the state domains the railways ports and waterworks various private com panies and industrial undertakings had also sprung up in connexion with which large numbexs of europeans were employed and which to use the words employed by the ekhcdive himself a few days ago had contributed immensely towards the prosperity of the countr all those who wero interested in the future of bgypt or who bad friends or relations out there had heard with con siderablo satisfaction the specch made a week ago in the other honse of parliament by the prime ulinister in which le said that all established rights in egypt would bo maintained whether they were those of the ultan of the khedive of the people or of the foroign bondholders and that the policy by which the government would be directed was that of the maintenanco of all established rights and the provision of now guarantees for those rights what he wanted to point out was that no guarantee for those rights was possible without the pre sence in egypt of tne european administrators and employsa great many of them british subjectswhom our consuls had been teuing to leave the country had the heen told simply to leave some disturbed districtdn to go to some locality where they would be under shelter of british guns in order to prevent a massacre that course would haye been perlectlycomprehensible but a pormanont exodusand lie used the word  per manuent  advisedly having received private information to that effecthad been going on in egypt under the advice of the british authorities he thought he might say that matters had reached a climax when it was found that the british consular surgeon in egypt as actually telegraphing to the lord mayor of london and asking him to raise a fund for thousands aud tbousands of poor christian families who were fieeing from egypt utterly debtitute could this movement which was appalling to great numbers of our fellowsubjects in egypt be really necessary  if the statements of her majestvs govern ment confrmed as they were only yesterday by the speecb of i de freacinet in the french chamber were to be believedau lo certainly believed themthat au those institutions in egpt which he had mentioned and all established righta in egypt were to bo maintained then those europeaus who were leaving the countr in sueb numbers under the advice of our consuls would be as necessary in the future as they had been in the pest was it coutemplated that after the holding of the confer ence which of course was to arrange everything amicably and satisfactorlly those poor people who had been derived of everyting tbey possessed in the world or who nad been obliged to abandon all their property were to be reinstated in their plundered homes or were they to be succeeded by others who would eveatuauy share the same fate if it were a question of a war or of a prolongel siege the resalt of vhich might be doubtful one could perfectly understand bumane considerations being allowed to prevail in order to save bloodshed but there was no such doubt because it had been stated the other day by the undersecretary for foreign affairs in the otherhouse that under no consideration would anarchy be allowed to prevail in egypt this was an aspect of the question that did not appear to be reassuring hear hear confidence in london was not consoling to thoso who had friends and interests in egypt not only were thousands of these un fortunate refugeescrowding the ports of malta andoyprus but we were told that the consulgeneral in egypt ac tually required the british engineers and workmen the other day to leave their post even at the risk of a water famine at alexandria since patting this question on the paper he had noticed among tho innumerable telegrams vhich wero appearing every day that some provision had been made for some of these unfortunate people in the lazzareto at malta no doubt although it was rather late that would be some alleviation of the distress that wats going on but it was only an alleviation which affected the lowest classes as to the comnmereial and the industrial classes no protection which the british consul could give to their liraperty would be effectual when the owners were obliged to leave the country he did not wish to open a discussion upon the whole of the egyptian question all he desired gas to draw attention to one point the action of our consuls in egypt with the oboject of eliciting from her maestys government some statement which might arrest this terrible exodus which was taking place and which was fraught with such lamentable hardship the consequence of wthich must be to arrest the progress of egyptearl granvillei cau assure my noble friend thatihave not the slightest disposition to complain of his anxious desire to have tbo information be bas asked for nor do i complain of the tone of his speech as regards her majestys government and i am rensible of his desire to avoid embarrassing them in one of the most difficult and complicated situations i ever remember witb regard to one point be referred to the declaration of the prime mlinister in anotber place i can only say that the govern ment are unanimous in adhering to that declaration with regard to the special case of complaint the noble earl has mead that this exodus from egypt has taken place under the pressure and advice of her majestys consuls all i can say is that i really believe that that statement is entirely without foundation we have no information in that sense of any sort or kind on the contrary the information we possess is exactly in the opposite direction i tlhink i may just read sonic extracts i fhd that on june  sir edward mlalet telegraphe from alexandria there is now a panic in cairo and european cmploy arc coming away in large numbers there does not seem to be any valid cause for the panio beyond general feel ing of distrust whioh has gained au europeans on the th inst sir e malet telegraphed  the eastern tele grapli companys clerks havo been to me this morning to say thoy are in fear of their lives and that they must go on board ship i havo done my best to trauquillize them four thousand persons arrived yesterday from cairo hir beaman whom i laft in charge of arobives writes that officers say that strictest orders have been given aad that there is no danger to the lives of euro peans the instructions left by sir e alalat to vice consul borg at cairofor tho consulgeneral was in structed to go with the khedive wherever he wentwere to exactly tho same effect acting under instractious from lord granville i leavo today for alexandria you will remain here in a position of mucb respousiblity but i have confdenco in your calmness of judgment to take the best measures which may be open to you to jiromoto the safety of british snbjects who remain in cairo in case of imminent danger i authorize you in necessarv cases to provide the expense of the removal of families vho cannot afford to pay for themselves at present i should recom mend ismailia or suez as points of embarcation rather than alexandria which is already overcrowded wvith refugees this is perfectly different from encouraging the exodus from my knowledge of sir b ealot  am sure that he has shown great courage and calmness in this matter and i know that every effort has been made by him in tranquillizing the european residents bore are people under a reasonable and natural panic flying away in a state of great destitution and to provide for them in some way is perfectly different from any general eucouragement of panic and flighslord houghton observed that he was in egypt for some time last year and he could strongly conflrm the impressions of the noble earl as to the btate of the country at that time but for this accidental raovement wbetber excited by personal ambition or what was called national feelingthere never would have been any disturbance for aln the evidence they had the people of egypt were he believed as strongly convinced of the utility of the european control as the noble earl himself he was also able to conflrm from personal communications vwbat had been said by the noble earl the secretary of state for foreign alairsthat no eneouragement whatever had been given by the queens official authorities to this un fortunate exodus oin the contrary he knew from one of his own connexians who had remained bravely at hisat and would remain till the last hear bear as weu as from the noble lord the secretary of state that everything bad been done by every person in any degree connected with england to tranquilize the minds of tha european residents even after the horrible tumult which oecurred sat alexandria by which so much hoss of life was caused the noble earl had referred to the terrible condition of the people of egypt and he had not in the least degree exaggerated the state of affairs at the present time they were in a state of social confusion and political difficulty sutch asrarely occurred even in those countries where there were eomplications betveen europeans and orientals and the problem to be solved was one of the most difficult that had been know n during the history of the worldthe miarquis of salisbu y sir edward melet certainly took a sanguine and optimistic view of affairs when he telegraphed to the noble earl tbat there was no valid reason for distrust on the part of thoso in cairo and alexandria i think the noble earl himself took a sounder view of the subject in saying that they wero actuated by a reasonable and natural panic the observa tions made by the noble lord who has just sat down were very interesting and valuab
