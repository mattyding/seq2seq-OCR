queens bench divisionte judge  tag seretp court of london y tincorupoatox of loxdossiuings in banc hfore jtr jtsrtick fl and mrjustice cavejudgment was given in this case argued some days ago wbicb raised the question whether a judge of tbe sheriffs courttho county court of the cityis entitled to extra remuneration either in the way of fees or increase of salary in respect of any extensions of jurisdiction resulting in an increase of business and consequently in an addi tion to the fees of the court or whether he is to be in that respect in the same position as others county court judges the judge was appointed in  nud his appli cation was based upon the provision in the act of  re constituting the court giving the judge nearly half ths of the fees received unless the corperation made an order to pay him by salary as they did assigning him a salary of � a year afterwards by successive additions raised to � a year le adnmtted their right to make such an order but alleged that it was onlv valid as to thie fees then existing  and in sc be raiscea similar claim ou a similar application which however was settled and withdrawn upon certain terms embodied in an order under which his income waa increased to subsequencly raised to � and the corpsra tion were to receive the fees since then however the county court act of  and saeveral other acts as the employers liability act had passed and as he allegel had largely increased the business of the court and the fees received  and he now contended that the original enactment giving him half the fees received in the court extended to all tees received and that these orders were only valid as to fees then receivableand that as no orders had been made assigninghim anyadditious to his salaryin respect of tho new fees he was iiow entitled strictly to aeout half of all the fees received ininus the sums already paid to h m and he acoordingly applied for a mandcamus to the chamberlain who is treasurer of the court to ay him that share of the fees which he claimed under the acts since gthe acts of ls  and  the applica tion wvas opposed by the corporation on an affidavit of sir t nelson their solicitor on the grounds that since  none of the statutes gave the judge any share of the fees and that as to the fees under the previous statutes and any suhsequent statutes the agreement entered into in  operated to preclude any such claimmir c russell qc and mr mclymont wesre for the judge  r webster qc and mr a l smith were for the corporationthe court had taken time to consider their judznent vwhich was now delivered in favour of the corperatioa and dismissing ir lkerrs applicationmr justice field delivered an elaborate judgment at considerable length to that efrect reviewing the history of the court he said in  there wvas an act reconsti tuting it and containing an enactment unusual in its nature as to fees no court could take fees from the suitors umless authorized to do so by parliament  and that act contained a clause authorizing fees to be taken and adding a provision which was the foundation of the lpe sent application the judges of this country in general did not receive any fees from the suitors but were paid by the country this act however containrd a peculiar provision that ths ot the fees should be paid to thu judge of the court but thed there wis a power given to the corporation to reduce the fees  and there was also a provision that the corporation might order that the judge should be paid by salary and that the fees should be paid to the treasurer to the account of the general fund of the court  and under that provision a report of a committeo was adopted by the corporation to pay the judge by a salary of �u a year after tbatthis being in tffect an order mir kerr was eleoted and accepted the office witn a knowledge of it  and ever since then he hal received his salary ana the fees had been received by the treasurer in g equitable jurisdiction was given to the court and thero was an express enactment that the fees taken under that act should be taken in the same way and that the judge should be paid an additional salary to be appointed by the corporation thus adopting the state of things then existing tha judge paid by a salary and tho feas received b the treasurer for the general purposes of the court uijder that act however the corporation appointed tne judge an additional aalary by which he was satised so that no question arises as to the fees inder that act ia g an act passed which tended to increase the business or all county courts and it enacted that it should in clude the city courtand that the same fees shall be taken on all proceed ngs under this act in that court asmaro now given on similar proceedings in the county courts and that the fees shall be applied in the same way as those uuder the act of  under that act mr kerr claimed an addition to his salary and his claim not being acceded to by the corporation he applied for a sacsndeamus aud the writ was granted and on the return the question was argued aud certainly the judges expressed opinions favourable to his contention under that act though there was no formal decision because there was a settlement under which be received an additioa to his salary which satisfed him and the terms of that settlement in  were embodied in an order under which the fees in future were to be paid to the treasurer in the tecantime there was an act extending admiralty jurisdiction to certain of the county courts in seaport towns and of course to the city court and the corporation agreed that whatever should to done by the government as t extra remunera tion to tne county court judges in respect of that exten sion of jurisdiction the corporation would do for the judge of the city court but nothing was done by parliament or the government for the other countycourt judgesbut the corporation granted the judge of the city court an addi tional �p a year in respect of the admiralty jurisdiction then the order oh  provided that as to any extension of jurisdictiou under any  future legislation the judge should be in the same position as the other county court judges and that all fees arising or which may arise irom the jurisdiction of the court shall be paid to the chamberlain as the treasurer of the court to the account of the general fund of the court trhat order was sated uponl and lhad been carried out ever since mr kerr had receiv ed his increased salary of � a year and the fees had been receiveo by tho treasurer and carried to that fund tben in  the debtors act passed which gave some further duties to tho county court judges and among others to the city court judge but it bad ino special reference to the city court and contained no enactment as to fees aud indeed gave no right to fees at all and if it were desirable that the judge of the oity court should receive any addition to his salary in respect of the new busitness uuder that act he would have to make an application to the corporation in whose discretion the ameenament of his salarywas left then came the county courts act  which also had no clause dealing with the remuneration of the jadges orgivig thejudge of the city court any right to receivethen the emnpoyers liability act which gave parties in certain cases a remedy in the county courts which they had not beforeno doubt somewhat increased the busmess but contained no provision as to additional salary or giving the judge any right to fees in the meautime mr kerrs salary bad been increased from � to � and the fees had been with his knowledge paid to the corporation ile had now how ever applied for a saendamus to compel the payment to him of aearly half the fees received in the court for business under those three acts it was contended on the part of the corporation that under the orders of  and  the judges interest in the fees of the court was gone on the par of mr kerr it was insisted that the order of  was not valid as to the future fees at all events  but it was not necessary to decide that because upon other objections he could not coneur in granting thle application mr kerr admitted that he had concurred until iute recently in the arrangement but lie now con tended that in respect of the business unaer the thlree last acts he was entitled to the share of the fees wlhich he urged gave large surplus fund that however did not at all advance the argument especially as the fees were not paid into the general fund of the corporation but to the funds of the court it was desirable moreover that suitors should not be called upon to pay more in fees than such sums as were necessary to secure them ample provi sion for the due administration of justice and as already stated the corporation had power to reduse the fees it was objeeted indeed that the order of  was not valid but time objection was not sariously urged and it appeared that in  and again in  orders were in fact made that the judge should be paid by salary that was recognized by the act of  providing that the judge sbouldhave not fees but an inerease of salary and it was now far too late to contend that there had been no valid order the applicant himself bad certainly believed that there had been such order and it had been acted upon ever sinco by the corporation iupaying him the salary he had received it was objected indeed that such orders wvere contrary to public polioy and no doubt the re muneration of a judge ought not to be the subiect of bargaining the sarary of a judge ought to be suficient to acure nirn a certain social poition and a ba rgain by a person desiring to be the judge that he would accept an mnadequate sum would be certainlyrcontrary to publio polisy but that ws snot this case in the case of the iverpool town clerk cited in support of the application the act gave tbe clerk the ight to the whole of the feesad contractto tsk salary was held toid but sbatasewas very different from the present for bere the legislature gave the odr ration expres powter to pay the judge by salary andlfix the amount there was sothing tberefore in the orders of e and  at all iinimical to public policy it was urged that thebe orders dld not cover fees arising urider new business under sub acy nt atvndthatif they did then tbhy were invalid anc illegal cause it araountedtoabargain th to i ifuture feciles ut the legislature had given the corporation a discretion as to the amount of the judges salary and it was coegetent to him at any time to apply to them for an mereased walary and thore was notbing in these orders to preclude hum from so doing the question raised upon this application was whether he had l right to this share of the fees whieb he claimed and he hiad failed to show any legal right to such share of the fees the acts them selves gave ima no such right the act of  might upon one construction have done so but that was dis posed of by the agreement of  the subsequent acts gave no such right the act of  merely provided that the fees in the city court should be the same as in other county courts there was nothing which gave the judge of that court a right to revive this claim for a share of tho fees he therefore came to the clear conclusion that this application must bo dismisjedbfit tusuc a oy said be quite concurred in this con clusion and had nothing to add to the judgment of his learned brother in which he entirely agreedthe application therefore was refused
