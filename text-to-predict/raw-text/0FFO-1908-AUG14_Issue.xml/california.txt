californiaio ou special comesrondentvacouver serene indifferent of fatethou sittest at the western gatewrote bret harte in his poem san rancisco and many readers have wondered what he meant he meant what he said this sereaity this indifference of the san fran ciscans of the californiansis one of the qualities that mnake them unique among americans there is something of the gaiety of the parisian in it something of the fatalism of the asiatic a little of the recklessness of the western cow boy but california is not part of the west in anything but geographical position one passes through the west to reach california and most travellers are glad enough to leave it behind with its crudities its brutalities its discomforts its lack of all those things which for an educated human being make up the suavities and interests of life i know of no impression in travel quite equal to that obtained when one enters california by the nsual over land route one has passed days in getting over the dreary prairies and the drearier desert one has crossed the rockies so high up that all idea of height and grandeur is lost the train has crawled painfully up the bleak sierras and on reaching the summit has passed through one snowshed after another some of them many miles long and then all at once it seems so quickly is the descent made one drops into that lovely country of sunshine of palms and orange groves of vmineyards and flowersthe sense of aloofness of a country apart increases the longer one stays in california on the surface there is not much difference between the californians and the americans of the east the middle west and the west the people one meets in the streets of san francisco seem rather more cheerful and less obsessed by the spirit of hustle than the people of for instance chicago or cincinnati but the build ings are as ugly as in other american towns the street signs as blatant the hotels as gorgeous and as uncomfortable the newspaper head lines are as big and as ungrammatical as the display heads of the journals of the east while the outlook on the world appears just as parochial and the papers are as full of personali ties of vulgarity of stories of graft thathorrible tendency to suspect the motives of every man which dickens noticed in akmerica is rather more evident in the press of san francisco than in that of other cities of the united states american too is the habit of ignoring the really big things that are being done and of paying a great deal of attention to tlings that are neither remarkable nor particularly admir able for example astonislhing feats have been performed in the reconstruction of san francisco buildings have been put up in six months that in london would take as many years if some of them were put up in london the authorities would make the owners pull them covwn again but that has nothing to do with the point i am making all this is taken quite as a matter of course while i have seen little crowds of citizens gather and look with wonder and admiration ata few square yards of thirdrate asphalt pave i ment just laid in marketstreetit is wvhen ono learns to know the people of california that one realizes the remarkable differences between them and the rest of the inhabitants of the united states the americans never cease to be pained and surprised at the behaviour of a somewlhat large proportion of the distinguished persons from europe who visit the cone to america and are re cicurtesy they are shown the clubs of new york the stockyards of chicagothe miscellaneous architectural effects of washing ton the various activities of other touwns and then they go home and rtite books and articles sbout america that are bitter sarcastic and often inaccurate the americans wvho are just as thinskinned as ever they were cannot under stand it and they ask each other whether it can be that the majority of distinguislhed europeans are illbred boors but ha not the real explanation of this been over looked  i fancy the trutl is that so many travellers go home from the united states carrying vith them a bad impression of the countr a feeling of irritation because to put it bluntly they hae been boredthe trouble vith the average americani is that he is not interesting he is so much of a specialist that he has had no time to attend to those things which to the cultivated euiopean are the things worth talking about he cannot with any confidence discuss books or pictures or music or even international politics he inows the politics of his own country but un fortunately they are so complicated that nobody who has been in theounited states for only a short time can understand them and so thereis not much common ground on which he and the i isitor from europe can meet of course we all i know that some of the most learned and cultivated men in the world live in the united i states i am speaking of the class which in  america corresponds to the aristocratic class in europenow the californian is different it was mr roosevelt i believe who once described california as the greece of amnerica the expression was a happy one and more than happy accurate there is being evolved in california a civilization which is quite unlikel anything else in the united states a civiliza tion as charming in its way as the civilization that must have existed in lesbos when sappho lived the ratio of works written by californians to the population of the state compared with the numbers of copy righted works originating in the other states is amazing surprising also is the number of wellknown literary man and women in new york who were born in california most surprising of all is the quality of the literary and artistic work that is being done in california of which work the rest of america knows very little and europe knows almost nothingthere are various influences that have com bined to produce the civilization wvhich is beginning to express itself in california in the first place i suppose must be put the perfect elimate of the country and its beauty the blue pacific on the one side the wonderful mountains on the other and between them a land as fair as any in the world added to this there is the quality of romance without which to many persons scenery however beautiful is mean ingless even tiresome the spaniards have gone but they left behind them legends and traditions beautiful names for mountains and bays and towns and the mission style of architecture which the architects of today are adapting to modern requirements those picturesque old missions of adobe dotted all over the country from monterey to san diego have inspired many  poem and painting and have indeed provided a keynote for the art of the californians consider also the influences of names would san francisco have been the same had it been called smithville  would santa barbara be so delightful were it known asjonestownbythesea   then again san francisco is a gateway to the orient and just as the arts of venice were coloured and glorified by the citys traffic with persia and india so the arts of california are tinctured by some note of dreamy gorgeousness that has come from the far east one finds it in the poetry of george sterling in the paintings of diclmnan and wores in the remarkable embroidery and jewelry and metal work that two or three san francisco women are producing in music the work being done in california is being influenced erom a strange source i wonder how many europeans know anything of the music of the hawaiiansthose haunting exquisite melodies that seem like the farewell of a dying racea centre of the cultivation of california is thecelebrated bohpmian club of san fcrancicit is i suppose one of the halfdozen best known clubs in the world mr kipling has described it so any description here would be superfluous the central event of the year for the members of the bohemian club is the  summer jinks which are held in a wonderful grove in the country the property of the club the performance given on these occasions is like nothing else in the world it is not a play not an opera in the ordinary sense but a kind of mystery play set to music with setting of the most elaborate character months are spent every year in preparing the performance and the author and the composer are always mem bers of the bohemian club receiving no pecuniary compensation for their work which in many cases has been of a very high order this fact serves to remind one that essentially the californian civilization is a plutocratic civilizationa plutocratic civiliza tion that is beginning to justify itself the struggling genius is rare the poet or painter or musician usually has money or knows where he can get it i thought i had found a pathetic case when a girl begged me for advice in regard to getting her work into the magazines the next time i saw her was in her home where seated at a louis xv escritoire she was engaged in writing chequesa large number of the californian poets and painters have summer homes at monterey a beautiful old spanish town three or four hours railway journey from san francisco others live at burlingame while still others have ranches in the interior of the state but al make frequent trips to their beloved bohemian club and as soon as they get there find out what the latest excuse is for arranging a dinner of the members when for instance the safe deposit and trist company went under recently carrying with it a good many millions in deposits there was a  hardluck  dinner at the club the room wvas illuminated by candles stuck in bottles and the table decorations con sisted of carrots and turnips but i noticed that there was nothing the matter with the quality or quantity of the champagne neither did the financial disaster affect the speeches which were up to the usual brilliant standard of the club mir kipling by the way must have been unfortunate in the bohemian club dinner which he attended for the  spreadeagle  type of speech is very rare at the club and when it is heard is usually laughed at perhaps they got up a special programme for ir kiplings benefitit is a new and brilliant and graceful cultiva tion that the californians are developing of course they share some of the faults of the rest of the americans chief among these being the lack of civic spirit which has permitted crimi nals like ruef and schmitz to exploit san francisco but even in this connexion there are encouraging signs for surely it is encouraging when men lile mir rudolph spreckels and mr james d phelan are willing to brave violent abuse in battling for the right i quoted bret harte at tho beginning of this letter the poem from wvhich the lines were taken was written  years ago but even then the poet dreamed of the time to be whenall fiulfilled the vision wewho watch nnd wait shall never sec who in the morning of her racetoiled fair or meanly in our placecalifornia geographically and so far as climate is concerned is only one of the chain of states which extend along the western coast of this continent there may be a little more rain in the nortlh but with that exception thera is practically no difference in climate between san francisco portland seattle and bellinaham even here in vancouver an overcoat in the vinter is a superfluity what i have said about cali fornia wvill i believe apply in the future to oregon and washington they are affected by the sarne influences they are marked off geographically from the rest of the united states and in time i think the pacific coast will develop a new civilization which will be a finer more complete more briuiant more wvholesome civilization tllan that of eastern america i
