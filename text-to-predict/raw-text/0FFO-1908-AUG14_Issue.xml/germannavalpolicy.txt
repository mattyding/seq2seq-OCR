german naval policyfrom ouir eblin corbespondentan article contributed to the tag five months ago by the retired councillor of legatiop herr vom rath bore interesting testimony to the nature of the calculations upon which german naval policy and the agitation of the german navy league had so far been based the material portions of this article which was reproduced in the times on march  set forth that german naval policy and the agitation which was at its service were founded upon the view that germany only required to build a certain numbei of battle ships in order to put an end to her present inferiority as regards england or at least so to modify that inferiority that a struggle if it took place would not be hopeless it was the gospel of the naval enthusiasts that england under a liberal governmnent would in view of the demands of her social policy refrain from build ing a larger number of ships and even might build fewer it was calculated that when the coniservatives returned to office germany would already have obtained a lead which it would be difficult for england to recoveras recent utterances in the german press have showvn sections of public opinion in this country are beginning to appreciate the fact that the seem ingly  arbitrary  standard which has been set up for the british navy is dictated by welldefined considerations prompted by these utterances herr vom rath now returns to the subject in a second article in the tag and points out that the last parliamentary session in england has plainly shown the determination of the british people at all costs to maintain the twopower standard for the navy in his opinion it would be vilfully to ignore selfevident facts for germany to close her eyes to the attitude of the british nation towvards this vital questionherr vom rath then proceeds to draw attention to the existenle of a school of naval critics in this country who contend that the purely defensive objects which german naval policy professes to have in view would best be served by the curtailment of the present battleship pro gramme and by a corresponding development of the torpedo and submarine arms of the service and later also of the aerial branch of defensive preparations he contends that in present con ditions the rivalry in battleship programmes is not only ruinous but that in the case of germany it creates an impression abroad which is contrary to the professed intentions of her policy he believes that the german government is anxious that relations with england should be improved but on the other hand he apprehends that so long as the rivalry in battleship programmes continues people in england will never abandon the suspicion that notwithstanding all german assurances to the contrary the german pro gramme implies latent designs of aggiession nevertheless he is convinced that the temper of the british people is not irreconcilably unfriendly to germany but that the public in england is merely animated by mistrust and by the suspicion that an attempt may some day be made to realize the  projects of attaclks upon england and the ambitious ideas of weltpolitik which are not infrequently propounded in this country upon these grounds quite apart from considerations of technical and strategie ex pediencyhe recommends thosewho are responsible for german naval policy to make every prepara tion which is necessary for coast defence and for guerilla naval warfare but to facilitate an under standing with england by abandoning the development of the battleship programme herr vom rath incidentally joins issue with count reventlow a retired captain of the german navy and a competent authority on naval questions who regards aspirations to arrive at an understanding with england as  sentimental and who advocates the maintenance of the present battleship programme count reventlow admits that in certain quarters in this country there is a current of feeling against the naval policy of the government but he maintains that this tendency has failed to gain the support of any important section of the population herr vom rath for his part contends that the reason why this opposition does not assert itself more appreciably is because  nearly every newspaper of any consequence is careful to avoid giving room to this school of naval critics for the expression of their views every opponent of attempts to carry the battleship principle to extremes has had to submit to this experienceit remains to be seen what impression vill be created by this second attempt to present the case against an unlimited battleship programme for the german navy the publication of herr vom raths flrst article was made the excuse for violent attacks upon the author on the part of the  national  sections of the press upon this occasion however his critics are lilkely to find it less easy to answer his contention that if great britain is determined to maintain the two power standard the mere increase in the number of german battleships wiu not as the naval enthusiasts have always argued mean a corre sponding increase of germanys naval strength as compared with englandthese discussions may be contemplated with interested but impartial equanimity since the german government and to some extent the german public are adequately acquainted vith the attitude of great britain and of the british people towards the question of maintaining the twopower standard for the british navy the need of the moment is that the unalterable character of this determination on the part of england should become more generally recog nized in this country but a process of this kind must necessarily be gradual and its further development will be followed with attention
