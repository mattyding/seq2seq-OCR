the breakigup op the poorlawilfbom a correspondtin a letter to te timee of wednesday lord george hamilton the chairman of the poor law commission referring to the first article on  the brealdngnp of the poor law published on the previous day says that  the writer forecasts the intention and action of the commission and  does so without sanction or authority au that need be said on this point is that the description in lord george hamiltons letter of the scheme set forth in the article is lord georges own and that thewariter has not claimed official sanction or authority for what he has written at the outset of the article it was remarked that it is not unlikely to be found when the report of the royal commission is issued that what is called the breakingup principle has recommended itself to many if not to most of the commissioners the sub stance of what is involved in the scheme was then given shortly stated it means the transfer of the children the sick and infirm and the aged from the control of boards of guardians to the care of committees of the county or county borough coumcils which are doing similar work provision for the adult ablebodied by a separate committee of the county or county borough authority and on national lines and the disappearance of boards of guardians it may be added that the machinery of the new poor law will perhaps take the form described in the present article and in the third and concluding articlethie new organizationin the framing of the new organization the award of outdoor relief wiu have to be taken into account in order that it may be granted consistently with the maintenance of the family unit such questions as the law of settlement and parental liability must be brought into viow and if the law on these matters is not to be entirely repealed means will have to be devised for enforcing it then again there is every desire to increase the interest of charitable agencies in the welfare of the poor who will come within the scope of the reformed law in past years these agencies have done splendid work notwithstanding the limitations put upon their operations by many boards of guardians they have helped large numbers of persons on the verge of pauperism to preserve their inde pendence and in this way they have not only rendered ood social service to the community but have been the means of relieving the rates of the cost of many cases which without their assistance must have fallen upon them there can be no question about giving these agencies an important place in the new machinery further whatever changes may be made we cannot hope to alter the condition of things unmder which cases of sudden and urgent necessity must arise the public health committee or the education committee may fail to discover cases in which they are respectively interested and there will stiu be families of tramps up and down the country such matters seem to require the provision of centres to which persons can apply for relief and an organization for reporting casesit is thought that au these reqnirements may be met by the establishment in each county or county borough of a court of relief to be held by a judicial officer a receiving house and a chari table aid committee possessing certain statu tory authoritythe oourt of reliefit has been pointed out that under the scheme already sketched the public health authorities could be charged with the care of the sick and infirm and the aged and the education autho rity with the care of the children and that pro vision would have to be made for the families of the ablebodied who might be treated in the manner already indicated but as the duties of these committees would be confined to the classes named it is proposed that the courts of relief should be quite independent of either of themandshould be held for the purpose of provid ing for outdoor relief and other cases which are outside these classes one or more stipendiary officers of high position with special economic and judicial training might be required in each county or county borough the judicial officer would hold a court daily in some part of his dis trict for various purposes and would visit the receiving house once a weel he would have under his control a staff of officers whose duty it would be to investigate cases he would have power to insist on all necessary economic condi tions and upon the evidence before him he would decide as to the treatment which the applicant for relief should receivewhether outdoor relief should be granted to a family or whether an applicant should be placed in the care of the education committee the health committee or the separate authority dealing with the ablebodied the judicial officer would also decide such questions as settlement removal and chargeabilityin the framing of machinery for the working of this scheme it is assumed that although it is not possible to abolish all outdoor relief its eleemosynary character should be got rid ofthe judicial officer in dealing with a case of outdoor relief would not arrive at his decision by consulting the wishes of the person to be relieved the request for such relief would be made by one of the committees except in very special cases and the judicial officer would order the curative treatment he might think best for the particular case before hirm he might be influenced by the education committee whose officer had ascertained that the moral atmo sphere of the home was unfit for the children whose case he was dealing with and who would like to havle them sent to one of their residential homes in another case the health committee might appeal to him to grant outdoor relief to a family whose breadwinner was sick and required openair or other treatment or his own officers in a third case might have ascertained that a person for whom outdoor relief was asked was anything but destitute strict and constant supervision and inspection of every case ordered for domiciliary treatment would be carried out by the officers of the committee responsible for the application the judicial officer might refuse to grant outdoor relief in which case aecommodation would be offered the family not in  the house as is now done but in the several institutions thus the sick father might go to the sanatorium provided by the health committee the mother into the training home for unemployed ablebodied women and the children to the residential schools power might be given to the judicial officer to order outdoor relief against the strict rules governmg it in such a case as the overcrowding of an insti tution but the local government board would be informed in each instance there might also be an appeal to the board by any of the com mittees against the decisions of the judicial officer not only in matters relating to outdoor relief but on sulch questions as settlement and chargeability the individual for whom relief was asked would have no right of appeal to the board in the event of an midividual refusing to accept relief in any of the institutions he would be left to do his best on hisown responsibility unless it was found that a person by so doing became a danger to himself or to the public when the health committee or the edueation authority would interfere and bring such cases before the judicial officer of relief who could be entrusted with compulsory powers of removalstricr adastrationit has often been pointed out in the times reviews of poor law operations that our exist ing methods of granting ortdoer relief have led to the growth of pauperism lax administra tion has helped to pile up pauper figures which have not represented the actual state of desthor deapee onandost iiftitution in auio this hassbeen proved over and over again by comparing tho state of things in an ably managed union with that in a union where the guardians refuse to adopt i right methods and where the social condition of the population is similar administration which produces these results is neither humane nor just to the ratepayers many of whom among thelabouring classes have a greatstruggle to make two ends meet and at the same time to preserve their independence there is very little hope of any improvement of administation in this direction under the existing system and one of the principal objects aimed at in the proposed establishment of courts of relief with their judicial officers is to secure a high degree of vigilance in excluding those who ought not to be relieved at all or who ought to be offered other forms of reliefall experience of poor law administration goes to show that proper supervision and adequate inquiry cannot be effectively carried out by such bodies as our present boards of guardians there are no doubt large numers of members of these boards who have full knoowledge of poor law matters and of economic conditions and right views as to the application of the law but as a rule they are in a minority and unable to make their voice heard or in consequence of tho peculiar influences at work during elections for boards of guardians they fail to secure reelection to those boards the remedy would appear to be an entirely new order of things rather than a patching up and a renaming of the existing authorities that which happens in the present administration of outdoor relief also takes placo in the matter of enforcing chargeability on relations of paupers year after year it has been seen that the law on this subject has been almost a dead letter for the guardians decline to enforce it with the result that the amounts recovered from persons liable for the maintenance of relatives bave been extremely small all experienced poor law administrators agree that cases must be dealt with in accordance with rigid rules the method of treating cases on their merits as is now done by boards of guardians is un reservedly condemned because it leads to relaxation of the testbut so long as there is a local body charged with the administration of all poor law relief there will always be variety of treatment through out the country and outdoor relief will be granted not by strict rule but according to  the merits  of a case and to the views of the majority present the character of which may change from time to time on the other hand national uniformity may be secured by the appoint ment of judicial officers and the formation of courts of relief as already described these courts would operate very much in the fohowing way it might be found that the children of a widow were suffering from inanition arrange ments would have to be made by the education committee either for the children to be  boarded out  or to be placed in a residential school or for an application for outdoor relief the officer of the committee having made inquiries would represent to the judicial oficer in the court of relief that the mother had been found to be a worthy woman who had done her beat for her children so far as her means permittcd the oficer of the public health committee would be informed of the case and would visit the home and he might state to the judicial offlcer that he had found it sanitary the officer of the unemployment authority also having had notice would say whether the woman could be found fau employment for wages the judicial officer would have his own staff to investigate the economic circumstances of the case and being thus fally informed he would decide whether the case came within the rules for outdoor relief and if so how much should be granted he would also say whether or not any person or local authority was by lav chargeable with the cost if be decided that outdoor relief was inadmissible under the r ules the family wouild have to be given treatment in the institutions of the committees con cerned with the caseit is suggested that under a svstem of this kind there would be no lax administration of outdoor rolief the alternative of admission to the appro priate specialized institution would always be open upon such conditions of chargeability and payment as might be fixed and the ratepayers through their elected representatives on the committees of the county or countv borough councils would have the management of all these institutions and of the treatment of the poor in them subject to some small measure of control on the part of the local government board it may appear at fiist sight that the inquiries indicated are too elaborate and that a great many officers would be employed in a single case but a comparison of the plan vith the existing system shows that the number of officers would not be greater than the number now employed in a case in a populous and well organized union at present however a great deal of the investigation made is use less because the outdoor relief committees of boards of guardians so very often fail to give heed to the results of inquiries to test eligi bility and to force chargeability and it is suig gested that a stringent system of testing eligibility for outdoor relief and of discovering and enforcing chargeability is impossible without distributing the several distinct services which are now grouped under boards of guardians among the several authorities of the county and county borough councils already charged with those services for the community at large
