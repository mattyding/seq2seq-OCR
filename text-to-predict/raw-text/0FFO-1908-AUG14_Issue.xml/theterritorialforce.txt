te territorial forcesir ian hmailton on the fild dayfro oun special corimspolentsalisbury plain aug gen sir ian hamilton in the course of his remwrks on the field day of yesterday has pointed otit that the general and special ideas were framed with the intention that the various stages of the attack should be clearly defined and more especially that the final fire position should be well established before any attempt was made to carry any selected point by weighty and wellprepared assault in this particular however his hopes were not realized the last stage of the advance was hurried and several premature and ineffective assaults were made by bodies of troops possessing neither sufficient depth nor momentulm for such a purpose he pointed out that in war similar liberties cannot be taken with a stronglyhold defensive position and that the closest cooperation of the troops in the final fire position with the troops destined for the assault is essential in the last stages of the attackwith the earlier portion of the advance how ever he had not much fault to find the cohesion and cooperation shown in this part of the operations were indeed greater than could have been expected sir ian hamilton thought that the territorial infantry were highly tried but came out of the ordeal on the whole very well though needless to say there were faults in some cases companies descended into valleys without first securing the high ground on the far side again companies were observed to lose direction although the widening gap on one of their flanks should have shown them that something was wrong again infantry scouts surprised by cavalry must stand their ground and fire instead of moving rapidly to the rearsir ian hamilton added that finauy he would like every one to know that wellwishers of the territorial army have been anxious about the operations which are now over it had been irnpressed on huim by many that it would be desirable in order to ensure success to have a set piece for the battle with a careful rehearsal beforehand he had also been advised to intioduce a few regular drivers and noncom missioned officers into the ranks of the terri torial artillery and to let a regular royal engineer officer assist in building the bridge over the avon but to all these suggestions he had turned a deaf ear and yesterday the terri torial troops had to sink or swim on their own merits as far as his opinion went however he was glad to be able to tell them that they had done remarkably well in acknowledging at the same time the good work put in by all ranks of the regulars he paid a high compli ment to brigadiergen allenbys cavalryrecognition of territorial unitsthe following is the th list of units which have beer reported as having attested at least  per ccat

tho process however by which this standard is to be attained is entailing a gret deal oi hard work upon ofiicers and men during the past five days tho column has been providing supply and transport for the infnntrv brigade in order to apportion this duty fairly the company serving the brigade has beon changed every alternate dav on every second day thereforo the entire belongings of the company for duty have been transferred to a new site and the retiring company bas returned with all its impedi mcnta to the old camping ground thus on every second day the tents of one company aro struck and with tho tent floorings bedding andother camp equipment pneked into wagons and tralsported a distance of less than half a mile this frequent transportation although heavy work has commended itself to

desired and omphasizes the need for the physical training which forms the secondary object of the camptheir progress in shooting is however very marked this is largely accounted for by the preliminary training they have undergono with small rifles on short ranas connected with the schools an instance of the ease with which the transition from short to service rifle is mado was seen yesterday when a little feilow seareely  yeals of age from the sir john cam sehool handling a service ride for the first time in his lifo made  points with three shots at  yards three shots per day at this range is the limit for beginners though more ex perienced boys are allowed five while the really promis mg lads have the fuol allowance of seven ordi narily the novices spend a portion of the morning with the miniature rifle at tre revolver ranges and in the after noon are transferred to tho  yards firing point the transference merely accustoms the boys to a wveapon of heavier calibre and is accomplished without any percep tibl deterioration i the shooting one typical squad of  boys firing with the short rifle at  yards yesterday averaged  points of a possible  at  yards with the service weapon the
