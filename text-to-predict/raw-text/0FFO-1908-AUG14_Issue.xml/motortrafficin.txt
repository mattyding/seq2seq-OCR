motor traffic in the cityfront a n nr v r londoners who make use of motoromnibuses no less than those who despise this particular for m of locomotion will be glad to know that the campaign against the noisy and dangerous motor traffic in the city which led recently to the hold ing of a mansionhonse meeting and the sending of a deputation to the home secretary is not to be allowed to lapse as was indicated in the letter from the lord mayor and other members of the deputation which appeared in the times yestelday those who are interested in the move ment intend to continue working steadily for the object which they have in viewthe introduction of legislation dealing with the matter it is hoped that when the holidays are over the lord mayor ll be asked to summon a conference of local authorities to consider the best methods by which reform can be secured in all probability the result of the conference wiu be that mlr balfour as the senior member for the city will be invited to introduce a bill into parliamentwhen the deputation from the mansionhouse meeting waited upon the home secretary just a month ago sir john runtz proposed that mr gladstone should pay a visit to the city in order to see for himself what the state of the traffic is it is not recorded whether or not mr gladstone acted upon the suggestion if he did he would not need to spend more than an hour or two within the city boundaries in order to realize that the evils of which the deputation spoke were very real ones and that they had not been in any way exaggerated if mr gladstone had boarded a motoromnibus at templebar as i did yester daty he would have had immediate experience of some of the points upon which complaints are rife as the omnibus approached there came from the innermost parts of its mechanism a weird moan inug which rising swiftly to a crescendo was eminently calculated to upset the nerves of any intending passenger immediately i reached the platform of the vehicle my nostrils were saluted with a warm pungent odour decidedly nauseating and as i climbed the steps i appeared to be plunging upwards through an invisible cloud of heated vapour safely seated on the top of the omnibus i realized that the noisy clatter of the vehicle and the very serious vibration would render the journey anything but a pleasant one so it proved the noise and the smell and the vibration continued all the way to liverpool street and it was obvious from the evidence of ones ears and nose that this particular omnibus was not by any means of an exceptional character we encountered  other omnibuses and every one of them passed us with a prodigious rumbling and rattling the  motorcabs which were met with were not nearly so noisy though they gave decided warning of their approach we overtook nothing that was not drawn by horsesthe drivers of the other motor vehicles in front of us took care of that on the other hand we were not overhauled by anything from the rear it must be said in justice to the driver that the speed was not excessive and that the cumbrous vehicle was guided through the streets with care only once on the route was anything like racing observed it was near st pauls and the offenderstwo omnibuses wproceeding westwards could not resist the temptation afforded by an open stretch of roadway twice the street was almost entirely obscured by vapour but on one of these occasions the nuisance was caused by a private motorcarit is in the open space between the mansion house and the bank however that one is most forcibly impressed with the seriousness of the problem of the citys traffic this has long been an exceedingly busy and a decidedly dangerous corner since the advent of the notorcars it is busier than ever and one fears andoubtedly more dangerous in walking along any of the thoroughfares leading into this open space one realizes that another complaint of the city man is only too wellfounded the atmo sphere of these narrow streets is poisoned by the fumes from the motor traffic there is no escape from the abominable smell and until one becomes inured to it bv long experience it produces a slight feeling of nausea usually followed by a headache is it one wonders in selfdefence that most of the men in the city streets smoke incessantly  perhaps it is not  quite correct bytheby to write of the stenches that emanate from the motors in the singular number they are not so variegated as are the smells of cologne but there are two distinet varieties of petrol odour one is bitter and rcrid the other is sweet and cloying they are both exceedingly unpleasant and one would imagine equauy harmfulnext to the allpervading smell of petrol in the centre of the city the most striking thing is the noise caused by the motor traffic and more par ticularly by the motoromnibuses i do not speak of the horns and bells and gongs of au descrip ties which are sounded to warn footpassengers of the coming danger these are not really needed by the omnibuses for it is impossible to remain ignorant of their approach at a distance of many yards the tall heavy coaches with their immense stacks of machinery pass and repass with a bang and a roar and a rattle that must be distracting to the men who are trying to work in city offices it is difflcult to analyse the noise dr noises sometimes one is reminded of a movwing machine being dragged along by stampeding horses at other times there is a suspicious resemblance to the roar of artillery or again one may almost imagine that the cold winters wvind is roaring amid the chimney pots so the omnibuses pass on their way as for speed there is not much to complain about in the heart of the city this is explained by the fact that there are so many omnibuses and cabs and vehicles of all descriptions trying to force their way through the streets that anything beyonda walking pace is impossible here again is a source of danger the traffic is so involved so elaborately interwoven in a sort of moving mosaic that the unhappy footpassengers can only intersect it at the risk of life or limb to walk from the royal exchange flags to the corner of queen victoriastreet in the middle of the day demands considerable courage and the utmost activity and this in spite of the fact that there are a dozen policemen engaged in handling the eight streams of traffic which converge at this pointto stand in the shelter of the mansionhouse and watch the moving mass is a fascinating occupa tion yesterday i counted the motor vehicles which passed in both directions during ten minutes in the middle of the day and again during ten minutes in the early evening in the first period  motoromnibuses and  motorcabs or cars went by at one moment there were fonr omnibuses abreast in front of the mansion house at another a bunch of six utterly blocked the roadway there were only two brief intervals during which the road was clear in the second period the traffic was heavier omnibuses and  other motor vehicles this time the road was never unobstructed for an instant in these figures of course no account is taken of horsedrawn vehicles which were perhaps as numerous as those driven by petrolwith motor vehicles passing the bank at busy times of the day at the rate of  or  an hour filling the streets vith noipe and dust and vapour and rendering the roadways almost impassable the ease for a reform of the conditions under which traffic is carried on in the city would appear to be unanswerable there is astrong feeling among those who have studied the question that parliament ought to confer upon the city corporation and upon other local authorities the right to prescribe the routes alolng which omnibuses shall proceed if tbis were done the motoromnibus nuisance in the city at any rate could be remedied to a con siderable extent streets like old broadstreet cornhi and threadneedlestreet in which two motoromnibuses of the present type can scarcely pass ought it is urged to be freed from these invasions the speed question of course would have to be dealt with for once out of the tortuous city streets the motordriver does un donbtedly travel very often at a dangerous pace the matters of noise dust fumes and oil dropping also mut not be overlooked so far at jeast as the extension of existing powers forsuppressing these minor nuisances is cooerned there is also a proposal that the size of the omnibulses shall be restricted but this is a matter which may perhaps right itself as the companies concerned in the traffic learn wisdom by experience
