 death of the master ofst johnswe regret to annouace the sudden death from apoplexy at nuremberg on wednesday night of dr charles taylor the learned master of st jtohns college cambridgethe rev charles taylor did lld was born in  and was educated at klins college school london he proceeded in due course to st johns college cambridge where he graduated in  with good allround honours ahieving his chief distinction subsequently in theology he was ninth wrangler in the mathe maticaltripos andwas placed low down in the second class of the classical tripos whenjebb graves of st johns and henry jackson now professor of greek and holder of the order of merit were senior second and third classics in  mir taylor sat for the theological exrani nation for middle bachelors and obtained a first class with distinction in hebrew he follcwed this up by winning the tyrwhitt hebrew scholar ship in  dr sinker for many years librarian of trinity taking the second and by being bracketed for the crosse theological scholar ship the kaye divinity prize which is offered only every four years fell to him in in  he was elected to a fellowship at st johns and was soon made use of as a college lecturer he was ordained deacon in  and priest in  on the title of his fellowship by dr hlarold browne bishop of ely in due course he was appointed tutor after that through various circumstances his rise was very rapid and in  when the long reign of the great dr bateson came to a close charles taylor found himself master of st johns college well within  years from his first tripos the choice occasioned no little surprise and there are men still surviving who might par donably conceive that they had at least equal claims but dr taylors contributions to learning followed consistantly upon two lines mathematics especially geometrical conics and divinity especially rabbinic and new testa ment literature the year after he took his degree he published a textbook of geometrical conics and from the year of his degree  to the year of his vicechancelorship  he was editor of the  messenger of mathematics issuing also in  an introduction to the ancient and mlodern geometry of conics with fhistorical notes and prolegomena his  ele mnentary geometry of conics which appeared in  went through seven editions and was reissued with a chapter on inventio orhium in  he was also the author of the article on geometrical continuity in the  encyclopedia britannicabut it was his biblical studies which brought him fame and justified his receiving the dd degree when he became master on other grounds than the mere jus dignitatis procuring him also the lld degree of harvard university in  he began with a study of the quotations from the old testament in the new called  the gospel in the law published in  which is still a reference hook upon an inexhaustible subject then came his work on the last chapter of eccle siastes entitled  the dirge of coheleth in  but though other admirable work followed his chief contribution to modem biblical research was due to his rabbinical investiga tions in which he took counsel with that learned hebrew and most quaint figure the late dr schillerszinessy and subsequently with dr schechter taylors  sayings of the jewish fathers first published in  and usually cited as  pirke aboth has become a classic it was reissued in  wvith a cairo fragment of  aquila and the master wrote an appendix to it in  he was particularly interested in the examination of those docu mentary finds which have come to us in recent times from various parts of the east such as the didache on which he lectured at the royal institution in s and the oxy rhynchus logia along with dr schechter he edited ecclesiasticus from the cairo genizah manuscripts in  and the list may close with an important monograph on the pastor of hermas in two volumes  of course he was an occasional contributor to technical publications such as the  journal of philo logy  and the  journal of theological studies but he kept himself rigorously within the severe limits he had set for his studies in sacred philology and would only step aside in order to discover say in piers plowman a phrase such as desudae eleemosyne in manu tua whieh he had been laboriously tracing upward from some tinicanonical sourceit is some way from such pursuits on the part of a not very communicative baehelor to successin a great public office like the master ship of st johns dr taylor was not of those who shine in society but he proved him self a businesslike if not brilliant master a hospitable vicechancellor in whose term of office occurred the celebration of queen vic torias first jubilee and as a borough alderman a useful link between town and university a certain shyness of manner made it not very easy for him to be popular with all his under graduates and it was sometimes whispered that when he had the lady margaret oarsmen to breakfast he was wont to amuse them with paliupsests afterwards a man of sturdy and even bulky physique he nevertheless had some considerable climbs to his credit and wrote for the alpine journal  a record of a notable ascent of monte rosa from macugnaga in a few months ago dr taylor was married at the church of his friend and fellowjohnian the archdeacon of middlesex to miss margaret dillon daughter of the hon conrad dillon for whom much sympathy will be felt in her early and sudden bereavement
