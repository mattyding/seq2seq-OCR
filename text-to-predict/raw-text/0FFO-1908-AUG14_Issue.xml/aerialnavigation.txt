aerial navigationmiha to the wright aeboplanfrom our conwpoqdentpawis aug a slight accident to mr wilbur wrights aeroplane this morning win interrupt his experi ments for the rest of the week ho took a magnifecent light of abotlt ten kllomtres this morning in min see at a height of about mt making the eircuit of the racecourse seven times and coming down with his habitual facility a few minutes later he decided to make another trial on his second round after being in the air a little more than two minutes at a height of about ft he decided to come down and descended to within ft of the ground in seek ing to avoid landing in a ditch he tried to swerve his machine to the left but made a false move ment with one of the levers so that instead of turning in the desired direction he went to the right forcing the whole aeroplane into an oblique position which drove one of the wings violently against the ground breaking its frame mr wright then got down and reassured with a smile the persons who had rushed to help him it was found that the damage consisted in a rent in the cloth of the left wing and the cracking of the frame the motor the rudders and the pro pellers were uninjured mr wright took his machine back to the shed for repairs it will be necessary to make an entirely new wooden frame work for the broken wing an operation which will take until monday or tuesdaythe flights describedm franvois peyrey who is an expert in aerial navigation in france and who had the good fortuno to witness the first flights of mr wilbur wright at the hunaudibres racecourse near le mans has given me the following authoritative statement of the result of those experimentsthese experiments were really remarkable they proved over and over again that wilbur and orville wright have long mastered the art of artificial flight they are the public justification of the performances which the american aviators announced in  and  and they give them conclusively the first place in the history of fly ing machines that rightly belongs to them it was at nightfall on august s that i saw wilbur wright make his frst flight he had made no flights for some months and yet his first experi ment began with the most delicate of all man cenvres in aviationnamely circling he rose forthwith to a height of about ft and the spectacle was marvellous and delightful we beheld the great white bird soar above the race course pass over and beyond the trees from its shed to the winningpost of the course we were able to follow easily oach movement of the pilot note his extraordinary proficienev in the flying business perceive the curious warping of the wings in the process of circling and the shifting position of the rndders when after imin sec of flight wright again touched the ground descending with extraordinary buovancy and precision while cheers arose from the crowd in the tribune i saw the man who is said to be so unemotional turn pale he had long suffered in silence he was conscious that the world no longer doubted his achievements on the follow ing days wilbur wright eontinued his enercises in order to fulfil the conditions imposed upon him by the weiller syndicate as is well known this group intends to purchase the right of construct ing and selling the wright type of aeroplane in france and the french colonies for the sum of f zc by his contract wilbur wright must take twvo flights each of them over a course of more than  kilometres in an average breeze and at a few days interval the aeroplane must carry two persons and enough fuel for a jouirney of  kilomotres in order to attain this result wright declares that he must be allowed to go into methodical training the machine which he used in america withi his brother had four levers controlling the various steering and balancing arrangements in france wilbur wright has had to alter this system and his present aeroplane has only twvo levers he must thus acquire the habit of fresh instinctive move ments he is daily making progress in this respect on august  he succeeded in describing a figure  in the air in lmin see on the th he went three times round the racecourse in min see and on the th six times round in min sec the wright aeroplane is what is ealled a bi plane the surfaces of wvhich are parallel exactly one above the other and slightly concave on the lower surface they are made of cloth stretched on a framework of spruce they are x metres long and two metres wide giving a total area of  square metres the distance between the planes is  s motre in front is a horizontal bi plane rudder for regulating the height of flight at the back a vertical biplane rudder for steer ing the total length of the machine is ten metres between the planes is a fourcylinder watercooled hp motor designed by the brothers wright on its right is a radiator with flat copper abes and on its left sit the pilot and passenger the motor drives two wooden pro pellers   metres in diameter by means of crossed chains the propellers revolve in opposite directions and are geared down in the ratio of  to  the total weight of the aero plane with one man on board is  kilogrammes the motor in working order weighs  kilogrammes the method of operation seems very simple the most interesting feature consists in the vorling  of the extreme under part of the wings whereby the flight of a bird is imitated and perfect lateral stability is secured the rudder which regulates the horizontal balance has to be used almost continually bnt as in the case of a bicyclist the movements necessary to maintain equilibrium probably soon become instinctive in order to make a flight a wooden ail about ft long was laid on the ground the aeroplane rests upon wooden skates and has two rollers in front oh the rail runs a little car upon which the aeroplane rests and the rollers on the rail when the screws begin to revolve the bird flies rapidly along the rail and at its extremity rises into the air by the help of the horizontal rudder when there is a vind the rail alone is suifficient in calm weather the aeroplane is launched as by a catapult by means of a weeight of  kilo grammes which falls from the top of a pillar ft high and pulls upon ropes passing through pulleys mr wright has realized the most delicate problem of aviationnamely the question of balance to behold this flying machine turn sharp round at the edge of the wood at a height of ft and continue on its course is an en chanting spectacle the wind does not seem to trouble him wright having flown in fairly stiff breezes in a word the wright brothers are the first men who have succeeded in imitating birds to deny it would be childishcaptain baldwins ballooneromou  conespoxdentwashington aug an unfortunate series of petty accidents pre vented captain baldwin from fulfiing the official speed reguirements for his steerable balloon this evening he started at sundown with a slight fitful sidewind a cylinder wire of the motor broke during the first five minutes and in making attempts to mend it the engineer was obliged to negiect working the planes which regulate the level of the flight the result wasthat the balloon undulated considerably and the speed was rtarded the outward two and a half miles weremade at the rate of only  miles an hour on the return lap when one and a quarter miles from home another mishap occurred a secondary wire leading to the timer broke and captain baldwin was obliged to descend vibration was the cause of this break as the wire was the only one without a link connemionlater captain baldwin resisrned to fort meyer at the rate of  rniles an hour hehas still two chances of qualifying and he is sanguine that he will succeed as the iaults in tho motorwbich caused this evenings failure can be oasiy iremedied
