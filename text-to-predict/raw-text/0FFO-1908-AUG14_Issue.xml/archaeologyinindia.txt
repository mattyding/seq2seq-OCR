archology in inda ivexploration and researchernom a cobbjpolidehmwhile the work of conservation is as i have shown being actively carried out all over india i found that exploration was by no means in abeyance when i visited dr bloch the archaologist of the bengal circle at rajgir i found he had lately completed some interest ing excavations in this remote region where ancient buddhist remains stil abound it is speciauy important as the site of the first buddhist council held after buddhas death in the fifth century sc at sarnath another highly interesting spot connected with the life of buddha about four miles from benares the directorgeneral himself was busily engaged in superintending extensive excavations on which many hundreds of coolies were at work the foundations of large build ings were being laid bare and antiquities of various kinds including sculptures and in scriptions were being daily unearthed the number of archological finds is here already so great that a permanent museum for their reception is being built on the spot at a short distance from the old tope and the walls in february last were already beginning to rise above the level of the groundsubsequently i was enabled by the hospi table arrangements made for me by his highness the maharajah of balrampur to visit the very extensive buried site of set mahet the ancient city of sravasti which lies about  miles northeast of lucknow and  miles from the himalayas here i was entertained in his camp by dr vogel the archsiologist of the united provinces and the punjab excavations were proceeding on two sites the first being that of an old buddhist monastery built of brick the other that of one of the gates of the ancient city two or three miles away it was a curious experience to witness the coolies of whom there were several hundreds men women and children being paid their wages the excellent plan has been adopted of rewarding by extra payment for archaeological finds the amount varying according to h importance of the object found this system not only stimulates the zeal of the coolies and males them mora care ful in the work of excavation but also acts as a check on theftlast of all i visited the frontier province as the guest of dr spooner the excavations which that scholar was conducting near pesha war with the aid of a small band of coolies had laid bare some masonry foundations the work had however not proceeded far enough to show the plan of the buildings or to yield any thing in the way of sculptures and inscriptions at peshawar dr spooner has started a museum for the movable antiquities found in the frontier province a vast number of these have in past years been removed being partly housed in the lahore museum or having been taken out of the country by private individuals dr spooner has nevertheless managed within two years to form quite a good collection including coins which ought in course of time to become a most excellent one the specimens are admirably arranged according to localities in such a way as to be mutually liuustrativefrom peshawar dr spoonor accompanied e me to mardanthe headquarters of the  guidesthe messroom of which distinguaished regi ment contains several very fine spe rinens of gricobuddhist sculpture found in the neigh bouirhood from here we drove some six imiles to takhtibahai a group of ancient buddhist stone buildings nestling just below the crest of a rocky ridge which rises abruptly from the plain these ruins are most romanti cauy situated reminding one of the medieval strongholds of robber knights which may be seen perched on craggy heights in various parts of germany they have a special interest for students of indian archiology as being the only structural monastic buddhist buildings the walls of which are still partiauy standing on indian soil this site has yielded many im portant sculptures in past years further excavations had lately been going on here under dr spooners orders as a result of these operations we found that about a dozen small topes had been laid bare in the courtyard of the monastery a umuber of stone buddbas and bodhisattlas future buddhas had also been unearthed and were lying near miany of the beautifully carved heads were in perfect preservation even the noses being uninjured though this is somewhat rare in indian anti quities some of these figures are as fine specimes of gandhara art as any that have yet been found in the northwestthe sun had already set when we re luctantly took leave of this highly interesting and romantic spot to scramble down the steep and rugged hillside to the plain below in looking back on my indian tour i recall many occasions of regret at being unable to linger under the spell of ancient solitudes like this in which one is alonewith nature and the monuments of men of the  dim and distant past as we were making our way in the gathering dusk along the foot of the hill our thoughts were suddenly brought back to the realities of the present one of dr spooners barelegged native attendants who was walking just in front noticed in the nick of time that he was about to tread on a snake and managing to kill it with his stick escaped being bitten dr spooner brought down with him as many of the smaller finds as could be carried away at the time arranging for the larger specimens to be conveyed by cart after a few days to the museum at peshawar the archoogical harvest which the valleys of hese frontier regios will yield when they have been systematically and thoroughly explored will undoubtedly be a very rich one that the archaeological department has been doing much research work in the subject of epigraphy also is indicated by the fact that in the year  no fewer than  inscriptions were copied bv members of the staff in southern india and  in other parts of the countryit is thus clear that a great deal of work has been accomplished in the domains of conserva tion excavation and epigraphy but incom parablv more temains to be done in the future not only are there many buried sites practically untouched some of them covering an area of many square miles such as that of kapilavastu the birthplace of buddha just within the fron tier of nepal and that of pataliputra the vast capital of magadha near the modern patna but several sites which have been partiallv explored in a former period must be worled over again and will take many years to exhaust it is indeed remarlable how many important discoveries were made by the archologists of earlier days particularly when we consider that they were men who like general cunningham had no special training and operated with a wholly inadequate staff but several of the sites which such men thought they had worked out they really only scratched on the surface a notable example of this is sarnath where aswe have seen so many important antiquarian remains have been found quite lately under mr marshalls auspices and where only a few years ago ir qertel made one of the most important archmological discoveries of recent timesa beautifully polished pillar bearing an inscription of sing asoka and surmounted by l a lion capital whieh is perhaps the finest speci men of ancient carving yet found in indiaduring my travels in india i had several occasions of observing the harm which had been earibw artieei ale card ona stl  and done in archeological work by untrained menl thus one of the sites i visited had been par tially explored in former years by an amatear he had in the first place greatly danaged the buried structure irn the course of his operations because he lacked the necessary knowledge of the correct methods of procedure he had further allowed the dibris taken from his excavations to be thrown upon the unexplored ortion of the site where it had by this time ecome almost as hard as rock the expenses of the newv operations were thus very largely increased by the necessity of remnoving this superimposed rubbish before the excavation s proper could be proceeded with having had no training in survey work he was further incapable of producing adequate plans of the work he had actually carried out it is more over well known that many sculptures were unearthed in former years by untrained ecavators who never troubled to describe or even to note the places wvhere they were found such anttiquities have consequently lost nearly all their archieological value the lahore museutm contains a large collection of fine sculptures the source of which is thus unknowni brought away with me the general impres sion that though thearchieological department is now on so much better a footing than ever before the staff is still inadequate for all the work that lies before it the vast size of the country as well as the number and extent of the mnonuments must render it extremely difficult for the directorgeneral and the provincial sur veyors to exercise the necessary supervision everywhere over the work of conservation alone to say nothing of making much headway in exploring and investigating the immense quan tity of archmological material that still remains to be dealt with the amount of official routine work which in addition to these activities is inevitable will in all probability interfere with the punctual publication of the annual reports the uptodate appearance of which is of special importance to researchers in europe and america in  the directorgeneral remedied this drawback by publishing in the journal of the royal asiatic society of great britain and ireland a summary of the work done during the previous year it is to be hoped that he will repeat this admirable plan if necessary in the futurethere is much other valuable work which it seems impossible could ever be undertaken bv the staff at its present strength thus com plete and scholarly monographs fully illustrated of important groups of monuments such as the caves of ajanta ellora udavagiri and the temples at bhuvanesvar and ekhajuraho would greatly advance the study of indian archmology speeial and systematic treatment of the iconoaraphy of the monuments to which com paratively little attention has hitherto been paid would make such publieations peculiarly usefula minor but not unimportant desideratum seems to be the publication bythe department if time allwed of brief and trustworthy archeological guidebooks to the most important sites such as karli sanchi ajanta ellom udayagiri bhuvanevnr to be sold by the custodian at a fixed price to travellers it is of course impossible to spend much on salaries paid to caretakers for the benefit of the rare and often unintelligent tourist the men who are employed in this capacity are mostly very ignorant and quite incapable of giving any trustworthy information about the mnonuments of which they are in charge on the contrary i have often heard such men making funda mentally wong statements even the custo dian at karli who was an intelligent brahman knew next to nothing about the inscriptions and sculptures in that famous cave temple though he was eager to learn he complained that no source of information was accessible to him at that lonely spot and seemed very grate ful when dr konow whom i accompanied explained various things he did not understandindia possesses several good archasological museums such as those at calcutta madras bombay lucknow muttra lahore besides those wlhich are being formed at sarnath and peshawar none of these can be said to have an adequate catalogue of antiquities though i believe a revised edition of andersons cata logue of the calcutta museum is about to be published the finest collection of greco buddhistic sculptures that at lahore is not even arranged and can therefore have very little educative value to the student it is absurd that dr vogel the provincial archieo logist should be expected to arrange and catalogue this collection in addition to his other multifarious duties a thoroughly trained assistant archaeologist should be entrusted with such worksome of these museums possess good collec tions of coins it seems obvious that these should not be left in the custody of the general archologist of the circle as is practically everywhere the case in order to be properly looked after they should be handed over to a specialist in numismatics a branch of anti quarianstudywhich aswe have seen ispeculiarly important in india only such an expert can properly arrange and catalogue the coins guard against loss bv theft and fraud or extend the collection with safety by his ability to detect forgerieswhat i have said is i hope sufficient to dispel any remains of the idea that the work of archaeological exploration in india can be completed within any calculable period the desire of all those who are interested in its future must be that the department will not only always remain a permanent one but will receive increased support from the government of tndia in proportion to the xvast field of its operations and the magnitude of the work which has still to be done and which far from being nearly finished lihs only within recent years been begun under systematic and scientific conditions there is every reason to believe that the department as now organized will by preserving the national monuments more care fully and advancing our knowledge of the past more rapidlv than has hitherto been possible add very much to the credit of the imperial government in the eyes of the world
