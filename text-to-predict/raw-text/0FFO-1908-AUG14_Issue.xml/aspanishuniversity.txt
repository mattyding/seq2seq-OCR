 a spanish universityfrom our iadmd coiesodpitwe are told of the old alchemists that their labours were barren because they were always lookmig for the wrong things it may truly be said of the spaniard that he also has wasted his labours because he has for ever tried for the wrong thingsif knowledge and material prosperity are benefits the question to be answered now is whether he is at lest turning his thoughts in the right direction in view of all we see about us in spain it is impossible to give a negative answer and yet one hesitates to bce too affirmative in the case cf a people whose national character is so strong and has been so enduring nevertheless i think we can see very hopeful signsa definite example of manageable proportions will dc more to explain what is meant here than any number of generalities i would suggest that the english reader who wishes to know whether there is movement in spain of other than a merely material kind should go for his evidence to perhapsthe very last place wherehewould expect to make the discoi eiynamely to the escorial ha ing gone there by an early train from madrid he will disco er if he is one of those tra ellers who see more than their guide book that the site of philip is  folly  is not nearly so gaunt as many parts of yorkshire and is an oasis of fertility when it is compaed say with the twenty miles between newton stewart and new galloway in the southwest of scotland when he has seen the great monastery palace which philip  built not at all as an eccen tricity of his own but on the ancient model of the aragonese houses of poblet and santas creus he can look about him he will discover that the village or rather small town is a prosperous place with a large chocolatemanufactory fulu of wellbuilt houses with wellglazed winldews and of people who are i isibly in good case then he will find that there is a secondary school the college of alfonso xii in the body of the escorial while in the dependencies there are a university so  called two schools for the carabiniersone of them a training place for officers another for children of soldiers of the corps and the school of foxestry the escuela de montes the  carabineros  arc the custom house soldiers of the spanish government and their schools are not interesting for the present purpose but the college and the  university wlhich are under the charge of the augustinians will repay a visit it is pleasant in the cool hours of the morning to find the open space in front of the escorialthe ionjaoccupied by human boys engaged in kicking about a most mndeniable english football the play may be dismissed in the terms in which miarryats quartermaster described the fighting of the spanish crews at the battle of saint vincent they would have foughtbetter hesaid if theyhad known how for  there was no want of courage in the don there was plenty of muscular activity in the little dons and thev would have played better if they had been taught the game athletics are not neglected under therale of tho augustiniansthe  university which is in truth a college affiliated to iadrid has a stable of horses and is building a  fronton or court for playing the basque game of tennisthe  pelota these places are not mere creations of the government a nuniber of scholarships in spanish  becas are given to sons of officers for the secondary school but parents wlho can afford the expense send their boys there from all parts of spain they like it in the first place because the escorial is very healthy afactwhich maybe recordedto the credit of the sense of phflip and then because the moral training is good a spanish gentleman explained to me in very plain terms that lie sent his grand son to the  universitv  because the lad was better there than when exposed to all the temptations of life in lodgings and boarding houses in madrid there is supervision at the escorialand perhaps too much i was not surprised to be told by the augustinian who showed me over the large  quad  in which the undergraduates have their rooms that they generally have to send halfadozen men down in a year they no doubt rebel against being looked after as if they were small boys and yet how much better it must be to have your owvn lofty and airy room in that  quad and the guadarrama to roam over and the hall to dine in than to be cabined in a narrow madrid street and a  esa do huespedes as for the training it is all but wholly modern and scientific latin is taught only for two years to the boys at the college and they learn only the grammar and to read very easy prose the augustinians confess verycandidlymthatthe whole arts course and the law degrees are very lasly treated in spain a degree in arts or in law confers no claim on government employment and is easily giventhe training of the engineers whose diploma does entitle them to government employment is a far more serious business therefore the school of forestry at the escorial naturally strilkes the visitor as a place where a great deal of hard work is done i cannot profess to speak with technical imowledge of the value of the the training given one of the augustinian professors at the college complained that al education in spain is too bookish and is want ing in the practical application which he had learnt to value in germany where he had worked for nine years that may be the case writh the school of forestry but it was not the impression left on me by the place itself or by the talk of the professors and the students but be the character of the course followed what it may here was a long range of buildings devoted to giving men a six years training in forestry the graduates are put on a government staff and entitled to salaries on which they can just live i hey are free to work also for prii ate employers and look to what they can earn ic this way as their real reward for a long and costly training the professors are laymen and has e no connexion with the augustinians of the college and the university i he classrooms and museums are excellently fitted there is a library where foreign works relatin to the suhjects taught in the school are to be found in large numbers � here is an atmosphere of energy and zeal over the whole place and its men teachers or taught they are not concerned only with the care of the actual woods but with every kind of work which is subservient to the planting and preservation of trees i had already seen from the carriage window of the train that castile is not so treeless as we are commonly told that it is in the province of ax ila which i have not crossed a late duchess of medinaceli made large plantations of pines on the model of the french landes they have just been sold to a company for the sum of five millions of pesetasabout � i am told and have read of other plantations of irrigation woiks undertaken by private owners and employers often working in co operation the state of spanish agriculture which employs with the pastures at least threefourths of the population and is by very far the greatest of spanish industriesis too large a subject to deal with at the end of an article i can only point out here that english men of business in madrid who sell agricultural implements can find purcsasers for the laroer in considerable numbers and for the smaller by thousands these traders deal largely with the  labradores the little yeomen farmers whb are now showing themselves very ready to adopt new ideas and such new instruments as are within their meansin short a new spain is forming under the political and administrative crust of the old it is a spain which is not indifferent to knowledge nor conceitedly contemptuous of what can be learnt from other peoples it is making wealth developing commerce between one province aud another andhas already brought the country to the stage in which the old anarchy of pronunciu mvenos would be intolerable so far it has teen too busy in promoting its private affairs to think of combining for the purpose of taking its government in hand but it is advancing toward the day when it will there is everywhere a stir ring of life and it is by no means impossitle that if one of those accidents which seem capable of ruining the existing order were actually to occur the result might simply be to hasten the development an to anrnrise the watrld
