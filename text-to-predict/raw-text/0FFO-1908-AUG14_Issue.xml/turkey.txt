tirley the strikes at conkstantdoplefrom oue cobbisupondentconstantiople aug the strike of porters and stevedores is expected to end tomorrow thanks in part to the efforts of the committee in part to the lack of organiza tion of the strikers  the employes of the tram way company after going on strike for a few hours resumed work this afternoonan ollicial commnuniqmu is published by the press this morning stating that the attempts made by certain emplmjys at the ministry of financo to prevent by means of demonstrations the application of the scheme for reorganization of the personnel of the ministry which has been approved by the council of ministers and sanctioned by the sultan are calculated to cause a breach of the pence and to impede the working of the state organization  that two leaders of the demonstrations have consequently been arrested and that further attempts of this nature nvill be punished at the same time it is considered probable that a number of the exofficials whose sudden dismissal caused the strike at the ministry o finance will receive compensation as soon as fsmds are forthcomingrwestitution by exministersshould the favourites and exministers now im

polieeforeign officers in macedontiafom our own correspondedtsofla ace the communication of the second portion of the anglorussian reform scheme to the powers has passed almost unnoticed in the balkan states where it is generally understood that owing to the altered conditions the project must for the present at least remain in abeyance the subsequent announcement from st petersburg that the scheme has been withdrawn conse quently excited no surprise european inter ference of any kind in turkish affairs at the present moment could be productive of no good results and might lead to dangerous reaction inspired by national and religious sentiment not only in constantinople but in the outlvng provinces especially albania the feeling of pessimism which on the outbreak of the revolu tion displayed itself in the balkan capitals bas now been greatly modified in view of the remark able tact moderation and savoir faire displayed by the young turks on many critieal occasions and the diplomatic address they have shown in reconciling hostile elementsnevertheless it is generally felt that the new rime is still only at the beginning of its diffi culties and that new problems of great complexity will present themselves as the situation develops the truce between the various nationalities in macedonia can hardly be permanent and some ominous occurrences during the last few days seem to indicate that the racial honeymoon is drawing to a close apart from the war of raees the doctrine of universal equality wlhich conflicts with the traditions of centuries will hardly be accepted or even understood by the bulk of the moslem population the application of this principle would turn the scale entirely in favour of the better educated and more progressive christinn elementin the circumstances there can be no question of the withdrawal of the european civil and military oficials in macedonia the young turks full of confidence in their success ul doubtedly resent their presence and in some cases foreign officials have received polite notifications that their stay in macedonia will be brief the young turks however recognize that the question can only be settled by the meditum of diplomacy in effect they will find the foreign officials most valuable coadjitors in the task of maintaining order in macedonia mlany of the foreigners now possess considerable administrative experience and there can be no reason to doubt that all will maintain the friendliest relations with the new rulers of the country and render important services especiallv in regard to finance and the reorganization of the gendarmeric during the transitional period now approaching their withdrawal can only be contemplated when more settled conditions have begun to prevailthe paris organ of the
