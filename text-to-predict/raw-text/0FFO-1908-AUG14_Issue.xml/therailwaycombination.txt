apprehension zmong raiway cmplo espeelly is this the caseivith the clerical stafes the uniform menparticularly if as in tho caso of the sovth eastern and chatham combination parlinmaeet forbids tho roduction of travelling facilitieswill not be so much affected though the great eastern railway has taken the step of ordering that no more men should be taken on referring to this subnect mr a g valkden secretary of the railway clerks association yesterday said we are au very mruch concerned about the developments thoy will undoubtedly affect the clerks more seriously than any other classes in tho servic the dupficate agencies are to be aboilshed and tho men occupying positions in them will have to be taken into tho officesi aen assuming they will not be dischargod and this will defer the promotions of these moaned keep down others beneath them the younger men are naturally apprehensive both on this point and as to whethor discarges wi bo made we aro not supposing that the companies will discharge the senior men who are qlified in all kinds of raihway business ourmembers feelita griovanco that any ono should bo discharged last year a grit deal was made during the crisis about the permanent character of the worik mr walkdeniointed out that the combination of the caledonian and north british railways early in the year resultod at once in the discharge of several dclrls in glasgow and pro ceeded nvo feel that if companies a oing to reduce their staffs it should be done by not filling up vacancies the outlook however does not seem promising the mlidland and great northern have discharged some jumior clerks already and the lancashire and yorkshire several more the cheshire lines committee a joint undertaking of the great northern lidland and great central havo discharged nearly a score if this happens before the arrangement is fixed up what will happe after two companies have offered their clerks work in signalboxes or as ticketcollectors instead of discharing thom some of the men have had to accept though they resent it very much indeed mr wllkden calculated that if the amalgamations are completo many hundreds of clerks might be discharged mainly from the head offices and duplicate branch offices  the association he said  are waiting to seo in nvhat way it is put before parlia ment wo think provision should be made that none of tho permanent cmploy should he dischargod the association may tako legal action if necessarv but i cannotsayyet we want also an improved scale of salaries to compensato for tho reduced prospects of pro motionparlliment and railway agreeinsthe current report of the railway rceicv tho orgen of the amalgamated soietv of railway servants in an article on the working agreements arrived at between the midland and london and northwestern railway con paios and the great central great northern and greatstern lailway compaaiessavslt is idle to overlook the fact that these combinations arrangements agree ments whatever they may bo alled constitute a tremendous change in tho policy which has hitherto been adopted by the railway companies of these islands the most serious part of this business however is the assumption thit amalgarnations and combinations of this kind can bo carried out wyithout parliamentary sanction or revision    it may be a good thing or it may he a bad thing for these agrcements to take place but we arc convinced that they ought not to be ailowed to be cemented until parlirirent lus had an opportunity of viewing and reviewing tho whole of the arrangements which may be contemplated and of pronouncing a judgrnent thereon this supinemess is all the more difficult to understand when it is remembered that a committee of inquiry is in existence which is szpposed to be dealing with the wvholo question of railway policy as between the companies and the general public all theso fiterchanges and agreemeints prove the absolute need not only for a parliamentary inquiry into the working of our present railway systems but of a practical public policy by which the interests of the public may be safeguarded at thio prelent moment in spite of the protestations of the railvay companies there is no guaranteo of any safeguard of the rights and privileges of the general public nor any guarantee with regard to the stadf who are emplovd   as a matter of public importance we consider it is the bounden duty of the board of trade to intervene and stop these agree ments until the wvholo question of policy has been thoroughly considered and a decision arrived at with eyes wide open
