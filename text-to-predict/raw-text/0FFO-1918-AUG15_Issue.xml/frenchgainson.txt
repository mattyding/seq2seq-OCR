french gains ontles oisiegen humbert steadypressurenearing iagsignvfrom our spedal coirespoidentfrench army auo   amkgeneral hurmbertes army made another ad vaee last evening north of the bois de thies court not a very big one but one of great value the freneh are once more in the park of plessier leroye which was carried so brilliantly during the march offensive at the same time thtl the french foiled a german attack on mont pmont the park and viuage stand in a plain close to the northern edge of the mauif lassigny also in the plain is less than a mile away and mont plmont a sort of cornerstone of the tnasif from which you look down on both villages ilmost with the feeling that you could throw a stone into either is about the same distance as general humberts centre has at the same time gained a footing in belval a short mile moutheast of plessierleroye and close under the southern slopes of moont plmont that famous little heightwhich both in march and in the june offensive when it was lost in spite of the heroic fighting of the dismounted cuiras siers by whom it was then defended has already covered the french with glory vill probably soon again fall into their hands thxs may happen either as a result of a direct attack or in keeping with the tactics that have governed the rest of the fighting in the district of the turning movement following on an advance on both sidesfarther to the east on the other side of ecouvillon general humberts right advanced rather more than a mile to the north of cam bronne and is now only a little way from the cave of which i wrote yesterday and from the spur whence one looks out eastwards over the valleymeanwhile french bombing squadrons are making the life of the germast behind their lines distinctly unpleasant on monday night tergnier ham nesles st quentin and noyon all of them concentration stations of vital iin portance to the enemy whatever they intend to do were bombed to the tune of  tons of ex plosive their lines of communications with the rear both by day and night have been con stantly harassed in this w ay by our airmen and they must be finding it extremely difficult and costly either to bring men and ammunition up to the front or to carry on the business of the retreat away from it on the other hand and en revanche they are on some parts of this sector making great use of yperite gas as part of their programme of delaying tacticsconverging linesmday south of lassigny the front ex tends from near courcelles in a northeasterly direction to the south corner of the bois des losgcs close to fresniorcs and from there with several sharp twists owing to the lie of the land turns southeast to a point on the oise between ribecourt and cambronnethe right half of the line has been striking in two directions converging on lassigny the left half cannot i suppose move forward to wheel in the same direction till the army on its left is in position to execute the same movement the operations of the right half may therefore now be regarded as finished for the present theyare frobthi intberts immediate object finished in a very de finite sense  the possibility of germian counter attack from the fastuesses of the maeaf of thies court is practically now nonexistentyesterdays operations cleared the plateau of the farn of st claude northeast of mareuil and established our position firmly at ecouvillon which we had reached the night before parther to the north canny is still in the enemys hands it is com manded on the french side by two farms situated right and left the farm of laroc and the farm of canny before the village can be taken the attackers ought to be in possesion of both but canny can waitthe real key to the masif as important to an army advancing from the west as plemont is to one coming in the opposite direction is the st claude plateau and that we have and also ecouvillon from which the french begin to look down on to the valley of the divette in the upper part of its course the result therefore of thursdays advance which put the finishing touches to whathad gone on since the attack on the mawil began is that though the french are not yet quite up to the valley of the divette the enemy can attempt no effective action on this side of it frorm or in the mujsi itslf beyond the divette there is a further system of heights in the angle between the roads from noyon to ham and noyon to chaunyin which formidable position the enemy will probably set themselves to fight another delaying action but that is a separate operation for which and the counter move on our part we shall have to waiton this side general hiumberts men have practically fnished the work which they had to do and have done in most brilliant fashion the front which they now occupy passes just behind the two farnswest of canny beyond which it crosses the lassigny road about two miles west of the village and skirts the edge of the park of plessier recedes slightly for about a miue and immediately pushes out a sharp little salient which takes in belval from which it strikes down on the farther side of ecouvillon straight to the oiseenemy in old french linesas regards the pace at which they have ad vanced it must be remembered that it is no longer on thlis particular sector of the front a war of movement because the enemy hold the old french lines with all their trenches abria and wire complete from these they can only in all probability be dislodged without serious difficulty by a heavy bombardment hort or long ds the case may be but at all events of considerable force the position at present is that the french have to get up their guns and ammunition and repair the roads and at the same time give their infantr a rest whereas the germans though still more tired havetho advantage that as they have retreated they have stage by stage come bak to their guns in their fied positions and to all the stores they neededin front of canny where the open ground north of the massif begins the germans have made a particularly determined resistance in view of the danger which threatens them if our advance continues on tlis side in all tho fight ing they have made great use of yperite and other gas shells and tho french infantry besides having to face in the masif thie firo first of a nore or ices continuous line and then of several nests of machineguns echeloned in depth behindthose in front wereo obliged for two vholo days to wear their gas masks in these conditionsthcir advance which had to he carried on almostman by man in this extremely difficult cotthtry  has been not slow but exctraordinarily rapid and they can lood forrard to the next battle with renewed confidenco in their power to go on pulshing the cenem hack i plltoday the french took ribe court and slightly advanced their line at two or three points on the niasitf of thiescourt where tho situation remains satisfactory fighting has bbeen very sevcre the germans having put in new divisions on
