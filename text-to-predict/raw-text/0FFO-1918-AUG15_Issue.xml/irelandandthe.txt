ireland and thenew parliamenttme coming election retrospect and forecast ny an nusu corsrondenthe debate of july  may be taken as representing the final appearanee in force of the iriah party under present conditions the long parliament will meet again for a few weeka in the autumn but the shadow of dissolution will be over it and the nationalists most of all will be thinking of their nevw constituents and constituencies rnther this of things at westminster when mr f h odonnell wroto his voluminous and vindictive history of the irish parliimentary party bripnug the storydown to the year in whicb thepresent parliamnit was lected he surnmed up the situation at that period in the phrase  never was the party lss deserving of esteem never was the party in moro complete aseen dancy and dminationi over the british conati tution if mr odonnell had liveda few years longer one can imagino the crow of triumph with which he would have wvelcomed the reverses that have since befallen his former collcagues and rejoiced over the desperate position in vwhich the oneo allpowerful party fincds itself on the eve of gcencral fgleationpeople in england have of late had other things to think of but the irish question is still there and tho latest phase in the fortunes of tlho party promises to be ani interesting one for ear liamentary purposes its beginning may be dated from the opemng day of the session of  when the tirstannouncement made by the speaker after the peading of the wings speech was that during the recess he ha issued a writ for north roscommon vacant by the death of mir james j okelly it wvas an historic occasion although no one knew it at the time for with north roscommon bean a series of fiercely contested elections whose result has been to show that the irish parliamentary party for something like  years supreme and un hallenged in ireland and only eight years ago glorying in its  completo ascendancy and domi nation at westminster no longer represents irish nationalist opiniontr sinn fein revoltokelly was no speaker and to the younger generation of the hlouse he was practically un known but he was a fenian stalwart of the fighting days and he wvas in addition one of the very few members of the party whom parnell really liked or trusted in return he stuck to parrell to the last with dogged fidelity and he never concealed his opinion that the betrayal of parnoll by the bishops and by the majority of his collcagues was the deathknell of the party therc wastherefore some appropriateness in the fact that it was his death and the vacancy in poseoinuon that opened the flod gates to the torrent of revolt  the resulfs of this and subse quent contests may be recorded in a few lines thero have been in all eight contested seats in ireland of whieh the sinn feiners have won five and the party only three the total votes polled wero  and  respectively nor does this indicate the full extent of the falling off for there are ominous signs of cleavage in the ranks of the party itself and in the country very few can be found to express any confidence either in its leadership or in its policy by way of comparison readers may be reminded of the course of events in the constituencies during the paraellite split in the carlv nineties there as now the section with the bishops at its back gained most of the byeleetions the parnellites being defeated by majorities averaging three td two but when the general election came the swing round to the sideof the majority became more marked and the panellites only mnanaged to save nine or  seats out of the ruinselectoral forecasts are not too trustworthy at the best of times and the present confusion in ireland warns off the most experienced the women electors are an absolutely unknown quan tity although the sinn feiners are confident of their support similarly they claim the great mnajoity of the yoqpng nerf vho arenow goingto be remembered that under the new distribu tion scheme there has been a considerable dis turbance of the balance of political power as between nationalists and unionists six nationalist counties lose one member each three nationalist boroughs lose representation entirely belfast gets nined members in place of four dublin city getsseven in plaee of four dublin county gets twoo tdditional members county down gets one additional member and the two younger universities in belfast and dublin get one member eaeh this will raise the total representation of ireland already absurdly overrepresentedfrom  to  and will reduce the number of nationalist members of all shades by a number variously estimated from seven to ten the unionists being increased in proportion the new universities will make no change in the balance queens naturallv returning a unionist and mr birrells new national a hotbed of sinn feinanadvanced nationalist taking the nationalists at  to  in the nexv parliament the most favourablo estimate that i have anrywhere heard would leave  or  seats to the officialparty the sinn fciners getting  or  as the first article in the shin fein creed is absten tion from westminster woe might thus have the novel spectacle of the irish unionists as the largest irish party in the house with something like  or  members if nationalists and sinn feiners fight it out to the bitter end some addi tional seats in critical coiltituencies will go to the unionists but this is almost unthinkable however much the nationalust factions hate each other they will bury the hatcheet for the time being rather than see such seats as west belfast south down or east tyroue gqing to the unionistsattitude of the churcithere are excited sinn feiners who claim that they will wipe out mr dillon and his fol lowers the policy of the  sweeping brush  is their watchword but this would suit the hierarchy just as little as the overwhelming preponderance of the old league which they have now demolished already some of the bishops show an inclination to back out of the extreme position into which they were betrayed by their rage at the passing of themilitary ser vice act one  turbulent priest father oflanagan of crossna who had taken a leading part in the roscommon election and afterwards in east cavan wags first admonished and then peremptorily sileneed his parishioners came to church one sunday lately only to find that he had been dismissed by the bishop and that a new curate had been appointed in hii place they promptly bolted the doors and the  intruder to borrow a wordÂ£rom the scottish controversy of the  disruption dayshad to make his way in by the sacristy window and say mass as best hecould before a few old wemen whilst a group of parishioners assembled outside and solemnly resolved to allow no other priest to say mass there till father oflanagan was restored as soon a the priest had finished the service the  protestcrs entared and secirely screwed and bolted all the doors and windowsso tat the parish remains as it vere under ninterdict somoe of the more hothcaded sinnfeiners declared that everv church in nationalist treland would be treated in the same way but the turmoil will not be allowed to spread so far sinn fein has won largely by the sympathy and support of the younger clergy and of a few of the bishops and if its leaders were to turnthe church against them their position would be as hopeless electorally as that of the parnellites or the fenians in former days cardinal logue the pea antprince of the church is still th strongest personality in ireland  there is not a bishop wlio does not tremble at his frown and if it camo to organized sacrilege he would mnake his contemners wish they had never been bormthe church needless to say is the one clment which it is never safe to leave out of the calcula tion in any consideration of irish politics the cardinal dislikes mir dillon and his methodsao the yugngeri clegy hve beenalloewe to goa certain length in supporting sinn fein and thereby smashing the party but midnight drilling raids for arias cattledriving assaults oh the police and theoather diversions of sinn fein have no attractions for the hierarchy and the local insurgents lay and clerical will get a sharp lesson if they go too far that the church is reallygfraid of home rule and vwould prefer to leb things go on as they are is th firm con viction of some of the most esperienced and far sighted ationalists cardinal cullen opposed homo rule and kept it at arms length so long as he lived and so did his successor if the boishops now seem to be ardent nationalists it is not say their critics because they have changed their fundamental views on irish govermnent and it is no secret that it was the bishops who destroyed the redmondmidleton compromise in the irish convention and thus brought to nought all hopes of substantial agreement in the bosom of that body the roman church and the hierarchy have more liberty and more influence now in ireland than in any other country in the world catholic or protestant and they may be excused if they think that they might go further and fare worse already the sinn fein papers are raising the cry of  a secret treaty between the cardinal and the viceroy  some con cessionsjit isinted wvili be made to the clergy the dutyof taig awlvy eshxnae of ireland and of fihliugti raiks of the irjsh glivisions

them are we to be conscribed cries new ireland in alarm and wrath provided the priests brothers and clerical students are exempt t  if there be anything in this forecast there may be surprises in ireland at the general electiona popular viceroythe mention of the viceroy brings in an almost forgotten element  for  years ireland has had no government said mr clhamberlain re cently and in truth there was little exaggera tion in mr redmonds claim that under the abcrdeenbirrell regime the government of ire land was carried on not at the castle but at the united irish league offices in oconnellstreet the winiborneduke combinatiqn was no im provement and it is with a start of surprise tha ireland after so many years finds itself again writh something resembling agovernment it is too soon to speak confidently of the french shortt administration there are too many pit falls but the viceroy by common consent professional politicians of course exceptedhas made an excellent beginning himself a warm hearted impulsive irishman he has spoken to irishmen as they like to be spoken todirectly and from the heart orderwill be maintained and treason will be stamped on  like a noxious insect otherwise he and mr shortt will be heart and soul with the irish people in every desire and endeavour to develop industries to improve agriculture and to make the country better worth living in for the common man at rockingharnin his own countyhe pointed out that  the country was enjoying greater pro sperity than ever before in its history and that the only trouble arose from a handful of in triguers many of them of foreign extraction who have no other object in view than their own per sonal interest young irishmen stand aloof from the war not because they are afraid but  because their minds are filled wvith mischievous sentiments and poisonous lies surely none but foolish irish boys would be found to listen to such idiotic ganmoni see that some  english sentimentalists threw up their hands at the idea of a viceroy spealing out like that but it is the kind of talk irishmen understand and like and it is not too much to say that lordfrench is already personally one of the mbst popular viceroys ireland has had mr shortt very wisely is saying little or nothing but he too ib earning it reputation for straightforward common sense and he is understood in additionto be deeply engaged on a programme for tho develop ment of the longneglected natural resources of the countryrivers harbouts railways and co ieries it will bean excellent test f lis capacity for ireland is still proeminently the land of jobs and the chief secretary will id yiany  push ful advisers whose interest iu development begins and ends with the development of their own interests  but there ikplenty of the right kind of work to be done and if mr shortt suc ceeds in gotting it done and done on strict blisi ness lines he will leave his mark as a substantial benefactor of irelandall this it rnust be admitted is a little apart from the question of the resultq of the next general electidn no administration good or bad is likely to tdrn a nationalist into a union ist or vice versa but after all sedition and disloyalty live and flourish on the memoryof past grievances and past siufferings andc everything that tends to imnprovo the material condition of thoecountry andthusto divertments minds from hat lord french called  evil councils and un patriotic and false sentiments is  a contribu tion to what is or should be the common aim of unionist and nationalistthe peace order and prosperity of
