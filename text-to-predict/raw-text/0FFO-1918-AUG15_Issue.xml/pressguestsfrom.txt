press gues ts frokioverseai  lord burnhaws ivwelcomee mr hughes and thecensorshiplord burnhlam entertained at tho ritz hotel piccadilly last night the members of the dominion press who are now visiting england to acertainu the exact condition of thibgs in this countrymr hugirs prime minister of australia proposed the toast of the british press lie said  he believed that if the barricrs of language could be broken down and the peoples could be brought really to know each other there would be few occasions for war or even rumours cf war the press universally was engaged in the great mission of bringing about understandings between the peoples of the world the british press in his opinion stood on the highest peak of the worlds journalism in australia the press had endeavoured to follow the high example set by the british press in his capacity as a minister in australia it had been his duty to impose restric tions on the press hie had never been able to con vince the press of the neeessity of those restrictions laughter and indeed in his own most positive moments he had doubts about them himself cheers and laughter through him then the australian press censor had his being laughter but ho had never been able to understand the working of the cnsorsmind cheers perhaps when posterity came impartially to record the history of these davs it would furnish reasons why the censor of the press acted as he had done for his part he would welcomne the day when th need for the censor no longer existedsir geonaoe riddel who responded to the toast raid that he had spent the last four years among the censor he had endeavoured to find out the censors mind and all he could say was that a geat doubt stiu existed among british journalists as to whether the censor had any neind at all laughter lno oeo could suggest that the british newspapers had given away one whit of their independence during the war the british press admitted the necessity of a censor but it would regard the declara tion of peace as its independence day when its judgment and criticism as they existed before the war would be restored cheersproposing the toast of  the dominion press lobd builri said that he was very proud to entertain such a company he doubted whether since  a more representative assenibly of our freo commonwealth of nations was ever brought together though he had in his recollection the rst of a wonderful series of galthering nine years ago when his father received at his home in what disraeli called beechy bucks the ixnperial press conferncae which did noro than was ever known to solidify public opinion throughout the empire before this deathbirth of a lew world there was one eloquent voice they had wished to hear more in these days and that was the voice of lord rosebery for he had been the prophet of the hush before the storm in those days they turned over the leasves of the sibyline books together and were some what wiser than tarquin they paid some heed to the warning word they heard though perhaps not as much as they should have had they been taken into the confldence of government as they were to day he owed this chance of fouowing his fathers footsteps to the grasp of the things that matter and count shown by the minister of information in fol lowinlg the great precedent set by the press in bring ing them here to see things at home and abroad as they really are lord beaverbrook was one of them nndhe saw us from tbe standpoint of  reater britain ln the name of the british press he the chairman thanked the prime minister for what he had done to enable the press throughout the empire to do the ful measure of its duty to the public which it served cheersonservarro orncosal newspaper men felt honoured that their dominions viqitors were the guests of the british nation it was the fjlct time that the newspaper press had been thus received in a representative character and capacity they were here as the observation officers of the british dominions overseas and upon their birdseye view much of our future would depend they would see things in a truer light and a fairer proportion than we could with eyes that were dimmed by the smoke and blurred by the heat of the fiery furnace we were too close to the hissing and roaring of the forcinghouse of fate until this war was concluded by a just and decisive pelace they could not see things whole but they would at least see them more clearly than we could and they woould not he ventured to thinlk find that the old country had aged much in these years of war it might be that thegassesithey used would be for the first time of britishimakein the fourth year of this bloody war britain was pulsating with an energy and enthusiasnm to which she had long been a strangervhich struck us as astoundingly new instead ef the old pose of self questionitig doubt about everything including our own right to exist there was a living faith in the righteousness of this high cause whioh made all things possible the most striking of all changes was the extent to which women had claimed and had obtained an equal share with the men in war work and var duties to the eternal glory of british woman hood cheers wve seemed to have shed for goodnd all that obvious and traditional defect of our qualities which the foreigner beheved to be an in eradicable iustinct of the racethe snobbishness as thackeray sad of thinking meanly of mean things we thought less of mean things now perhaps we had aiso got rid of what our fast friends and valiant allies the french called  snobbism which meant the pretence and assumption of a supeilority a pride of life over other nations even of our owvn household that had no justification in factbut there was a pride that was justified like wisdom of its children and that was the pride we took in the shining achievements of the sister states of the imperial commonwealth cheers when all had won such imperishable fame it was invidious ahmost impossibleto distinguish on all the fronts of war the dominion forces had shared renown that could never be erased from human nnemorv he heard it suggested by one of their guests that the part taken by the dominion services in the war had been exaggerated by the dominion press such was not our view the home press did not yild a jot to the dominion press in its genuine and unstinted adtiration for the spirit which had impelled the dominions to send us one in  and one in nine of their communities on the greatest of all crusades during the war the news paper press of all the commonwealths which make up the empire had formed up on the same alinement and there never was a time when the understanding was better with the vastand various organizations of the empires press the old spirit of downing street which was not confined to the colonial office or to any government office and which even pene trated to fleetstreet had been finally exorcised by the compelling necessities of warpaiss and governrtthe newspapers were in the mood for yet closer intimacy and cooperation it was only through the newvspaper press that the nminds of men could be shaped and moulded from dav to day almost from hour to hour to the comnion ideals and purposes of patriotism and union to those who wvere corming on to the generation of our young and rising hope it was both teacher and preacher the power of the press was bound to grow with the growth of popular government nobody in their senses could allege that the press of the empire was badly informed or weakly constructed but this war had taught them that there wvas a need for further understanding and mutual service among themselves the groat divi sions of the newspapers of the empire represented there thatnight had many sides and many features they had grown to their full strength and stature on the footing of independence and selfrespect in that way they had become necessary to the machinery of government and were so to an everincreasing degree bult they were not part of the government machine and he hoped they never would be cheers criticism was the selection of the best and to give the people the best they could in the way of men and measures they must ever be critics anl even severe critics and sometimes advocates and even enthusiastic advocates but not the actors and agents of any government no matter what its colour or combinaation of colours if they wvished the press to be the mouthpiece of the public the british press welcomed its visitors back to their spiritual home by the banks of the river
