a new conception ofindustrymajor astors idealmajoi astob mp parliamentary secretary toi the ministry of food speaking at the holborn restaurant yesterday as the guest at luncheon of tho rotary club told how with industrial recon struction in his mind he succeeded in reconciiing the points of view of matters and menhe said that some time ago he invited eight or a dozen trade union leaders in plymouth his con stituency to spend a weekend with him in order that they might discuss what had been wrong in the past and how they might try to improve matters in the future aftera long sitting they ended up on terra firmae later bo invited an equal number of employers to stay with him and vvithout knowing it both parties came to the same conclusion alike as to the past and the future then he invited both sides to visit him to their com plete surprise they unanimously agreed as to what had been wrong in the past and what was neces sary in the futuie and they formed themselves into an industrial reconstruction association not only did capital and labour not question each others point of view but he found that they had never come together before as soon as they had agreed on the defilnition of capital their task in arriving at agreement was enormously simplified they were all agreed that every form of capital was entitled to receive its particular form of interest  and then they found themselves discussing what its ordinary and fair remuneration should be altenvards they dis cussed what should be done with surplus profit but did not arrive at any solution as to the vay in which it sbould be dealt wvithon the question of the livfng wage it was re garded as not fair that industry should have to bear the burden of bringing up a mans family and the conclusion they came to was that the state and not industry ought to bear that burden and that responsi bility they were of opinion that  mans income should be such a sum as would enable him to live in comfort and decency and that the responsibility was on the state to assist in the matter of educa tion medical service maternity service and the free feeding of school children another point discussed was the obvious and admitted unfairness of twro groups of men belonging to difofrent industries putting forth the same amount of energy labonr nnd skilu in the samo locality and earning largely different incomes it was felt to be particularly unfair when it was realized that that was due to the tact that one industry had been well organized in the past and another had been badly organized or not organized at allwhat they had to look forward to major astor said was a more general system of remuneration in the past our standard of guccess had been too much gauged by a purely cash basis if we could have a neew conception of industry and look upon it as a form of national service and it all connected with industry felt that they did not require flnancial stimulus as in the past their reward being in the teeling that they were serving the state we should be able to get a new gpirit in the country which would be worth living for
