the somme i i  fightingin a battletornv illagetale of a tankfrom our speclal correspondentwar correspondents heaiquarters aw quiet continues on the british sector of the battle front last night on the north side of the somme our troops had ome fighting on a araal scale and pushed the line there forw ard slightly our front now running from east of and including etinehem to a point about a mile west of bray and thence northwestward to the ancre east of dernancourt it is hardly necessary to repeat the evident determination of the germans to hold the high ground south and southeast of mieaulte if they can in the recent battle we have not attacked it apparently the th wiirtemberg division which was brought in for the attack made by the enemy on august  in the area north of the sommue has suffered so mueh that it has had to be wvithdrawn i believe there remain in the line here the other three wuirtemberg divisions which have been brought in since our advancethe th the th and the rdsouth of the somme the night passed quietly except for artillery fire and aeroplane activity which was intense the germans especially have been shelling the framerville and vau villers area heavily at intervals as well as the region by parvillers and enemy aeroplanes were aetive in the darkness both immediately alonig the lines and over the back areas no infantry movement of importance however has taken placeat chipillyi have this morning been in chipilly and from the high ground east of it looked down on etinehem which the germans at tho time were shelling with some industry using chiefly shrapnel i approached the village by the south through cerisy and over the germanbuilt wooden bridge which spans the river here and passes over the lagoons of the valley bottom lthe former iron bridge lies with one end in mid stream in a former message i spoke of the extraordinary strength of the village for defence against attack from the north and west lying as it does below the level of the surrounding country on the valley bottom to which the plain breaks down in sudden jagged banls which are everywheie honeycombed like old cliffdwellers habitations with dugouts gun positions and machinegun posts even to one who lnew it before the formidable charaeter of the positions in the iight of the last few days fighting was particularly impressive as the tunnelled banks and rugged hill faces lay naked and exposed to one approaching from the southchipilly is but the ghost of a village now the last time i visited it a brigade of gallant cana dian cavalry were there i looked for the buiid ing where i was present when officers assembled for a brigade conference i found it would be a poor affair for any headquarters now witn walls pierced with ragged holes and the road though fairly intact all tilted askew like a hat on a tipsy headall the village is similarly ruined and a pathetic sight is the old chureh a mere husk with the space inside the broken walls heaped with piles of spilinterid masonry but amid all the ruin on either side of the shattered altar two large lifesize statues of our saviour and the blessed virgin still stand intact on pedestals against walls and gaze at each other across the wreckage even as i stood there the bullet of a rifle or machinegun from somewhere east ward or overhead by etinchem whipped wickedly against the fragmentary walls and splinters of stone were flung inside the chureh no house remains intact and fewt are anything more than heaps of rubble and skeleton beams the chief sign of life in the village was the swallows which have chosen this dreadful spot as a gathering place for their journey south and streamied among the ruinsclambering out of the vilage to the eastward one could get a noble view of the lovely wind ings of the rver and of the village of etinehem over w hich shells burst constantly vhile now and again great clouds of smoke went up from the ruims as a heavy shell ploughed its way througha great achievementturning north along the plateau we had spread beforc us as the germans saw it the ground over which our men had to come to attack the woodswalard wood and celestins wood on the left and gressaire wood on the right they are not wrecked as many woods are nowva days but still are fairly leafy the northern edge of the high ground is one wide clover field which in the sunshine today was fuu of butter flies but from it one looked across the deep hollow which runs to the bare face of the opposing slope down which our men lad tp advance and at ones feet amid the clover were the trenches and machinegun posts from which the enemy commanded that open slope i think it is necessary that one should stand there with the wreckage of the recent battle round one to understand how great an achievement it iras when first our troops pushed across that deadly glacis and by sheer indomnitable courage cleared the dark mass of gressaire woodotherwiso the country is enormously interest ing but the sights are such as i have already described in telling both of this and other battle fields it was wonderful today to see bunches of our men with naked bodics gleaming white in the sun bathing in peaceful reaches of the somme where doubtless the germans bathed a few days agoas one went by the shelltom roads through the litter of the battlefield everywhere were signs of the rapidity of the germnan flight and along the roadsides ready to be moved were gathered piles or parks of all manner of booty including sometimes batteries of guns and in one place a whole family of trenchmortars from great big grandpapas throwing b shells over  yards to the latest little in twin infantsreceived one villagei heard today a nice story from australian otfcers concerning the capture of warceleave village on the first day of the battle marcelcave was difficult of attack in front in face of its machinegun defences so two coinpanies of aus tralians with one tank came down on it from behind on tho north the tank went first and was so efficient that after it had perambulated the village thro wvas nothing left for the infantry to do then the tank formally handed over the village to the australians and the corn mandin oficers of the two companies concerned gave the tanlk commnander a full receipt therefornamely item teceived on august  from commnlier  tank no  one village of marcolcavi in indifferent repair and soforth that receipt is a pleasant souvenir for the tank commander to keep hereaftertanks also were very valuable in the more recent capturo f morlancourt where light tanks or whi ets were used as well as the heavy types of mae runcs as i told at tho time the germans made no serious resistance but our infantry saw the panicstricken enemy running as fast as they could with xrhippets in pursuit and ploughinig first into one party of fugitives then into another but for the horror of it it was ludicrous and theaerman losses apart from prisoners wers heavy the weather is still superb
