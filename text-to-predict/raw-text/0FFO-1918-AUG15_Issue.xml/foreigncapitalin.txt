exoedient in the companies acts  to  particularly having egard to circumstances arising out of thc way and the develop tnmts likely to arise on its conclusion was issued yesterdaythe chairman of the committee was lord wren bury and the other mem bers were mr a s comyrs carr sir frank crisp mr g w currie mp mtr f gorebrowne kcc mr jamns martin the hon a  mills sir r d muir mr c t needham mp mir h

committee issued in tho first instance a number of questions to selected persons and bodies of persons competent to assist them theso included persons conversant with banking commerce lav shipping accountancy and the stock exchantge evidence was also given before themt orally by  witnessesa question of hign polictthe question which lav in the forefront of their investigations and to which they attributed prime importance was that of the emplovment of foreign capital in british industries in their report the committee statethe preliminarv question whether it is desirable that foreigg capitalshould be freely attracted to this country is one upon which there was little if any difference of opinion the maintenance of london as the financial centre of the world is of the first importance for the wellbeing of the empire any thing which would impede or restrict the free flow of capital to the united kingdom would in itself be prejudicial to imperial interests and anv legislation which would tend to impede or resttict the free flow of capital here by imposing restrictions or creating impediments ought to be jealously watched lest in the endeavour to prevent what has come to be caued peaceful penetration the normal course of commercial development should be arrested it is to be borne in mind that at the conclusion of the warif it should be concluded upon such terns as we hope and anticipatethere is no probability that the countries which are now tho enemies of the allies wil bo those which will be in possession of capital looking for external emplovment outside the coun tries of the allies it nmay be said speaking generally andl subject to exceptions of no great mnoment that europe will have little surplus capital to investv the foreign capital wshich we have to contempltwill be cadtal flowing not from the central emdies of europe but from other parts of the world of whichi america may be the chief to impose restrictions upon the influx of capital aimed at our present enermies with the result of deterring the fow of capital from say america would be a poliy highly injurious to tho economic recovery and renewed prosperity of this country after the war for these reasons we are of opinion that in all amendments of the law falling within the scope of our reference the expediency of the attraction of foreign capital should be steadily borne in mind and anything which wvould have a restrictive or deterrent effect should as far as possible be avoidedat the root of the whole matter the committee point out lies a question which is not one of company law amendment at all but one of high political and economic policy they observelit does not fall within our province to inquire whether the traditional policy of this country to admit and welcome all who seek our shores and submit themselves loyally to our laws ought in the case of some and what aliens to be revised whether any and what restrictions ought to be imposed upon the alien who ip any one of these three characters seeks to come here or whether discrimination ought to be made between an alien of one nationality and an alien of another that is a question of high political and econo mic policy which it is not for us to determine the ques tion of naturalized british subject as distinguished from british subject britishborn is again beyond ouir sphere we mav probably assume that as regards aliens generally there is no intention to change the traditional policy of the country and that we have to inquire whetherthat being soany amendment of the law of joint stock companies is expedient having regard to circumstances arising out of the war but as regards aliens who are now our enemies it may be that the british empire may adopt the policy that a special stigma ought to be attached to the german and that neither as an individual nor as a firm nor as a corporation ought he for a time at any rate to be admitted to commercial fellowshir or to any fellowship with the civilized nations of the world the existence of these questions has greatly increased the difficulty of our taskfor until the policy is kiiown it is not possible to say how the companies acts should be amended to give effect to it it has thus become necessary for us to indicate our conclusions n alternative form according as the policy adopted in these respects is one or anotheraiies sbareholdemsthe committee recall that in april  the com mnittee appointed by the board of trade to investi gate the general question of trade relations after the war reported against imposing restrictions upon aliens becoming shareholders in british corporations but in favour of definite information as to the nationality of the shareholders in every british company on the other hand lord balfour of burleighs committee in december  dis couraged any attempt to secure this informationmany of those who have made written replies to the questions put by lord wrenburys committee or who gave evidence before them expressed opinions in favour of disclosure of nationality by all share holders and in some cases of limitation of the pro portion which aliens may hold of the share capital of a company others on the contrary are im pressed with the mischief which may result from restrictions whose tendency will be to deter the influx of foreign capitalthe report goes on to state that if foreign capital is to be attracted here it folloxvs that so far as such capital is invested in or utilied for the industries of joint stock companies it must be represented either by shares in sueh companies or by debentures representing indebtedness by them and that its employment must be controlled by boards of direc tors appointed from time to time by the oners of the invested capital the question therefore is whether restrictions ought to be imposed upon the extent to which the control of the company shall be alloved to reside in aliens either by reason of their holding a majority of the shares or of the debentures or by reason of their obtaining a majority upon the board ofdirectors and if so hbw thedis closure of their alien character is to be enforced before dealing with this question the committee point out difficuties which present themselves in the way of securing disclosure of nationality and ensuring that aliens sh not command the control assuming that it is desirable to prevent their doing so the law of trusts is firmly established in this country if a be the registered holder of a share he is not necessarily the beneficial owner he may be a trustee for b to cnict that the registered holder must be a british subject effects nothing for b may be an alien and an enemy suppose however that you enact that a when his share is allotted or transferred to him shali make a declaration that he holds in his own rightor that heholds in trust for b and that both a and b are british subjects there is nothing to prevent the crea tion of a new trust the next day under which c an alien enemy will be the person beneficially entitled the only effectual way of dealing with the matter would be by a provision that the share might be forfeited or might be sold and the proceeds paid to the owner if an alien should be or become beneflcially entitled to or interested in the share such a provi sion does not in the general case commerid itself to us as practical or desirablequesrioxs to be de crnxdhaving pointed out these difriculties the committee approach next the question of policy bearing in mind the sources from which as indicated above foreign capital may after the war be expected to come they then enumerate the questions which must be decided i is it desirable to legislate in the direction of forbidding the employment of foreign capital here in joint stock companies unless some such pro visions as the following are satisfied that there shall be disclosure of the aliencharacter of the foreign owner that not more than a certain proportion ofthe companys shares shall be held by aliens that the board or a certain proportion ofthe board shall not be alien andii is it desirable to discriminate between one alienand another and to legislate in that direction in the case of certain aliens and not of others n our answer to these questions we find it necessary to discriminate between different classes of com raiies and we divide them intoctass acompanies generallv not being companieswithin classes b and tclass rcompanics owning british shipping and class ccompanies engaged in  key  industriesv the remainder of the report it is
