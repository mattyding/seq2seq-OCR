the americannorthwestwar work of fourstateshelping the common causeby muajau c eartin the following article mr william cedgar the editor of the  bellman  and of  the  northwestern miller of mdinneapolis describes what the four states of minnesota north dakota south dakota and montana have done and are doing as their share in assuring the success of the allied causewhile the general attitude of the uinited states as a whole towards the war is of course well understood in the united kingdom it is probable that comparatively few people inthis country realize what a stronghold the cause of the allies has taken upon that portion of america which lies far beyond the alleghany mountains about the headwaters of the mississippithat part commonly called the northwest here there prevails a spirit of sacrifice devotion and earnest sober determination to fight germany to the last man and the last dollar this is the more interesting and extraordinary because a very large proportion of the population is not anglosaxon in its ancestry inheritance and traditions being composed of swedes and xor wegians germans bohemians and danes with a considerable number of poles and russians who have become american citizensenlightening the publicthose of us living in the northwest of british ancestry were practically of one mind when ger many invaded belgium and england declared war there was no question where our sym pathies and inclinations were from the beginning although we were constrained to remain neutral by the policy of our government it was the problem of bringing into line our fellowcitizens of far different ancestry and tradition equally entitled to consideration in the event of warand equally or even more essential to the success of a national war programme that gave us the greatest concern what on a small scale was our owvn sectional problem was on a larger scale the mighty problem of our president for the solu tion of which time and enlightenment and the gradual spread of understanding of germanys fell objects were absolutely essential hence as enigland now fully understands the three long years of patient hopeful waiting for the ap pointed time to come the sure manner in which it came about constitutes an interesting psycho logical study of thle development of national solidarity of opinion and action mostgratifying to the american who now views his country as having found itselfthe northwest of which i am writing and whence i come consists of the states of minne sota north oahota south dakota and montana it would be proper to include the northern part of wisconsin and a part of western michigan which are adjacent and commercially and indus trially closely allied wvith it but for purposes of statistical convenience i have omitted them these four states have the dimensions of an empire consisting of  square miles some what more than onetenth of the total area of the united states roughly they are combined more than three times the size of england wales scotland and ireland and over  per cent greater than the area of the german empire so much for the mere matter of size which is unimportant in this connexion the thingsthat count in the prosecution of the war are the men money food and material that may be contri buted from any given sectionit seems to me that it would profit and might encourage some of the warveary in england to understand what the american northwest has devoted and will devote to the promotion of the cause which it has unanimously accepted as its very own and to which it is irrevocably and un reservedly committed not only because the sum of these available resources is in itself consider able but because the spirit at the back of this section of the united states is significant of that of the whole countrythe call of the seamiinneapolis is the chief city of the northwest and the combined population of its neighbour st paul and itself exceeds half a million people being about oneeighth of the population of the four states it is  miles northwest from new y ork and about  miles from the pacific coast thus situated remote in either direction from theocean it is remarkable that the enlist ments in the united states navy service in which is purely voluntary at the minneapolis recruit ing station should be the largest per head of any city in the united states and actually in point of numbers only second in the whole country this is very largely due to an interesting phe nomenon of race instinct the territory tributary to this recruiting station is largely populated by scandinavian farmers whose sons have never been near the ocean the nearest approach to it they have ever seen are the almost boundless fields of waving wheat upon which they have been raised and which they have helped to culti vate yet the old blood of the vikings runs in their veins and the call of the sea appeals to theni with an irresistible force when the united states declared war these blueeyed yellow haired boys fresh from the farms flocked to the nearest recruiting station eager to be enrolled in the naval servicearmy recruitlncthe american army is recruited by selective draft this went into effect in july  and from that date until the middle of december was the real test of its effectiveness in the north west the experience of the district board of which i was a member is typical of all the others in this section lts jurisdiction covered a cityof nearly  people and  surrounding coun ties containing a large population of foreign descent naturally loth to go to war following the first call  registrants were reported the quota of minnesota was  and it wias filled promptly by a draft of  men  baving already volunteered and entered the ser vice the change in feeling towards compulsory military service as exemplified by the experi ence of this board is remarkable and significant at first there was widespread but not truculent opposition on the part of those vho were selected to join the army all manner of excuses were urged for exemption a very insistent plea being the need for farm workers at home the various district boards gave these excuses very careful attention and none were exempted unless abso lutely required for war purposes at home and  war purposes of course included the produc tion of food and munitions the law worked smoothly and inexorably and in due time the recruits many of them most reluctant to leave home were sent to the training camps to be made into soldiers before the second call was made many of these newly made soldiers returned home for brief leave the contrast between the stoopshoul dered slouchy recruit who often unwillingly had gone to camp and the upstanding manly cleareyed youth who returned home after but a short period of training was marvellous more over the change in his attitude towards the war was equally amazing the contagion of a great idea and the inspiration of a cause which he vasnow proud and glad to serve had metamorphosed him  whereas he went away a hind a dtllwitted lout perhaps he came back every inch a man anid eager to go forth to battle for an object which lie had learned to know was worth the greatest sacrificethe effect of these human objectlessons in the eities towns and villages of the northwest was instantaneously beneficent thereafter hiow best to serve the government became the first thouglt andinividual interests the last therewas no difficulty in getting men to serve and there wvill be none in the northwest up to the extreme limit of the governments
