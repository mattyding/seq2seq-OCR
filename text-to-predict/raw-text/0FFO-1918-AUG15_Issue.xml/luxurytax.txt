luty tax womenscriticism of price limits views of trahes affected lnere was much discussion yesterday in the home and in the shops of the proposals of the select coni inittee on luxury duty and criticism of many aspects of the report wasnot wanting itis under stood that as soon as parliamentrcassembles in the aututmn tliechancelloroithe exchqudr wil bo asked to give facilities for a general discussion onl the report mfednhile theomniitteel proposals nwill be considered by mr bonar lawv and his advisors during the recess below we print some opinions eollected yesterday on the probable effects of the schemedress andous linena woman correspondent writesthe resignations of miss craig of the national federation of women workers and of miss violet markham aud mrs vaughan nash whom the seleet conmittee had called intb consultation created a general suspicion among women that the taxation was likely to be on a wrong basis the lists of prices in the cornmittees report abunantly fulfil the expectations a middleelass woman with a large family to clothe said yesterday  it is an obvious attempt to get back some of the munition workers high wages bt the scheme is so clumsy thatif it ever came into operation it would give a new value to shoddy while making good clothes with wearing qualities impossible for growing families with fixed incomes rather than pay the tax a certainnumberof the getrichquick workers would always buy the cheaper article renewing it often thus creating a new demand for it and causing a rise in price people lke myself would have to pay the rise in ptice though unable to renew frequentlya visit to a large firm doing a mediumclass trade revealed some of the flaws in the schedule the childrens department did not contain a single coat foa girl of  the priceof which did not exceed £ the nonhlxury lbitn the cost price of girls school coats of blanket cloth ordered from the wholesaler in jtune was ss d  we are rationed by the manufacturer in these said the buyer for tha department  i have only been allowed  and teey are already nearly all gone i shall have to pay more for the next order the schedule seems to be based on cost price in most cases rather than a fair average retail a mediumclass coat and skirt for a girl of  cannot be bought wholesale under £ the price limit la the scheduleseven guineas islthe phee beyond which womens eostumes become aluxury according to the schedule but the only costumes available at this price were those which used to cost  guineas before the wa and they were obviously not economical to buy ten guineas the equivalent of  guineas before the wvar was the lowest figure at which a plain tailor made with any claim to stand the wear and tear of omnibus and  tube  crowds could be bought smart readymades cost £ sk at the fabric counters the buyers said that the mistake of not stating dngle or double width was a grave omission single width fabrics though wasteful to cut would evadethe tax while on the double widths it would be paid no cotton fabrics at s a yard the price limit were in stock in double width and all the double width voiles were at about is d sometimeago single widths at about half that price were made but the greater economy of the double width material drove them from the market that means that practicallyon all eotton voiles and the like the tax would be payable por s a yard retail the lmit for nonluxury dress materials nothing could be bought the buyer said  the lowest we can buy wholesale is los and then it is of the poorest quality we shall not be able to sell a gabardine under s l id a yard this winter and we do not guarantee anything as pure wool in this department the comment was also made that the wholesale and not the retail price bad apparently been taken as a guide the books showed that tie prices of fabrics have risen by leaps and boundsthe prices fixed for nonluxury hats seemed to escape criticism but the proposed taxation of the enen cupboard is a serious matter to the housewife the prices of cotton and linen have already risen high enough without a luxorytax no linen sheets can be bought at £ s a pair the nonluxury lmit and no linen pilow case at s a run on cotton goods would be the result of such a tax it is difficult to see why blankets at  apair wvere incuded who ever drew up this schedule cannot have knuown that only standard blaukets are available and for these the price is fixed at ols d wines and spiritsthe following statement of the wine merchants point of view has been sdipplied to us by mr francis dowmnanit would be hard to find a wine merchant who is going to lose anights rest over the schedules assuming them to beiadoptedbythegovernment just as they standthere would be no great skrinkago of business if the tins ordinaires had been inicluded there would have been a food tax to fight but claret sauternes burgundy and chablis priced higher than s a dozen are certainly lusxiiesport is the wine which comes off worst the genuine stuffthat is to say alto douro wine of full alcoholic strengthcan no longer be profitably sold at s a bottle this means that while drinkers of french vine and of sboteh whisky could dodge the tax eltogether the oldfashioned port lover would have to pay every time threeor four years algo the freight and insurance ofa pipe of port comning from oporto to london cost less than £  but the last ship ments have cost between £ and £ under these heads and the wine itselfis also much dearer as port is not merely afood but a food which eases the sugar problem it would be wiser and fairerto put port with sherry andmaaeira ina separate category at six shillings instead of fivenot only champagne but practically all the other sparklng wines would rank among the tasable drinks it is hoped hoever that the removal of the german menace to roims and epernay may brig champagne prices down a little in which event the consumer would pay no moreincluding the tax than he is paying todaythe distinction between sa gallon in bottle and £ s d in cask  has a fln air of exact know ledge atany will be impressed by the punctilious d as two gallons yield one dozen the iguhres imply that a dozen of winel ean be bottled ted matured for half a erown five shiltings wouldtbe nearer the mark and this disclosute ofmignorance makes wine merchants distrust the schedules in genoeral

by the trade in books and pictures the sitck has to be constantly renewed and the thingsthat are sold have to help to pay for those which were boughtasid paid for years ago and now seem to be wanted by no one codlsequently large profits are inevitable presumably the new tax will be fixed according to the price received by the dealer and not on the cost price in any case the customer will pay to a

auctioneers fear that the tax will encourage collectors to trade privatela with one another in valu able pictures and fine old french furniture in order to save auctioneers commission and dealers
