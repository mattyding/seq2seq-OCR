german naval policyian impending chiange from our naval correspondentall the measures taken to deal with the submarine campaign fau into two categorieis those which are employed at sea to get rid ot the submarine itself and those which are undertaken on land to repair the damage wrought it vwill not be denied that con siderable success has been nttained in botli directions yet no specific has been lound for the submarine and if it wvere not for the american effort mercantile ship building production would not have outstripped the ravages of the uboat it is futile to assert that the menace has been mastered so long as the uboats can continue to ply their evil trade in the channelapart from the alliinportant need for improving the output ofbritish shipping the most interesting question at present concerns the omlicial view taken in germany of the tboat campaign does the retire ment of grand admiral von holtzendorff and the selection of admiral scheer as his successor for the post of chief of the admiralty staff indicate a coming change in german naval strategy  the report that admiral capelle is also leavng and viceadmiral behncke will take his place as naval secretary of state loks as if something of the kind was contem plated admiral behncke who was vicechief of the naval staff until septeriiber  was supposed not to be an outandout supporter of tirpitzs submarine campaign although he defended it in conversation with an american naval officer if the high military command dorminating the naval situation has at length realzed the futility of ruthless submarine warfare as a decisive factor an increase of liveliness may be expected in the north sca a younger school of german naval officers is said to exist and to be in tensely dissatisfied with the inactive rtlc which the high seas fleet has played for some time past as a coast defence force anything may happen if admiral scheer has gone to berlin to initiate a more forward policy this would not necessarily mean that ruthless submarine warfare was abandoned but it might account to some extent for dr macnamaras statement last week that the admiraltvy detects no marked in crease in activity of submarines the uboats may be wanted for another purpose the recent scuffle off the dutch coast in which the germans lost a zeppelin and our casualties were some small motorboats is significant of the vigilant and continuous watch kept on the german movements we can afford to lose several little  scooters and apparently the crews were savedif we put out the eyes of the german navy chiefs by destroying zeppelins the movement on the fringe of the german position is obviously a part of the submarine campaign because as the activities of the uboats are restricted and confined by the british minefields it is estential to pick up their traces as soon as ihey leave their home waters such measures have a greater value now that the submarines have been to a large extent deprived of the use of their lairs on the belgian coast speak ing figuratively the net is ever being dravn tighter and as captain persius said a few days ago  now our submarines have a task which is so difficult that it may almost be described as superhuman  there are several factors therefore which point to a possible hange in german naval strategy and experience teaches that a scuffle between small craft may easily grow into quite a respectable naval engagenaent
