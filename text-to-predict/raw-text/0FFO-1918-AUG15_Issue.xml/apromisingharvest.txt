a promising harvestprices still not fixed by our agiucultl coespondstthe corn harvest is novw in full swing in the greater part of england the start last muonth was not auspicious but conditions have since improved and thousands of acres have been cut and a considerable area carted the crops of wheat have seldom been finer and bar ey and oats are bulking better than had been expected although many fields of spring cereals wili not be difficult to cart with the general character of the corn harvest however there is very littlo ground for complaint the crops are we developed healthy and uniformly matured and if they can be safely gathered the national xtackyard will be filled as it has not been for more than a generation whatever else maybesaid of the work of the food production department ithas assured to the countrysubject to a safe harvesta bulk o cereals far in excessof the normal and this at a time when labour is searce and wanting in prociency is a feat upon which the department the county committees and especially the farmers are tol be congratulated a bountiful harvest is their pmint contribution to the task of winning the warthe gathering of the crops as well as their growth is determined largely by the weather at the eritical season uncertainty is therefore the chief character istie of the english harvest and it is more than ever to be reckoned with this year because of the great proportion of amateur harvesters engaged never have so many hands been employed that have had no previous experience in the work and willing though they be it is not to be expected that the standard of proficiency will be high the absence of training wiu not bo so noticeable if the weather be fine and laboursaving machinery can be fully utilized but should the weather be wet and the crops be laid and tangled the work would drag on for weeks at great expense to the grower and at risk of depreca tion from prolonged exposurethe hministry of food is still silent respecting the prices that are to be obtainable for the harvest the delay in announcing the fdgures it is to be feared cannot be interpreted as foreshadowing terms advan tageous for the grower the inaustry is insufficiently represented upon the advisory bodies and trading iterests as usual will prevailthere is one point coneerning which firmer action is urgentnamely the sale of inferior grain for feeding to poultry and pigs buyers have to pay exorbitant prices for what is often little better than rubbish a correspondent says that he was charged s for two bushels of inferior oats and a corre spondingly high price for chicken foodhalf of which the chickens left on the ground the farmer is not the offender for his flied price for the quantity of oats would be less than los it is a gross injustice to both farmers and consumers that traillc in the lowergrade ceieals should be uncontrolled and a loss to the country that the small buyers should be ex ploited in this way
