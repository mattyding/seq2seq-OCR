with all that was best for the country and one that would do its best to improve tho condition of every class cheersmr josern howanr seconded the resolution which vas carried wvith a few dissentiontslords george h cilton who was loudly cheered on rising said that he wished tc say a few words of farewell as that occasion would be the last on which he would ever have the opportunity of addressing his friends in the capacity of member for the county of middlesex it was  years since he had first the honour of coming forward as candidate for that county and if on each successive occasion he had had the honour of being returned at the head of the poll it had been entirely due to the onergy and devotion by which he had been supported by his friends and to the fact that during the past  years there had been a steady gravitation of moderate liberals towvards the conservative party on the occasion of his first speak ing in that neighlourhood his strongest opponent was their present chairman who was at thaw timeamcderate liberal but who found that he had been deceived and lilre an honest and straightforward man came round to that party with whose principles he found himself in every respect in accord cheers that which changed hir littler had changed many other personsthe utter inability of tho radical party to make good the promises by which they caught votes at the hustings seventeen years ago mlr gladstone came forward and told them that if they would allow him to destroy the established church in ireland he would promote contentment and loyalty in that country rhere was not one single movement in ireland which ilr gladstoue wished to quench that he had not promoted there was not a single motive power which ho vished to increese that he had not contrived to obliterate five years ago the radical government assumed office with the object of reducing the taxes and restoring depressed trade and now the people were expected to swallow wholesale any audacious programme of socialism wvhich ilr chalmber lain might dangle before the eyes of those who were not well initiated in public affairs cheers the conserva tive party were not cager for office when they lately as sumed it lno saue or sensible body of men would have been willing to takc office in face of the tremendous difficulties hbut that which did induce them to take office was the knowledge that there was a number of pressing questions and especially the negotia tious with russia which were likely to drift into a position unless a responsible government was soon forned which wvould land this country in war with russia during the six weeks that the conservatives were in office they succeeded in passing the housing of the working classes sct the criminal law amendment act and also in placing the irish land question upon a better foot ing those measures nvould contrast favourably with any egslation which during the jive preceding years with an overwhelming majority had been passed by their op ponents checrs in foreign affairs pledged as they were by the obligations of their predecessors they had brought negotiations to a successful termina tion  and lastly it was mostly due to the cordial relations which they had wvith the great powers of europe that hope of peace for europe in pre venting an agitation in bulgaria mainly lay the radicals in all their addresses laid stress upon their determination hecafter to maintain a strong and efficient navy it was the radical party who when they wero in office allowed the navy to become weak it was admitted by the late government that the navy was insufiicient to perform its duties audiu consequence they proposed to vote an ad ditioual swun of t during the next three years in order to bring the navy up to its reqaisite strength  there fore he assumed that the navy was not at its requisite strength at that time what was the object of having a strong navy  to protect the nations initerests if wve were at war and exactly at the moment that we were nearest at war with a great eluropean power we were weakler in the navy than t any time during the last  years it was a fact that this nation wouild hardly derive any benefit from that extra sum of ï¿½ for two years to come the moral they might draw from the danger fronm wvhich they had escaped was that if they wanted to have a strong navy they must harc that navy continuously kept up to its strength  and if they once allowed it to get below that strength which wvas requisite for the protection of their commereeno isnumediate or hasty expenditurewoulddo any good he believed that the only way by which ithey could secure permanent peace was by asserting with firm ness and resolution their interests abroad the conserva tivos might fairly say that during the past few months they had succeeded in managing their affairs with dis cretion and wvith success hear hear and therefore wlhen the proposals came from two parties one of which had unider most favourable conditions absolutely failedand the other uinder most nnfa vourable circumstances had parti ally succeecded surely coimmon sense would iudicate that they shouid throw in their lot wil thoso who had sue coeded if a conscrvativc majority should be returned they would eudeavour to inanag affairs ontbose principles which coutld alone maintain the vast and multifarious in terests of a great lempire such as englandviz the priuciples of commion sense and patriotism loud cheers
