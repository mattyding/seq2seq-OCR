latest intelligencethe eastern crisisfrom oim coremspondentsvienna oct prince alexanders return to sofia has been promptly followed by the announcement that the bulgarian cabinet will defer to the principles formulated in the recent collective note of the ambassadors the recall of the bulgarian troops from eastern roumelia will be the natural conse quence of this submission to the treaty of berlin indeed the government can no longer afford to maintain the enormous cohort of troops that was collected under the influence of revolutionary en thusiasm and ugly stories have been coming from l hiilippopolis of discontent in the city and camp of hardly suppressed mutiny and of disorganization everywhere it is certain that the retirement of the russian officers who wore in tho bulgarian and ronmelian service must havo throwvn the whole armiy out ol gear prince alexander had to com mission officers pretty muclh at random and a great many of those cosmopolitan polyglot adventurers who are always forthcoming when colonelcies and captaincics are being distributed seem to have been as successful as usual in obtaining good ap pointments so long as the troops were in the first flush of their excitement and obeyed orders with alacrity it mattered little wvho was at their head but wvhen discipline had to be introduced under most dispiriting conditionsthat is wvith short pay a failing commissariat and wvith no certainty as to what the army was going to do then the want of popular and trustworthy officers began to be badly felta great many of the soldiers appear to have been irumbling at having been summoned away from thleir occupations comparing notes together on the march and in the tedium of camp life they doubtless convinced one another that they were not ready for a war in earnest and from tho moment wvhen this persuasion wvas spread rumours of turkish advances caused continual panics a telegram from philippopolis today says that the utmost order prevails and that the peopleas loyal as ever to prince alexander are looking confidently for his speedy return but the despatch is from an official source and does not tally with impartial reports now a week old which have come by post the authorities at philippopolis and sofia do not allow unfavourable news to pass the wires and so we can only conjecture at present what effect has been produced at philippopolis by the princes departure and what furthereffect willbe occasioned by the recall of the crestfallen troops it may be guessedhowevertbat russian emissaries will now avail themselves to the utmost of their chance to promlote disaffection against prince alexandermieanwhile a telegram from nish today states that  from motives of economy some troops have been sent back to belgrade and further reports confirm the impression that tho envoys of germany austria and russia havo cautioned king milan to such good purpose that lie no longer contemplates rushing into a war of adventure it is nct yet believed howevor that ho will disband his army and return himself to belgrade it is still thought that he will occupy the district between turn and bresnik but that he will do this without declaration of wvar alleging merely that he must protect his frontiers it is also thought that he may be allowed to keep the dis trict in question he is reported to have said yesterday that there was no alternative for him between  action and abdication and that if he wvere forced to descend from his throne he should feel that he had been betrayedwhatever consequences may accrue to sing milan personally from his failure to disturb the peace of europeassuming that he does failit cannot be questioned that it was the duty of the three emperors to stop him from setting the whole bzalkan peninsula in a blaze prince peter karageorgevics wio has had an interview with a correspondent of the buda pester tagblatt insists that austriahungary is to blame for the mobili zation of the servian army the princo who has uow gone to cettinje said that montenegro could not remain inactive if servia roumania and greece decided upon action the tone in servia lie thought was more favourablo than ever to the house of karageorgevics but he did not consider tho present moment to be suitable for coming forward with his claims to the servian throne  it is true he added  that political con ditions may compel me to undertake an action but this will scarcely be tho case for the next few weeks at a given moment i shall be found in my place with regard to russias attitude tho prince was reserved in his expressions  at any rate  he said  russia could not but be averse from a war between balgaria and servia as the enemy of all slavs on the balkan peninsusa would be turkey for king milan a bloody war with the bulgarians would certainly signify le commence iiteitf de a finwa correspondent of the xcue frcie presse has had an interview with a russian statesman who strenuously advocated the deposition of prince alexander as tho only sure means of pacifying bulgaria and rournelia  if the prince resists said the ikussiad  tho turks should be set to march against him this possible intervention of turkey need not alarm us for there would be no real war the bulgarians can offer no resistance for they lhave no officers since the russians havo left them and especially no generals the turks wvould simply enforce the decreo of deposition and theni retirethis language may be set beside that which the pruiissels nvjed of yesterday uses about prince alexander and one may divine from it that a last determnined effort will now be made by russia to bring the porte to propose the princes deposition the attemptunsupported bv any other power and clearlv contrarv to turkish interests could only succeed if certain turkish statesmen allowed them selves to be thorouglly inveigled  but even if lrussiani diplonmatic alcts should fail it may already be seen that should the work of the approaching new conference or conferences be not finished very quickly prince alexanders position will soon have become almost untenable the aree inent between the three powers appears to contain no condition that russia should desist fromintrigues against the prince whom it is austrias interest if not germanys to maintain as ruler over bulgaria and eastern roumelia and there is every prospect of theso intrigues being carried on to the detriment of all peace in bulgaria until they either succeed in driving away tho prince or until the prince can definitely foil them by getting established under european sanction in a ojsition of effective power and independenceberlin oct the north german gazette of this morning publishes the following communique from the foreign officethe first semiofficial utterance of tho german government if i mistake not on the subject of the eastern crisis the intelligence we receive as to the steps token by the constantinople ambassadors of the powers who signed the berlin treaty gives un equivocal aud gratifying expression to the resolu tion of these powers to maintain the peace at present provailing among them the decisions of the ambassadors rest upon the common feeling of the powers that the momentous questions as topeace or war cannot be made dependent on a change of mood iin the balkan peninsula the european areopagus wvhich is alone responsible for the maintenance of peace and for the welfaro of the nations declares in a no less solemn than decided manner in its memorandum that tho un justifiable ambition of individual races on the ealkan peninsula cannot be permitted to imperilat will the peace of the great powers by quarrelling vith each other or with turkey and thereby in tentionally or othernise leaving out of account that their partly selfish and partly short sighted policy might result in compelling the great powers to mingle in the dispute aud break the peace which they have been so careful to preserve such proceedings on the part of the petty balkan states must rightly be met with most serious objections sfom the whole of europe the peaco of tho great powers has an interest for all their subjects numbering more than  millions while greece servia and bul garia with eastern roumelia possess at the ut most six million inhabitants of wvhich certainly not even a tenth part in each of these states belongs to the dominant nationality it is at any rate unfair to expect that  millions of euro peans should expose themselves to the danger of being obliged to dispense with the blessings of peace because three petty balkan states with scarcely six million inhabitants suddenly conceive the idea that their local balance of powerthat is to say their particularist ambitionis im perilledthe salient feature of the above communtiquge which bears internal evidence of having been com posed at friedrichsruh is the candid admission that hostilities among the native races of the balkan peninsula would in all probability also evoke an open conflict of interests between two of the great powers which though not named could only be austria and russia and it may be safely inferred that urgent representations in the sense of the above entrefilet have already been made at athens belgrade and sofia indeed if the omens speak true prince alexander notwvithstanding all his brave words about burying his bones on a roumelian battlefield rather than recross the balkans would seem to have at last shown some signs of an inclination to the voice of reason perhaps even of intimidationin another inspired articlecf propos it is diffi cult to see of whatthe orth german gazeite refers to the defective system of cannon lately in troduced into the servian army some time ago when the servian government gave a large order for french guns of the de bange pattern the paris press made haste to raise a shout of exultation at this triumph of the national industry over the boasted products of herr krupp but now the organ of the wilhelmstrasse adduces a long list of accidents and fatalities resulting from the bursting and defective working of de banges gun to prove that the latter is really inferior to the erupp cannon as was otherwise proved by careful and competitive experimenting with guns of the armstrong krupp and de bange type at bel grade why then did the servian government adopt the french gun i  oh says the north gennan gazette  that was merely owing to the superior astuteness of m de bange and to the in fluential social position of the french element in servia which achieved a victory over the krupp cannon does the chancellors mouthpiece mean to hint that this frrench element in servia might bring its influence to bear on the politics as well as on the artillery of king milan ifoonstantinopile oct i have abstained from transmitting the conflicting reports concerning the reply of the powers to the porte until i could confidently give the sense of the document as accurately as possible the powers warmly approve the firm and dignified attitude of the porte and recommend it to con tinue the same course they give an assurance that they fully appreciate the profound wisdom and moderation of his majesty the sultan since all europe condemns theviolation of existing trea ties andthey hold responsible those in authority on both slopes of the balkansand forbidthe concentra tion of bulgarianforces on the roumelian frontiers the powers most emphatically declare their firm intention to preserve the general peace aand the bulgarian population will be held responsible for all rash acts the consequences of which will weigh heavilvyponi them without any reason to hope for any external aid the impression created by this communication has been so far favourable in high official quarters from its tqne and the admission of the jus tieo of the cause of the porte and its enuncia tion of sympathy together with its strong con demnation of the conduct of the bulgarians but at the same time it will be easily under stood that turkey expected those practical means to be applied by the powers which they may deem advisable in the present emergency his majestyhas undeniablygivenproof onthis occasion of deep political perspicacity and right judgment by restraining the unreflecting action of his government or the adoptionof violentmeasures in any direction while he is actively directing pre parations to meet all contingencies a general agreement exists on all sides in favour of a preser vation of the peace and it is hoped that the powers will be prepared to adopt in concert with the porte the necessary steps for securing the common desideratum and the full satisfaction so justly due to turkeytho sultan has power and the means at com mand to enforeo obedieneo and holds in check material force sufficient to secure victory his majestys high sense of what is due to the dignity of his country and his deference to the wishes of the powers that signed the berlin treaty have been fully shown while the present disturbances are manifestly only inspired by a hope that their authors would receive support or be ultimately condoned from without it is said therefore that the porte will address a reply to the collective note of the powers both with respect to necessary action in the case and to guarantees for the futurost petersburg oct communication betwveen the cabinets in regard to the eastern crisis is still going on and a formal conference has evidently been decided upon to meet in all prolaoility at constantinople the collective and preliminary declaration of the am bassadors wvas communicated to servia and greece simultaneously with its delivery at constantinople and sofia and there is some reason to believe thatit has already had a sobering effect at least upon the servian government tor after repeated re ports of servian troops having crossed the bulgarian frontier we learn today from vienna that king milan is now wavering and that the contemplated advance of his troops has beon countermanded in spite of the danger it is thought here that the bellicose excitement of these small rival states of the peninsula will gradually calm down if only timo enough is givon them and that the eventual effect of tho present burden and economical misery which they are imposing upon themselves is more likely to be a return to reason and demobilization than an outbreak of hostilities forced on them in order to put an end to the in supportable strain upon their patience and re sourcesit does not yet appear to be clear in what way the powers will decide to solve the diffi culties of bulgarian unification so as to give no justification to the pretensions of bulgarias neigh bours russia it seems has altogether avoided making any use of the term status quo or status quo ante but seeks a solution in as strict accordance as possible with the berlin treaty if the balkan states refuse to obey the powersit is not probable that turkey would be alone empowvered by europe to enforce obedience as terridole massacres every wvhere would be certain to follow and thus gi f or the rebellious slays the active sympathy of onor raore interested powers very probably the dlecision of the conference wil take the form ofdespatching to philippopolisa special international commission or delegation representing all the signatory powers with authority to declaoe to the bulgarians that in the event of thoir continued opposition to the wish of europeeastern roumelia and bulgaria would be entered by armed force not composed of turkish troops alone and not under the orders of the polte but at the disposi tion of the commissionm aksakoff in his russ has a violent article againstlerussi an diplomacyand its organ the jornal de st petersbourg for avwant of wisdom as he puts it in permitting russia to be completely over reached by all the european powers in this bulgarian businessbruissels ocr sthe alord asserts that the modern principle of the national will is not applicable to the peoples of the balkan peninsula they have been delivered by russia and their autonomous existence is due to the sanction of europe the duty of the powers was to arrest immediately this senseless enterprise prevent its dangerous conse quences reestablish the statuts quo remove the leaders of the intrigue punish the guilty and then to consult in common about possible modi fications of the situation created by the treaty of berlin the nord attributes the inertness of some european governments to their being over wvhelmed by public passions and party politics at homewhich made them look at things not from governmental standpoints but with unavowed afterthoughts the nyord expresses the hope that in presence of the terrible eventualities the governments will understand their interests and fulfil their duties in this case the aord says all will be for the best  right will be reestablished the treaties maintained the authority of europe affirmed the work of berlin revised and the legitimate wishes of the populations appreciated and satisfied within the bounds of the possible the peace and the equilibrium of the east will be consolidatedand the tranquillityof europe will re ceive materially and morally a new consecrationthe st petersburg correspondent of the nord writes that the equilibrium among the balkan states should not be effectively disturbed as this would justify the dangerous competitions from athens and belgrade the russian cabinet seems resolved to act up to this consideration and its action will soon appear in a clear manner as m de giers has again taken the direction after receiving personal instructions from the czar and concerting with prince bismarok the line of conduct to be followeda portion of the above sppeared in our second edition ofsaturdayssofia oct the representatives of the powers today handed to the bulgarian government a collective note in which after praising the attitude adopted by the porte wvith a view to the maintenance of peace they invite the government not to concentrate troops on the frontiers and hold it responsible in the event of peace being disturbed by any such concen tration a cabinet council was held this even ing under the presidency of prince alexander in order to draw up a reply to the noteon his arrival here last night prince alexander met with an enthusiastic reception a demon stration was made in front of the palace and an address was presented to the prince urging him not to abandon the attitude which he had taken up but to do his utmost to secure the union of the two bulgarias his highness in reply de clared that he would mako every sacrifice for the attainment of this object the prince was loudly cheered by the peoplecoroner in the collective note presented yesterday to the bugarian government the powers after ex pressing their appreciation of the wisdom shown by the sultan and their conviction that he will con tinue to do everything compatible with the rights of his sovereignty in order to avoid having re course to force state that they have resolved to accede to his miajestys request for assistance to enable him to quell the agitation which now dis turbs one province of his empire and to reesta blish order and prosperity the powers
