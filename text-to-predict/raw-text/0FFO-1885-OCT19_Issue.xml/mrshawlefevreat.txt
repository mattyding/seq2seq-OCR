mr siajvleifbvre at beadingmr shawlefevre addressed a meeting of the members of the various liberal associations at iteading on saturday evening there vas a crowded attendance and the pro coedings vere very enthusiasticur sitxwletva devoted the first part of his speech to a personal and general retrospect of the last  vears being induced to do so by the fact that tho meeting at which he was speaking w as held on the d anniversary of his first return to parliament turning to more political questions he said ho might remind his hearers that vhen he last addressed them ho had been recently admitted into the cabinet where alone a member of the government had an opportunity of influencing its decisions the three mouths during wvliieh he was a member of the caninet were fraught with greater difficulties than probably any govornment in modern times hal ox perienced they had beforo them questions of the greatest momnent and difficulty there wvas the dispute with ussia with regard to the boundary of afghanistana question which at one time they were afraid wvould lead to nvar then they had a very grave question before them relating to egyptian finiance in which every other power in euro was concerned then there was the dlispute with france about the suppression of the osphcreegnytienc  and they had also a misunderstanding with the government of germany vith rcard to its recent colonial policy the late governmonthad to carry on the most difficult nego tiations in the face of the muost vehement opposition fromi the tory party combined with the irish liationalist party that any governmnent had ever experienced almost ever week a vote of censure was sprung upon the govern muent by these combined partiesa combinaition no doubt purely accidental a laugh but this opposition greatly weakued the government in their negotiations withl foreign powers howeverthe late government set to work an d brought all these difficult matters to a conclusion they practically settled the dispute with russia one question in iispute between them wnas re ferred to arbitration and thie other was all but settled by friendly negotiations they settled the egyptian financial difticulty and disposed of other dificulties and cwhen they left otlice all these various dificeulties were pactically if not absolutely brought to a conclusion he htad no complaint to make rith regard to the tory g overn ncnt in brinmng these negotiations to a conclusion he thought the tories had acted wisely and well in carrying on the worl the liberals had left theon the tory chiefs had been going about the country bragging on every platorm that they had been even more successful in these nnatters than thu liberals and that they had initiated a policy of their own in bringing them to a conclusion he now gathered from lord salisburvys last speeclh that they had really carried out a worlk of vhich they disapproved they bad however fouud vhen they came into power that the honour and word of this country were pledged and therefore tlcy had no option but to bring them to a conclusion in the way they had done if as lord salisbury hbad told them he disapproved the result of the recent negotiations with rnussia then they might suppose he woild have been better pleased in prolonging the con troversv and bringing us into a war with that country then with regard to egyptian finance the government had succeeded in issuing a lonn by bribing two hebrew bankers with ï¿½c and in that wvay had gained the consent of the stock exchange but yet the government disapproved the agreement which was made ani so on through the various agreements to which he had referred it eppeared to him a somewhat humiliating confession on thr prart of a government in the position of caretakers cheers wvith regardi to ireland they were under the impression that one of the principal complaints the tory prty had to make wvas the condition in which the latejiberal overnment left that cotntry the liberals wvere attacked on the ground that their legislation had ruined ircland that propertv vas unsafe and that the govern ment of the country could not be carried on without the renewal of the coercion act but it appeared that liberals vcre labouring under a mistake in this impression for vithoat oipeial knowlcdge the tory leaders had held a secret conclave and had come to the conclusion that it was not necessary to renew the coercion act and they had agreed to cppose its renewal by the late liberal govern mnent they however kept this conclusion entirely secret even fror their own supporters but he would ask whether they icept it a secrct from the irish nationalist party cheers and in fact whether they had not in the combination they had witnessed the secret of a singular areement real by the light of what they now ileew it wras perfectly certain there was a combination letween the tory leaders and the irish party to turn out the liberal government on the undterstanding that if the tories came into power thley would not renew the coercion act ihear hear re did not want to complain that they had not renewed it forhe agreed with the observations that lord sal hury maae in his recent speeches on the matter they were almost identical with the observations he himself made some months ago to mr gladstone and lord spencer when the former was good enough to offer him the irish secretary ship he expressed his opinion that in view of the great extension of the franchise it was not desirable to renew the coercioni act cheers they could not give a great extension of the franchisewith one hand and coercion with the other and he urged when the coercion act expired that it would be better to revert to the ordinary lawvs of the country elear hear that being his opinion he did not accept the irish secretaryship it was not for him to say wvhat action was taken upon this question by the cabhiet later on all he could say was that no de cisioni was come to by the government as to what the nature of the new coercion act should be he still main tained his opinion upon the questionoven though it migbt have become desirable to arnn the irish executive with certain powers which it might put in force if the experi ment of doing wvithout the coercion act proved unsuccess ful therefore he did not blame the tory government in not renewving the coercion act and he hoped most sincerely that the experiment vould succeed it was true boycotting had largely increased and might have to be dealt with by other moens than the ordinary law but he recognized that if the opposite course had been followed it might have been attended by still more serious colise quences and other evils even of a more serious character might have resulted hear hear with regard to lord salisburys reference to future legislation he quite admit ted that his proposals with reference to local governmeut were considerably advanced and in advocaing a democratic local government his lordship was prepared to waive some of the dearest prejudices of the tory party as it would deprive the county gentlemen of what was con sidered some of their most cherished privileges in the rural districts but for all that he did not sec why the country should leave in the hands of lord salisburys party the carrying out of a great measure of that klind hear hear if electors looked back they would find that the great advances in popular government had been made under the administration of the liberals and it would be better and safer to leave measures of this kind in the hands of the liberals cheers then withregard to land le gislation it vwas satisfactory to now that the leaders of the locry party deplored much wyhich the liberals deploredand wyere wvilling to try a change lord salisbury said he wvas prepared to consult the present lord chancellor with a view to the introduction of a measure to facilitate land transfer he had known the present lord chancellor for some years and he ventured to say that a more retro grade anid obstinate old tory had never existed in the house of commons to his mind it would be just as easy to extract tears from a flint as to extract a genuine law of this kind from the tory lord chancellor laughter but this great question could not be dealt with in a measure of land transfer becauso the cause of the mischief complained of lay far deeper they had tq consider tho question in its social economical and political bearing and his impression vas that there should be a change an the whole course of legislation wvith regard to all those matters which tended to accumulate the land in the hands of tho few and that all the powers of the state should be used to promote a wide distribution of property in land he proposed to deal with this question more fully on a future occasion the question of local goveru ment was one the importance of which it was impossible to exaggerate when local government was thoroughly constituted in the rural districts on a true and popular basis they vould be able to deal with many of the grave evils which affected the community to such an authority he believed it was possible to give power to buy land to let to the labourers where their gardens and allotments were insufficient such an authority might also be in trusted with the control of the liquor traffic as to the question of education he had always been of opinion that the moment education became compulsory the time was not distant when it should also be free it had always appeared to him a great anomaly to require parents to send their children to school and at the same time to pay the fee for the moment education became compulsory the fee became a tax and not a good tax either hear hear it was better for all parties that the chargc should be undertaken by the state and be collected bv the state from the whole conimunity in the shape of a tax they m ust recollect that education was made compulsory not merely in the interests of the parents but also in the interests of society itself cheers au children should be brought up with elementary knowledge sufficient to read and vrite and sbould also be taught certain other subjects wvith a view to utilizing to the utmost such powers as they had in so doing they were adding to the resources of the country and enormoab benefits resulted it was in consequence of charging a fee that a considerable number of children within the school ago were with drawn from school and he for one had come to the conclusion that the only way of curing chis evil was for the state which already paid twothirds of the cost of public elementary cducation to undertake the remaining onecthird in advocating this they were accused of socialismbut he did not thinkit was socialismin any bad sense of the termhe would conclude his address by telling his hearors that they must not be frightened because differences were said to exist within the liberal party for ho never knew a time when they did not exist oear hear it was almost an essential condition of the party that there should be differences of opinion cheers wl hen he first went into parliament mir bright and mr cobden were sitting below the gangway and certainly there were great differences between them and the leaders of the liberal party at that timelord palmerston and lord russell if lord palmerston had expressed his mind he would have said there were greater differences between himself and mir cobden than between himself and the tory leaders that did not prevent him from being the leader of the liberal party or the liberal party from advancing cheers there were people who now thought mir bright lagged a little in the rear and that the progress of others was a little more stimulating  but nevertheless they loved and admired a veteran of that kind cheers and were aot disposed at that moment to question what his progress might be there were differ ences in the past and would be in the future and the differences which nowv existed were no greater in degree than they were at the time of ivhichhe spokethegreat bulk of the liberal party were betweesa the two extremes but he had no doubt that at the right time they would be prepared as a united party o carry out important measures cheers differences wvere not confined to the liberal party for the great bulk of the tory paty differed from the lory democracy as expounded by the younger men there were even differences among the latter the right hen gentleman concluded his address by referring to matters of local interest
