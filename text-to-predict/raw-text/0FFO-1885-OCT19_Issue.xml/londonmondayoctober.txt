loyjdon monday october  the terms of the ultimatum despatched by the indian government to ig thebaw which we were enabled to stato on saturday had not been made pablic in india when our calcutta corre spondent telegraphed yesterday the news printed in another column the fact however is now announced in an official telegram from simla confirming our statement but not entering lo fully into details it is probablo that the viceroy who had received full powvers to act from the home government wished to delay the announcement of the measures he thought it right to adopt until they had received the formal sanction of the secetacty of state it is unnecessary to say that this sanction might iave been reckoned upon beforehand lord randolph ciubchlil with the asaent of his col leagues in the cabinet determined to leave the question entirely in the hands of lord duffeirm and his angloindian advisers and the resolution was both a prudent and an honourable one it will be impossible for the most bigoted partisan ship to attack ministers for loyally supporting the policy of a viceroy whom liberals and con servatives have been equally reacly to trust the ultimatum however though not made publicwas generally anticipated and universally approved when our correspondent telegraphed and it scs that the burmese government wereprepared  it since according to advices received at rangoon thnebxw and his ministers had avowed the inten tion of stopping the british envoy at the frontier and turning him back vith contumiely they may or may not proceed to this extremity of insolent folly but whatever they do the course of the govermnent of india at least in the preliminary steps is perfectly clear krng tilebaw must purge himself of his offence  he must satisfy the three conditions laid down by lond duffeerln and if he does so and no unfortunate collision should be precipitated by the recklessness of the burmese the nominal independeneo of mandalay may be forthe present maintained thougl in the opinion of thoso most intimately acquainted with tho country such an arrangement could at the best be considered no more than a makeshift but if load dufferils demands are met as is too probable with ai obstinato or an insulting refusal the deposition of tnedav must be carried out and the future of upper burmah must be settled on a permanent basis providing as well against the danger of foreign intervention as against tho possibility of diverting from india and from england a trade capable of vast developmentthe anarchy at present prevailing in upper burmah due undoubtedly to the public follies and private vices of a halfinsane despot has assumed the most formidable proportions and is likely to increase rather than to be checked as it becomes known that tiuebav has finally broken with tho angloindian government mandalay itself is reported to be surrounded by bands of dacoits who aro threatening the town and may at any moment sack and burn it whatever military force exists in the country is employed either in guarding the person of tho xmg or in making a show of resislance to the english meanwvhile his country is given over to violence and the lives of all europeans aro threatened indiscriminately the italian consul at mandalay has been in per sonal peril and at irangoon the most serious ap prehensions are entertained lest british traders and other foreigners should be suddenly attacked the steamers on theupperirrawvaddy are naturally the object of solicitude it is represented to the government of india that pending the settlement of the matters in dispute tnebaw and his mini sters should be gravely admonished of the re sponsibility they will individually incur should they allow europeans to be murdered or tortured and looking at all the circumstances of the case the attempt to work upon the fears of tho bur maese court appears to be a precaution which it would be unwise through any mere punctilio to omit there is substantially no difference of opinion among military and political officers as to tho ease with wvhich the restoration of order in upper burmah could be offected by a moderate force but with respect to the future should tiebaw be so rash as to provolke his doom there are tw o alternative policies between which the governmentof india will have to choose it would perhaps be more correct to say that there are only two alternative policies whether theraw is allowed to remain en the throne or not for hardly any competent authority is in favour of leaving things as they are even if the violence of the burmese or european intrigues were not certain to force our hand we must either annex the country or wemust send a british resident to guide the nominal ruler at mandalay whether he be thanaw or a prince set up bv our selves lord riuon has declared in favour of the latter course but all his arguments against annexa tion appear to apply with as much or as little cogency to the government of the state by a resi dent at the same time it is clear that a nominally independent burmab in contact with china on one frontier and with french influence on anotherwould be lesstractableand more exposed to disturbing forces than a native state in india proper surrounded by british territory and cut off by oceans and mountains from intercourse with any other european power it would be idle for us to have a resident at landalay if he were unable to be absolutely certain of preventing the native administration from quarrelling with china or intriguing with the french in a weak moment some future secretary of bstate mightthink it proper to remove all restraints on the  foreign policy  of burniah just as tho kiiedivls government was permitted to send hicxos pashias army against the maidi we can not afford to leave the door open for such follies the stake is too important the elements of danger are too serious and too numerous if wo are forced to use the military power of india to establish order in upper burmah we ought not to hesitate in the adoption of measures which will secure a permanent sottlementit has been suggested that the definitive esta blishment of our predominant influence in upper burmah would be regarded with disfavour and jealousy by china we publish in another column a communication from a wvellinformed correspon dent which shows that the present attitude of china has been entirely misconstrued by critics like lord riron the government at pekin has had cause to be convinced of the necessity of drawing closer the bondsof amity with england and if for the moment the pressure of russia on the northern border of china and of france on the southern border has been relaxed the chinese are willing to abate sometbing of their secular ex clusiveness in order to form friendships that may be helpful to them in the future we have reason to believe that the views of our correspondent are those which prevail at pekin and if advantage can be taken of this disposition on the part of the chinese not only to arrange a settlement of the burmese question in which they will acquiesce but to create a trading station near the frontier at bhamo the government need not be afraid of lord rirrons bugbear the withdrawal of the buffer between india and the celestial empire we are endeavouring it is pointed out to open up facilities for commercial intercourse with china and her central asian dependen es on the side of assam and it is somewhat incï¿½sistent to profess to be afraid of contact with her on the side of burmah the jealousy of french ambition which is now the dominant feeling at pekin extends to the unauthorized but not the less troublesomemovements of french adventurers at mlandalay  and for this reason if for no other the chinese would probably be glad to see us in un disputed possession of the dominions of tnibaw this is undoubtedlya question for the workingclass electors to find new markets for english manu factures instead of those which protective tariffs have closed against us is the most hopeful remedy for the depression of trade if we are able not only to develop the resources of burmah but to make a breach in the exclusive system of china the advantage will be great both to consumers and to producers in those countries and in our own it may be pointed out also that we are never likely to have a better opportunity of bringing the business to a satisfactory conclusion than at the present moment the colonial policy of france has met with a check through the state of french politics at home russia is also occupied in another quarter and any arrangements between england and china are likely to be accepted with out demur by all the potvers with commercial inte rest in the east
