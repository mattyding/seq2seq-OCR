teibphonring from ligiitlsjpsfrqoi a corresrondnan experumentof the greatest importancato the comrmercial world is now being made on the east coastot england by the telegraph construction and maintenancea company for the last eight months the company hax had several of its best operatives located in the neighi bourhood of the aze off which the most dangerous sand round england are to befound these gentlemenara hourly incommunicationby telephone with a lightship which is anchored  miles out in the vicinityofthe swvin passage an ordinary telegraph cable has beeni laid from waltononthenaze to the sunk lightship and telephone and telegraphic apparatus have been affixed tt both ends it was considered improbable that the humai voice would be conducted  miles especially in roughi weather but this has been now proved to be thoroughly practicable a conversation was carried on with mr stevenson one of the telegraph meintenance company officials who was on board the sunk lightship by telea phone for a considerable time mr stevenson had beer a month upon the boat and had experienced al indeso weather during which time he had kept mr lewis and ir pinkerton his colleagues on shore fully informed of thb state of the weather roughness of the sea and passing craft adding frequently forecasts of weather which usually turned oat to be correct a month upon the lightship is a trying ordeal  but mr stevenson was so satisfed with the success that attended the exiperiment and knowing ig the advantage of telephonic comxunication vith light ships was understood and generally adopted what  splendid boon it would be to mariners and merlaeants that he spent his tima busily in collecting infonatioi andwatchingtheworkingof his electrical machines idi a back room of the walton postoffice are machines fo utilizing magnetic currents of all descriptions a button ij touched which rings a beu in mr stevensons cabirz upon the sunk lightship  miles away  then a voicei that of mr stevensonis heard inquiring what is wannted how is the wind  fhow is the tide  mave yoia seen such and such a ship pass   how much water iï¿½ there in the swin passage these questions cannie answered at once or the following is transmitted  signal such and such a ship that she is to put in  harwich every ship passing is duly signalled and hce name and description telephoned to the walton postoffice on an average  ships pass in the dayand if it was knovn that messages could be sent ashore no doubt the majority of these would avail themselves of the benefit a con siderable number of the ships passing have come great distances without passing one of lloyds signalling stations the signalling of these passing the sunk lightship would be of great commercial valueas their time of arrival at any port they were boumn for could be timed by the owners in london accurately and everything could be made ready for the landing and sale of the cargoof much more importance is the use the telepl ono could be put to in a storm or in the case of a ship getting on the sands one night this year in a rough sea a ship did got on a sandbank and instantlyher exact position was telephoned to valton from the lightship the gentlemen at walton awvole the lifeboat crew and telegraphed to ramsgate and harwich where the lifeboatswere got readyfor launching justasall three lifeboats were about to startatelcphonc message cane from the lightship that the ship in distress had got safely off the sandbank and that there was no need for the life boats to start the boats were stopped and if it had not been for the telephone they would have been out on the rough sea aln night searching for the ship that sent up distress signals if all the lightships around the coasts of europe had this means of communication to point out the exact position of a ship in distress a great number of fives would be saved as the position of many ships foundern ing cannot be indicated vith any certainty by the ordinary rocket signals besides the above uses of the telephone with lightships all passing ships in quest of a pilot to navigate them through dangerous channels could withoub difficulty telephone their desires to shore the sunk lightship is only  tons and yet only once in the stormiest sea when she had been tossed about in a gale of wincd has the telegraph sire been broken the two ends at the break were picked up and rejoined within  hours she is moored in  fathoms of water and is manned by a captain and six to eight men all of whom express their most earnest approval of the intercommunication with the shorewhereby they can make known at once their own and the wants of others during the night communication is as openras in the day the trinity board is showing con siderable interest in the experiment and it is hoped that it will see te eat importance of at once mutting by thureans the chief lighuships in communication with the shore it is stated by the gentlemen engaged at wvalton that the telephoae will act over twice ten miles  and there is no reason why some day it should not act over much greater distances
