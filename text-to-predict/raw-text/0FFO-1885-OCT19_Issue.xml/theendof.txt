the end of the oldiam stiye irnom our jwcu wstxit oortzesondntin actual warfare it is sometimes difficult to discovor victory for either party at the close ald the difficulty is certainly increased whei the conflict is botween labour and capital and a remnant of common sense prevails on ono side or the other the oldham employers are now said to be surrendering and as it is true that they have consented to yield  per cent more than they were previously pre pared to pay there is perhaps as solid a basis as usual of such pretensions to success as the apologists for strikes are accustomed to mailltain at any rate the oldham union ists are crying  victory if the result is remembered in that light the tradition will be as well founded as many another on whiclh the military credit of trade unions has been built up the slightest esamination of the circum stances goes far to show that if capital has been beaten in this case capital has the worst of it in au and that the famished families of the unemployed monopolize the gains and honours if not the heroism of the struggle that has taken place it becomes indeed a question whbther a strike so fruitful in glory and profit ought ever as far as they are concerned to be ended to do them justice the unionists are talking and writing so much in that strain as to suggest that no end would ever have been reached if the capitalists had never given way it is obvious however that in contests of this kind the fatal weakness of capital is its preference of the returns of industry to the pains of heroism or the mere semblance of victory so for  weeks as at oldham capitalists may steadily withhold the  per cent that has been contended for  they may have refused for any number of weeks the proposed compromise oef  per cent yet a day surely comes if the pure instincts of capital and not of passion are in the ascendant when a turn of the market or a chance of itor a weakening from any cause of those temporary ties that unite competitors in alliance makes it appear to some that they have more to gain then if not before by concession of the  per cent or even  than by keeping up tne contest longer then the opposing party claims a victory especially that portion of it which wass sufficiently disciplined organized and armcd with funds to ward off tho famine which may have scourged and decimated the majorityit is a victory for unionism no doubt if it is shown once more how the nonunionist goes to the wallhow the orga nized have the power to control the fortunes of the nomi nally free and independent it is evidentalso that no such victories would ever be won if the operative like the capi talist became possessed with the commercial spirit of bar gaining in his own and his familys behalf in that case he woulddisembarrass himself of class feelingandwhateverthe wagetake care he kept at work till he could afford to havea holiday but the preliminary to such freedom of action on his part is an overthrow of the bugbear that by doing the best for himself immediately he is preparing general ruin ultimately the theory of this oldham strilke has been that if  per cent less wages were accepted there  per cent reduction would be enforced everywhere it seems to follow that the  per cent now submitted to must be of sinmilarly general application and likewise that clause of the settlement which contemplates the other half of the  per cent being submitted to in three months  if the state of the cotton trade be such that an average mill caun not be worked without a less as the price of the fo called victory by which a  per cent has been sub stituted for a  per cent reduction during the next three months it appears priimd facic that the  victors have one and all been payinig for the last three months the remaining  per cent of their earnings plus the  per cent now to be securedin other wordsthey have gone  weeks without a farthing and the consequent destitution and mnisery are described as appalling admirers of the results achieved console themselves with a conviction that if all had been at work instead of idle the production of yarns must have been so excessivethat the market would have been still worse and wages therefore still lower the least reckless of capitalists is less superstitious in his fear of the con sequence of outstripping his competitors in overproducing and underselling than are those martyrs to prudence and caution the militant unionists their supreme anxiety is to protect the future mnarket at whatever present sacrifice the latter being a visible and terrible fact seems much less problematical in its extent and consequences than the possible disasters that have been avoidedthe operatives and their families and all who have suffered along with them whether willingly or by compul sion have given proofs of constancy and fortitude that are undeniably stupendous it is however questionable whether any who are unable to think the cause was good and wvise in which these qualities were exerted show wisdom themselves in applauding the exercise there is no doubt as has been urged by sympathizers at a distance that these unhappy sufferers have much to excuse them buin one of their e cuses is the readiness of so many philanthropistssome who should know better others who are not likely to know anything of the matterto declare that those who promoted the strike had the shrewder estimate of what was required they said the state of trade required reduced production rather than reduced wages they have enforced a reduced production and the market is still a bad one  crgo they and not the employers had the juster view of the remedy this chain of reasoning leaves out the material facts that the employers did not prefer reduced wages to reduced production  that each employer would rather have seen his competitors stop or reduce production  and that employers did not reduce wages to improve the market but to lessen their certain and previous losses no spur less sharp than absolute need is likely to unite competing capitalists in such an enterprise as enforcing roduced wages against a union so strong as the oldham spinners have shown they possessed among the lessons which such conflicts in the cotton trade doubtless have for tne observer one is the evidence on both sides that neither is able to believe in the sincerity of the other whatever reasons or excuses may be put forth by either party for their conduct the other assumes to be so much dust thrown ih the eyes of the public the mayor of oldham as has been stated declined to head a relief movement lest itshould com promise official neutrality since then the accumulating distress of several weeks had been added to what had gone before and the ilayor had signified his benevolent feelings by au offer of mediation he regarded the contest as one from which the town must suffer for a long time after it had ended the savings of a whole community have been nearly exhausted the incomes of employers have been diminished and the burdens upon ratepayers will have to be increased in the meantime the stoppage of oldham industry has been giving advantage to competing neighbours this is so familiar a consequence of a local struggle as to excuse suspicionsthough no hint of them appears in the alayors appeal nor perhaps in sny utterance connected with the controversythat those who profit by the mischief may sometimes have a laud in creating it it is conceivable if not demonstrable that among the  competing concerns forced to a common idileness the overstocked or better provided had something to gain dy sloppage nna otners morelo ose leaving such doubtfdl points asideand noting the abundant reason for earnestness in quest of possible peace it is unpleasant to see how promptly the mlayors sincerity was called in question the strike was against a  per cent reduction the strikers had lately offered to halve it and the mlkayor next suggested that this remaining difference might be splitthat a per cent should be the compromise between  per cent and  it was at once objected that thisw ould be too palpable a victory for the employersthere are more signal instances of reciprocal want of faith the latest appeal for assistance to the strike was a circular of october  which taxes the employers with in sincerity in proposing to reconsider the question in three months if the full reduction were now submitted to the circular says the idea of trade improving by christmas if all the spindles so long idle were again at work  is simply preposterous the employers offer was therefore  nothing more than a delusion and a snare and was made because those who made it had themselves no notion that they would ever have to carry it out in the leading columns of the unionist organ the cotton factory time issued two days after the circular a more favourable an ticipation appears of the effects of resuming workwe advisedly recommend the question to be settled by an acceptance of  per cent at present and if the mills cannot work withoat a loss at the end of three months then the wages question can be again considered by the committees of the two associations    the present strikuewasnot nndertanen against areduction of wages but against the evil of overproduction and if the mills could not be worled as a whole without maldng a loss the operatives would he found reasonable when asked to suffer a  per cent  but we are of opinion the chances would be more in favour of an advance than a reduction at the end of three monthsthe writer of the above recommendation had the advantage of knowing at any rate what terms would be found acceptable by the negotiators the following night but the above extract from the circular is interesting for another and very different reason it is an echo of the language of employers when anybody asks them what is theiranswer to some more or less specious proposal or pretext of those on strike  it was never meant to be acted upon it was intended to hoodwink the public to give an example of this there is the often reiterated pro fession of nvorkpeoples advocates that  they
