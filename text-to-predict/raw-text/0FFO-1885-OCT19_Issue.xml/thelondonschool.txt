the london school board blectionthe fortheoming election of members to serve the next the sixth london school board for three years entered upon its fnal phase preceding the actual ballot on satur day the legislature has laid down the rules that seven days shall be given to candidates who have been nominated to consider whether they shall stand or withdraw and this period expired on saturday at  oclock when in the various divisions of london the lists of candidates who will go to the ballot were finally made up by the returning officers the withdrawals from the lists which formerly made the totalof  names as candidates for the  places niow show a total of  candidates the withdrawals up to saturday having numbered  but these candidates are very unequally distributed for while there are eight candi dates fuor four places in the city and nine for five places in chelsea there are  candidates for six places in r insbury  candidates for foutr paces in east lambeth  for six plaees in west lnmbeth and  candidates for five pleces inthe towver hamlets returning officers of oxperience are of opinion that there would have been more withdrawals if therehad been any expense attached to the position of a candidate and the election would then have been drawn on lines more distinct than it now can be for the crowd of unknown porsons who are thus endeavouring to thrust themselves into public notice somewhat distract public attention and the wellknowvn men who are candi dates are leaving the public free to discriminate between those who have served and those who seek to serve on the boardat present there is very little pressure on the part of candidates by public meetings or by placards and in some few divisions the returning officors treat the whole matter of the election as if it were a more parish business tho returning oficers in marylebone chelsea the tower hamlets the city of london hackney greenwich and east lambeth were specially remarkable for dcealing with the work in the most open way and gave tho public every information  but in other places the lists of names upon which from  to  people will in each division in a fortnight have the right to vote to represent them were not in any way issued to public notice in the east and the north of london the forthcoming parliamentary elec tion takes all attention and there is scarcely any regard in the way of placarding showni as yet to the school board election  but the canvass is likely to be sharp in the short time which will elapse before the poll is taken in northeast hackney one candidate has adopted the novel plan of selling a pamphlet at a price which will leave a handsome profit and thus combines business with the canvass for tho public service the pamphlet in question bears a sensational title and makes sensational charges against the general body of the board this has hitherto been treated by the members generally as a matter of humour and of a selfevident purpose but as it has been regarded seriously in some quarters and among classes who see things only on the surface answers are bemg bestowed upon the assertions thus sot forth in marylebone too there is some pamphlet issuing but this is the work of a scholar the names withdrawn on saturday include those of several members of the present boardnamely those of mr arthur mills formerly mp for exeter and a representative of mnryleboac on the school board  mr denny urlia who has done good work on the board during the past three years as a representative of chelsea and was elected by the cnnservatives and churchmen imr e

thames northward to kensalgreen and includes the districts of chelsea kensington fulham hammersmith brompton and the districts which border on willesden on the northwest the extent of the division may

held the con fidence of his colleagues as did his predecessor and the other night in spcaking at a meeting he took occasion to declare against free education for all the population of london and expressed his wvillingness to retire from a work which had taken five days a week of his time since he had been a member of the board and he dealt with the wild assertions made by those members who he said came to the board meetings which were open to the pub lic where they made speeches but they left all the de tailed work to their colleagues in dealing with detailed work mr wilks declared his colleagues gave the best attention despite the allegations the voters passed a vote of confidence in mlr wilks and pledged themselves to press on his election the other of the two old members for the
