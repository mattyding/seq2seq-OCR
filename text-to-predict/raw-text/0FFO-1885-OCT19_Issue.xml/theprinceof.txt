of lords was too large and another was that it suffered from the same cause tbat practically brought about obstruction in the house of commons it was a fact that all questions were threshed out outside the walls of parliamentin the press and at public meetingsso that when they came to be discussed in parliament they were in both houses settled matters everybody knew how all would vote and there was very little necessity for and very little advantage in the debates the consequence of this had been to lower the tone and character of debates in both houses and to enable men to resort to ob structionlond rosesetu at rluamunooxlord rose bery visited kilmarnock on saturday in fulfilment of an engagement to inaugurate a mdnument to the memory of the eary reformers and to lay the foundation stone of a museum and art gallery the event was made the occasion of a public demonstration and lord liosebery wras presented vith the freedom of the burgh provost starrock made the presentation and lord rosebery in the course of his reply said there could be no greater distinction in kilmarnock than to be made a burgess of kilmarnock he did not knuw whether the citizens of kilmarnock had the good taste to make their great national poet a burgess like most distinguished persons burns had been more honoured after his cath than in his life but it was in kilmarnock that the first ap preciation of the poet was shown for there the first edition of his works was published and they had ereated a stately monument to his memory with regard to bimself he was profoundly moved by the affectionate kindness of his countrymen it was a thing which he did not profess to explain which he would rather not try to explain he sometimes thought that people in the south who did not know how clannish the scotch folk were must wonder to see how much honbur was lavished upon him by his countrymen but he believed it to be because they had a feeling for those who on either ride of politics or in any rank or station in life endeavoured to do their best for the common weal the inauguration ceremonial took place at a later hour in the afternoon the monument which occupies a prominent position in the kaypark a public recreation ground gifted to the town takes the form of a corinthian column surmounted by a figure of liberty it was erected by public subscription  to the memory of captain thomas baird and alex iaclaren as also john burt john kennedy archd craig and other kilmarnock pioneers of paliamentary reform who in the early part of the yth century devoted themselves with unselfish zeal to the cause of the people lord rosebery in the course of his inaugural address recapitulated the circumstances under which the kilmarnock reformers sacrificed them selves for their opinions and pointed the lessons which they taught these men he said for stating their opinions on the questions of the day for doing what people were now doing every day and hopec to do every daynamely to give free utterance to their thoughts on public subjects were imprisoned they were imprisoned for holding opinions that all hold now those tumes were as bad as times could be but the country pulled through them not through the wisdom of its rulers buf through the qualities of the people it was something of the bame kind now though they were not now ground down by intolerable oppression as their fathers were in those days yet there was still much to redress they saw much that was wrong they were still confronted with the eternal problem of tha inequality of human conditions and they must do their best in certam ways as those simple honest men did to try and redress it they might not be able ta redress the conditions to which he alluded but at any rate they could make the efeortthey could at any rate pve with thetimnes
