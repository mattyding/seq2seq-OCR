chinva an the burmbee qubstionfroit a corr tpnvnlrw the chinese have shown themselves so vigilant and sensitive on all questions affecting their frontiers and so tenacious of what they believe to be their rights in the countries bordering on their owvn territory that their attitude in regard to burmah is of some importance at the present moment the annexation of upper burmah sliould that be tho outcome of the present crisis will it has been pointed out place us for  miles along the clinese frontier  and it will be we are told followed inevitably by an irruption of chiniese labourers into the valley of tho irra waddy whom it will be diflicult to govern and impossible to expol tlhe chinese it is said do not want us or any other great powver on their frontier and they will take evely opportunity of harassing us and of throwing theit wveight into the scaie against us so as to drive us out of burmah ultimately and finally the spectacle of a chinese army marclhing down through assam to invade india is conjured up to frighten us from dealing with king thebaw if these statements and inferences be correct if these vaticinations rest on any substantial basis then it may frankly be confessed that the burmese question is ono of tlho most difficult and dadgerous problems that has ever arisen for solution by english and indian statesmen and if as has been suggested the mediatization of thebaws successor is the only way to meet all these dangers we cannot do better than adopt that course at once lest a worst thing befall us but let us first be quite sure of our ground we are now at the parting of the ways in burmah and before we decide on the course we intend to follow let us clearly per ceive the facts and avoid raising up shadowy spectres to frighten us back first of all let us dealwith this chinese bogey and it is not a little marvellous to find that politicians and writers who view russian advances towards our indian frontier with equanimity should be the first to cry out at the enormous danger of our proximity to china a russian invasion of india is a fantasy but a chinese army encamped around calcutta is a pressing danger which we must take steps to provide against and which we should bear in mind in dealing wvith this simple question in burmahthe chinese it may be said at the outset are far indeed from being indifferent to the state of affairs in barmah nothing passes there that is not noted by them and they saw the french intrigues at blandalay which have been going on for nearly two years past with much concern french influence and predominance all along their southern frontier from the delta of the red river of tonquin through the shan states to the valley of the irrawaddy was what appeared to tnem imminent and a french empire in indochina bordering on their own is a danger so great that thev would go to any length to prevent it in the first place then in keeping french influence out of burmah and in taking steps which will prevent any ftarther danger from that source we are doing precisely wvhat the chineso desired to have done ve are sure of their sympathy in the work so far and if their assistance were needed there is the best reason to believe that this also wvould be cheerfully rendered but there is a difference between preventing the growth of another power in burmah and ourselves annexing it up to the chinese frontier and the question is what china thinks of the latter will she object to it either now or in the future or wil she frankly accept the situation  and assuming burmah to be annexed to our indian empire will she be ready to allow trade to go on vwith southwestern china along our new frontiers  these are the questions which really lie at the root of the chinese position and the answers to them must depend on the method in which wo now treat the chinese iovernment if we totally disregard china on the ground that she has no interests in burmah worthy of our consideration and then annex the country and expect to find a trade springing up across the frontier we shall be much mistaken we should probably experience no active opposition but wve should have touched the chinese on a sore point and have left behind  rankling sense of neglect which could not be easily removed if wve go to her frontiers and demand trade it will probably be refused but happily there is no chance of any such unpleasant ness the relations between england andchina at present are such that difficulties of this kind can not arise for lack of a candid interchange of views if we invito the chinese onthefrontiers of burmah to come out and trade to extend her frontier a fewv miles down to bhamo we shall have the trade of a considerable part of southwvestern china at our feet at kiachta on the chinese siberian frontier the greater part of the trade betveen china and russia is carried on half of the town is russian half chinese and a similar arrange ment with regard to bhamo would certainly meet with the jhinese concurrence that towvn would thus be placed in the position of an open ort on the east coast of china it stands at the head of the navigation of the irrawaddy and manufactures can thus be sent from england with a sinalo transshipment to the borders of yunnan wye should thus bring southnvestern china to the irrawaddy instead of goinig to vast trouble to reach it china is by ilo means so dead to the value of opening this portion of her territory to trade as is generally supposed yunnan has vast mineral resources which if properly developed would make that province as rich as the most fertile grainbearing provinces of the valley of the yangtse but all this mineral wealth is lost on account of the expense of transport to the east coast chinese statesmen know by this time not only the value but the necessity of commerce and the day has gone by when any statesman with a position to lose will exclaim with a celebrated critic of the unfortunate treaty of livadia w why if this treaty be carried out you will see com merceo springingup like wveeds all over kashgaria we have tierefore at our hands the means of offering china complete satisfaction and of in ducing her to open to our trade the el dorado of modemn travellers she would not merely be a con tented spectator of a settlement of burmah but to some extent a participator in itmediatization if sugaested as the best solution of the difficalty buttlms appears to be proposed merely with a viewv of extricating ourselves from the respornsibility of annexation and without due considerattion of the circumstances the main value of upper burmah to us is that through it lie all our posrsible trado routes into southwestern china tnese can only be worlked by an arrange ment witu the chinese who will naturally look to us and not to our puppet at mandalay for its faithful executionwhether we annex ormediatize the rosponsibility in this respect will lie on us moreover tho device of mediatizing is well onough in india where the native princes with the singe exception of the maharajah of cashmere and the mountains in the north and west of his territory practically seclude him also are secluded from alloutside influence but our own but in burmah wle have china in the north and france should she ever succeed in reducing tonquin to order up to the shan states in the west if we are not pre pared to answer for all the doings of the ruler of burmah to both of these neighbours along hundreds of miles of insettled frontier our mediatizing is useless if wve are then we have at once all the responsibilities of annexation under wvhatever veil we may hido it from ourselves who ever rules in burmah must by the nature of things have intercourse withchina and the latter prefers that if we are to be the rulers we should be so ostensibly and definitely rather than that we should stand behind in a shadow pulling the strings of a puppet china fears nothing fromeng land as a neighbour she will rather welcome us on the irrawaddywhere we canat any rate maintain order and see that tbade if trade there is to be is carried on without disturbance but it appears that some public men dread china on our frontier it may be asked will the danger be a whit the less will it not rather be greater if wve have a wrjak prince between ourselves and her  if a mongol invasion of calcutta is to take place at all it is not clear how a media tized prince at mandalay is to prevent it if we could not do so ourselves amnd if that other in vasion which is also spoken ofan invasion of chinese labourers in the valley of the irrawaddy is to be dealt with it looks as if the rulers of the straits settlements and of hongkong should be better able to deal with it than a burmese prince this latter invasion would indeed be a blessingupper burmah at present has only about x of population cultivatee as the chinese could cultivate it it wvoald become one of the gardens of asia but the main point is that either of these invasions and one is as chimerical as the other woald bo assisted instead of inmpededby the device of mediatization if any argument at all is to be drawn from them it woula be raison de plus for annexation moreover thero is nothing in all chinese history to warrant us in thinking she is an aggressive nation  she has manifested much tenacity in maintaining her rights great obsti niacy considerabzle ignorance and bigotry but never aggressiveness h er very magnitude must always kceep her from being aggressive her size is her mweaknesseven if a frontier conterminous wvith china were a danger it is one that we must face we are at present doing all we can to get permission from china to trade with eastern turkestan and tibet through cashmere bhotan nepaul and assam all these will be points of contact with the chinese frontier  our natural growth in asia brings us side by side with china much of her old jealousy has passed away and she is learning to understand her own interests in the furnace of esperience she is willing now there is reason to believe to assist us in settling the burmese ques tion and in opening a route into southwestern china she is not troubled by the  miles of contermiinous frontier which frightens lord ripon why should she  she has already  miles of conterminous frontier wvith russia at least as dangerous a power in central asia as great britain the question for us now is wvhether we should avail ourselves of the favourable circumn stances to put ourselves side by side with china and to open thegreatmarkets of southern and south vestern china to our manufactures or whether we shall fritter away our time and energies in bolster ing up a figurehead at mandalay have our ex periences of mediatized and buffer states on our northwestern frontier been so happy and suiccess ful that we should desire to repeat it in the northeast  the chinese wvill help in a complete and effective solution of the question  if we merely propose putting up another prince in place of thebaw they vill probably see no reason for altering their present arrangements on the frontier and the trade of southwestern china will only exist in the imagination of our depressed trading centres for years to come
