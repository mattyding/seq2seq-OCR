with deafen ing cheers in proceeding to unveil the statue said ladies and gentlemenwe are met together today on a memorable occasion to do honour to a man whose memory is respected and loved in derby for seven parliaments and for  yearsa long span in the life of manthe borough of derby gave to sir bass its confidence a confi dence which he repaid with loyal service cheers new that alas  he shall no mora be seen among us we have desired and properly desired that present and future gene rations shall as far as art can permit have a memorial for the times that are to come of that image and that form which will long be loved and respected in derby cheers for that purpose we have secured the services of one of the foremost sculptors of our time to perpetuate the image of sir bass as a testimony of the gratitude of derby to his memory but i will undertake to say that never was there a man who les wanted a statue than the late r bass cheers derby is full of the monuments of his munificence his generosity to all your public institu tions is well known he was a bountiful contributor  the pecreation ground the free baths the schools of art the childrens hospital and the infirmaiy owed much to his bounty there is in particular one very valuable institu tion and sir bass showed his accustomed judgment in fostering iti might almost say in founding itthe pail way orphanage in this town he knew that there was no class among our citizens who deserved better of the public than the men who by day and by night peril their lives in order that we may travel in comfort and safety and he knew also that the best provision you can make for those men that which would give them nerve in the hour of danger and consolation in the moment of death would be to feel that there was a provision in the future for those who wvere near and dear to them hear hear and cheers that admirable institution which owed much to mrbass still remains i am happy to think flourishing among us then there is the freo library an institution which will subsist in derby i hope as long as books are written and as long as books are read it was a splendid gift costing ï¿½ a gift which was only pos sible to a man of great fortune and of a great heart cheers these benefactions in derby were in addition to those which he made at the place of his birth and his trade at burton his churches his schools his institutes and his clubs are a perpetual memory of his general bounty of his public oareer i must say little this is one ot those happy occasions at this moment too rare which are outside the stormy atmosphere of party strife there are indications upon the political barometer which tbreaten a good many of what are called serious disturb ances before long laughter  but bere at least and for today we are all at peace i will say nothing of mir bass as a party man though i believe that no man to whatever party he may belong will fail to respect and esteem a man who was always sincere in his creed and faithfultohis friends cheers mir bass was a sincere ally an honest and goodhumoured opponent and no man was more uni versally popular on both sides of the house of commons he did not put himself forwvard there very much  but i read soon after his death some few sentences in the times which seemed to me most aecurately and justly to appre ciate his character thc times said in his capacity as a politician he merited respect and the qualities which insured his success in business made him sober and discreet in parliament slow to speak and ready to sink his own predilections in order to advanoe the cause which he had at heart unfailing in the per formance of unobtrusive duties reticent and prudent mr bass was a member of parliament of a type which is likely to grow even rarer than it isgentlemen that is too true i wish we had more men like mir bass cheers there never i think was a man of whom it may be saisl more truly that he had a sound mind in a sound bcdy hlis success in trade was a proof of his capacity no man ever becomes the acknowvledged chief in the business he pursues except by a superiority of talent and of character hear hear to create what was practically a new trade was in itself a mark of originality his celebrated manufacture has spreadhis name throughout the habitable globe but it was not so much in the power of amassing wealth that mr bass was admirable it was in his manner of using and spending that wealth the mayor has referred to the memorable words of ir bass and they were very characteristic of him i have made a lot of money i have bad much pleaserein making it but i have had much more pleasure in giving it away i and he also added  lot me say to those young fellows who would be rich in their day remember what an old man tells themthere is no pleasure in life compared to that of conferring pleasure upon others cheers this was the spirit in which mir bass lived and that is why his memory will long survive and be cherished by generations of the citizens of derby loud cheerssir artrnu bass feelingly returned thanks on behalf of the family for this public recognition of the worth of one whom they lnew and loved so wellon the motion of the hoin george curzzon conserva tive candidate for south derbyshire a vote of thanks was accorded to sir wvilliam harcourt and after a few words from sm hfnrny jsmes the proceedings terminated
