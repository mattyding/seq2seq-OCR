irelanddublin oct an accident which happily was not attended with any sorious consequences although the circumstances vero calculated to excito alarm occurred on saturday morning to the steamer violet ono of the london and north wvestern ccmpanys boatswhule entering the mouth of the river a dense fog such as frequently occurs at this season covered the entrance to the harbour and the violet was proceeding cautiously through it wvhen it was discovered that another steamer the city of bristol the property of mlessrs balgravc which was outvard bound but was afraid to venture further lay at anchor nearly opposite the pigeonhouse the lookout did not observe the city of bristol until the violet wvas almost close upon it owing to the thickness of the haze bolls were rung on board the waiting steamer which was in mid channel and its proximity was then more distinctly known an effort was nmade to sweep round the obstruction but the helm did not answver as quicly as was necessary owing to the slowness of the motion and the result was that the violet ran on a sandbank on the clontare side with her prow sido turned at an angle of fromtbe mouth of the rivertherowere  passengers on board at the time but as the seawas calmand there wvas no confusion no panic arcse but the nature of the accident was soon realized as the tide had been ebbing for over an hour it was evident that there was no chance of getting off the violet until the nest tide but the alexandra a goods steamer in the service of the same company was speedily despatched to the passengers a number of whom were got on board with their luggage by means of boats the process of transferring the passengers was tedious but was shortened about halfpast s oclock by the arrival of a tugboat which was towing in a vessel from kingstown after about an hour and a halfthe passengers were conveyedto the northlwall station the tugboat then returned to the violet and brought in a rather heavy parcels post for which tho london and niorthwestern company are contractors thev iolet heeled over on her side when the tide was out but righted with the incoming title and being found quite uninjured was able to make her return passage to holyhead in the evening the conduct of the passengers and crew when the accident occurred is warmly commended there was not the slightest excite ment or confusion and the only feeling shown was dis appointment at the dolaythe war carried out under the auspices of the national league against landlords and the means had recourse to for the purpose of harassing them and all who have any dealings with them are still subjects of much anxiety in the dlistricts in which the combination is strongest and most stringent in its rules it is no longer a crusade against those denounced as evictors and rackrentersbut ex tends to the whole class a it is enough for a man to take grazing land or buy cattle from or work for a landlord to make him obnoxious to the leaguers the executive are earnestly eudeavouring to defeat the conspirators but as the organization becomes more extensive and complete the difficulty of the undertaking is augmentedthe abuse of the practice of boycotting has been con demned by mr harrington in the rooms of the central league in dublin in terms which have been applauded by admiring friends and sympathizers but here is the wav in which his moderate counsels are understood and acted upon in his own county as reported in his own journal the eerry sentinel states that the listowel branch met on sunday and mr fitzpatrick national league proposed a resolution vhieb was carried unanimously it was to the efflet that it camo to their knowledge that certain shop keepers and tradesmen of the towvn wvere supplying tenants of landgrabbers

apprehensioncork oct the committee of the cork defence union have been actively engaged every day for the past week in perfecting the organization every post brings a large number of applications from persons in nearly every part of the county appealing for assistance the committee sit every day for at least three hours and arrangements are made to meet every particular ease presented to them the union has already pnrehased two steam threshingmachineswhich were actively at work in different parts of the county corlk dturing the past week threshing prduce for persons who have refused to boov to the odious and insufferable tyrrany of the nateonal league plenty of local men have been found to work the machines the wvorl is got through very expeditiously and the scene of operations is changed almost aily from one portion of the county to another where the benefits of the union are required to relieve boy cotted persons a large number of men are employed at each machine and although the union has been in existence for only a vory briet period it can already claim to have done much to render ineffectual the decrees of the national league against persons who have refused to follow the behests ot that nefarious organization  all local men have been employed to carry on the wvork and the committee have received numberless applications from persons willing to accept employment a large number of labourers and small farmers as well as those in more favourable circumstances have signified their intention of joining the union the organization will be spread over the whole county and when all is perfected boycotted persons can be relieved at a moments notice the numerous promises monetary and moral of support which have been received from different parts of england more especially london where a committee of the defence union has been formed have given the committee great encouragement in the difldcult task that lies before them they confidently believe that the appeal which they in tend maiing to the people of england fur aid will uot be made in vain but will be cheerfully and generously responded to if they are well supported they feel assured that they will be able to curb the power of the national league by renderingintimidation useless and thus removing one of the most potent factors from which that organization derives any influnece which it possesses on saturday afternoon a very important meetig of the union was held at the rooms  southmall the business of the organizing committee wvas reviewed by gentlemen from various parts of the country and views were exchanged as to the best means of rendering assistance to those who are boycotted it was represented to the meoting that the cork steam paclcet company woould suffer loss by the action of the cattle dealers association and the meeting decided to appoint conipetent persons to attend fairs on behalf of the union aud purchase all boy cotted cattle and forward them to england by the steamers of the company by this means it is thought that the coli pany will be almost recouped for aiiy loss they would sustain by the nction of the cattle dealers in the event of this not proving satisfactory other means wvill be found to sustain the company against the outrageous course liursued by the cattle dealers tht union have invited all persons willing to dispose of cattle to communicate vwith their secretary and the cattle will be readily bought in and forwardedto england already a great suany persons have promised to send their cattle through the medium of tho union and when this becomes more generally recognized tliero can scarcely bo a dloubt but that the cattle business of the union will be increased tenfold no in termediate profit is locked for the margin of gain which cattle dealers obtain by the purchase and sale of cattle goes to the seller the defenceu nion has also resolved to grapple withanother important factor in the national league organization at the meeting on saturday the in convenience wvhich many obnoxious persons experience by reason of being unable to get their horses shod wvas represented it was decided to establish a travelling forge immediately and employ several blacksmiths a large caravan will be immediately procured and the blacksmiths wvill be busily cngaged this docion will cause niuch gratification to hundreds in the county cork whvo have beon unable to carry on their farm work because they could not get their horses shod possession was taken eli saturday by dealers of the old lassage railavy station which the corporation has rented to them for the penningc of cattlo awaiting shipment the dealers received a telegram from dublintrom mur maurice iealy solicitor announcizig that he had seen the under secretary in reference to the statement made by the tonvn clerlk of cork on the authority of a magistrate at the meet ing of the corporation ol friday that by an order of the privy council there were only tvo yards in cork fixed for the inspection of cattle to be shippednamely those of the clyde shipping company and the steam packet com pany the telegram is not altogether definite as to whether the authorities at dublin castle have yielded to the cattle doalers in a matter in which they could have withheld their sanction but it is quite clear that the cattle dealers will experience no difiiculty on the score of the legal barriers anticipated by the town cerk mr h only after stating that he had seen the under secretary says that  mr headley government inspector of cattle for the south of ireland has been ordered to go to cork to make necessary arrangements for cattle dealers in the meantime the cork boycotters are making the  necessary arrangements  to endeavour to ruin the steam packet company and now that they have been informed that the privy council rules do not jar with their objects they have engaged mir bt fitzgerald contrac tor to make tho required alterations in the premises which they have engaged for cattle penning mlr fitzgerald has accepted the contract with one condition attaching to it namely that he woulcl only take a sum of money from the cattle dealers which would cover the expenses he would incur in making the required alterations and would look for iio margin of profit for himself it is regrettable to find a gentleman like mr fitzgeraldgiving countenance to the object of a number of men wvho do not disguise their resolve to ruin the steam packet company if possible and who pay no heed to the fact that if they should succeed in their designs a long train of misery and suffering would be the inevitable fate of the shareholders many of whom are wholly dependent onl the percentage they derive from tho earnings of the compa ny eowvevr the prospects of the company appear to be brightening and many persons wvhoare competent to form an opinion on the matter express themselves hopeful that the decision arrived at by the cork defence union will result if not
