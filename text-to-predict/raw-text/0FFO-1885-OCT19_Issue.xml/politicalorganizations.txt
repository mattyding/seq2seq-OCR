political obganizationswibirmingramthe impending general election prcmises to le a political event of mnonientcus importance great forces hiave been set at liberty for the first time low influences are about to be brought to bear apon the political world and it is hardly to be wondered at that thoughtful men should lock forward to the future with a mixed feeling of interest and anxiety they are anxious to knowv what is coming and yet they are not full of eager ness tlhs is natural for in a certain tense it may be truly said that this country is submitting itself to a new regimae a partial revolution has been tranquilly accomplished by a constitutional process which happily exemplifies the unselqish character of our system of government the process was not novel by passing the iteform act of  the ruling classes to a certain extent of their own free willsince certainly they could not have been placed under legal compulsion admitted a large section of their fellow countrymen to a share in the government cf the country the ruling classes created by the act of  again by means of the act of  admitted another great section of their follow countrymen to the fran chise  and the present year has witnessed a repe tition of the process upon a scale which is entirely magnificentit is not however any part of the present purpose to summarize the results or to examine the character of either the remresentation of the people act or the redistribution act this has been done in the past we know at any rate approximately thenumber of the electors iu every constituency new and old it is possible to learn the exact territorial limits of every constituency at this point in  or in  it wvould havo been neeessary to end inquiries into facts and enter into conjecture but the problem wears a very different aspect in  great forces have ilideed been loosenec but they will not run riot since tlhero exists machinery deliberately and care fully adapted for the control and the management of the forces which have been set at liberty this machinery is to be found in the political organi zations which have arisen in great number of late years interesting and influential at all times as political phenomena these associations possess features of supreme interest and bid fair to acuiro an increasing influence in the face of the existing circumstances we have institutea therefore a special inquiry into the con stitntion and operations of some of the more imortant political associations of the united lcingdom with the view of discovering if possible the nature of the machinery employed the results of its operations in the past and the cbjects towards which it has been directed thus only is it possible to come to a just conclusion concerning tho merits of these institutions and to form an approximate idea of the influences which they are likely to exercise through the new electorate upon t  course of political affairssuch an inquiry could not fail to find a natural startingpoint in birmingham in that town the caucus system as it is commonly described first fotmd an english home and in it the system has flourished exceedingly producing results of which whatever their merits or demerits may be it is certainly impossible to question the mnagni tude and first of the meaning and derivation of the wvord  caucus as to the latter there are two theories the suggestion is that it ma be traced to certain meetings of the  caulkersof boston in america called together for the purpose of redressing grievancee consequent upon the maintenance of british soldiers in the american colonies the object of theso meetings appears to have been the choice of representative delegates as spokesmen and further it appears to have been customary to dotermine the exact programme of operations another theory attributes the derivation to the root  kawkaw  wincl in the language of the algonquin indians who it is believed dwelt upon the north bank of the st lawrence signifies a councillor on the whole the former theory whether it is etymo logically correct or not is in cloeer harmony with the english idoa of the character of the organi zations known by the name of the caucus since it contains the idea of discipline and discipline as wvill horeafter appear is the root of tho whole matter after all however the etymology of the wvord is a thing of comparatively small practical interest and it is enough to know that both the tvord and the system which it denotes are of american origin and further that the word itself carries a distinct meaning to the mind of evely person who is interested in political affairs ono poinlt only remains to be noticed in connexion rith the word  caucus neither the liberal association of birmingham nor any other liberal association chose it as a title but ittwas assigned to the birmingham liberal association by lord beaconsfield in no very kindly spirit and has been used to describe that association ever since time was when the liberals of birmingham felt sore upon this point wvitness the manner in wvhich it was spokon of by mr chamberlain in   it is lie says essentially inexact and misleadinit has tho great merit of boing inferentially offen sivo a quality which has insured the survival of mucb of our political nomenclature and under these circumstances it will be better frankly to accept tho wvord while trusting to time and ex perience to attach new and more attractive mean ings to itthere are two great political associations in birnminghani the one liberal and the other con servative of these the former as being the more important and effectual may be treated tirst it was established in  but did not take a genuino hold upon the population for at least five years in the year s however the ofecial ranks of the birmingham liberal association received a notable recruit in the person of mr schnadhofst a gentleman possessing great powvers of organization whose name has from the latter date been indissolubly connected with the idea of the liberal organization of birmingham wvhen mr schnadhorst became the secretary and ruling spirittho life and soul in factof the association it was to use a common and espres sivo phrase in low water it was established but had not taken a firm root in the affections of the birmiigham people lut mr sehnadhorst appears almost imniediately to have recognized the poten tialities of the weapons which jay ready for his haud and it was not long before the associa tion became an important factor in local politics it achieved an important triumph in tho mayoralty of tlho late president of the board of teade an imnprtant event at which it is neces sary to pause for a moment in the history of municipal selfgovernment there are fewr more in teresting epochs than the mayoralty of mr joseph chamberlain and there certainly can beno better opportunityfor studying the effect of the intro duction of political feeling into municipal affairs until  the tovn councillors of birminghamhad been selected by persons to wvhom it appnared thatimperial antimunicipalpolitics wvere essentially distinct matters  but in that year political pre judice begn for the first tinme to exercise a serious influence upon the municipal elections and from that date up to the present the political test has been rigorously applied to every candidate for municipal honours those vwho argue that the ad herence of a town councillor to this or that party in general politics is a matter of real importanco to the town in the government of which the towvn councillor is concerned possess as the major pro miss of their syllogisnm nn hypothesis which is rprintd facie highly reasonable this hypothesis may be giveniinthe wordsof anenthusiastic admirerofthe birmingham svsteni  a municipality contains he says  like the ouse of commons the narty of progress and the party wllich wvould keep things as they are tie party whicli wvould remove abuses firmly and the party which has more conservative patience with them  the party wvhich would mark its rule by improvements and the party which in stinctively resists change in this sentence there are several expressions which may reasonably be blamed as tending to prejudice for example ths uso of the word  conservative  is in temperate and it is obvious that a man who is  instinctively  averse to change is not more unreasonable than the man who is  instinctively  prone to novelty the sentence however contains on the whole a fair explanation of theintroduction of political feeling into municipal affairs it nevertheless contains an obvious non secqtiiitr a man may as experience has often proved belongto the party of progress in his ovwn borough and yet be a conservative in matters of imperial pclitics so on the other hand a man may be a lileral at westminstor full of grand schemes for the improvement of the conditon of the people and yet averse to change in lis own borouh again many men are largely influenced in takming their place upon one side or the other in politics by their views concerning the comparative importance of foreign and dmestic policy in shlort there are endless reasons which influence a man in his choice of a political creed which bave no weight with him vhen he is called upcn to decide whetler he will give his adherence to the party of progress in hiis owrn boroigh or to that of complacent quiescencenevertheless it would be unjust in the last degree to ray tbat in birmingham the introduction of nolitical animus into municipal affairs had preduced anything else than benefit to the localityonthe contrary it has been stated with perfect truth that mr chamberlains mayoralty was the beginning of a new era in the istor of the town blere again there is an opnortunity of using the language in which mr chamberlain fcrcibly paints the results of tho efforts of the liberal party in birmingham the cfforts of the liberals in our various local bodies have been steadily devoted for years to the improvement of the sanitary and educational condition of the town maaniflcent schools have been erected compulsion has been actively enforced the charge for instruction has been reduced to suit the means of the parents a thorough system of sanitary in spection has boon carried out an infectious hospital establishedthe sewerauo of the town com pleted its streets and footpaths properly paved parks have becen opened and baths and libraries provided the gas and water supply of the towvn nas been acquired and a gigantic scheme under the artisans dwellings act has received the sanction of parliament and is in cowrse of execu tionp these were the words of ir chamberlain in s and taken in combination with the necessary grain of saltwvhich on this cecasicn is far from being a largo onethoy accurately repre sent the working of a svstem of municipal politics which although it is apparently built upon a weak foundation in logic las undeniably produced excellent fruit n the whole however few people have been found to attack the operation of the caucusthe term is used purely for tho sako of convenienceso far as it affects local affairs nor are local affairs the present concern and they have only beenintrodueed in order that full weight might be given to the merits cf the caucus the present concern is with the affairs cf the nation at large and the gravamen of the charge against the caucus is due to the influence whieh it exercises upon those affairs that charge is a serious one but before it can be investigated in all its bearings it is absolutely necessary to examine tht constitu tion of the birmingham liberal association exceedingly similar to these rules and that con stitution but smewhat more dogmatic and rather more rigid are tho rules of the conservative association of that borough but it must be con ceded and remembered in all fairness to the last named association that it is the necessary con sequence and the inevitable outgrowth of its more perfect and more influential rivalbirmingham is divided into  wards or extra municipal districts and by rule iii of the rules of the birmingham liberal associaticn it is enacted that there shall be an annual meetidg of te liberals of each ward for the purpose of electing ward or district committees and appointing representatives on the divisional councile of the association such meetings are called ly placard and advertisement and by suchothermeans as may commend themselves to the various ward cr district committees  and it is to be noted that all these meetings are held on the same day and at the same hour in order to prevent anv interference with the liberals of cne ward by the liberals of another a ward committee consists in the �rst placei of the representatives of the ward upon the divisional council of which more will be heard laterand in the secondplacoof such otherliberals as may be elected each committee has powver to add to its number there is nothing to object to in this since w e have not yet come to the point of inquiring into the powers of the wvard committees but there is an cbvious questionwhat is a liberal i this is a question which is certainly not capable of being answered definitely and the birmingham liberal association does not so much as attempt to answer it the members of the association are all liberals who are elected to serve upon any of the ward committees or of the divisional councils in the prescribed manner   wvho subscribe to the association  wvho signify their adherence to the objects and the organiza tion of the association tho objects of the aesocia tion are twoto maintain theliberala ssociation of theboroughand to promote the adoption of liberal principles in thegovernment ofthe country aman in short is left free to make up his mind wlhether he is a liberal or no and the only fetter which is imposed upon him in jolning the association is tbat he is bound formally to signify adherencenot only to the objects of the association which are vague but to its organization wvhich is definite but turning again to the ward committees we come to the crucial point they exst it would seemand are elected forthe sole puirposes of adding to their own numbers and of selecting candidates for the representation of each ward in the town council it is exactly this power of selection which is tlie questionable matter but it occurs later in a more important connexion so that the discussion of it mav profitably be postponed for the momentthe next committee is called the executive committee it consists of theofficurs of the associa tion of sixr mcmbers elected fromoach ward in the mannerwhich bas beendescribedbeforctwo being the chairman and secretarv of the ward ccm mittee for the time beingsix members from balsall heath two frcm saitley and little prom wich ard twon frcm farbone these gentlemen have powrer to add  the total number of the com mittee being at the present time  their duties are to fix the dates for the annual meeting of the general council to fix dates for the election of the ward conmmittees and of the representatives on the divisional couicils they do nct possess any power of selection ext como the divisional councils in each of the parliamentary divisions which have been constituted by the recdistribution act there is a counicil consisting of representatives in the pro portion of three per cent of the parliamentary electors of the division the average being no members to each divisional council they are selected at the annual waard mectings and theirrincipal duty is the selection of the liberal candi nato for the representation of the divisicn in par liament in addition to this there is a general council formed by massing together the divisional councils and tho executive committeenumbering altogether about  personswhich exists for the purposo of determining the policy of the associa tion of acting as a scrt of quasi court of appeal to the divisional councils and of selecting the liberalcandidates for tho school board elecetions tlhis with a nmanagemnent committee who like the executive committeo never dictate to divisional councils or ward ccommittees hut only advise them when asked is the whole constitution of the birmingham liberal association as remodelled to suit the altered electoral conditions of the dey formerly the selection of parliamentary canididates lay entirely in the hands cf the general council or as it was then called the general coimmittee but the adoption of singlemember constituencies is the obvious explanation of the transfer of this power to the divisional councils which have been called into existence by the reform and redistribution acts of the last session of parliamentlet us followv the operation of this ccrmplex but accurate system in a bypothetical case it will be noticed first that the members cf the association need not necessarily be electors nor even so far as the language of the rules is concerned men they meet in their wvards they elect their ward commit tees and by electing tlheir ward committees pledge themselves to support thecandidates nemed by their committees for the municipal elections afain they meet in ward committeeelect their divisional council and thereby pledge themselves tc support the parliamentary candlidate who mnay be nomi nated by their divisional council in short as far as the laws of the association are oncerned it appears to be deliberately contemplated that the unenfranchised masses of the ccommunity should have a share in the representation of the people again it woula constitute but a trifling onward step if the representative of the divisional council were emipowered by law to come forward at the hustings and record by a singrle strolke of his pentho vote of every liberal elector in the boroiglh we are thus lrcugbt face to face with two curicus results in tho rrst place tha enfrenchised appa rently adnit the unienfranchised to a sharo in the replesentaticn of tho peoplo trcm bhich the legis lature has deliberately excluded them and in the seconid place the electors annually suirender their right of choosing a parliamentary candidate they say in short acecrding to tho plain interpretation of their laws and constitution w we placo our votes at the absolute disposal of the council and in electing the members of that council we twilgive the uncifranchised an equal vote with our selves having examined the constitution of the asso ciation it is fitting to inquire what merits its advo cates claim that it possesses ii the cect says mr chamberlain  is to make every man feel a personal interest in government and to widen the basis of representation till it is coextensive with the whole of the party  or as mr schnadhorst would put it  to organie lhe people so that proper expressicn may be given to the wishes and the opinions of the majority it can certainly claim for itself the strength which comes of unity elnd it can boast the enthusiastic support of those whom itsenemies are apt to describe as its hoodwinked victims in political operations it has met with unvarying successit has obtained the allegiance of practically the whole liberal party in birmingham and its leadersalthough they would object to being called such are clearly actuated by the highest motives meanwhile the system is open to much adverse criticismthe basis of this criticism can hardly be under stood without entering into some discussion on tho ideal positioni of a member of parliament is he a delegato or a representative  that is the root of the hole matter is he to use his own judg ment having originally given to the electors a fair general eketch of his political opinions or is he to be merely the automatic mouthpiece of his con stituency as representd by the council who nomi nated hlm as a parliamentary candidate  upon both sides of this question far moro may be said than can possilbly be written hero  but one thing in favour of the representative theory mriust be saidnamely that if a member of parliament is merely a delegato the debates in the house of commons are a lamentable waste of time and breath a delegate cannot logically or possibly be more than a voting machine  but for the name of the thing ho might as well be a lay figure the moment he begins to listen to argument he be comes a representativethat is to say he is a man whonihis constitueney has sent to parliament with a right to use his own judgment the basis there fore of the present critickm is that the representa tive theory of government is the better of the twoyhat then is the criticism it is one which has been offered before one which naturally suggested itself almost as scon as the caucus system was introduced into this country  it is that the caucus createsperhaps it would be more correct to say  imagines public opinon this mr chamberlain sboutly deniessayicg  the caucus does not make opinion it expresses it if this assertion were or could be correct the whole controversy would be at an end but it contains an inherent fallacy but the mischief of the thingconsists in the fact that tho caucus by its very ccnstitution gives an in correct expression to public cpinion driving many divergent opinions into cone rigid mould the general council meets to determine the policy of the associationin other words to formulate the articles of the liberal erced for the time being the electors have for the space of  months surrendered their rights of forming opinions or at any rate have conspired to fortify themselves against the risk of changing their minds these are the conditions ender which the general council meets to determine the policy of the association and under the circumstances it can hardly be arguad that the general council does not supply tho electors with opinions and place in their mouths words which their lips nmight be slow to uttera word moro may be said with regard to the selection of candidates if the caucus system were universal and as a necessary consequence all membersof the house of commons were delegates thero would be no need of searching for rmembers of parlianent who pnssessed any other moral or intellectual virtue tlan common honesty but our parliamentary systm has not yet arrived at that point argument and oratory still exercise a certain influence itr the heuse of commons and an experienced statesman still commends himself to the iudgment of an ordinary constituency more strongly than a man whom the electors might safely trsst to vote according to orders yet it nimay be said without hesitation that the obvious tendency of the caueus system is to excludefrom candidature many men adnirably calcu lated to represent the real feeling of the con stituencyit bas already been implied that the liberal association of birminghlaiii is an excellent electioneering machine judged by rtsults in deed it is little if anything short of perfect it produces exactly the fruit whiich it is intended to produce and liberal members are returned to the house of commons from birmingham with the same precise rcgularity as bullets cut of a mould it goes withleut saying therefore that there is also a conservative assceiation in birmingham more or less modelled upon the liberal lines it has ward comniittees elected at public meetings of conservatives ahnually convened but the ward committees can take no public action without the consent of the executive comnmittee this com mittee consists of  members only elected by the board of management the board of manage ment ccnsists of tho president vicefresidents treasurer and hon secretaries together with three representatives from each ward or extra municipal district two from tho midland con servative and the conservative clubs cne each from other conservative clubs in the borgugh and not more than  cooptativo members there are also divisional committees in the proportion of  to reo electors in each parliamentary divi sion who have much the same duties and powers as their liberal rivals so far there is but little difference between the organizations but when we come to the qualifications of membership the aspect of affairs is altcgether different rule iv runs thus all persons shall be deemed members of the association who subscribe at least one guinea a year to its funds or are duly enrolled as members of a vard or district committee the board of managemont shall have power unless a satisfactory explanation be given to remove from the list of members tho nanie of any person whose conduct appears to them inconsistent with the re quirements of rule ii this rule prescribes that mcmbers of the association shall de persons whose sentiments and political action are in accord with those of the conservative partv and  who acknowledge its recognized leaders hlis shortly is the constituticn of the conservative caucus which differs from its rival in principle chiefly inthat a power of expulsion is given to the boara of nmanagement who are not altogether popularly electod and in that a mcney qualification is re quired in practice the association has not flourished not merely because the conscrvative creed has not many adherents in birmingham but niainly because a large sectirn of the conserva tives ineluding some of the moest important men in tho town decline to be elrolled among its members
