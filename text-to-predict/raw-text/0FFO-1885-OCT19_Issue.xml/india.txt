in bengal but the dusserah occupying two days and forming a portion of the bengali festival is most religiously oberved by all hlindoos the anticipation that the dusserah and the mahomedan mohurrum would this year fall on the same days has been causing some uneasiness and the government have been concerting measures to prevent a collision between the hindoos and the mfahomedansthe distress fund committee according to the last advertised list dated october  have obtained about  rupees the indian mlirror a calcutta paper which represents young bengal and which during the ilbert bill controversy made itself very prominent on their behalf grate fully acknowledges that the movement now in pro gress for relieving suwfering in the flooded districts owes its origin chiefly to the benevolence and humanity of the bengal chamber of commerce a body composed mostly of enghlishmen and says englishmen will have no reason to doubt that their violent opposition to the original ilbert bill was based entirely on the ground thatit threatened encroachment on their rights nor their disclaimer of a feeling of hostility to natives and native inte rests if they now come forward with practical proofs of their sympathy in the form of contribu tions however small the european firms in cal cutta have shown their sympathy not merely by initiating the mdvement referred to before any appeal was made to them but have supported that movement by liberal donations promptly givensatisfactory progress is being made with the repairs to the damage caused to the railways a large amount of labour is being employed and it is expected that the lines injured by the floods will shortly be in full working order the earn ings of the eastern bengal state railwayhave been seriously affected for the  weeks ending september  the total was six lakhs less than in the corresponding period of last yearby last weeks official report it appears that in bengal except in the flooded tracts the prospects of amun and rice are favourable other standing crops are generally favourable rabi cultivation is progressing vigorously prices are fluctuating in the punjab the central provinces the northwestern provinces and oude they are falling in miysore and tc some extent in bengal with regard to the threatened famine in mysore continued improve ment is reported and unless the northeas t

districts east of the ganges where there are bumper crops the exports of wheat and linseedwhich are almost trebled have gone chiefly to calcuttathe returns of seaborne trade with british india for the year  do not show a very favourable prospect the diminution amounts to a little more than one and ahalf per cent which does not appear to be so great as was expected ab ombay paper computes an increase in the years s and s of about  per cent respectively the three following years only showed about four and ahalf per cent since then the trade of india as of most other countrieshas been increasing a better comprehension of the decline will be obtained if the average amount of increase is taken into considerationthe present financial position of india attracts notice the task before the government of pro viding revenue is recognized as a difficult one the salt tax which is admittedly the sole financial reserve of the country apparently can not be touched the reply of the mladras chamber of commerce a prcis of which has been already telegraphed to you is very generally approved the prospect of an incometax excites opposition in the native papers as its imposition will provoke serious agitation the suggestion of a calcutta paper that opportunity should be given for a fair discussion of the finance ministers proposals before the government are committed to their acceptance seems worthy of considerationthe appointment to the post of mili tary member of the council which is shortly to be vacated by general wilson is discussed in military circles it is thought that it would be a grave mistake a fruitful source of complications and a certain cause of waste of time in future if his successor should be one whose relations with the commanderinchief eleetwere likelyto become strained of the candidates colonel chesney is regarded as a conscientious worker with broad views and there is no reason to anticipate friction between himself and sirf roberts the only criticism against him is that heis wanting in praa tical experience the one whose appointment apparently would give the greatest satisfaction is sir herbert macpherson sir herbert has had wider experience of soldiering and possesses a more intimate knowledge of the various military departments in india than any ether officer taking a genuine interest in economic reform and it is to his suggestion that thegovernment is indebted for saving large s ums in more than one military de partment shrewd and clearheaded he is not likely to be led to sanction any but practicable and reasonable proposals being on good terms with sir f roberts he is considered the best fitted for the duties required failing sir w macpherson colonel chesney wonld not be unac ceptable to the service but any other appoint ment is to be deprecatedthe action of the bombay presidency associa tion with regard to the resolutions supporting an alpdeal to the british electorate is kept before thepiblic by native critics that action is contirmod bthemadras andpoonaha ssociations and presuimably by thecalcntta andeurracheeassociations though the coneurrence of the latter is not published the british indian associationone of the most iram portant native political organizations in india however repudiates it considering that tho native community of india should not identifythemselves with any political party in england it also de clines to support the appointment of bombay and madras delegates to england because it believes it to be extremely inconvenient to tie the associa tion to the political opinions of individuals the president of the bombay association has ex tracted himself from an unenviable position by resigning his membership sir j jeejeebboy writes i feel i cannot any longer remain a member of an association wlhich apparently aims at using india and indian interests for the political pur poses of one or other political party in england to us both parties are or should be alike t have stanch friends as many among the one as among the otlher party and not least among them are in my opinion several of the gentleman gratuitously and objectionably proscribed
