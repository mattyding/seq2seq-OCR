candidate for taunton cthe earl of corki briefly opened the proceedings welcoming ir trevelyan to somerset as a distinguished member of the late administration who could fairly be called the original promoter of the extension of the fran chise to the counties cheerssir tnoas acland then proposed  that this meet ing heartily welcomes the right hon george trevelyan and desires to recognize his distinguished services to the liberal party and the liberal causeespecially in the activeart he has taken in extending the franchise to two mil ons of his fellow countrymen cheersmr g f luttrell of dunstcr castle seconded the motion which was carried with cheersmir trevelyan who was cordially received on rising to ackno dge the compliment said lord cork and gen tlemenit is indeed a proud day to one who always has cherished the right of calling himself a somersetshire man to receive a welcome like this from a somersetshire audience every somersetshire man knows what the aclands and what the luttrclls are and if anything could add to the pleasure of this afternoon it would be to have this welcome given to me from the mouth of my kind old friend sir thomas acland and seconded by mir luttrell oï¿½ dunster castle cheers  and an additional agreeable uess is given from the fact that it is at such a moment as this we are met together on the eve of as great a con test as ever was fought by the weapons of voice and vote ve are met together in a town wvhich is the centre of one of the most important districts in which this struggle vill be fought hear hear it is very important that the people of lancashire and yorkshire that the people of suih towns as glasgow and leeds and manchester should bestir themselves as they are bestirring themselves at the present moment but the real and most important point of the contest does not lie in those greab commercial and mining centres hear hear wo hope the best of those populations and i believe our hope will not be dis appointedhearhear  but i can assure you that those who have the interest of the liberal party the most at heart and who may call themselves in some degree the directors of its policy are looling with the most eager and wistful interest to thoese populations which were unrepresented under the old system bet to whom the reform bill has given the privileges of citizens and who now have an opportunity of showingwhether they have got the qualities of courage independence and genuine patriotism i can imagine nothing more melancholy than the condition of some of the most famous historicalyof ourenglishdistricts before the close of that representative system which died on the day that the r oyal assent was given to the fran chise bill hear hear look at these counties in the west of england think what they were hundreds of years ago think how in the th century the enterprise and courage of these counties founded our commerce and our naval supremacy think how your forefathers saved the independence of england against the spanish armada thihk what sufferings they endured in the dys of the stuarts for liberty and then what a contrast is that to the days when election after election there came from devonshire and somersetshire an unbroken tale of tory mnembers out of sympathy with popular aspirations and if   sand  which would have remained unbroken but f or the galiant gentleman who sits on my left sir t d acland and who is now courting the suffrages of the wellington division i see that mir elton asks whether you will give the representation of west somerset to a gentleman with a large estate to be put as a feather in a fine old cap laughter well i do not know whether you will it is for those who are better acquainted than i am with local polities to say i know one thing and that is never had a constituency fairer opportunity of showing whatitthought of one who fought the battle offreedom in its darkest days than by welcoming sir thomas acland to somerset shire with which he has as close a connexionand that is saying a good dealas ever he had with devonshire and of sending hack to parliament a gentleman who as a county memberisas hardwvorkiidg as honestand as well informed in everthing a county member requires to know as any gentleman who ever stepped across tho threshold of the tlouso of commons cheers i see an attempt is being made to persuade you into the idea that the conservative party were not averse to extending household suffrage to the counties oh well i gather from tho reports of mr stanleys speeches that such is the opinion those reports are extremely condensed i have been studying the somnersethire papers for some weeks past in hopes of iinding out the opinions of those gentlemen who aspire to bo conservative representatives but unfortunately the spokb smeu of the tory party in these districts appear to be not so much the parliamentary candidates as some gentlemen who have no parliamentary ambition but who are trying to further the fortunes of others and for every oine sentence i can find of r stanley or colonel paget i am condemned to read at least half a column of a mr llemmitgs laughter well in this case what appears to be the conservative view of the relation of their own party to the franchise is put forward very tersely n the speech of tfr broadmead at lililverton laughter mr broadmead says what the conservatives did was this they said we will not pass the franchise for the counties unless you also introduce a scheme for redistribution of seats a voice quite right too i see that mir broadmead says he is very closely and early connected with milverton i am pleased to think that in the close ness and earliness o connexion with milverton i do not yield to mlr broadmead  but whatever may be the case with iilvorton undoabtedly my association with the extension of the county franchise is both earlier and closer than that of mr broadmead cheers and laughter and i can assure him though i do not fancy it is news to the electors of somerset that his account of the matter is entirely incorrect in the year  i and sir charles dilke laid before the house of commons the following resolution  that in the opinion of this house it is desirable to adopt a uniform parliamentary franchise for borotgh and county constituencies and that it would be desirable so to redistributo political power as to obtain more complete representation of the opinions of the electoral body if the conservatives wvanted to combine the extension of the franchiso with the redistribution of seats we gave them an opportunity hear hear we gave thom the same opportunity in  in  and in  and iustead of taking it they spoke and they voted in a body against that very combination of the county franchise and the redistribution of seats which mtr broad mead says they were always anxious for but i will put it to another test and i want the conservative candidates to read wvhat i say and to submit themselves to this test aud i do not want to have anything more to say about mlr broadmead or mr hemmings but will mr elton or mr stanley or colonel paget stand up at their next meeting and say it is their conscientious opinion that if we had had a large tory majority in the parliament which is now expiring the franchise would by this time have been extended to the counties no conservative candi dates in these days will say a great deal laughter and a voice they will say anything  but i do not think they will venture to say that a voice yes they vill i must ask yon to allow me to answer my own questions laughter there is not a somer setshire man who has obtained the franchise who does not know to which of the two great parties he owes it w hen the majority of the county householders had no vote when their good will went for nothing when their support was rather a weakness than a strength to a political party the liberals took up their cause and fought for it through good report and through evil report unitil they brought it to a successful issue it was nothing to us whether the people of milverton or ilminster or yeovil or westonsupermare or williton were going to give their votes to the liberals or the tories we thought they had a right to those votes and we were determined they should have them cheers and now that theyhave the suffrage i am slow to believe that the first use to which the ill put it nvill be to tho detnment of tho parts vho gave them the suffrago that is glad they have got the suffrage and is not afraid of tho use to which they will put it cheers in determining to which party they will give their first vote i earnestly trust that the somersetahire electors the conservatives especiallv will carefully consider the condition of ireland cheers the qua rtery review says the condlition of ireland isunde niably far better than i has been ever since mr gladstone returned to power i deny it i absolutely deny it hear hear just as i emphatically deny lord salisburys asser tion that the condition of ireland which is now so dis creditable and so dangerous grew up uuder and was due to the administration of lord spencer and myself i do not believe that the assertion would be indorsed by a single man who has property at stake in ireland be he liberal or conservativo and i pity from my heart and sou i oity those irish landlords and those poor lawabiding rishfarmers who read the sort of statements lord salisbury is making on this side of the channel for conservative con sumption what is the state of the case  wvhen lord spencer and i were in ireland cheers men fulfilled their civil obligations they are not fulfilling them now when lord spencer and i were in ireland rent was paid morereadily than it is paid in engiand at this present moment in many parts i think we msght almost say in most parts of ircland rent is not being paid at all a voice boy cotting and as for boycottingthe notion that boycotting is not much more virulent and much more universal now than it was under lord spencer is a notion which would never be maintainod for one single moment by anybody who is boycotting or by anybody who has becn boycotted laughter what is boycotting  boycotting is cutting offall communication and all the advantagesof civilization and all the means of life from those people who have taken farms which the national league did not intend they should take and from all people who communicate with them or deal with them or work for them these wretched peonle are called landgrabbers and they are denouncedtote vengeance of the mob in printed notices and in violent speeches now when lord specer was in ireland to issue theso notices and to mnake these peeches was lpunishable offonce hear hcar and what was more it was an offence which was punished and punished very effectually hear hear but hardly was lord snencer out of office which in his caso meant power for i seo you recognizo the distinction than a meeting near someevicted farms was held for tho purpose of intimidation a meeting which lord spencer had forbidden to bo held was held fivo wretched men were hung in effigy around the plat form and from the platform three members of parliament violently denounced these men to the mob lord salisburys government took no steps to protect these people whowere so cruelly treated and they took no steps to call to account those three members of parliament and that with very good reason for these three members of parliament were part of the majority which put lord salisbury in office rcheers and hisses lord salisbury tells us that  prose cutionis for boycotting are pending but does lord salis bury himself expect these prosecutions to succeed a voice i question if one wvill succeed they would have succeeded a year ago if they had deserved to succeed because they would have been tried before a special jury but to try boycotting cases before a common jury in their own neighbourhood within the sphere of the terror which the boycotting itself has created is a farce a most cruel farce as concerns these poor people who are boycottedthe most inconceivable statement that lord alisbury m s is that the crimes act did not diminish outrages this is the responsible statement of the prime liinister of engnd i can understand what that state ment means in the mouth of an advanced liberal member but i cannot understand what it means in the mouth of lord salisbury in the year  when there wvas no crimes act there were  agrarian outrages the crimes act was passed in  and in  there were  agrarian outrages or a difference of one to six cheers but take the gravest class of crimemurder in the first uine months of  there were  agrarian and political murders in  there wvas one in lss there was none cheers well now i can understand an advanced liberal who does not like the crimes act saying that this diminution of crime was due to the beneficent operation of the land act  but is that the oeinion of lord salisburyis that the only conclusion he can arrive at  he has always denounced the land act as unnecessary and uncalled for and as a measure of plunder and robbery landlords in ireland are in a terrible position milr healy tells them that the course of the irish people is clear it is a course of determination to bring about the destruction of landlordism lr parnell speaking on rather a solemn occasion in the same town as two of the chief roman catholic archbishops said that the people did not regard judicial rent fixed by the land com mission as any more sacred than old rent and on the next day lord dunraven a member of the government went down to norwsch toansweraspeechwhichimadethereand said that the government welcomed and were anxious for the support of theparnellites does lord dunraven or lord ashbourne say or would mr edward gibson have said for one moment that they can expect to have the support of mir parnell and mir eealy unless they acquiesce in and accept mir parnells and mlr healys theory about the nonpay ment of rent  these liish questions are very intricate the past of ireland is confused the future is dark  but there is one course which plain and honest men as i believe the great majority of somersetshiro electors are may take and that is to resolve that the next government shall be one which shall not be dependont upon parnellite support cheers bet that it shall be a governmont supported by such a body of followers like the gentlemen i see around me that they shall deal with these irish questions from motives of justice and wisdom and not from motives of political expediency and ministerial sub serviency cheers illy own firm belief is that we shall get a very solid and large majority over both tories and parneulites cheers and i will tell you why now istead of the old system under which a parcel of solicitors and country squires and great noblemen meet on the first floor of some country inn or after dinner in some countrv house and settlo who are to be the candidates for the division and then impose them upon the division and instead of those candidates when they became members having nothing to do but go occasionally to a ploughing match or a flower show laughternow the gentlemen who wish to re present a country district have to goaboutand make speeches in  or  or  villages and in order to speak withanyeffector any frequency they must havesome thin to say our candidates have each of them a creed hear hear it may not be exactly the same creed as their neighbours and i am uncommonly glad it is not but at any rate it is a creed which the candidate believes in genuinely and he can explain intelligibly the liberal candidates all the country over whether they are ex cabinet ministers or gentlemen aspiring for the first time to parliamentary honours can tell you plainly their views on local government the licensing laws the land laws education the game laws and the procedure of parliament a voice how about the church  lhey did not wait till ir gladstone put out his manifesto but now mr gladstone has put his manifesto out they gladly recognize that he will lead us as worthily in the future as he ever did in the past cheers but meanwhila the conservative candidates official and nonofficial were waiting for lord satisbury as if not one of them had an opinion of his own at last the news came from london that a cabinet meeting had been held and that the rulers of the country had assembled to see whether they had a political creed and understand by talking among themselves wbat that politcal creed might be and now everybody has lad the advantage of reading lord salisburys programme cheers in considering that programme the first thing is to look and see what there is in that which is not in mr gladstones manifesto because for that point and that point only will the conservatives be able to take credit as against ourselves the only proposal which is not taken from the liberal wardrobe the only proposal which bears the true salisbury stamp as far as i cani make out is a suggestion that any incumbent of the church of england shall be allowed of his own free will and motion and without the surveillance of the ecclesiastical com missioners to sell church lands and invest the money in consols i look at this proposition with the gravest suspicion sales of this description under lord cairnss act even when they are watched by trustees more closely than lord salisbury intended them to be watched are open to the very gravest abuse this suggestion likewise contains a principle which i for one ill never acknow ledgethat is that a clergyman of the church of england has an interest especially a personal interest in his stipend be it glebe or tithes other than any servant of the public has in the salary which is paid him for doing public work out of the national property or the national ex chequer  hear hear and cheers but there is anothor and much moro serious consideration when we are judging lord salisburys programme and that is whether he and his followers are the right people to carry out those legislative changes which they have accepted very reluctantly and which at heart they all thoroughly disliko cheers wlhat lord salisburys own feolins about some of these great questions are may very easity be seen from his speech one of the greatest questions is simplifying land transfer and making it cheaper hear hear mr goschen has told us that the transfer of land sholdd be as cheap and easy as the transfer of conmols and accordingly lord salisbury sneers at mr goschen and says mr goschen knows a great deal about consolsbut knows nothing about land now it so happens it has come within my personal knowledgethat mr goschen though fortunately for him ho has a great deal less land than lord salisburyis veryintimatelyacquainted indeed with practical farming cheers in fact lir goschen is a farmer and i do not believe there is any man in the country who knows more than mr gosehen about the effect and scope of possible land reforms and as a matter of fact i myself brought into the house of conmnons an irish land bill by which the sale of land was made quite as cheap and easy as the sale of consols and the conservatives took up this bill this year and passed it and at this moment the sale of land in ireland would be as cheap and easy as consols if it had not been that lord salisbury and lord carnarvon by dropping lord spencers methods of preserving law and order have taught the irish farmer to think it is much cheaper and easier to pay no rent than to buy his farm under the most simple methed that human ingenuity ever devised for my art i prefer to trust the great problem of reforming the land laws to the great party which contains such old land re formers as ir shawlefevre mrvilliam fowler and mr arthur arnold men who have all along believed that simplification of land transfer is a thing which ought to be done which should be done and we are determined that it shall be done and not to give it over to a party whose leader at the very moment he says he is going to takeothe thing in hand is sceptical whether anything at all can be madie of it hear hear i doubt whother the temperance party will have much confidence in the temperance legislation ofa statesman who tells us that freedom in tho retail sale of spirituous liquor is bonnd up with  those doctrines of eivil and religious liberty laughter for which we have fought so hard and under goune so much laughter and cheers i doubt whether local government reformers will have much confidence in the local government reform of statesmen who belong to a cabinet which brought forward a scheme of local go vernment reform in which there was no direct repre sentation of the people whatsoever and in which all the administration was put inthe hands of nomineemagistrates appointed by the lord lieutenant himself a nomineei speak with the greatest respect towards lord corkand to the boards of guardians and they would be still less willing to trust a statesman who like lord iandolph churchill hisses thought this miserable instal ment ot reform was so dangerous and revolutionary that he denounced it in an extremely long and elaborate and eloquent speech in which he attacked fiercely both the bill and the blinister who introduced it laughter and when we returnfrom home toforeign affairs there is very little that is inspiriting or encorraging in the programme of lord salisbury we hear on all sides that conservatives have some special recipe for managing foreign affairs  but as far as i can make out the evidence that it rests on is that lord salisbury and lord beacons field had great success in the berlin treaty laughter and that success consisted in the separation into two parts of that province of bulgaria which the course of events has now united again laughter strange to say lord salisbury finds a matter for pride in this unification of bulgaria and boasts of it on this ground that the province could never have been united now bad he not previously broken it asunder laughter but the fact of the matter is there is very little reason for pride and the lesssaid about the whole transaction thebetter a marked characteristic of those great diplomatic changes in which great britain took an interest in the past and of which we are proud now when we look back in history is above all their permanence look at the establishment of the kingdom of greece of belgium and the kingdom of inited italy these wvere all undertakinos in which the best gart of british opinion was deeply interested and which we helped very largely to further and they have all lasted to this day but all that was essential in the berlin treatythe right of turkey to garrison the balkans by her hold on eastern roumelia is gone like a shadowgone like the six millions which we paid  and with it has gone the title to foresight and statesmanship which was founded upon so limsy a basis cheers then lord salisburv confesses in so many words the justice and the wiedom of the policy at which we were aiming in e teand afghani stan at the time we went out of office e cpomplains very much that we taunt his government with slavish and sub missive condluct because they continue our policy now wedo no gucbthing yc dnotblqm the conservativefor continuing our policy now that they are in office wvhat we blame them for is that when we were in office and they wvere in opposition they could find no measure to the violence of the language wvith which they attacked that policy and the authors of it cheers at question time when we were in office parliament and the country were disgraced and discredited by the potty pertinacity of the attacks which were directed by right hol gentlemen who sat on the front opposition bench and gentlemen and noble lords who then sat below the gangway but who are nov on tho treasury bench against the people who were doing their best for the common fortunes of the country who were carrying on intricate negotiations with foreign powersagainst in fact every atom of that policy which our former critics are nowv continuing and imitating cheers when we are talking of programmes whether in lord salisburys programme or in lord george hamil tons or in mr w h smiths wvhere is there any allusion to measuires which are absolutely necessary in order to in crease the dignity and the efficiency of parliament hear hear we knov very well what your local conservatives think on this matter mr ruscoinbe poole made a speech at the bridgwater dinner last week and my attention was called to it because mr elton referred to this speech and said  it was difficult to aniswer the eloquent wvise and statesmanlike address which they had just heard laughter i was rather piqued by that challenge and determined to try and answer mir poole and i read his speech through three times in order that i might discover what was considered to be statesmanlike among somerset shire conservatives laughter besides the usual abuse of mrgladstone sir charles dilke and mr chamberlain cheers in rather highlyseasoned form i found two prac tical propositions and two only one was to use mr pooles expression  it was worth wvhile to keep the queen on the throne laughter and that is a sub ject which as an old servant of the queen with an old servant of the queen in the chair i do not choose to drag into party politics  hear hear and cheers the other was a description of mir gladstones very moderate scheme for reforming the procedure of parliament as  an attempt to gag the house of commons and stop the hberty of debate laughter that is the language of con servatism all the country over hear hear and this will be more and more the language of conservatism till the days of the general election because next to law and order in ireland and next to the vast mass of the money of the british taxpayer the dignity and efficency of the house is the most acceptable sacrifice which can be made by the conservatives to their parnellite allies cheers the dignity of the house of commons and the speaker who has so nobly maintained that dignity hear hear are the special obiects of irish aversion and attack the nationalists boast that they have got rid of mr forster lord spencerand myself laughterand they have got rid of lord hampden tho late speaker and now they are aiming at getting rid of lr peel in that aim ana object they have the assistance of lord george hamilton and the tory party in london i am bound to say that i believe that in leamington and waraick itself there are many conservatives who would be very sorry to oppose their eminent representative a ridiculous attempt has been made to justify this attack upon mir peels seat in the middle of october by saying that in the middle of july i went down and attended a public meeting at wel lington i went down by request of the speaker himself because he thought that tho  people in leamington and wlarwick had a right at a time like this to display a citizen interest in national politics cheers it would be a very heavy price to pay even for the honour of returning mlr speaker inslowand i am bound to say i think mr peel stands worthily even by the side of that great name if one condition of returning him was that all his con stituents are always to be prevented from hearing and making speeches about the political faith that is in them cheers and besides i went to leamington in the character of one who lives very much in warwickshire in order that i might address from a leamington platform my friends and neighbours in the iural districts of south warwickshire who are fighting an arduous but as i believe it will be a successtul battle for the liberal cause cheers among other things they are fighting what i see you were fighting toothat is the battle of free trade against protection cheers in the oflicial manifestoes and speeches of the government we hear very little attention given to this great question it is not so with the rank and file of the tory party no one could read the proceedings at the bridgwater conservative dinner which i take to have been a classic occasion on which the senti ments of the party were expressed without seeing that next december you will have to give your votes for and against commercial privilege and commercial restriction in proposing mir stanleys health mlr warry said lvhy should not radicals and i suppose under that headc he included ir goschen  have to do with the commis sion of inquiry because they knew what the evidence would be and that it would be so damning to their pet theory that it could not exist much longer free trade had been the cornerstone of the radicals for the last  years and if that as removed down would go the party like a shot in reply to that toast mr tanuley said not one single word to repudiate those opinions if sir thomas aciands health were proposed in those words do you think he would have allowed them to pass unnoticed   no no the battle wnicel yoa nave to fight in this district at any rate is the battle for cheap tea cheap sugar cheap meat and cheap bread cheers it will be the old old battle of the many against the few and of the small people against the great cheers now fortunately the manyhave votes and if you are true to yourselves wve know what the issue will be cheers for my own part i do not think the proceedings of the con servative party in this district will do much to advance their cause bear hear i see that one gentleman who was one of their principal speakers said  he would not call his opponents a troop of jackals but he would call them a gang another shame be it said dragged in the namo of the lady who will bh remembered in history as lady chatham is remembered as a nobleworthy helpmeet of a great statesman in order to rouse laughter by uoting what professed to be a private conversation of mlrs gladstone hisses and crie of  shame now i believe these speakers whether they be baronets or arch deacons entirely mistook the character of the new votersear hear  the agricultural population of the country donot lovescandal and invective cheers they havea greatdea ore of the gentleman in them than a good many ot those people whofor three long parliaments have refused them their votes on the ground that they were defi cient in culture and general information they have got those votes now and they will give them not to those people wiho have tried to tickle and attract them by v uigar per sonal abuse of their political opponents not to those people who hold forth to them promises of commercial protection which cannot be made good but they will give them to those serious earnest solid men who talk to them as if they were responsible and reasonable beings and who try to persuade and convince and not to bef
