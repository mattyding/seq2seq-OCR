mr childerson friday night in addressing a meeting of liberals at perrybrhige near pontefract mr childers mp brought to a close tho visit he has been paying to his constituents mir roulton the chairman having opened the proceed ingsmr childers after referring to local matters said that  years ago or even at half that distance of time when he first became one of the members representing that borough the landed interest was represented in rarliament far more than any other interest but in the late parliament that interest was not quite so strong he hoped that in the future there would be a larger representation of the industrial classes cheers and that there would not only be more farmers in parliament but also some of the less wealthy employers at the present time they had in the rouse of commons two or three farmers and two special representatives of labour the two labour representa tives were blr burt and mir broadhurst loud cheersboth of whom bv their thorough knovledge anci straightforward conduct had woon positions in the house of great influence and authority he hoped others of the same kind wonld be returned in future as ho looked forward to a parliament vwich would be a parliament of work so he hoped that in matters of opinion there wvould be much toleration and that members would be ready to give and take he had noticed that during the last fevr weeks there had been a tendency to magnify differences rather than to accept them as inevitable the liberal party must from its very nature always contain differences of opinion their aim as a party was to get rid of abuses to encourage both in dividual and general freedom to abolish privileges of all kinds unless shown to be umnistakably for the public advantageand to carry on the queens government by the people for the people loud cheers there always would be differences of opinion as to what were serious abuses na in the manner they ought to be attacked there would be differences of opinion as to how far each man shonld have leave to protect himself and at what distance and at what point the state ought to interfere to take care of bhu and regulate his conduct  also up to what point the direct action of the government and the will of the majority of tho people should prevail over the fair wishes of the minority the lileral party had flourished bv allovwing such differences to be fairly discussed within its ownnborders they did not attempt to force the rapid adoption or even the advocacy of great changes as essential for all who called themselves libernls nor on the other hand did the liberal party underrate or suspect those wvho saw more cuickly than others and who almost by instinct conceived great ideas and urged schemes of extensive reform some years before the country generally was alive to their necessity he bad seen lately some symptoms of a great difference between the great sections oi the party between those who would proceed slowly and cautiously and those who would move rapidly and who knew the danger attend ing the postponement of changes they felt were for the public good some lfhigs blamed the radicals for adopt ing newv ideas too rapidly and some radicals found fault with the slowvness of thewhigs butashewished tobecalled a liberal and a friend of progress rather than either whig or adical he would strongly urge upon the meeting that the latitude of the viewv among liberals on questions still open should be encouraged he said this in the face of opponents who differed from the most moderate of liberals far more than liberals differ among them selves referring to free trade he contended that it should be maintained that popular government should be established freely in the constitution of local authority that temperance should be encouraged and that education shotuid be brought home to all classes cheers those had been the liberal watchwords for nmany years cheers their opponents started from a very different point their old standard was the privilege of the people and they only accepted bit by bit the facts of the liberal programme laughter the liberal motto wvas progress some wishing it to be slower and some faster but all wishing to move onward cheers he askcd them vhich of the two contending parties they would adopt a voice liberals and cheers as he had said he wvas not on all occasions for rapid action but greatdanger might under certain circumstances result from the delay of reforms he had noted with great interest indeedthediscussionamong irish people them selves in recent years as to the reforms in their govern ment they would remember that in oconnolls time there was a great cry for the repeal of the union that was resisted and it died out a much more moderate practical proposal was made by the men of ireland and in nll parts of the nation some years ago that ireland should have a larger share than ste had nowv in the management of her own affairs at pontefract the other day he offered his constituents and through them to the country what seemel to himn a moderate and practical solution of the question what he said then had been the subject of not unkind criticism and that criticism so far as it had gone confirmed him in his view choers lwhether the particular solution he suggested should be adopted or some other the question should be settled as soon as possible iear hcar they would have in the next parliament members coming from ireland determined that these questions should be settled and if this was not dune he thought that great danger would follow the present was a quiet time in ireland and the best time for settling this question for although there was sonie boy cotting still the far greater evils of a few years ago did not prevail at this moment the present was a good time to settle the question whether irish affairs could be safely intrusted to ircland referring to the land question he said there were certain views abotut it which had not taken at all in the public mind but which had the advo cacy of a few persons not perhaps known to parliament if those views were allowed to sink into the public mind they might produce the greatest possible evil the liberals wisshed to settle the lana question wvithout infringing the rights of property cheers  but they wvished the settle nment to he a full one the time had come when the people might wvell express in the ballotboxes their opinion upon this subject everybodl wnlo read nevspapers must know that it wa a question of great peril andi a ques tioi of great peril should be dealt with by larliament and the nettle extracted before the evils increased the question of local government wvas ready for settle mnent he wvas a member of a committee of the last caibinet over wvhich sir charles dilko cheers presided that committee drew up a detailed and admirable plan for the settlement of county government which plan sir charles dilke with extreme clearness laid before the countrv a t ralifax the other day he hoped that the country would adopt sir charles dilkes proposals because they vould place the local government of this country in the hands of the people both in the country districts and in the great towns and would also place in their own bands the regulation of affairs which were nowv dealt with by magistrates or at least bypeopleelectedundera curious forn of suffrage cheers there were questions wvhich he considered were not ripe for settlement in some cases perhaps the best plaii wvas to proceed rapidly but in others to proceed wvith more caution the question of free education was one of those in which more inquiry ought to he made before they could adopt either one or the other of the proposals before them there was another great qucstion ot public interesthe meant free trade cheers he confessed it was immaterial wvhether the attack of the fairtraders came paon them sooner or later for they were in possession of the citadel cheers on the pre viious nighit he ondeeavoured to give them some idea as to the great benefit free trade had beeni to the people probably they wvould hear snore about it before the election was over for the borough vas flooded by leaflets containing extraordinary statements utterly impracticable put forward by the fairrale league it wvas stated for instance that the price of mat had been raised by free trade but farmers well knew that prices of stock had gone seriously dowvn the leaders of the liberal party were freetraders to a man cheers and they would at the right time be wvell pre paredl to undertake the defence of free trade

guiltyof any act of presurption when having been requested to attend this important meeting i gladly accepted the invitation cheers i believe that i am addressing gentlemen coming from no fewver than seven electoral divisions which under the actof the last session of parliament constitute this part of england for electoral purposes of these seven diisions i think either mvself or my family are known in there hear hcar and therefore having that connexion or interest in this part of the country although i am by birth a york slireman i trust i may be allowed to address to you a few words in answer to the resolution you have adopted it atik you sinceroly for the resolution which you have just passed expressing your confidence in my great leador ir gladstonie and in those of us who as followvers have heen associated with hini in conducting the affairs of the cotiutry i thank you i say most sincerely for the con lidelce in i k gladstone which you think his past work has justified hear hear and for the assurance that you all ieel tihat if after this electionhereturns to power hewilldo his duty in the futture as he has done in tho past checrs let rsue say ono wvord to you about the connexion between the late government and the great accession tooliticl power vhich bas come to the great mass of those msc before me it may be said without any injustice that in the division of the country into electoral districts ir gladstone and thoso who worked with him are not the ony parties to whom credit should be given  and that is lierfectly true it is the case that when it becamo aestiod ot so many months ago of what should happenconsequence of the resistance of the house of ores to the first bill that nwe passed we were fortunately able to secure at that most critical moment the co ereration of our opponentslord salisbury who led therqgosition in the house of lords and sir stafford north oe who with much credit to himself bofore he was driven out of it led the ofpasition in the house ofcommons we wero fortunate enough to obtain their co operation in supporting the passing of the seats bill but gentlemeu do not bo deluded by those who tell you that you one tho franchise to anything but tho courage of mr gladstone cheers itwas ilr gladstone wvho at the moment wben he saw that the country was thoroughly with him had thc courago to propose and in the teeth of a large amount of absolute opposition to carry through the house of cummons that measure which has conferred the franchise ulpoii the whole of the householders of this country and not only upon the whole of the householders but upon a great many who may become householders in the future hear hear lord esm uordon has just now read to you some statement made by a noblo lord lord landolph churchill oh oh who has great influence at the presont moment made not many months ago in direct opposition to the proposal that the franchise should be extended to the ngricultural labourers in that opposition he had in fact tne support of a great mass of the conservative partythe covert support in same cases but the open and undisguised support in others hear hear it was the liberal party led by mr glad stone which overcamethatopposition and it isto theliberal party that you coming from these seven divisions ot the counties near here onve it that you are about to exercise the franchise for the first time the question which i think you will all ask yourselves is having got this privi lege how do you propose to exercise it  you will exerci se it in the interest of liberal principles it has been suggested from our opponents that the new vote which you have got is not protected by the bauot a voice  we kinow different that the ballot is not reallysacred and that if the new voter wishes to carry out his owvn interests he had better vote in the way that those who are able to exercise a little pressure upon him wvish because for a certainty there will be some means of detecting after wards howv he votes laughter i can tell you with some know ledge of the exact machinery of the ballot that you are entirely protected in giving your vote cheers it is most important for you the labourers who for the frst time have got a vote to be able to throw back in the teeth of those who tell you that your vote may be known that there is not a word of truth in itthat your vote is sacred it is thoroughly protected that just as no man has a right to say to you how did you vote  so no man has the power to find out how you vote i should like to say a word to you about what objects in legislation you intend to exercise your privlegewhom it is you wish to see in parliament and in power cries of  gladstone  and what it is you wish them to do when they get there on the personal question of membors i shalt not be con sidered intrusive when i say that you have seven different candidates before yon from seven different divi sionsall good liberals all excellent men of various shades and sections of the liberal party and yet all of them in the main subjects agreeing cheers and i trust you will send each of them to the house of commons by a handsome majority cheers when they are there what do you want them to do  i have not mueb time to go into the tale of political work which you would like to base done by your members but one thing you would like and that is when they go there to do your work they will be able to do that work loud cheers and will not find their exertions strangled their energies cramped by either open or covert obstruction and that the house in carrying further their rules of procedure will take care togive to the members the fullest opportunity to do their work i do not know whether any of you read the speech delivered by the speaker the other daywherein ho quoted the unendurable opposition encounteredbythe late g overnmentthespeaker from the moment he takes the chair and until parliament is dissolved speaks vith perfect impartiality he has shown day after day and night after night bow the house of commons was occupied by destrdying the energy powver and work of its members in consequence of the per sistent obstruction wvhich was going on with so much suc cess i have suggestod certain remedies which i believe would be officient hear hear the day we begin work there should be such regulations as would enable parliamont to work that is our first duty cbeers the next one wasthe one to which lord esm gordon has referredthat the parliament led by tho liberal partyand i have no doubt that there will be a great majority cheerswill set to work to reform abuses there are many abuses still unreformed hear hear some of which i will mention are there not great abuses in matters which interest you in the countrythe land diffi culties regarding the tenure and transfer of land  every one of you who wishes to obtain a piece of land should be able to do so without the legal difficulties which now sur round the acquirement of land cheers the work house was alluded to just now mlay i tell you the differ ence in this respect as told me by a frenchman who had studied english politics and who said that you english people have probably more money and wealth and are stronger than we french and y think that is truelaughter but he said  there is this great differonceit is the ainm ad object of every frenchman to work hard and also to stint himself from the good things which you englishmen enjoy in greater abundance so tnat when he was old he would have something to fall back upon instead of going into the workhouse and should be able to die upon his own land but to do this you need not panish yourselves the french peasants have been overwhelmed by the unfortunate war in which they have been engaged and their necessaries and comforts cost twvice as much as they do in england owing to free trado you can purchase what you require much cheaper than the french you have an excellent example in these frenchmen and if you work hard you can then acquire land much better than they can that remark of the frenchman illustrates the enormous advantage to us of the system of free trade because you have now double the wages that you used to bave betore free trade and the prices of the necessaries of life being chcaper than they were the people of this country are nowv in a position to make that provision for their old age which the frenchman finds in the land which he or his predecessors have purchased i have said that your members vill go back to parliament prepared to reform abuses and one of the best reforms i thinlk they ca n make is in respect of land there is another reform which i hope will be one of our first acts in the new parliamenti mean the carry ing out throughout the country of a good scheme of local government hear hear sir oharles dilke cheers my excellent friend and colleague placed before the country a few days ago an admirable plan by which every one of you i see here will be as much interested in the good government of his cointy as he is now in the good govern ment of england generally i believe that if that plan is carried out and if in addition to that irishmenare allowed a fair share in the adminisetration of their local affairs the peop le will be much moro contented than they are iiow  and though there will be a littlo friction at first and there always is when elections take placeyou wvill be the gainers in the long run i hope sour representatives will be prepared to carry out these great reforms which i think this great country will never regret i thank you again gentlemen for having listened to me for so long  i thank you for the vote you carried so heartily  and i trust that when you go to the poll it will be to support liberal principles by electing the liberal candidates before you loud cheers
