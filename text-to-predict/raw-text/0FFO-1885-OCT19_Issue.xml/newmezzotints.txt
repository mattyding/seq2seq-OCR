nbw mezzotintsa serious effort is now being made to rovive tho art of mezzotint not only a beautiful art in itself but one which more than othor department of engravers work is identified with england for some  years mezzotint has been declining or rather the name has been appropriated by an art which has very littlo claim to itand has commonly been given to a bastard process which has nothing in common with the methods of the watsons dickinson and john raphael smith the fatal step was taken when it occurred to the engravers and publishers that to work upon steel would be comimercially more profitable than to worki upon copper from the trade point of view they were riglt enoulgh for a steel dlate will give a thousand impressions quite as certainly as a copper plate will give a lhufired but wo have only to compare an impression from even the best steel mezzotinted plate with an impression from the copper to be convinced that all beauty and all softness has been lost by tlhe change to mr dunthorne the publisher of vigostreet is due much of the credit of tho present reaction in favour of the older and more legitimate method for he has encouraged several of our younaer engravers to make experiments on the copper and the artistic success of the e ventures is such as to make it probable that more will follow we have already called attention to two plates after c e pertigini by mlr edward slocomba one of whicl  nerina is perhaps themost admirable study of drapery that has bern achieved by any mocdern engraver another plate which deserves high praise is the birth of galatea after the picture by mrburnejones the engraver is mr c w campbell a young man whose worth we have not seen before but who has evidently so much talent thatwetrust hewillo on as he has begun it is the first time we believe that any picture of mr burnejones has been rendered in mezzotint but certainly the result compares very favourably even with such plates as waltners admirable etchingthe sibylother mezzotints just issued by the same publisher are three landscapes by mr joseph knight a wellknown watercolour painter they are all much the same in character two being moonlight views and one we suppose a late afternoon landscape wvith the trees in heavy shadow mr knight has a strong sense of the picturesque and chooses his landscapes with a great knowledgo of effect but in his drawings he is too much given to the use of very heavy bodycolour the disaareeable qualtity of this is entirely absent from tie mezzotints of which one  the clouded heaven is a very beaitiful study of marshy meadows seen under a cloudy moonlit sky but more important than these plates are the really wonderful copies of three of the liber studiorum series bymr frank short a young south kensington student these are part of a set of  which mr short is executing under the direction of mr ruskin who has lately written to express his  nmqualified approval  of the result and his hope that the twelve may become a standard art school set the three subjects as yet finished are  procris and cephalus  the watermill and r paglan castle and amonfz those to follow are the famous plates of ben arttur solway moss and the  source of the arveron tho process followed has been exactly turners ownnamely an etching of the outline with the rest mezzotinted and mr short has followed in the steps of the master with quite extraordinary precision he has wvorked from the finest obtainable impressions which as every liber  collector knows differ very widely from the ordinary impressions and are as costly as they are rare certainly to those who caro for beautv rather than rarity these copies are better worth having than half the impressions of the  liber  that one commonly seeswre may add to this article a word in praise of a new plate which is not a mezzotint but a photo gravure just issued by messrs buck and reid of now bondstreet the  maiden plate we believe of these publishers it is after tlho  orpheusf of mir jolhn m swan an animal painter of great promise who has studied in france and often gained some notice a the saloni orpheus is seated in a rocky valley with a group of lions stretched around him listening to his music mir swans rocks are a little woolly and one of his lionesses is rather faulty in drawing but other wise the picture is vigorous and interesting and alessrs goupils process has rendered it with great exactness
