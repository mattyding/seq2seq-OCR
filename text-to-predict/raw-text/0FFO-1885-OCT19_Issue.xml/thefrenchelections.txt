the french electionsparis oct a second ballot has been held today for  seats for which a fortnight ago no candidate either obtained an absolute majority or polled one fourth of the registered electors at the second ballot there aro no such conditions a rela tive majority being sufficient these second bal lots four times as numerous as in  have been held in  departments  oe which did not elect their full quota of deputies at the first ballotwlhilo s did not elect any at all these inde cisive results were of course due to tho multipli city of candidates some departments having as nmany as five lists not to speak of paris which had  today there is only one case of more than tvo rival listsviz seineetoise where there is a triangular duel between mioderates ralicals and reactionaries everywvhere else the lists have been reduced to twvo mostly by the retiremnent of those republicans lowest on the poll but in two or three instances by a composite list based on proportionate representation the paris polling places have consequently been even quieter than a fortnight ago there being only three or four dis tributors of voting papers posted outside each instead of a score about  fewer men must therefore have been employed in this waythe temps of this evening expresses real contrition itike the late jules favre it asks the forgiveness of god and man for having entered into an alliance with the radicals for th e second ballot the conclusion of the tenps is that while the conservatives and radicals wero actively engaged with the elections over the whole of france the opportunists had done nothing to insure their success it proposes shortly to pre sent its friends with a scheme of organization compatible with the law and destined to remedy this insufiiciency of their action in the elections just completedthe temps is quite right it is certain that the opportunists like all the dynasties which preceded them and doubtless like all who wvill followv them believed in the unlimited dura tion of their rule they were contented them selves with their lot and they were convinced that france enjoyed the same satisfaction now that they will be deprived partially at least of power they will certainly make every possible effort to recover it although the story of the cage door shut after the bird has flown is as old as the hills it is pcssible that by patience and skill they may succeed after a time in getting hold again of the precious fugitive nmown as power but if we may approve the very logical conclusion of the temps we must confess and admit that in spite of the out cry of offended decency uttered by interested persons the alliance entered into between the opportunists and the radicals for the second ballot cannot be blamed it is quite as reasonable and quite as respectable as that of the royalists and the bonapartists for there is quite as great a difference between them a true bonapartist is certainly as far apart from a true royalist as an iuxtreme radical is from a moderate republicanin a country where no party is strong enough to tonquer singlehanded it must make alliances for the battlefield subject to resuming its separate place when the battle is over and the alliance is naturally wvith those with whom mutual conces sions can bo mado heroism though a military is not a political virtue and a political party is bound to combine all the chances of success within a certain line any alliance is permissible nnow the joint opportunist and radical list for paris transgresses that line in at least one case a u basly figures in it and is described as working minersecrotary of the northern minersfederation this mk basly is a ptiblican in the department of the nord who got up tho disas trous strikes there thereby ruining both mastors and men and exposing the department at least as regards thecollieriesto years of distressso striking is this that the ditmen the victims of his incite ments havo all voted for the conservatives as a protest against the instigators of the strilkes par ticularly k basly the paris revolutionists the natural patrons of disorder picked up this man disowned by his own district and placed him on their list this scandal ought to bave satisfied them but it is now monstrous to see him figuring on the same list as a cabinet minister especially the miinister of the interior whose duty it is to put dowvn the disturbances which it is wi baslys mission to provokethis exceeds the bounds of permissible alliances and is reallyan outrage on public opinion a man is alwvays free to refuse to appear on a listand the post of deputy is too dearly bought at the cxpense of such fellowship besidesthis case there are othlers whichfor other reasonsare repul sire but after all the object is to wvin the battle subject to fighting for the spoils after wards in many sections even the most advanced at which i wvas present at the commencement of the counting i remarlced that electors had ex punged the name of basly i would fain believe that the electors will have more respect for them selves than the framers of listsand that the name of a minister of the interior of the french republic wvill not be returned along wvith that of the culpable organizer of the homicidal strike of the northern miners this act of justice and decency accomplished on the part of the electors what is to be feared is not that the moderate republicans will be associated with the radicals for the day of battle but that they will remain tho prisoners of the radicals when the battle is at an end it is that as regards this especially that the tcmps will have to admit its offence and clothe itself in sack cloth and ashesif this fatal fact is realized the conservatives will only require to exercise selfcontrol to let their opponents do as they like in order to remain masters of tlhe fiold of course they will have in their turn to declare battle in order to determine whether royalists or bonapartists are to retain the conquest of power some persons fear that the admission of the due de broglie to the chamber will induce the rtoyalists to attempt a rcxsoration and to commence operations at oncete duke is more likely howvever to restrain the unrea sonable ardour of his followers he knows the inmost thoughts of the comto de paris he knows that the latter does not dream of an immediate accession bat advises and almost requires his friends to be merely the zealous champions of the interests of francethe due do broglie we may be sure will con form to his chiefs wvishes he knows that his ovn unpopularity is due to the th of miay of which ho is believed to have been the author whereas he was only the accessoryand he knows consequently that the country does not want a fresh crisis he wvill not involve in his unpopularity the comte de tparis whose mouthpiece he is known to be by making france thinlk the real object of the con servatives was to strangle the republic for their ovn benefit and not as they professed to serve the colntry the duke will give the conservatives an attitude whlich will increase their weight in the country and pave the way for their legal return to power as a barrier against the violence contem plated by the radicals with the cooperation of the ioderates on which they calculated the fact is people are beginning to reflect on the im portance of a voting paper and decline to follow those who either to right or left aim at a fresh irevolution the only chance therefore of suecessjf or the  conservatives is to deserve their victory as prince hohenloho remarked by their honesty and patriotismmmmgntnot a single dofinitive result is yet known telegrams indeedhave come in from some depart ments giving the numbers for the chief towns in which the republicans head the poll buit these do not represent th of the total vote what is certain is that the number of voters today has been much smaller than a fortnight ago there being almost universally one or two lists those certain of defeat as well as thoso certain of success have not voted with the same alacrity and both sides wvill poll considerably less at paris only  sections have yet been reported mm allaintargd clmenceau lrochefort and eterv taking the lead and  electors out of  being thus accounted for now multiply ing this by  there would be only  voters instead of  as last time at the ministry of the interior towards midnight there was only a single telegramviz from the prefect of tho seine announcing that the poll had closed at  that all had gone off quietly and that the weather was finethere is no occasion to laugh at the simplicity of this telegram the fine weather on election days is unfavourablo to the conserva tives whose electors go out
