tep lpe ra getelpherago is the name wvhich has been given to a system of automatically transporting goods by thc agency of electricity as the motive power which system wvas the invention of the late professur fleeminzg jouilin dying in june last however the irofessor did dot live to see his ingenious ideas carried out on a practical scale hie had begun the conetruction of a telpber line oul tbe estate of lord hiampden at glynde near lewes  but hs plans had to be perfected by professor perry his suecessor as the engineer to the teipherage compauny this line has been completed and was formally opened on saturday last by lady hampden who electrically started a loaded train on the line a special train conveyed a large number of visitors from victoria statiun to glynde armong the company being sir frederick abel admiral sir edward inglefield mr wv h preece ir latimer clark hir r  croanipton professor ayrton lr eidwtrd woods r t it crampton mr swan mr e a cowrper mr m i pryor chairman of thc tclpherage company mr wv il massey and mr charlks twuodthe line is a double one nearly a mnile in length alnd is composed of two sets of steel rods threequarters of an inch in diameter supported on wrooden mosts of tshaape and about ft high the wires are supported one oil either end of the crosspiece of the t which is ft loig the carriers or skips as they are technically termed are iron troughshaped buckets each holding about cwtand suspended from the line by a light iron frane at the upper end of which is a pair of grooved whells runining on the line of rods a train is made up of ten of these skips which azre in electrical connexion with each other aud with an electrical motor which is placed in the middle of the train having five skips in front of and five behind it at a point about midway of the length of the line is the enginehonse in which is a steam engine which drives the dynamos from these latter the current is ed to tbhe line and thus to the electrical motor vhich moves the train the use to which the line is put is to carry clay from a pit to the glynde railway siding vwhence it is delivered into trucks and transported by rail to the works of the new haven cement company at the charging end of the telpher line the skips are loaded each with about cvwt ef clay the train thus carrying one ton a labourer lby touching a key starts the train which travels at a speed of from four to five miles an hour along the overhead line to the glynde station arrived there anotherlabourer upsets each skip as it passes over a railway truck into which the clay is thus loaded this upsetting however will eventu ally be performed automatically by means of a lever on each sldp which will come in contact with a projecting arm as it passes over the truck the labourer at the dis charging end of the line has full control over the train and can stop start and reverse it at will as can also the mau at the other or loading endthere are two trains at gynde but only cne is at present used that being found suficient to deliver u tons of clay per weelk at the station the tiiimaaum quantity required by the cemnent company the trains need no attention when running as they are governed to run at the same speed both on rising and falling gradients an antomatic ulock system is provided so that as many as  trains can be run ou the line without the possibility of collision the telpherage line at glynde being the fist erected it is admitted that its details are capable of improvement it however successfully demonstrates the ingenious idea of professor jenlin in utilizing electricity as a source of meotive power beyond this it can hardly be said to go at present
