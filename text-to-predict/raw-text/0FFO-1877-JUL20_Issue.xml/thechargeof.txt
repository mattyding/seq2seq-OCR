duty sir james to state to you the facts of this very painful case and i am afraid i shall have to trespass very considerably on your time to mnake the evidence intelligible in its bearing upon the four pri soners at the bar you are perfectly aware that five men named henry benson wvilliam kerr fredtrick kerr charles bale aud edwin blurray were convicted at tho april siessions of defrauding a french lady named mladame de goncourt of a sum exceeding � the scheme was concocted in july  chiefly by benson who was con victed in  ot uttermg a torged reeeipt for � and wilo after serving his term of imprisonment went to rside in the isle ot wight in the name of young william err who wasi very skilful in turf matters gave him material assistance and the other prisoners took sub ordinate parts in the fraul one of them lurray who was out gon bail tin  and had abscondeda d been ever since alloweed to live in london unaisturbed by the police which was a remarkable circumstance the scheme included the manufacture of a sham newspaper called le sperl and an article was written by benson pointing out certain modes of safe investment in turf speca iations through the agency of certain bookmakers whose names and offices in london were given a french trans lation of the article was printed and circulated in france with the papers which was printed together with blank forms of check on  the itoyai bank of london at charing cross by a mr brydone at edinburgh lodgings were taken in kcingstreet dukestreet sit jamessplace jermynstreet and clevelandrovw by the prisoners who assumcd the names of montgomery eullerton francis c and were the  bookmakers  to whom tle advertisement referred a central office where all the prisoners met at intervals being taken at  northumberlandstrect strand one of the objects of taking the latter office it will be shown was to be within the vicinity of  the shop or the factory the slang tarms used by these men for scotlandyardwhere at least one of the inspectors was obviously in league with them benson the twvo kerrs and bale went repeatedly to this officeto carrv out their operations and bensonwho was an able french scholar translated the letters which began to arrive daily soon after the circulation of the frau dulent paper in ifrance a large number of persons were imposed upon but it is enough to refer to the case of mla dame de goncourt from whom draughts to the amount of � were obtained by the prisoners by false pro tences the success of the enterprise led then to attempt a further fraud ot �o upon this lady but her friends interfered and it was deemed de sirable to communicate with her london solicitor sir abrabams who at once sent to the officials of scotland yard the matter wvas placed in the hands of chief laspec tor draseovicb a valnect public servant implicitly trusted and wfhose acquaintance wvith foreign languages peculiarly fitted him for the tabsk in this inquiry ho was assisted by the prisoners palmer and eiklejohn and it will appear that both benson and hierr wvere acquainted with these officers meiklejohn having known themn for yearsaud being an occasional visitor at the northumberlandstreet offite snd it will be seen if the action of these three wellknown servants of the public did net justify the serions charge which imake efisst themof having conspired to defeat the ends of justice i now come to the th of september a mecss ioportant date in this history mr abrabams the solicitor of madame dc goncourt made inquiries at the sarious lodgings occupied by tho supposed bookmakers hut no tidings of them coutl be found and on the dth he applied to mtlr knox the inagistrate of arlboroughstreet for warrants against then of course he could only give the names wtich the prisoners had assumed and the warrants were granted accordingly meanwhile the men who were in the habit of meeting at northumberlandstreethad become awareof whatwas going on and the remarkable coincidence happens tbat on the th of sedtember the very day after mr abrahans began to talke action in this matter the whole of these tive persons disappeared from northumberlandstreet r abrahams had applied to scotlandyard on the th and to mlr knox on the th and i shall call before you one of the five men villiam kerr who wvill tell you that on the evening of the th be receivedi information from sootlandyard that inquiries were being made about them and that in consequence of this intimation from drus covich the wvhole of the five were enabled to escape apprehension i believe in tie first instance hat drus covich was ignorant of the real nature of the trade carried on by there men and really supposed them to be book makers or mere turf speculators up to this time i have no reason to doubt that he was a honest man dloing his duty honourably to tbo public but somewhere aeout july  he tell into pecuniary dihiculties caused partly by the failure of a brother for whom he had accepted a bill for � which lie was compelled to pay i think you will find that maleiklejohn w ho wvas an intimate friend auni com panion of kerr suggested that the latter should lend � to druscovich and froee the nioment that he accepted that sum he was a ruined man of course it was the object of kerr to get tho police in his power and one of his first requests to druscovich was that being about to start a bettingotfice he sliould bo sup plied with any information if proceedings against him wore ever in contemplation i am disposed to lelieve that vvhen druscovich was originally employed by mir abrahams to investigate the frauds on madame de goncourt he had no knowledge of the fact that benson kerr bale and the others were the men who in the names of  captain gif fard  benson malontgomuery  kscrr  ellerton rw ere actually eugaged in these frauds for kerr uill tell yoni that when lie called at niorthumberlandstreetoe exclaimed hliere is one oe the biggest swindles ever known a lady in france has been defrauded of � then it was for the first time that druscovich became acquainted with the facts of tihe case and kerr was able to use his influence over the officer snd to escapo apprehension on the spot it will appear that herr wvent off on the th on the issue of the warrants to derby where mleiklejohn lived and filled the position of superintendent of police on the mlidland llail wvay it being customary vith the authorities of scotland yard to allow their trustworthy servants to accept appoint ments of this nature in the country after conferring withmceiklejoln the two men returned to london after telegraphing to brascovich to meet thou at the st pan cras station the threo men hail an interview there and on the following day druscovich was directed to make inquiries of a moneychanger in london named lreinbardt respecting the numbers of the bank notes which lie had given in exchange for the draughts of madalme de goncourt at that time benson was at glas gowv and a telegram was sent to him there directing bins to get rid of the bankcotes in his possession the produce of the � fraud and pleikiejohn avent down to glas gowv no doubt to assist him in this effort there was no lack of ingenuity manifested on the occasion it was known to bensou that the bankers of scotland did not register the numbers of their notes and it was the object ot these men to exchange the english notes for scotch notes with the least possible delay so as to avoid their being traced beiison paid them into a glasgow bank in the name of foster and got a draught upon the berwick branch of the clydesdale bank for � in � notes meanwhile druscovich bad procured information as to soine of the notes about �ou aud wvas referred by the mcouechauger to the bank respecting othersall these facts being telegraphed to glasgowv ia due course thus by the th of october benson is in possession of the whole arnount in scotch notes and he returns to london and lives in lodgings at newington llhentheeenglish notes were paid into the bank of lnglaud druscovich wvas sent to make inquiries about tlmeni hut what had happened in the in terval  it wil appear that on the od of october a pre eent of � in gold placed in a cigarbox lad been made to mrs meikejohn as wvill be proved by kerr and some days later in tue month benson kerr and meikle john met at the castle and falcon in aldersgatestreet where five �notes of the clydesdale bank were handed to meiljohn two of which were afterwards changed by hiim at manchester and lceds it is an important fact that tlese notes have been traced to the possession of the inspector and it wvill le shown that a valuable bracelet was purhhased of mlr benson the jeweller of lud gatehill in noveniber and was presented to another of the prisonersi think druscorich laving brought the narrative down to this point we have to consider what becamo of the rest of the clydesdale notes the prisoner beanon who may le regartred as the mastermind in all this business knew thar they must be disposed of and ho appears so lhave consulted with meiklejohn early in novem ber upon the subject the result was an arrangement that benson kerr and ieikleiohn should go to the bridge of allan in scotland and open an ac cotut at the bank of alloa in that district lt is a remarkable circunmstance in the caso tbat the father of meiklejoha resides near this placc and that mr mn tcith tiho mnanader of tho alloa bank was personally known to him it was therefore determined that they should travel to the hridgi of allan where meiklejoha should introduce his frieuds to r monteith who would be naturally satisfel dwith the recommendation of such a higbly respectable person holding important public situa tions of trust benson accordingly went down and put up at the queens otei passing as  r youna he telegrapbod to kerr in the name of captain giffard to joinhinh there and meiklejohn followed on sunday the th of november a dinner party was arranged at dun blanc where meiklejobn introduced his friends to mr bonteitb to mr wvilsou of the scotch police and to another geutlamarn in the service of tho sheriff there the result was that benson opened an accouut of � at the mallo rank wlhile gliftsrd bubsequently onened anotheraccount of � at the same bank while all ithis was going on mr abrahams in london was becom ing conrinced that ne was not getting that as sistance from the police at scotlandyard which ho had a right to expect and consequently on the th of november he offered a reward of � for the apprebension of the men in their sssumed names about tnat time it was discovered that benson was passing in one of those names the advertisement was inserted in the times and copies of it were printed and sent round to all the police offices and to al the bankers in the kingdom when mr abrahams discovered that benson was one of the men and that he had lived at shanklin in the isle of wighthe directadthat letters arriving there from thenorth should be watched py this means the retreat of benson was fortunately discovered for aletter from a former ser varat of benson who was still living with him in scotland was addressed to a friend a servant girl at shanklin and although the letter wvs not opened the post office stamp proved an accurate guide to the possible whereaboute of benson and enabled lir abrahams to institute ingqniries in that direction almost simultaneously with this im portant discovery mr abrahams received information of the seizure by the edinburgh police of the plates of the forged checks and other documents printed by him and used in the frauds practised on madame de goncourt it having been part of the original scheme to pre tend that owing to the jealousy or oppositiol of rival bookmakes in london it was necessary to use these checks in exchange for money trans mitted from france upon these dclcoveries baving been communicated to scotlandyard by mr abrahamls it was resolved to send druscovich to the isle of wight and on the lotlh of november a telegram was sent to tihe queens botel bridge of allan informing kerr of this fact the telegram purported to come from  av brown london and was addressed to  w gifferd it was as fol lows  if shanks is near the isle of wight let him leave at once and see you shanks being intended for benson a letter follows it is obvious that this telegram must bave been sent from some person acquainted with the proceedings at scotlandyard and tho man who sent it is supposed to be ialnier or a person acting with his autbority the letter which followea this telegram was sined  w brown and was addressed to mr ciffnrd queens llotel bridge of lulan it ran thus there is very strong particulars from edinburgh which i suppose you know they have the address at the shop near here it is also known that you were in edinburgh a day or two ago perhaps you had better see me things begin to leek fishy news may be given at lsle of wiglit where shanks is wire from edinburgh that plates have been seized letter froma shanklin that one of the men is well knowtn there d goes to the isle of wight tomorrow send this back signed wyilliam b who wvas with you at the daniel lambertthis letter bears the london post mark of nov  and the bridge of allan post mark of nov  the initial  d was intended for druscovicb and the letter was no doubt written by almer and put in an envelope already ad dressed in the handwriting of kerr giffard ln the mean time druscovich had telegraphed to mr abrahams  there is no one in the office who knows young which was untrue  therefore i start tonight for edinburgb druscovich knew perfectly well that youndg was known at least to chief inspector clarke who had seen him and was aware of his former conviction a second letter was written as soon as it was known that druscovich was to go to edin burgh to the sanim address and in the same handwriting  ds route is changed gec the lame man out of the way at once the reference here being evidently to benson who during his former imprisonment had tried to comerit suicide and had injured himself permanently by burning or otherwise in the attempt this second letter was written on a piece of blotting paper and was posted on the th of november in the eu district this is material because i shall show you that on that evening palmer went to a dlasonic dinner at an hotel in fleetstreet which was fixed for  oclock inspector clarke who was a member of the same lodge was also at that dinner and had no doubt some conversation with palmer about the goncourt case for at  oclock a second telegram wvas receivod by giffard at the queens hotel giviug him the information that d  was going to leave that night and will bewith you the firstthing in themorning if shanks is with you let him leave immediately whien this telegram arrived they were dining together at the queens but they disap peared from the hotel the same night maling some excuse about being required in a divorce case or something of the kind to account to the landlord for the suddenness of their departure as the two letters did not arrive till the next morningtof course they did not reach either benson or kerr lt seems that kerr went with a friend to glasgow lie telegraphed to paimer the same night to this effect  your telegram received does our friend go to edin burgh or to bridge also say by what train as i wish to join him very important is he alone i await your telegram all nigbt the po here is open all night reply paid for this shows tbat kerr lnew perfectly well that all this information came from scotlandyard and from palmner the telegram was addressed to palmers private residence at lewington andthe telegraph boy rememnbers perffectly well takin it there as he had to wait  minutes before he could get the people to receive it it being long after midnight inle boy returned to the office at a quarter to  palmer startled at the receipt of the telegram did not send au answer back by the boy but sent one to the office later on for at  in the morning kerr received an answer giving him the information wbich he required as to the movements of druscovich who went down travelling in a pullmans ear and arriviug at edinburgh between  and  on the morning of the llth kerr who was an intelligent man knew that it would not be safe to telegraph to druscovich in his own or any assumed name so he adopted the expedient of sending hixi a telegram in the name of inspector meiklejohn and appointing to meet him at the west end or princestreet eumuburgh it was ad dressed to care of police iffice thus  m eet mo at  at the end of princesstreet can give you information must see you without fail will wait important come immediately on getting this druscovich kept that ap pointment and no doubt he was supplied with all the par ticulars about the ilight of benson and himself lhe inspector replied  i must go to the bridge of allan as  am sent liere and after dillydally ing about lhaif the day he did go thero in tre afternoon on a missior which he new to beuseless lie did not furnish any infornation to his empluers and when he arrived at the bridge of allan lie inudo no in quiries of any one except a policeman and allowed a day or two to pass before he even mentioned who he was to the landuord of the queens the latter expressed his surprise and said  if i had known you i could have told you all aboiit them at the same time producing the letters which had arrived after their departure benson who had gone to perth was informed at once by ierr that he had bcen found out through hisservantwriting toshanklnanddrus covich who ratheralvoided thanicourted informatonatook no steps till he knew that his friends were out of the way an attempt was made by a friend of kerr to get possession of the letters stil left at the hotel but mlr anderson the landlord wisely refused to give them up then a telegram was sent by mir abrahanis to druscovich  you should get hold of their letters what are you doing  and he was then cbliged to take possession of thenm or possibly they wonld never have been heard of bale and kerr went to derby and benson ivent to matlock and efterwards he was sent to ltotterdam about the end of november leaving miurray to get rid of the notes at the london moneychangers one or whom mlr saffery mnade an ap pointment with him and beforekeepiug itgave information to chief inspector clarke who attended and took murray into cuitody bale had also been given into custody for thi same attempt but was discharged in the absence of evidence to convict him murray was the first man cap tured balo and  kerr joined benson at z otterdam aid iv kerr continued to live in his lodgings at  marquess road canonbury and now ir froggat comes upon the socne lie was employed to defend lurray and  grieve to say he did not scruple to aid the others in defeating the ends of justice hie received � from kerr to go to lrot terdam for the purpose of preventing if possible the ex tradition of benson and his companionslienson being there in the prtentious name of georgelvashington mor ton the advertisement offering the reward of � had been copied into the foreign newspapers and through the changing of one of the clydesdale notes at rotterdam itjr abrahams was supplied with the information vhich he wanted and the socalled ameriran citizens and his friends were caiptured with a large number of the clydesdale notes in their possession druscovich had been sent over to see them but he did not apprehend them in the meantime murray was being remanded from week to week in london the lith of december was one of the days fixed for murrays examination and on the day previously import ant information had been given to mr abrahanss by r flintoff the landlord of  northumberlandstreet whose description of benson and kierr tallied exactly with that given by the lantdlor of the hotel at the bridge of allan knoving that klerr was in daily communication wvith frog gatt and muray the greatest secrecy was observed and not a soul at marlboroughstreet exceptthe magistrate knew that a warrant was issuted for the apprehension of kerrthis warrant was placed in the banlds of mr superin tendeut williamson of scotlandyard who had acted all through this painful matter with commendable zeal although he felt how much the service was de graded by such disclosures kerr was apprehended almost in the precincts of tie court froggatt on finding that flintoff bad identified kerr made an attempt to bribo him not to appear employing a man named stenning to assist in this effort steuning who was with kerr at the time of his arrest and tried to obstruct the officers in the execution of their duty was sen tenced to  months imprisonment for the offence mr flintoff will tell you that froggatt not only tried to bribe hintwith moneybutappealed to bim not to ap pear against a brother mtasorusing the sympathetic influ ence of a benevolent institution for a corrupt purpose lut happily without success you will be told that froggattindicted flintotf for perjury for making ziis assertion but the charge was heard and ignominiously dismissed by the city magistrate wvho heard the case wvithout even calling ou mr flintoff for his defence blrt this is not all there is a far more serious imputation against mr froggatt that he was also supplied with � by kerr to tamper with mir hmonteith a gentleman in too hirgha position to bhetompted and when all other means failea and hes discovered that benson and his com panions were in custody at l otterdam he dictateti the terms of a false telegram which was sent to the police officials there aud purported to come from superintendent willianison as follows  find more ton and two men you have in custody are not those we want officers will not be sent over liberste them letter follows by ahappy coincidence mlr wlilliamson himself arrived at itotterdam as soon as this false tele gram or sbortly afterwards and its object was defeated the telegram was in the handwriting of stenning and was despatched from the holborn office these are the facts of the case aud we have not cared to take a single step in this prosecution tdl all the requisite information was obtained hence the delay and tho strict secrecy of our proceedings tho learned counsel then referred to the official reports furnished by druscovich meiklejohn and almer to their superiors at scotlandyard pointtng out how factabd beensuppressed and misrpresented lettersand telezrarn destroyed druscovics maude no allusion in his rcports to the telegram received by him at edinburgh or the interview with kerr or any of tne matters of importance which camne to his knowledge at the bridge of allani meiklc john the head and front of the entire business denied all knowledge of the men vith whom he had dined and cor responded and mr poland read many of the letters ad dressed to kerr by hima beglining with  dear bill  and such fanriliar expressions and cautioning him to scamp away in case of a smell as there was a brief meaning a warrant out against him one of the notes referred to   having gone to america referring to palmer who was there at the time and spoke of  p oodle the name by which bexson was lnown among them druscovch had evidently come later into the matter and on several occa sions showed his repentance declaring that he  would arrest somebody  the tracing of the clydesdalenotes would be a most important feature in the casemeiklejohn add froggatt having received them  over o having been paid to the latter for his professional servicesafter addressing the court for nearly four hours mr poland intimated that lie did not propose to open the evi dence at that late houir and asked for a remanda long discussion followed upon the subject of bail a strenuous effort being made to induce sir james to admit palmer to bail on the ground of his minor share in these transactions but the aiplications on behalf of the inspec tors were all refused yroggatt was liberated on the same lail as beforehimself in �iq and two sureties in � eachsir jaes iogiuam said he would tale the case on thursday afternoon
