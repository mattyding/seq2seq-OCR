rev j r simpson mr thomas hughes qc bmr loch mr ribtonturner csir chglesa trevelyal said the deputation had come to lay before the hlome secretary what was realy a case of slave trade and slavery in the midst of our english chris tian civilization that this wa the case was owing to two causes one being the yoathful almost in fantile age of the children the other their total ignorance of our languagetheir own language too being unfortunatelylttle known here the system of their import ation had all the characteristics of slavery they were obtained from their parents under a two years lease by a class of professional persons who wenb by the namo of  padroni a term not at all clear in its application in this case and when the children were obtained they were sohldfrom person to person in the same class for gain occasionally they were stolen by persons in the same class the attractions of the childrentheir childish accomplishmentscausing them to be thus stolen some times too the despairing children ran away in both cases when they ran away and vwh they were stolen the children were advertised tor as lostitnd stolen cattle were advertised for in fact as the report would showthe children were advertised in the same manner as was cur rent when the domestic slaves of liverpool and bristol west indian proprietors used to be lost in the olden time before lord mansfields famous judgment such was now theahamelessnessshownin regard to thistrafficandthe secu rity felt by the padroni that our laws would not be enforced against their infamous trade the poor children earned large sums of moneybut they did not get any wagesthey merely had a bare subsistence of the poorest character then too they were coerced by harsh treatment and sharp punishment if they did not take to their owners as much money as they expectedthe home secrztay asked if any estimate had been formed of the amount the children took to the padronimr lisronturnar said it was estimated that each child took on the average about s a daysir charles tprevelya proceeded to say that use was alsomadeof thegirls for immoralpurposes occasionally the padroni were brought before the magistrates and fined or had a months imprisonment but this was ineffectual to stop the traffic as was to be seen from facts stated by signor luciano of the italian benevolent society and one of the secretaries of the italian consulate he stated that upon certain italian children being brought before the magis trate and ordered to be sent to industrial schools he found the london school board  had decided not to keep foreign children in the school withregard to the recom mendation of thesocietythat the englishpublic should not give mouey to these children signor luciano mentioned the following case on the th of may  a padrone named giuseppe ventre  years of age a native of picinisco appeared before the magistrate at great larl boroughstreet policecourt to claim two of his children and two of bis relatives charged with begging stating that he was ready to take them back with him to italy it was eventually arranged that he should be allowed to have them on depositing � at the italian consulate which he did and which sum was to be returned to hinm if in one months time he was able to prove that the children had arrived at their destination other wisethemoneywould be forfeited the names of the childrenas given wero anselmoventre aged  maria ventre aged  his sons carolina rossi aged  his niece gaetano bona aged  his nephew directly giuseppe ventre had again got the children into his clutches instead of returning to italy he left for the provinces and when he was informed that he would lose his � he smilingly answered  what is that to me  i shau more than make it in a couple of weeks another case is that of a mnan who came to england some years ago with a dog trained to perform several tricks he amassed a few pounds and then embarked in trade as au importer of italian children and organgrinders and in a few years after when he died it was found that he was worth more than �i sir charles proceeded to urge that the system had flourished because it had hitherto only been dealt with before the magistrates in an or dinary way by a months imprisonment a fine or worse than all sent on to the next town this offence hal thus hardened into a deeprooted compre hensive system which could only be overcome by repres sive measures equally as comprelhensive as the system and equal in organization the moagistrates and police through out the country ought to bo directed to act against it in an uniform and simultaneous manner so that the field of the  padroni  would be entirely preoccupied and all the holes stopped the cumulative penaltiesof thevagrant act whipping and all could be brought against the  padroni and the ttaliangovernment had done all it could to stop the traffic the italian benevolent society would send the chil dren home if they were got tnutof thepowerofthepadroni sir charles pointed out thalt the british public by giving money to the children were acting as in confederacy with the  padroni  for the destruction of the children  but he said the govermment could step in and by exercising its authority over the magistrates stop the trade at oncemr ttrper read letters from noblemen and from the chief magistrate sir james ingham and said that if the provisions of the blementary education act were uniformly enforced in not allowing any children to be in the streets in town or country the trade would be gonethe secretary of the italian consulate also prayed that the english law should be enforced in order to aid the italian government in suppressing the tradic of wvhich he gave many particulars saying that a  padroue  cleared about � in three years out of each child he had begging in the streets of englandthe hoai secretatry in reply saidi have had groat pleasure in receiving this deputation and i have listened with interest to what you have had to say but i have already been in communication witiltbe chief metropolitan magistrate with the education department and also with the police about the question of how far the english law may be strong enough or may be made stronger to prevent what i agree with you is a most objec tionable and abominable traffic and all i can say is that anything the english law can do to put it down so far as i have any power in tho matter shall be enforced further than tfat i cannot go bmy im pression is a great deal may be done by the law as it stands at present and when we come to put the law in force and find it is not btrong enough we can try and obtain addi tional powers to enable us to do so i heartily agree with everything that has been said about the abomination of the system of importing the children and i am quite sure it cannot be too strongly condemned i promise that elery thin that the english law can do to terminate such a scandal to the country shall oe done without delaythe deputation heartily thanked the minister and retired
