be establishod they should be satisfied not merely that it was execated accord ing to the requirements of lawthat was signed and attested in the presence of two witnessesbut they should also be satisfied that the deceased was aware of and as sented to its contents there was no doubt that it was a remarkable case there were difficulties that were very manifest on the one side and on the other but in coinsider iing how those difficulties were to be disposed of there was one circumstance which they should steadfastly bear in moindnamely that the will was written entirely in the hbasdwriting of the man in avhcse favour it was  that the instructions upon which he alleged he wrote out the paper wvere taken by him andby him alone tand that there was no other person whatever who was alleged by him to have had any knowledge of the intention of the testatrixso that it rested entirely upon his evidence wbether or not be did receive instructionls from the tstatrix to prepare the will which
