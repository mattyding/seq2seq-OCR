marvellous trip across the whole continent and also by africa during the last sssions of tie society having occupied a considerable part of their attention lieutenant young the rev richard price and others taking a leading part in no age or country had progress been so manifest or so fruitful of great results as in african discoveries and in fact the ad vancement of civilization on those grounds the society appealed to the meeting and to the public at large and he should like to see a fund of ï¿½ a year raised for this purpose it was necessary that this country should find new markets to talre its produce and africa opened up a wide field to them the alave trade he also maintained coull only be effectually suppressed byimparting to the natives christian civilization in a ohristian spirit their work he said should excite a national spiritinasmuch as it was a national concern he mentioned the efforts now being made in other countries in this direction and stated as a result of the confer euce held under the auspices of the king of the belgians that national committees had been formed in all the capitals of europe the emperor of germany had given marks while the kingof the belgians had raised a fund of f and had increasedthe income in reference to this matter by nearly f again there was the king of portagal who had been induced to take a deep interest in the subject and had stated that should funds not be forthcoming to enable portagag to lake her place in the proposals which had been made he personally would supply any shortcomings at his own expense in condusion sir rutherford moved the first resolution viz  that the commercial interests of this country are to a large extent involved in the development of inter course and legitimate trade with the outports to the fertile bullt littleknown regions ofc central africa and therefore that the scheme of thorough expoloration proposed by the african exploration fund committee deserves the warmest support of this meeting as powerfully tending to secure tht endcommander cairo in seconding the motion said that africa was one of the most fertile countries in the world in the pacific there were spice islands but in africa they had one vast spice continent coffee grew wild there and although the seyyid of zanzibar had diverted some of the capital of his subjects to the slave trade indiarubber was being produced in large quantities le urged a systematic exploration of the continent that he sid being one of the first steps to the openimg up the country to civilizationand religion there should be no jealousy between the two for where civilization was religion would follow the slave trade even as now carried on was too fearful to contemplate he had seen five and six villages depopulated in order to furnish a miserable string of  slaves the remainder of thepopulace either being killedor driven into the jungles to die of starvation thequestioniof domestc slavery was another mtter ad would require some care in dealing with it for shlvery was eugrained in the minds of the people a systematic exploration althoughlat first necessarily costly would he believed be soon se fsupportingviceadmiral orarasctey spoke in favour of the motion which was eventually adopted wvithout a dissentient voicethe archbishop of yobc in proposing the next resolu tion said the sympathies of this country were easily aroused and as easily allayed but if this country had been so horrified during the temporary war in the elast what ought their feelings to be in reference to tn enormities hourly daily monthly and yearly perpetrated under the name of the slave trede this country had been guilty in regard to the slave trade but it had borne witness to a noble renentance with the payment of  millions of money for freeing slaves gradually during the last  years by the spirit of public opinion throughout the civilized world slavery had been cast aside by the principal nations and he hoped it would soon be disowned by all cheers at the present time from the one single port of quiloa there were exported annually  slaves those came principally from the wvest side of lakenyassa and according to the most trustworthy calculation for every o slaves produced for labour  perished or were sacrificed in the capture of the others having denounced tao slave treaty with the seyyid of zanmibar which per mnitted che importation of slaves for domestic pur posesl the demand for which his grace said could not be  annualy although  were im ported yearly he urged that if the purpese of the resolu tion ho had to move were carried out a deathblow would be struck at the detsetable traffic he said it was nearly  years since we made this question our own we had debated it in parliament and had spent  millions of money over it the reult being that the west coast of africa had got rid of that wlhicth had devastated it he moved accordingly that the history of the slave trade during the last three centuries and the crimes yearly perpetrated in its maintenance at the present day render it imperative on all nations who have ever profited bytllis trade to adopt the must effective means for its suppression au essential pre eminary to  hich is a systematic efibrt such as is now pro pesad ta obtain further information regarding the lcss nown regions of central africa and ascertain the
