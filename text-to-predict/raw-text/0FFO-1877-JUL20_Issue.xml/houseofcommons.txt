he had lately received no fewer than ten printed circulars beaded lay mens association he would read one of them siras one of your constituents i beg to address you as to the public worship regulation

politics feel it my duty to with hold my vote from any candidate who will not pledge him self to the repeal of this acthe had no objection to any one of his constituents indi viduauly expressing his

re marks of the lord chief justice who felt strongly on this matter the question of a public prosecutor had formed a subject of consideration not only to the present but ofhe late government but he would warn his hoa friend though a public prosecutor rnight be a very necessary it would be a very expensive luxury for he would have to be provided wvith a staff and the expenses would certainly be heavier than at present he was prepared however whenever an opportunity offered to bring in a bill on the subject in his evidence before the judicature commission the hon gentleman would iind a strong

to ascertain that any prac tice prevalils among boards of guardians and governors of lunatic asylums of comnpelling their officern to resign before considering any applications for incerase of salary but i amn informed that the board of gauardians and the goveracra of the lunatic asylum at ennis adopbted such a practice mere then twvo years ego the local govern ment board at that time informed the board of guardians that they objected to their action on the subject but i do not find that the inspectorsof lunatic asylums made any communication to the board of guardians the practice seems to meopen to objection but the hon member is himself a goveror of the lunatic asylum and can move that it should be discontiniued if he thincks fit to do sogrocers licencesmr dalrymiple asked the

for war whether the deficiene of transport for thetroops mnsrching from aidersbott to windsor for the late review was so great as to necessitate the dismounting of two batteries of artillery andsome of the engineer train to supply horses and whether even with that assistance the blankets and waterproof sheeting had to be left behind contrary to the recommendations of the medical staffmir hardythe facts stated by the hon and gallant memler are i believe correct the transport for summer drils is very hard worked at aldershott and was not increased for the march to windsor the weather was fine

of the danubemr hanbury asked the undersecretary for foreign affairs whether it was true that the irussians have com menced to block up one of the principal mouths of the danube by sinking stones and ships in opposition to the remonstrance of the international commission  and whe ther it was intended to direct the attention of the govern ment of russis to such a breach of the public law of urope as declared by the treaties of  and lmr bourkethe british danube commissioner had reported that four vessels as described in the question had been sunk in the sulina mouth of the danube and the depthofwaterfornavigation was now only four feet when this camo to the knowledge of ifer majestys am bamador at st petersburg he expressed a wish and hope to the russian government that measures would be taken to prevent the obstruction of the navigation of the danube papers on that snbject would be laid on the table of the house he might mention that the british commissioner at the danube had been authorized to join any protest that might be made by his colleagnles the other commission ers when they thought it right to make any he had also been instructed to make detailed reports and the matter wonld receive the attention of the government from time to imethe transvaal territorymr a mmies asked the undersecretary for the colo nies whether it was coatemplatetl that the whole debt of the transvaal territory estimated by lord carnarvon at about ï¿½ should be eventually met from the im perial treasury whether the ï¿½ placed on the sup plementary estimates represented the total amount to he asked from parliament and whether there are any other grounds besides the alleged fertility of the transvaal for nticipating the repayment of imperial advancesmr j lowtherit is not intended to ask the im perial treasury to discharge the debt of the transvaal state nor do we propuse to ask parliament for any further sum than the ï¿½ of which notice has been already given with regard to the aebt i should mention that while the estimate must of necessity be only apprs xi mate so far as can be ascertained the total debt previous to the sum now nasked for in the supplementary estimate was about ï¿½ the grounds for anticipating repay ment of the advance though they appear to be regarded by my hon friend as somewhat problematical are in addition to the great fertility of the country lwhich i may observe is not merely alleged but thoroughly ascertained its ex tensive mineral resourcesthe th regiment in aswer to mr c smr hardy saidas i have previously stated an officer of the th regiment on being accused of an offence was placed under arrest broke that arrest and absented himself oficers under arrest are except in extra ordinary circunstances considered on parole and in this case no departure was made from the usual custom tlle officer in question was gazetted out of the service and no further steps have been taken regarding him i have no knowledge whatever of the occurrence said to have taken place at rusmore and as the th regiment has not been stationedat that place since  it is not con sidered necessary after this lapse of time to take an adion in the matter his royal highness the fieldlhl commandingtnchiefisfully acquainted with the mrale and discipline of every regiment in her majestys service mnd does not think it rennisite to hve anepea nur into the state of

appointed under the recent act wbich gave power to appoint them at once although the act itself did not come into operation imme diately it was necessary that preliminary arrangements should be made by the commissioners the four gentlemen were all to be paid twoof them were old directors of prisons and two were magistrates one taken from the north and one from the souththe business of the sessionthe marquis of hartingtoni risa to ask the chanceuor of the excheqtuer wbether he is able to iford any information about the intentions of the govern ment with regard to the remaining business of the sesvion i hold in my hand a list of mca sares which are introduced bynembersof the govern mentand many of which although they were mentioned in her majestys speech at the opening of the session have made up to the present time but very little progress i do not tlhink i need trouble the house by reading that list or by pointing out the stages at which the measures have arrived for the right bon gentleman will probably refer in detail to the principal bills it is quite evident that unless the duration of the session bo prolonged considerably beyond the usual limits it will be quite impowsible that all or nearly all of those measures which up to the present time have made but little progress can be considered by the house the right hon gentleman will perhaps be able to tako this opportunity of informing the houso whether he proposes to ask for any further sacrifice of the time which is still at the disposal of unofficial members  if so at what time he will make that request it may also be in his power having fully considered the state of public business to give some intimatiou to the house as to the time wben he thinks it possible that our labours may be concluded perhaps the houso would like me to take this opportunity of making an explanationas some misapprehension no doubt exists from some wantofclearnesa of expression on my part the other day in tho courso of a discusion upon the condact of the government with regard to tho irish sunday clsing bill in ono or two observations i made i intended to point out that the introduction of the appro priation bill which i hoped would not long bo delayed would give a more appropriate opportituity of discussing a question of that sort relating to the conduct of the go vernmneat with regard to tho measures thathave been before the iouse i find it has been understood in somequarters that the otservatios i made amounted to a notice that it wax my intention to take the cpportanity ot the introduction of the appropriation bill to snake mcne observations upon the conduct of her majestys government it is quite imposible for me to know what may occur before tho end of the session and i have not come to anyformal and definite resolution in my own mind s to the coursa it will be my duty to take when the appropristiouï¿½ bill is introduced i wish to say that otlag wa fttisx fro mny minti tban o savlv formalnotice that i had any such intention on that ocasion to comment on the conduct of her majestys governmentthe ceaincellor of the exchequerwith re ference to the closing observations of the noble lord i quite understood the remarks he made on the occasion he refers to in the same sense as that in which he now ex plains them of course it is quite obvious that the stages of the appropriation bill always furnish very appropriate occasions for any critical remarks that may be thought necessary i did not understand that sny special notice was given with regard to the state of business i do not understand that the noble lord at present de sires that we should enter into any discussion as to the progress of business or as to any of the causes which may have interfered with the progrcss of some of the measures iatroduced by the government i understand the ques tion is simply put for the convenience of the house in order that we may know as well as we can how we stand and may endeavour to make our arrangements accordingly i anw prepared to give such answer as i can in the smne spirit as the noble lord asls the question it is quite true there is a considerable number of bills that have been introduced by members of the government which are still upon the paper and some of themu are still down for rather early stages of course it would be impossible writhout unduly prolonging the session to pass them all at the same time i feel some little difficulty in saying with regard to particular bills that we in tend to lay aside this or the other bill because the progress of business is not altogether under our control and it may happen in tho course of the tiame that reruains that we may find ourselves able to make more progress wvith some bill than we expect or that we may meet with unexpected obstacles with regard to another i therefore do not wish that what i say now should be regarded asa complete and final programne of all that is or is not to be done in the course of the ses sion i may mention one or two bills with which i feel it would not be possible for us or convenient to the house that we should proceed this session and iu regard to which it is desirable so state that we do not intend to take up the time of the house of these bills the most im portant is the valuation of property bill the house will easily understand that this is a bill wbich could not be proeceded with without fair and full discussion and which wculd occupy not unreasonably a con siderable time in committee if it stood alone i think it possible that we might proceed with it this ses sion but we find the question of going on with it has been complicated by notices given by the hon members for new castle and leith opening up the large questions of repre sentative councils and local government seeing that these questions would have to be discuesed in connexion with the valuation bill we think it is not desirable or convenient to proceed with it there is also the irish valuation bill which i think the house will hardly have time to take into consideration i may also say with regard to the bishop rics bill the patents for inventions bill and the roor law scotland bill we do not at present see our way to trouble the house with these bills the bills that are immediately before us and with which we think it is im portant the house should proceed i will rmention in this order there is the irish judicature bill which stands for committee and wbich perhaps i am not over sanguine in hoping we may get through committee tonight there is the south african confederation bill which we pro pose to take on monday next and there are the irish alnd scotch prisons bills which we are anxious to pro ceed with as rapidly as possible i hope we shall not be thought unressonablein asking that from nextweek we may take uesdays and vednesdays for government business and if that request should be acceded to we propose to take on tuesday next the irish and scotch prisons bills i would not mention any particular business for wedses day we shall sae before that day what it may be conve nient to take thursday is pledged to the hon and learned gentleman the
