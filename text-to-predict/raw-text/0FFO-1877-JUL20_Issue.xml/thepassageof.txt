the passagb of the danubem fromi our prvssian courespondietberlin july in accordance with the very complete and taethodical system of reporting adopted by the russian military authorities the short teleggrams sent immediately after any event are succeeded by a series of ulterior statements first there is a second batch of telegrams supplementing the original inteligence next the news is recapitu lated and as a rule amplifaed in the summary of warlike operations published every six or seven days then the proceess is repeated in another and more comprehensive account given to the public every fortnight while to wind up the complicated procedure there is issued a monthly history afford ing a general survey of vhat has been done from each of these various statements i have hitherto contented myself with extracting only what had not appeared in the preceding ones but i think i had bettor deviate from this practice in the case of a new report just submitted to the emperor by the grand dulie

to slatina the th th aud th corps were appcinted to complete the army placed under mv orders in consequence ot the extraordinary floods and a pro longed deluge of rain the roads were impassable and a number of bridges across these roads and across the rail roads were carried away by the violence of the floods the roumanian railroads were worse constructed than i had expected and very insuficiently provided vwith empoyis and rollingstock the tad condition of these railruads was partly the cause of the destruction of the bridges all these circumstances combined to hinder the raovements of the army and particularly of the transport by railroad of siege artillery parks of pontoons steam sloops material for bridgebuilding and of provisions of all kinds so that the troops did not reach their

danube under the command of lieutenant general zimmermann the th corps had orders to arrive on the th of june at alexandria to be ready for removal to any point where they might be wantedi ithe thcorps had orders to rejoin and follow the army by rail according to particular instructions on an average the concentration of the army was de layed six days somo ccrps more some less the transport of parks of pontoons and siege artillery byrail suffered the most from delay indoed the danube has this year over flowed its banks with greater force and for a longer period than usual and the waters havo only abated slowly on the lower danube they were in the beginning of june lft above their usual levelthis necessitated the passage of tho danube which had been fixed for the th of june being postponed from dayto day up to the very last moment we had to con tend with nature and with the imperfections of the roumanian railroads in the beginning of june when the troops had advanced ready to make the passage which had been fixed for the th of june it was found that the parks of pontoons were three days behind hand in con sequence of the bad condition of the railroads the march of the whole army zlong the line of the vede at ruchie de vede at alexandria and at beia had therefore to be re tarded at the last moment from the th of juno to the th of june and the passage adjoured for three days the pieparations made for crossing were as follows  beside the four parks of pontoons of the army at galatz and at slating pontoons of wood were constructed all the other materials of the bridge were prepared at slatins the potocons constructed at galatz were transported by rail to slatina all were launched on the olta it was needfui to bring all the pontoons and ether malns of transport to slatina launch them on the olta after wards to dem end the danube pasing by the fortlfications of nikopo wholly and solely because there was no other choice vxcept tho olta there is no other navigable river falling iyito the danube between nikopol and sistova if we had prepared to crosa thb ardjis wo should have had to ascen the danube and pass the still ctronger fortres of rustehuck towing up all our material as far as sistova i taought such an undertalaing impraedcible the parks of pontoons were transported by rail to the station of bnias between bucharest and glurgovo hence by the ordinary route to beia the steam sloops carrying torpedoes were trans ported by rail some of them to slatlna and ome to fratesti before srriving at glurgevo thence they were conveyed by waggoas to famunda below trnu and to mlalu de janse up the river glurgevo where they were launched on the danube  two poiats were previously hooken for the passage braila on the lowver danube below ulkopol about the middle portion of therivers courv at an i itended crossmg the danube at sltova the most ad tageogspot from a militaxy point of view but the enviro af imnitza were so inundated that it was impodsl to thinkof passing over at that place i had no choice bat to pass the river at nikopol where the danube hss only a bed with no creeks or windings i therefore took proper measres to concentrate the army and gave orders to throw in torpedoes at different parts of the danube on the lower danube this had been done at the com mencement of the campaign so as to prevent turkish vessels from entering either by the principal arm or by the canal of matchin this operation succeeded wonderfully well and by the end of akpril we wbo had no fleet had taken away the danube from the enemy from reni to braila  by the end of may all the lower danube from reni to hirsova was free of turkish vessels and entirely in our power owing to this we were able to construct a bridge from braila to ghetchet without let or hindrance the waters were so high along the lower course of the river that lieutenantgeneral zimmnermann consdered it impossible to pas on the d of june the day appointed and begged leave to postpone the operation till the waters had abated upon my reiterating orders that it was indispensable we hould cross without fail on the d of june be made every effort to compass the perilous operation which was executed with brilliant suocess on the d of june maiorgeneral joukow performed the passage of the river from galatz to boudjak with the regiments of riazan and of riajak and after an obstinate combat seized upon the i beighta of boudjak after this encounter the turka beat aretreat all along the line of the lower danube and oui troops occupied matchin toultcha issaltha and hirsoua without firing a single shot at this moment we are retreating into the interior of the dobrudscha thus by the d of june we were masters of both shores of the lower danube this passage has been effected with comparatively few lossesthree cfficers and  men killed two officers and  men wounded it is necessary to add that the troops of the lower danube corps crossed the river in steamboats on rafts and barks but not on the kridges which tad been con structed secing that from ghetchet almost to matchin the whole land was inundated and that at the otte de jpont of gbetchet everything was under water in the middle part of the course of the danube the preparations that had to be made for the passage were un questionably the most difficult as bas been stated its execution depended mainly upon the railroads wbich were most inadeoeate for the task secondly all the turkish monitors excepting the two wlich had exploded at braila were in ttis part of the streanr which made the estabish ing a network of torpedoes an extremely difficult and dangerous enterprise the vigilance of the burks had been awakened from all the symptoms we had reason to suppose that they knew several days leforehand that a passage was intended below likopol vith a simultaneous movement at giurgevo and ltenitza the enemy in all haste had therefore collected all their strength at these piats where they were erecting works of defence at nikopol for instance there were in the teginning of may when our troops arrived but two detached works in the beginning of june they bad  for a vhole month the turks had attentively watched our troops opening fire whenever a detachment however small appeared on the banks or on any boat that pushed from shore but on the approach of the decisive moment the enemys watch fulness evidently began to fag and this circumstance greatly facilitated the preparations for the passage agreeably to first intentions the troops marched upon turnu and elemunda in the following order of march a portion of the th corps st division of infantry and th division of cavalry from slatina to segartcha the th corps the fth division of infantry th corps and the bulgarian legion marched upon saltcha the oth division reuniting to their corps at segartcha the th division of cavalry had been left behind by their corps in vitanesti the th brigade of priflemen the th oorps and the parks of pontoon these latter upon their arrival by rail at banias marched to siaka and piatra the caucasian cossacks upon simnitza the th division of infautry upon oltenitza and giurgevo where they were to rejoin the rest of the th corps the th corps forming a general reserve upon alexandria the th corps upon a pcint determined by me whence they were to remove wherever most needed au the troops were to be at their posts by the th but i have already said that in consequence of the delay in the transport of the pontoons the army was stopped on the vede river at rousche de vede alexandria and beva thence the anry with equal facility and promptness could be sent to turnu simnitza and giurgevoas circum stances might require the time occupied by the troops in advancing to the vede was turned to account for laying torpedoes on the danube and reconnoitring the ground with a view to the selection of the principal point where the river could be crossed torpedoes were sunk from the th of june to the th on the th our squadron of torpedo boats eight steam aloopsstrongnvas launched on the danube at malu dejosse to which point the vessels had been transported by land at  oclock we began laying down obstructions in the stream at parapan at  am the turks on the opposite shore perceiving our works opened a iifle fire upon us anda little later despatched a steamer which let off grape upon this captain novikoff vho directed the works ordered lizutenant skrydlov to attack the hostile steamer with the sloop schoutka lieutenant skrydlov made straight for the monitor anrd lodged the torpedo but the wire being cut by the eneniys bullets the mine did not explode and the sloop had to retreat lieutenant skrydlov three sailors and the painter verestheagine who was on board as volunteer were wounded the monitor likewise beating a retreat our works on the stream were successfully ter minated hardly lad our squadron returned to the shore than general skobeleff of your majestys suite colonel stroukoff my adjutant and stafftaptain sokharoff came up to report that the turks were cunstructing a battery on the right shore to fire on our sloops so the latter immo diately left their anchorage five under lieutenantcapta n tador going down the danube while the five others uuder captain novikoff sailed away in the opposite direction all got off safely though three were struck by turkish bullets while engaged in sinking obstiuctions having completed these works wh ch prevented the turkish monitors stationed at rustchuck and turther down from sailing further up the rive than rustchuck all that remained to be done wvas to place torpedoes between parapan and turnu taking into account that it was first intended to cross at iikopol it was determincd to obstruct the river above that place and clear the danube of monitors all tbe way from nikopol to parapan to execute this latter design t we requirow d an opportumity exhicu tid not present itself rqo twu mcnitor rmained at nikopol though we succeeded in laying down torpedoes on the th of june our steam sloops were nearly all of them concentrated at ilemunda those left at malu de josse having been transported to the rallyingpoint by land considering the small number of these vessels at our disposal and foreseeing how much they would be wanted to protect our troops in croseing tte river captain novikoff resolved not to expose them unnecessarily to dangerbut to place historpedoes in boats propelled by oars in the night from the d to the th he had his canoes transported by land to karabia where they were launched by  oclock pm on the th the torpedoes intended to be laid at and near karatia were in the water miy adjutant colonel stroukoff took part iu this dificult and dangerous enterprise covering the boats with a line of sharpshooters from the shoro when the turks becoming aware of what was going on sent riflemen to the waterside it was too late lhe torpedoes had been placed and the canoes moved off without let or hindrance the same day our sailors accomplished another glorious feat on the d of june a turkish monitor near flemunda got up her steam and rapidly went down the river majorgeneral leonotf in command at flemunda immediately inforlmed our sailors limself placing in position four pieces of tho th battery under the commandof captain kolomeitsoff there were at tbismoment at flemunds only five steam sloops three of them were damaged but the two remaining ones at once entered the stream and fiercely attacked the turkish vessel uotwith standing the hailstono of balls and buuets disclared at them marine arous with tho sloop mina was the first to attack the monitor and but for a bomb cutting the wire of the torpedo battery would have sprung his mine his sloop was hurt and obliged to fall hack after this ensign niloff in the jchutka threw himself upon the mouitor aud luckily avoided a torpedo placed in front of tbe turkish vessel while going past the monitors prow at a sasheus distance ensign niloff fired three shots from his revolver at the turkish captain the splash of a bomb beat against the right sdde of the sloop the monitor veering her prow turned away from the mine ensign niloft then tried to get at their left side but his vessel being half filled with water and going slowly in conse quencoe the monitor succeeded in retreating to nikopol for this briliant exploit ensign niloff has been rewarded by the cros of st george of the th class and marine arous by the muedal of the military order the firing of the four pieces of the horse battery reatly contributed to hbaten the retreat of tho monitor the distance once obtained by the first three balls nearly all th other grenades exploded on tlh bridge of the hostil teel the

shore of the danube from simnitza to turnu having myself as certained the extreo difficulty of attempting to cross the river at nikopol i observed that the water was no longer too high to permit the passage at simnitza and accord ingly fixed upon this point somewhat below sistova no one at headquarters knew whither i had gone or that i was away at all nor do the turks seem to have had any inkling of my inspecting the shore in person at least they did not fire having selected the point where the river was to be crossed i immediatedy gave the following orders  to keep the chosen point a secret frcm every one except the commander of the th corps which vas to cross first to conceal the chosen point i directed the th division of infantry to march from alexandria to piatra the only troops

were received by the shots of a few isolated sentinels proof smfficient of the complete silence olserved in the passage they climbed the steep bank without any considerable less subsequent convoys encountered a heavy fire of infantry and artihery it was evident that the turlish troops stationed at and near sistova hiad taken the alarm and were hurrying to the spotnevertheless the pontoons went on crcssing and re crossing the river incessantly live poutoonsthree ordinary ones and two connected by a raftfoundered being struck by cannon balls the number of dead je not yet exactly known i am

two first convoys had successfully driven beck the turks who had retreated about five versts from the waterside he immediately ordered the brigade of majorgeneral petraf chevsty to march upon sistova and attack the town the th rifle brigade was detailed to occupy the hills skirting the river above sistova from  oclock in the morring till noon the sanguinary fight raged incessantly the last shots being heard at atout  pm the turks defended them selves with the courage of despair all their positions had to be taken at the point of the bayonet nobvwithstanding the assistance rendered by our batteries on the roumanian shore it required a great effort to silence two guns pcsted on the bills which command sistova at last however the enemy withdrew in the direction of tirnova and niko pol our losses were slight considering the difflculty of the task accomplished we had two offlicers and  men killed and  officers and  men vounded  are missing several officers and soldiers received more than one wound i shall subsequently submit the list of the dead and wounded ou this memorable day your majestys troops have covered themselves with immortal glory all without any exception have been
