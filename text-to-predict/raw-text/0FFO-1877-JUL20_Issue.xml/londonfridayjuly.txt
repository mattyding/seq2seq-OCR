technicai knowvledgfle of stationery and printing when he considered the resolution it ap peared to him to be utterly impracticable as no person connected with great commer cial transactions would be tempted to accept a post the salary of which hardly exceeded that of the manaaer of a firstrate commercial esta blishment for the discharge of the duties of the poat considerable administrative ability some offi cial experience and capacity for labour were re quired coupled wvith educational and moral quali ties a man with the mere technical knowledae of a printer and a stationer could not be appointed moreover there was in the stationety department a permanent body of men capable of supplying the inspector with all the requisite knowledge under the circumstances of the case he

of absolute destitution if his resignationwere accepted he hoped that the house of commons would yet consider this case in a milder and juster spirit as he had been actuated only by a desire to
