thb ba of k lianprom ou special correspondent vwth thetubxish amycaip riuprixum june there are few things more difficult none more disheartening than the attempt to extract trust worthy information from the turkish otlicials i forwarded you a short note on the th giving you the few particulars i could gather concerning the battles that were fcugbt onthest ateshekehalian since then i have had an opportunity of conversing vith captains trotter and micalmont additional alilitary attaches the only english present on the field but as they were on the right of the posi tion where the fighting was confined merely to an artillery duel it is impossible for me to give you any very accurate account of the engagement and i much fear that until the russian official and de tailed reports are published we shall be ignorant of the particulars of one of the bloodiest battles considering the number of men engaged of this centuryi reported to you in my last that on the th inst mukhtar pasha hearing that general drogo kanoff had established himself in a very strong position at eshekkihalian moved across from zewin fdooz to delibaba the head quarters of the right wing of the turkish armytaking with him five battalions with six field and sixmountain guns he had previously ordered up one battery from hassan kale and one from taikhojeh three battalions and  horse from kuprikui two battalions from ehorassan one from gulentas one from taikhojeh and two joined the force a few hours subsequent to the engagement on the th what his total force was on the morning of the th i am unable to ascertain with any degree of accuracy as i said before it was perfectly m possible to estimate the losses at the battle of tahir but in my opinion not a battalion or battery preserving its formation reached delibaba this opinion is strengthened by the report given by the officers above mentioned who state that he ad vanced from ielibaba on the morning of the th with au his forces leaving but one battalion at taikhojeh to keep up his communication with his centre at zewin dooz and that his force consisted of  battalions  field and  mountain guns advancing through the pass he left a reserve at eaidar kul about six miles distant of five bat talions and all his field guns under majorgeneral mustafa pasha and pushed on wvith the remainder towards the russian position that evening there was slight skirmishin betwveen the cavalry out posts the turldsh division bivouacking on a ridge about three miles from the russian camp at dawn on the st the turks once more advanced and at  am had taken up a position overlooking the russians their camp peing distinctly visible about two miles distant immediately below the turks captain mcalmont assures me that he could see the russian troops parading and that had mukhtar pasha brought up a field battery to play on them he would probably have driven them offbefore they could have formed butaltbough thus surprised no attack was made on the russians who quietly paraded struck camp within sight of their enemy and then moved off to commanding ground in the immediate vicinity which they had previously intrenchedit was not until noon that the fight com menced when the russians having taken up position on this ridge opened an artillery fire on the group of horsemen composing the head quarter staff and sent forward a body of infantry to turn the right flank of the turkishposition this atlack was checked and apparently not per sisted in the contending forces on this part of the battlefield contenting themselves with longrange firing on the left of the turkish position however very severe fighting occurred but to get at any accurate report is beyond the bounds of possibility the turks evidently advanced in some force with the view of carrying the russian intrenchments they pushed quite close up to them and were repulsed only to renew the attack over and over again the regiments composing this brigade complain bitterly that they were not properly supported and they also complain that they were sent into action with a very limited sup ply of ammunition their pouches not having been filled up prior to the engagement it is reported that on one occasion the infantry were supported by a body of circassians under moussa pasha but that the russians immediately let loose two regiments of dragoons on the irregular horse who were crumpled up like a pockethandkerchief with a loss so moussa pasha says of  kiued and  wounded this i doubt for reasons i wil dilate upon laterthe turks failed to capture the position which the russians still occupied at nightfall the turks claim a success however as they bivouacked on ground that night in advance of the spot they were on in the morning and the followv ing day early the russians moved off to a ridge about three miles in rear which they at once in trenched prior to their march they removed their dead from the battlefield and in the afternoon the turks moved down to couect theirs amounting to over  mukhtar pasha did not follow them up and although in his report he claims a victory and announces the capture of two gunsz yet at the most it was a drawn fight and his loss was enormous turkish officers have in con versation with me estimated it at  men and i am inclined to think this is not an exaggera tion i myself saw fully  wounded men on the road between erzeroum and this those able to walk were forced to struggle on as best they could those able to bear removal were placed on mules or country carts while the more dangerous cases were left in villages by the roadside the commanderin chief estimates the russian strength at ten bat talions with  guns and their loss at a figure much heavier than his own while he announces the capture of two fieldpieces this latter statement is unfounded attempts were made by the infantry on the left to capture a re doubt which contained that number of guns but they were unsuccessful and as captains mcalmont and trotter were on the ground the whole day and went over the battlefield the subsequent day with lulklhtar pasha and assure me that no guns were taken i must own to a belief that the turkish commanderinchief has been misinformed on this point the whole turkish force engaged amountedto  battalions and nine field and ten mountain guns for as the fight waxedlhotter large caus were made on the reserve so that the russians were over matched in men and the british officers present also assure me that they certainly had only eight field and a few mountain guns and one rocket troop in action so that in point of artillery fire the op posing forces were pretty equally matched i am inclinedto doubt from what i have seen of the turks if the russian loss were so heavy as it is supposed to have beenfirstly because i kow how w idly the ottoman soldier fires away his am munition secondly because i have seen how utterly regardless he is of cover thirdly i have watched the russians skirmishing on the hillside and have been struck with admiration at the manner in which they conceal themselves while ad vancing husband their ammunition and never waste a shot in addition to all this those present state that the russians scarcely showed themselves at allindeed captain mcalmont informed me that he nover saw a single battalion and very sel dom a skirmisher taking all these things into consideration it appears patent to me that tho turks with their usual dauntless courage reck lessly exposed themselves in storming the intrench ments and whilel unable to touch the russians were shot down by them in hundreds from the per fectly secure position they enjoyed behind their brcastworks i am afraid this is a very meagre account of the battle but in spite of all my sndeavours i have as yet been unable to get any maore details so i must content myself with send lng you what i have in hope that i may shortly be in possession of fuller particularyesterday morning early sir arnold kemball was informed that the russians were advancing in two columns and that severe flxhtinv might be ex pected at both zewin and dolibaba twe accordingly moved on to khorasan it being a very central posi tion on the road however we met numbers of circassians tailing off to the rear certainly between  and  men from these we learnt that a strong fcrce of russians had attacked ismail pasha on the zewin dooz and that moussa pasha who with  circasaians had been detailed zlukhtar paiha to roceoqdtom mt iina ibeen unable to force his way through them and was at present encamped at khorasan while on the right bank of the stream mustafa pasha was posted with five battalions we accordingly sent back our baggage animals and moved on we constantly ascended the hills on our left to see if any signs of the enemy were visible but beyond mustafa pashas battalions posted on the crest of a ridge about three miles to our right front and large parties of circassians hastening to the rear not a sign of war was visible we reached khora san at  pm but were not allowed even to give our horses a feed of corn the circassians had reported a large body of cossacks advancing on the village and their leader moussa pasha judged it expedient to beat a hasty retreat he insisted on our leaving immediately and even waited to see us mount so bowing to necessity we once more set off and in company with lioussa pashas horsemen forded the araxes and pro ceeded by the right bank to kuprikui such a sight as the march of this body of cavalry said to be  strong i never saw and for the sake of turkey i hope never to see again when we mounted at khorasan i fancy there must have been about  men but instead of marching in one compact body with their chief they moved off as it pleased them in twos and threes by whichever road suited their convenience scarcely  men crossed the river with their leader andthese soon dwindled down to a small troop of about  men as i write i see the tent of moussa pasha pitched within a quarter of a mile of mine sur rounded by about  other bell tents all occupied by the horsemen whose dashing gallantry and fanatical hatred of the russians were announced as certain to bring the war to a speedy conclusion so far from these men showing any dashing gallantry when in bodies they display a remark able tendency to keep out of the way of the enemy and spend their time in ravaging villages pillaging the inhabitants living on the fat of the land and never paying a sous for anything they appropriate the fattest lamb in the flock the best horse in the stable the largest cooking vessel in the  khan  are all considered fair prize it is not to be wondered at then that armenian and miahomedan alike should look forward with feelings of welcome to the coming of the russians it is exaspera ting to see the circassians all round one lying down in comfortable tents living on the fat of the land and declining to join in the conflict while the turkish soldiers are without cover without food and fighting gallantly for their country for two days now heavy fighting has been re ported as going on at zewin dooz where ismail pasha aided by that gallant hungarian general faizi pashawith a force of barely  men has kept at bay a russian force which is reported to be half as strong again tnstead of proceeding to the assistance of the beleaguered turks who are much harassed by the russian cavalry moussa pasha and his circassians lie in clover at kupri kui  miles to the rearyesterday five battalions and three guns forced their way up to zewin from this place but they moved off before i learnt their intentions and asit is quite impossible to join the camp except in com pany with a large body of infantry for strong bodies of cossacks are prowling about the road have cut the telegraph wire and captured small parties en deavouring to join ismailand as i have no wish to date my next letter from tiis having had one nar row escape from an unforeseen journey in company with a russian escort i am naturally rather careful where i go so wlhen aioussa pasha informed us at khorasan that the cossacks were within half an hour of the village i gladly joined in the evacuation of the place we moved across the hills on the right banik of the stream and pushed on so as to avoid the circassians who we knew would occupy every corner of every village we might reac the first place we came to yuz vairan where we had hoped to find a rough nights rest was in flames having been fired by the circassians or koords and of course was quite de serted the fact that it was a christian vilfage was quite sufficient excuse for these gentry to destroy it as we passed through at about  pm we came across a party of schamyls men coming from deli baba on seeing us these gentry raised a cry of  russ russ i and dashed off leann baggage grooms and horses to their fate we ca med them and moved on to komadsor an armenian vilage where we arrived at  pm and found fairly com fortable quarters in a stablenaturally since i have been here i have had many very many opportunities of conversing with turkish officers and men on the socalled eastern question and the consequence is that arriving in the country a strong philoturk deeply impressed with the necessity of preserving the integrity of the empire  in order to uphold british in terests i now fain would cry with mr freeman  perish india rather than one english soldier should fall fighting for turkey  am fully aware that partisans of the ottoman empire maintain that we should not be fighting for the porte but to keep open our communicationswith india which would be seriously imperilled by the contiguity of such an aggressive power as russia what did we fight for in  and what was the result at a sacrifice of life almost unprecedented in our annals of warfare  at a sacrifice of  millions of english money we bolstered up an effete power and for  years allowed it to labour under the impres sion that we should always prop it up by our stal wart aid when assailed what has been the conse quence  the upper classes have enriched them selves by sucking the lifeblood of the lower the country is in a state of bankruptcy owing to its maladministration the officials buy their promo tion with money extorted by threats and compulsion from the poorer community and continue in office by the same means trade is at a standstill and no man durst embark in a new venture on account of the heavy fees demanded by every government official as his own private perquisite and although the actual imperial taxation is small and fals lightly on even the poorer classes yet the power placed in the hands of all government servants is so enormous and usually is so arbitrarily wielded that the inhabitants groan under a yoke almost too hard to be bornethe constant reports by our energetic con sul of the gross outrages committed on christian villagers and his inability to obtain adequate compensation the burning houses of yuz vairan which we ourselves saw on the th and the deserted armenian hamlets all over these hills point to the fact that oppression however much it may be denied by constantinople officials is openly practised and connived at at any rate by those in authority in asia minor several glaring cases have come under my own personal observation and many more have been reported to me by the american missionaries and our own consular offlcials in erzeroum i do not for one moment mean to deny that there are honest energetic turks capable of exercising their talents for their countrys good but these men are powerless the vital powers of the nation are so sapped by centuries of misrule the minds of the majority are so imbued with the belief that all ideas not born ofmoslem brains and sanctified by meslem usage are false and to be scorned that were any honest minded gontleman to rise to power and endeavour to check the present system of misgovernmenthe would not remain in office one week after accompanying a turkish armv in the field after witnessing the privations of the men owing to the criminally faulty commissariat arrangements after beeina the miseries of the wounded

even of turyeys stanchest supporters of the vacillation and weak ness of herministers i cannot help feeling tlhat she is past redemption and that any encouragementgiven to her will only prolong the present struggle afford russia a pretext for further a gression and make the blow when it does come fall the harder upon the misguided nationthe battle of zewin doozfrom our correspondent with thez turkisharmycamp zewvin dooz june leaving komadsov at  am we forded the araxes fearing cossack patrols which had been reported as scouring the country we passed over the hills viq ardost in rear of the zewin hills reaching the camp at  am we proceeded at once to mlushir ahmed m ukhtar pashas tent where we found hin and his gallant old chief of the staff faizi pasha in a great state of exultation it ap pears that the fight on the th herewas a complete isnecesa the russians attacked the position very heas n trn ieaacvyasentyouwill explain that therightowing to the open nature of the valley running up it defied attackturkish camp on zeywindoozthe battle lasted until  pm when the russians drewroff leaving  dead bodies on the ground from reports of officers on the ground it appears that the russians who as i have already informed you had detached a force of  men with  cavalry at kars were reported at mellidooz on the th inst a reconnaissance showed that their general had detached a force of five battalions a battery and some cavalry towarda khorasan with theviewof cutting off the right wing from the centre and probablyalso of seizing the kuprikui position at present almost undefended by a cop de main and thus forcing the centre of the turks to fall back on erzeroum without effecting a junction with the delibaba division at  am the russian column consisting as now could be distinctly seen of  battalions three batteries and from  to  cavalry vas visible moving over the hills from mellidooz to zewin without waiting even to halt and rest his men the russian general by some said to be loris melikoff himself by others general geyman pushed on heavy columns to the right front of the turkish position where the ground is split up into numerous rocky ra vines terminating under the turkish intrench ments in almost precipitous walls enfiladed for a distance of about  yards and in many places ex posed to cross fire from three intrenchments held by infantry as well as to a sweeping fire from the six krupp guns the russian guns owing to the nature of the ground could not come into action at a nearer range than  yards and the turks being about ft above their batteries shots not actually striking the intrenchments either buried themselves in the ground on the face of the slope or passing over fell harmless a long distance in rear of the ridge the infantry fire too owing to their low position was to a great extent nullified while the ottoman troops safe behind their shelter trenches rained in a fire from their martinihenry rifles that no troops could have lived under ten times were the russians driven back and ten separate times did they with the gallant obstinacy characteristic of the nation assail this almost impregnable position certainly impregnable from the face they attacked it from seventeen turkish battalions armedwith the best shooting weapon in the world poured down an almost incessant fire on the russian column and when they shaken and broken by their heavy losses endeavoured to move off to their right up the valley and attack the more open ground in that direction they were met by two fresh bat talions accompanied by two field guns very fortu nately sent down by faizi pasha and although these suffered very heavily one having no less than  men put hors de combat theyeffectually checked the enemy again and again did the russians press their attack sometimes to within  yards of the turkish trenches again and again were they forced back unable to face the furious storm burled against them the sun went down on this scene of carnage and yet the fight went on the midsummer moonlending her bright light to enable aggressor and oppressor to carry on their dread slaughter in spite of their enormous losses in spite of the death of two of their most gauant and determined leaders in spite of their being unable to inflict any loss on their opponents the muscovites pressed on their attack  but at halfpast  in the evening having lost nearly onefourth of his force geyman drew off to zowin had the turkish commander possessed any confidence that his men would face their foe in the open the russians would have beenfouowed up and probablynot a man would have escaped to tell the tale to the grand duke michael atkars but knowing that the strong point of his men was in fighting behind intrench ments and being destitute of cavalry for moussa pasha had been idly lying at khorasan all day instead of moving up to support his bravely fighting compatriots faizi pasha wisely determined to abandon all hope of pursuit and allowed the russians to draw off unmolested to a position near zewinthe following morning on the th a smart cannonade was commenced by the russians at a very long range and under cover of it they retired to mel idooz where they now are waiting for rein forcements from kars on the arrival of these they doubtless will once more try conclusions on the spot the turks now are inspired with confi dence in themselves and their leaders dispirited by the surrender of bayazid the capture of ardahan and the defeat of iaghir they were somewhat en couraged by the slight success gained at khalian when the russians certainly fell back before mukhtar pasha  and although the very heavy loss sustained that day somaewhat damped their ardour the complete victory on the th here has inspired them with the greatest enthusiasm and will pro bably put a very different complexion on the issue of the next few weeks campaiguas have alreadytold you mukhtar pasha on the lth crossed over to delibaba and koord ismail pasha on that day assumed command here on the th he satisfied himself with sitting on the ground reading his koran and praying in a rapid and audible tone in my humble opinion and in the opinion of every turkish officer with whom i have conversed the whole credit of the day is due to faizi pasha the chief of the staff whom ahmed mukhtar had wisely left here to assist ismail not only did this gallant old officer superintend all arrangements personally visit ing every battalion and shelter trench but once or twice early in the day when the russians pressing close up to the intrench rments caused the turks to waver in one instance indeed to retire somewhat rapidlyhe led them himself forward revived their drooping spirits in spired them with fresh courage and so won the day for his adopted governmenta hungarian refugee after  captain kohlman as he was then called sought em ployment in the turkish army under konety he gained some renown and was rapidly pro moted to the rank of majorgeneral  but with their usual obstinacy and pride of race the turks look with jealousy on the man who foughtand bled at lkars who executed the fortifications at batoum who reorganized the fourth army corps and although he has changed his faith and is now as orthodox a mussulman as the most conscientious turk faizi pasha has the mortification of seeing men who w ere boys when he won his spurs in the ottoman army pass over his head and gain the coveted rank of mushir while he still grows gray in the grade of ferik it is to be hoped that the porte will show signs of some grati tude and as his just rewvard give him the rank of marshal with weak battalionsand  gunshe com pletely defeated  very strong russian battalions with  guns inflicting on them enormous losses while his owvn casualties did not amount to  men the division of general geyman on the contrary is reported by prisoners taken subsequent to the battle and by deserters to have lost killed and upwards of  wounded an austrian officer pro sent on the field one who graduated in the o and  campaigrns and held high rank on the staff of the i avalz division at sadowforzned mo tbat theflosses were fully  men the villagers of zewin informed us that upwards of  men with  superior officers were buried on their hills and as the turkish soldiers buried  in front of their position i am inclined to think that their losses must have amounted to fuly  killed and wounded the turks suffered heavily in officers  out of the  being of the commissioned grade iaeutenant general mukhliss pasha received two severe wounds in galantly encouraging his men and many officers commanding battalions fell at the head of their regimentsi must mention one incident in the action show ing the value of the turkish cavalry and their leaders wvhen the russians shaken by the fire in front endeavoured to move off to their right they were met as i told you by a couple of bat talions and two guns who checked and drove them back the scene of this affair was an open valley well adapted for cavalry manceuvres fsizi pasha ordered his horse some  kurds circassians and zaptiehs down the hill to charge the broken in fantry instead of proceeding down the watercourse which opened into the vauey and where they would have been completely covered these daunt less horsemen moved boldly across the sky line of the ridge fully exposed to the russian fire and before any attempt to descend had been made they suffered casualties to the extent of about  horses when considering they had sufficiently vindicated their characters they retired and declined to fight again that dayi have endeavoured since my arrival here to re port fairly and conscientiously all that has come under my personal observation i have never hesitated to expose the vices follies and short comings of the furks but i trust at the same time that ihave fully given them their due fortheir gallantry in the field or their noble conduct in bearing privations which no other nation in the world would submit to it is no pleasure to harp always on one string and it has been a source of sincere gratification to me that i have at last been enabled to change my note and chant my feeble lay of praise to the honour of the officers and men engaged in the battlefield of zewin doos on monday last it is more than a pleasure to be able to recount the energy good judgment and gallantry shown by the commanderinchief ahmed mukhtar in the operations of the last few days his conduct at kars subsequent re treat from that place at the end of april and the apathy he evinced at the commencement of the campaignled to hisbravery being freely questioned officers and men inveighing in no measured terms against a leader who vas rarely seen out of his tent never visited the regimental camps iuvari ably retired on the advance of the russians appa rently took no pains to insure his commissariat being regularly supplied and allowed his men to suffer cold hunger and want without raising a finger to assist them i am inclined to think that miukhtar pasha was hampered by the constantinople officials wvho permitted him to open a campaign with an empty treasure chest and then with a flourish of trumpets sent him � and bade him go in and win and also by the jealousy of koord ismail pasha at erzeroum who took no pains to feed the army in his district or to horse and push on the numerous guns lying useless at that city to the fourth army corps hlowever much the commanderinchiefs conduct may be open to criticism prior to the th there is no doubt that subsequent to that date he bas shown an energy and capacity rarely seen in a turkish official immediately on learning of the de feat at taghir and cousequent depression and loss or morale of the delibaba division he himself pro ceeded to the spot led the men forward against the russians and gained a decided success although achieved at a frightful sacrifice of life it showed the turks that they could hold their own against their foe and thus having inspired them with fresh courage and seen personally to the faulty comruis sariat arrangements which the unfortunate maho med pasha entirely neglected he crossed back to zewintoo late however to participate in the gallant fight of the th the success of which must be attributed to the arrangements and gallant bearing of the chief of the staff faizi pashaas i close this letter osman bey aidedecamp to the commanderinchief and as gallant an officer as ever drew sword has just come into our tent and reported that the russians have retired both from mellidooz and from zaidikan leaving the front both of the bleadquarter and delibaba divi sion free from threatened attack it seems that the russians lost heavily in the fight at khalian and that faik pasha moving up from bayazid with his force the details of which i have previously given you amounting to about  infantry and  cavalrv with nine guns has placed teraukassoff between two fires and forced him to fall back from the same source i learn that having detached this division to attack zewin the grand dnke michael has but  bat talions at kars and that mukhtar pasha feeling the morale of his troops so much improved has de termined on making aforward movement i trust however that this may not be true for his weak ness in artillery will bring ruin on the turks if they attempt to act on the offensive it has been ascertained beyond doubt that loris melikoff com manded in person on the th here if so he deserves to be removed from his command and the russian general whoeverhe maybe who led his men against the position without a reconnaissanee and sacri ficed thousands of valuable lives in driving them against precipitous cliffs deserves to be tried by courtmartial very different was his conduct from that of tergukassoff on the th who handled his men in the most perfect style and gave as pretty an illustration of hill warfare as could well be desired
