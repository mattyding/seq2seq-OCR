austrtaby telegraphro ou axstrian corresronentvienna july from the theatre of war itself there has bean no news of importance since yesterday at constan tinople public agitation is at its height troops are being constantly despatched to adrianople but there is visible consternation mcst of the journals hero as well as in hungary are actively discussing the passage of the balkans by the russians some of them make out that the moment of action has arrived for austria who they say has always in dicated this event es the extreme limit of her neutrality  others again attribute the same policy to englandfor my part i do not believe that so fares concerns austria the government deems the mere passago of the balkans by a few russian battalions a sufficient motivo to intervene as i pointed out yesterday all the contingencies of the war have been foreseen and ï¿½ long as there is no question of discussing the conditions of peace anything that russia can do will be regarded ps essentially of a provisional character it is lament able howeverthat in certain of their administrative mauuxe th itussians shquld have soenwed toattach to tho new stato of things they are creating a definitivo character the fulrther they go in this direction the further they will have to recede  for it is evident that nothing definite can be done with out the consent of tho great powers and primarily of austriait is perfectly absurd to speak eiroady of the occupation of constantinople by the russians from the balkans to the bosplhorus is a loog way the possession of constantinople is doubtless an event which would affect the interests of austria no less than those of england and though the means these countries might think fit to employ tor the protection of those intercsts would doubt less not be the same still there could be no ques tion about them for tho present however the war is not ended and for austria to intervene now would be an act of great irrprudence especially as there is nothing to show that russia does not intend to respect the wishcs of austiia to the utmost indeed it wcs with the view of sparing her susceptibilities that russia avoided passing through servia and preferred taking the more difficult route which she has followed the czar has already taken into account the scruples of austria and the act may be regarded as evidence of his intentions lvhen therefore the hour of final settlement comes austria wvill bo able to re mind him of his duty and secure protoction for her interests
