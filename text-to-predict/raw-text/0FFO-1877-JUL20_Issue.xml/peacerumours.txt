peace rumfoubs rnor a french coiesponhdestpamis jrly   tihe march of events at tlhe seat of wair in european turkey is beginning to occupy the serious attention of the cabinets it is now known beyond all doubt that there is a double current of opinion around the emperor of russia one party headed by prince gortchakoff desires that russia should not deviate too far from her former declarations but that after showing the tuirks and europe her strength she should be satisfied with imposing under the guarantee of europe conditions of toleration humanity and economy which turkey previouslyrejected so defactofreesmgtheenropean christians from turlkislh rule they feel that russia cannot exact from turkey modi fications of treaties depending not on ber but on the signatary powers they advocate in short an unpretentibous and brief campaign localizing tho war to the end and enabling russia to dismiss her soldiers to their homes before the winter instead of so weakening herself by a pro tractod conflict as to possess no more inlfluence on the continent ihis political party under the chancellors prudent leadership perceives that thero are barren glories and ruinous con quests and unmoved by tho rapid success of the russian arms it listens to the rumours reach ing it from the four corners of europe wondering every night whether the morrow may not add a fresh complication to those alroady existingthere ere around the emperor liowever larger ambitions and more extended schemes general ignatieff and lprince tchorkasski aro opposing prince gortchakofis infuenco with all their might and are unfolding before their sovereigns eyes wider and more eeductive prospocts this second party describes the definitive solution of tho eastern question and the glory to be earned by the emperor in realizing the dream of the czarsand driving the crescent beyond the bosphorus they show himi how prince gortchakofis policy which consisted in leading the european powers up to the point of concession they now occupy should bo suspended on the eve of war to bo re sumed on tho tbreshold of peace leaving he military leaders alone to judgo of the proper moment for passing from the stato of war to the state of peacc they show him turkey abandoned by the civilized world falling to pieces through age and corruption and doomed by tho providence always complacently invoked by conquerors to dis appear from tbo face of the earth in their view the russian armies shoiild pause only at constauti noplo itself where after restoring tothe worship of the truo god the temples sullied by the crescent the emperor should summon around him the representatives of the powers to settle with them on the scene of ifis conquest tbe fate of european turkey some indeed and general ignatieff is at theirhead arc

for hiim to cleliver his counttr fromu the periodical struggle against the turks alhey point out to him that auistria is restrained by germany that italy obeys the coin eis of the latter that france is impotent and divided and that england is powerful enough in tho bosphorus to destroy constantinople but not to defend it against an army encamped at its gales they saymnoreover that in any case russia cannot after the terrible sacrifices she has mado afford to return without some brilliant advantages from the campaign and that these advantages lurkey will only give to triumphant russia after sle has traversed tho road to constantinoplo and has swept armies before ler theysay toeand i eim farfrom having exhausted this theme that it will be im posible to restrain he victorious arny without of fending and humiliatingit that turkey will not re gard herself as couquered till the russian standard is waving from the top of st sophia that at the pre sent mornent the turkis are no longer in a position to avenge themselves on the christians and lastly that bulgaria and roumelia wm furnish if necessary more excellent winter quarters for the russian troops than there are in russia itselfsuch is the talk rt the emperors headquarters and those who know exactly the state of things add thatthe supreme hour hasarrived andthatwhenonce rustchuck is in the hands of the russians it will be too late to influence the emperor in a pacific sense the attitude of europe sudciently proves that it wisbes peace as soon as possible while that of prince gortchakoff shows that he is disposed to second its efforts haste is therefore necessary it matters little from what side the first ovorture comes the chief thing is to make it and make it speedily for if evenitisnotsuccessfulit will haveas a diplomatist has judiciously expressed it the advantage of clearing up the sitnation and of bringing about that indispensable common action of the powers which has ceased since the collapse of the protocol and thus left each to act in isolation and as it were at hazard
