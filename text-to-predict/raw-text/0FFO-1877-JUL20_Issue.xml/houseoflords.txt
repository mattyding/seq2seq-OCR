appointume of air pigottthe earl of beaconsfield aidmiy lords i rise to make one or two remarks upon a resolution passed by the other house which is on your table and which has been transmitted to us in the usual manner that resolution my lords is a censure upon the conduct of the government with respect to m public appointment which has recently been made i am the last person who would question for a moment the propriety of noticing the conduct of a minister who sar seem fora momentto have placed himself in oppo sition to the opinion of the house of commons my lords theimportant question before us arose in this manner there was about the time when the present government was formednow more than three years agoone of the de partments of the state which was not deemed to be ad ministered in a manner entirely satisfactory to the public a committee was appointed by the house of commons to inquire into the general state and conduct of that depart ment that committee after receiving a great deal of evidence issued a report of considerable interest and value ily lords i do not think that there is anybody who more values the labours of parliamentary commit tees than myself they obtain for the country an extraor dinary mass of valuable information which probably would not otherwise be at band or available and formed as tbey necessarily are of chosen men from the two most im portant bodies of the state their reports are pregnant with prudent and sagacious suggestions for the improvement of tho administration of affairs my lords i have spent the greater part of my life in parlia ment and it has frequently been my dutyalways my de lightto vindicate the rights and privileges of parliament i have sometimes been charged indeed with having taken an extravagant view of those rights and privileges but i think charged unjustly but my lords i never for a moment have maintained nor do i know any personal or written authority that has maintained that the reso lutions of a committee of the house of commons were in falible hear hear mly lords i think you will see that if that position were admitted the utmost disorder and inconvenience must be occasioned in the administration of public affairs in the first place it would entirely de  stroy the responsibility of ministers rear hear if when a public question arises all that a mlinister lias to do is to propose a parliamentary committee to in quire into it and when that committee has reported all that he has to do is to incorporate their unimpeachable suggcs tions in a bill and afterwvards an act of parliament the house will at once see in what a position of difficulty and disaster i might say the administration and even tho legis lation of the country might be placed in the present in stance this committee offered to the consideration of the country their opinions on all the points connected with the administration of the department in question and they offerqd them in considerable detail i think the number of resolutions at which they arrived with regard to that department were not less than  some of these resolu tionsi miy say many of these resolutionswere adopted by the government and worked most advantageously some of these resolutions have been adopted by the go vernment but in their operation have not been successful and they have therefore been bandoned some of these resolutinas were disregarded after due and deep considera tion by the government the department in question my lords is that of the public stationery and the office in question is that of controuer of that department among the resolutions which vereidisregarded after the deepest consideration by the government was a resolution that when the oice of controler again became vacant the person appointed to that office should possess the requisite technical knowledge of stationery and printing my lords at the commencement of this spring this office did become vacant i was made aware of it by the courtesy of the gentleman who held the office some time before his resigna tin was formally announced he told me of it i doubt not from a consideration of the difficulties which would attend the new appointment and in order that the government might have ample time to consider the matter it fell to my lot my lords to fulfil that dutya very difficult one i assure vou  had to consider therefore the recommendation of the committee of the house of commons that the new con treller should possess  the requisite technical knowledge of stationery and printing now my lords when i con bidered that resolution and when i made some inquiries re specting it i found that it was one which appeared to me to be utterly impracticable hear hear no doubt my lords there are gentlemen connected with the great private establishments for the sale of stationery in all its forms aud desriptions who possess the intelligence the educa tion and the character which would render them per fectly competent to occupy this post in the administration of the affalirs of he country but your lordships will see in a momenet that persons connected with great commercial transactions employing a vast capital and getting a great retarn from it cculd not be tempted to accept a post which however honourable is one with nothing of the glare of distinction about it and the salary of which hardly exceeds the salary of a firstrate clerk or manager in a firstrate commercial establishment hear hear now m lords what is the consequence of such a position of affairs to appoint a person who has technical know ledge of stationery and printingthat is to say to appoint a stationer or a printeri should have had to appoint some person who had retired from business or some person from whom business hadretired laughter my lords i felt the responsibility of dealing with this question and i could not undertake the responsibility of asking a decayed stationer or printer to fill a post of this character hear hear but my lords the post is one which requires considerable administrative ability it requires some official erperience it requires a capacity forlabour these are the qualities which are generally ne cessary for an administrative office of this de scription and it is usually necessary that they should be coupled with that of education and with the moral re pute which society demands my lords in these cir cunstances the question which i had to decide was one of very great difficulty your lordships may say that although it was not possible to appoint a man who had technical knowledge of stationery and printingit is not to be believed that the superintondence of an important department of the state the expenditure of which amounts to half a mil lion a year should be intrusted to a person ignorant of the knowledge without which it was impossible that successful administration could be secured my lords i apprehend that this vote in that respect must have been arrived at under a considerable misapprehension of the circumstnuces in the stationery office as it at present exists there is a complete and organizod body of experts in every depart ment connected with stationery with printing and with bookbinding so far as the public requirements demand they are a permanent body and they supply the indivi dual who is responsible for the administration of the de partment with au the technical knowledge which is re quisite your lordships will perhaps be interested to hear that there are in this department two examiners and two assistantexaminers of print ing and of printing accounts that there is ous examiner and one assistant examiner of paper as material that there is an examiner and two assistant examiners of binding a very important part of the business of the officoin short there is not a single branch of the duties which require technical knowledge which is aot already provided with competent experts well my lords it was necessary for me to consider what course i sbould takefa rom having disregarded the resolutions and opinions of ae committee of the house of commons thepresent govermment bave effected in this particu lar department most important reforms and have to a great extent reduced its expenditure since the publication of the report of the committee and very much in consequence of its suggestions the expenditure of the department has been reduced by � and at thismoment there are changes in progress which will bringaboat afurther reduction of � ayear i think this is evidence that her mnajestys government have not in any way neglected the recommendations of the committeoof the house of commons rear hear upon this point my lords i may perhaps mention that it has been said this great saving of the publio money and these ad vantageous changes are a striking proof of the advantage of having as superintendent of the office a person who has v technical knowledge of stationery and printing for they bave been ascribed to the influence and exertions of a disinguished colleague of rmy owvn who is secretary to the treasuryandwhohappily i think for the publicbefore lie entered into public life was bimself the head of one of the greatest establishments in this country connected with prinltizzg and with stationary hear hear i allude to fr smith the secretery to the treasury heara name mown and honoured now i assure you my lordsand i make tlis statement with hiis fuuu authority and at his special desirethat none of these alterations ia the sta woev ofiice are at all attributabla to bisingheenco endexertions as secretary to the treasury he has signed all the documents wbich have appeared connected with that department but the truth is he rigned them formally with the full confidence that the work which had been done had been done properly that work had been done by a lord of the treasury mr rovland winn it was solely by his individual exertions and unceasing care that those great improvements and that saving were effected and i need not remind you my lords that mr rowlaud winn has no technical knowledge of stationery and printing but is a lincolnshire country gentleman hear hear and a laugh now mylords i arrived absolutely at this conclusionthat it was impossible with any regard to the efficiency of the public service to appoint as head of this establishment a gentle man who was a real stationer or printer the question therefore arose in what manner the vacant post could be most efficiently filled some are of opinion that the post ought to have been filled by a literary man because it had been filled by literary men and because that was thought to be a graceful tribute to men of letters my lords i do not think that i shall ever be accused of any want of sym pathy or respect for men of letters hear while i have occupied my present post and also in former times i have omitted no legitimate opportunity of aiding and honouring men of letters but i am not aware that i should be honouring the literature of this country by placing a man of letters in a post which requires qualities he does not possess and the duties of which in consequence would have to be performed by others now glancing over the names of various men of distinction in let ters i do not find any one of suitable qualifica tions whom i could have expected to accept the post but although i might not have been able to fulfil literally the resolution of the hlouse of commons i might have found a person competent to carry on the established routine of the office among the present members of the esta blishment well my lords this is a delicate subject to treat of but when the public interest is concerned i must treat it with frankness and i trust that in treating it with frankness i shall hurt the feelings of no individual my lords i have ever been of opinion that not as a strict rule trom which there may be no exception but as a general rule to be observed it is expedient that when the head of a department retires or is promoted it is not desirable that as a matter of course his successor should be found among his subordinates generally speaking i believe it would lead to obsolete roatine and a supine system of administra tion which it is not desirable to encourage i do not lay it down as a rule without exception i can at once admit that if i found a department conducted wvith great efliciency a department against the administration of which there had been no murmurs and if i could trace that that effi ciency was in a great degree attributable to the energies of some of the second in commandif i may use the phrase in the department i think that that efficiency and that ability would create a moral claim to promotion which i should be the first to acknowledge but if speaking gene rally as i think it will be admitted it is not wise that it should be considered a matter of course that a subordinate should aucceed to the chief on his promotion certainly that rule would particularly apply wvhen we are dealidg with an office the administration of which was admiittedly unsatisfactory hear hear i say this particularly with reference to the chief clerk of the stationery department mlr reid i believe him to be a most efficient and able offlcer i believe that allkthat was good or much that was good in the late administration of the office may be attributed to him but at the same time the general ad ministration has not been satisfactory and it appeared to me of the utmost importance that fresh blood should be in troduced into the department under the circumstances of the case my lords there was only one course to take as it was really practicauy impossible to appoint to the head of the stationery department as controller a retired or unfortunate tradesman laughter  as it was clear to me that from the organized system of experts prevailing in the stationery departmentall thenecessarytechnicalknowledge was to be obtained from men who had been trained as stationers trained as printers trained as bookbindersthe three great trades connected with that office  as it did not seem to me expedient that a man of letters should be ap pointed merely because he was a man of lettes and as it seemed to me most desirable that considering the stato of the department some one should he put at its head that had the requisite qualities for establishing an efficient ad ministration and who was not connected with the old system i had to see whether among the members of the civil service i could fid such an individual well my lords my first intention and my first step was to apply to some of the most eminent members of the civil service and i endeavoured to induce them to retire from the offices which they filled and accept the present the one that was vacant my lords i was not on the wholefortunate in that attempt and i must say thatou calmly considering the obh jectionsthat were made to it i do not think those objections were unreasonablethe gentlemen to whom i applied all held offices equal not to say superior in dignity to the con trollorship of stationery and they all received salaries equal no to say superior in some instances to that which was accorded to that functionary therefore it was asking them to make a sacritice without any apparent necessity for it my lords what was to be done  i considered then that tho best course i could take would be to see whether there was not in the younger members of the civil service some one equal to the occasion and i let it be known that this post was vacant it was to be a reward of merit certainly i did not advertise this in the news papers or proclaim it at charingcross laughter  but i had the opportunity of making the matter known in official circles and it was well known in official circles that the clasin of any man who had shown that lie had distin guished abilities and that he was competent to cope with such a post would be favourably considered by me cheers well my lords what was the result of that  six names were placed before me one of which was bmr pigotts i will not mention the others because it might be invidious to do so but i will name their positions which it will be seen were not mate rially different from mlr pigotts one was clerk to the treasury the bias of my mind was certainly to have pro moted that gentleman it has fallen to my lot to introduce clerks of the treasury to very important positions in the public service and they have gained great distinction by the opportunity that has been afforded them another gentleman was connected with the office of works another was in the board of trade a fourth was clerk in the wvar officethe same department in which mr pigott was and another was in the geological survey office these were the six gentlemen who were brought under my notice as being competent to fulfil high administrative duties i believe that all of them are men who will rise in the public service but i could not appoint all six i had to make a selection i made overy inquiry and i finally decided to offer the post to mr pigott he had not asked for it he would have looked upon it as an act of great presumption to ask for it no friend of his ever interfered in the matter cheers his name was brought before me by a gentleman who has as large an experience of business in our public offices as probably any living person and who from his observation alone had ftixed upon mr pigott to reoommend him upon his merits cheers andnot only did no friend of mir pigotts interfere in the matter but mr pigott himself was unaware that he had been proposed for the post and was greatly astonished that his name had ever been brought before me mly lords i mention this be cause it has been said in an assembly almost as classical as that which i am addressing that this appointment was a  job   hear hear and laughter that the father of mr pigott was the parson of my parisb that i had relations of long and intimate friendship with him that he busied himself in county elections and that in my earlier contests in the county with which i am connected i was indebted to his exertions miy lords this is really a romance laughter thirty years ago there was a vicar of my parish of the name of pigott and he certainly was fattier to this gentleman he did not owe his preferment to me nor was he ever under any obligation to me shortly after i succeeded to that property blr pigott gave up his living and retired to a distant county i have never had any relations with him with regard to our in timate friendship and his electioneering assistance all i know of his interference in county elections is that before he departed from the county of buckingham he registered his vote against me loud cheers and laughter and nmy lords it is the truthit may surprise you but it is the truththat i have no personal acquaintance with mr pigott who was appointedto this office the other day cheers i donot know him even by sight and yet my lords this narrative was the basis of the principal address upon which this resolution was founded and i am told by a gentleman who necessarily from hispositionis the best and most competent judge of such a point that if thatstatement hrdnot been made there woul not have been tho slightest chance of the resolution being carried hear hear bmy lords there is in this question sometbing much more than personal feelings to be considered when such a resolution was passed i should have felt it my duty under any circumstances from my respect for parliament to have brought its consideration under your notice but my lords i am greatly mistaken if there are not considerations connected with this question much grver and deeper than personal feelings and personal interests i will not dwell on the case of mlr pigott mir pigottthough of gentle birth is the youngest son of a younger sonthe cadet of a cadet and had nothing to depend on in this life except the salary whichhe had obtained by  years of honourable and not undistinguished labour in thepublic service of which he is a member hear hear known there by the ministers to whom he has been private secretary and known there also for his distinguished ser vices as secretary to a commission to which i believe some members of your lordships liouse belonged having for feited entirely forfeited the post which he possessed he did not hesitate with the promptitudo of a gentleman top lace the resignation of his new office in my hands hear hear he is of course without resources and why because for  years having done his duty in a manner which never had been impeached having obtained reputa tion even in his modest career without soliciting promo tion ignorant tbat his aname was brought before the minis ter who could promote him lie was promoted for bis sheer merits and for his sheer merits alone and now unable to go back to the post which he filledfor that has naturally ofcourse been immediately given to anotherho finds himself in a position of honourable but absolute destitution hear hear i do not ask you to think of these things if it is for the public interest that they shouldoceurthey must occur if it is for the public interest that mr pigott should be placed in such a position he auust meet his fate but rmy lords there appears to me to be a niuch niore general a much deeper question for us to consider at this moment i have the opportunity of nowv addressiiig men snaniy of whom lave been iu the habit of transacting great affairs and who know and have felt the terrible re sponsibility of government my lords how many of you thero urq wko whim mlinisters of the crown aivge onccatsions felt that there is a special reason for appealing and a special object to be attained by appealing to some mem ber of the civil service and asking him to relinquish his post and take another for the public interest and the con venience and advantage of the government of the day  but can you appeal to a gentlemau in that position now if a resolution passed in a complete misapprebension of the facts lays downtheprinciple which i deplore to see expressed in the resolution to which i have referred i hear hear wvhy you might go to such a person and he would natu rally say  well i have a post of � or � a year and a prospect of the salary increasing by the constancy and assiduity of my labours you tempt me by an increased salary you tempt me by higher duties you touch the am bition natural to all men and you appeal to that public spirit which i say without exaggeration is a distinguish ingmark of the civil service of this country but if i accept the post what security have i thatparliament may not interfere with the executive in the performance of tho duty which has hitherto been regarded as the peculiar function of the executive hear hear and what guarantee have i that in order to assist the public interest or tho adwinistration of the day i may not find myself ab solutely destitute with a famaiy to provide for r hear hear it is open at any time for some body to get up in tho house of commons and say  i understand mir so and so is appointed to be controller we will say of the stationery offdce with � a year whso was only a clerk with a few hundred pounds before this is an infamous job i can prove to yoa that his father or the grandfather the brother or the nephew of this gentlemn was the election agent of a member of the presentcabnet and i call on you to de nounce this flagitious arrangement cheers mylords i would hope that the house of commons will consider this case in a different a mdder and a juzster spirit it is a ganerous a ssembly and i am convinced that had it been aware of the facts it never would have arrived at such a conclusion hear hear but if mir pigott is sacrificed i am equally at a loss to know how i can meet the wishes of the house of commons i cannot place at the head of the stationery department a person who is technically a printer or a stationer everybody who is consulted on the subject will give the same opinion  and i doubt not that your lordships on both sides feel that such an arrangement is not only absurd but is from the manner in which this office is organized utterly unnecessary for all special and technical information is at its service it was in my opinion a good appointment it was in my opiion an appointment which would have benefited the public service and i am sore that never was an appoint ment made with purer motives cheers my lords in these circumstances i have felt it my duty to make this explanation in vindication of my conducti do not say of the government because of course from the nature of things i am individually fesponsible i have acted from no motive of which i am in the least ashamed i have been influenced solely by a desire to advance the public interest and therefore i think your lordships will scarcely be surprised when i say that i cannot feel myself justified in accepting the resignation of mr pigott cheersearl granville said that the noble earl not having given any public or private intimation of his intention to make the interesting statement which their lordships had just heard it was not to be expected or wished that the house should now enter upon the consideration of what had occurred in another place he desired however to state his opinion that the noble earl had most naturally come forward believing that the house of commons had acted without a knowledge of the facts to give an explanation of the circumstances wvhich had lied to the appointment there could be no doubt that the proper mode of dispen sing patronage was one of the most important safeguards to the good government of the coantry he believed how ever that their lordships would think itbetter thenonot to discuss that case on its merits but to leave the house of commons to consider the statement which the noble earl had just made hearlord penzance said he had the honour to be chair man of the commission on army retirement to which the noble earl at the head of the government had alluded mr pigott was secretary of that commission which sat something like  months it had to go through a vast mass of details to group facts togetherto draw conclusions on particular cases and to place side by side with each other the claims of various classes of officers in the iu vestigation of those mattersthe commission had the as sistauee of mr pigott and his only object in rising on that occasion was to state that in his opinion a more assi duous a more intelligent or more capable man for the duties he had to discharge in connexion with the copmmis sion could not have been found than mr pigott and so far as he could judge that gentleman was fuuy capable of taking charge of a public department hear ve had great pleasure in testifying to his great ability and to his great success iu the work he undertookearl nortebrook wished also to mention that when he was at the wvar department mlr pigott filled the office of his private secretary doing his work to his entire satis faction as an able and excellent public servant he could of course express no opinion of the qualifications needed for the stationery office having no knowledge of its working or of the report of the select committee but he had felt it his duty to say what he knew in regard to mr pigottviscount card well did not rise to say anythiug in praise of ir pigott because he did not understand that anybody had cast any imputation on that gentleman in regard to the business he had discharged bnt he could also bear testimony to the faithful and efficient manner in which mr pigott performed his duty at the war office he discharged his duties most faithfully and most ably

was true that the conduct of the porte had expedited the war in former times russia had had some ground of compiaint against the porte for the nonfulfilment of trea ties but that was not the case at the present time it was not for the country which had fomented insurrection in bulgaria and which had thus indirectly brought about the atrocities to come forward to judge and chastise the porte for whatit it had done in selfdefence since the th of april this invasion of turkey by russia had been going on unrestricted except by the waters of the danube the armies of the porte and the insurrection in the cau casus such a state of things was not wholly satisfactory and the position of our government in the matter was one of considerable difficulty their attitude was that of men who were anxious to uphold existing treaties and their task was rendered the more difficult by the faint support and even open opposition from some of those with whom the treaties were entered into the objects of those who desired that the bosphorus should be held by a more en lightened and civilized power than the porte would scarcely be secured bythe successof the itussians in the present war as matters now
