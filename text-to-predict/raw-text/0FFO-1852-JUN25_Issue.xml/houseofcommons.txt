timemetropolitan burials compensationsoa the motion that the house go into committee to pass a resolution for compensation out of the consolidated fund to parties owners of burialgrounds which should be closed by virtue of this actlord ebrington said he should oppose the motion because no principle ha been laid down in support of this piopossi for compensation which ho contended if sauc tioned ought to be applied to provincial churchards as well aa to those of the metropolis and if the resolution were exteuded to themthe claim on the publi purse would be enormouslord j ianners said that it was not proposed to give compensation except in those cases where the secre tary of state should take upon himself to close the burial ground and as the secretary of state had no power under this bill to do so the objection did not applymr mackinion saw no necessity for giving compen sation to the owners of private grave yards wbich being already overcrowded with dead bodies had already amply remunerated the proprietors much to the detriment of the publio healthl lord j manners said compensation would not bo givou in cases where the grounds were overcrowded and could no longer be used with safety to the public healthmr humle objected to the principle of taxing the whole comminuoity for tho purposo of compensating cetain parties whose interests were supposed to be affected by a measure passed for the bonefit of the mettopolis onlymr t duncombe thought the proper course for the house to have taken would bave been to enact that after a certain day all these churchyards in and about the metro polis should be alosed giving the secretary of state a power to close any of them earlier upon its being shown thbit the public health required it he certainly did not approve of vesting so much authority in the secretary of state as it was proposed by the clause suggested by sir w moles worth to confer upon that public functionarysir w siolesworth said that every precaution was taken to prevent parties obtaining compensation who were not fuuy eutitled to iti mr g a hamilton said in the unavoidable absence of the chancellor of the exchequer he confessed he didnot know exactly what course to pursue the question no doubt was oue of considerable difficulty whether these compensations should be charged upon the consolidated funu he had sent to the chancellor of the exchequer and on the part of the treasury he mr haittlton wished or time to consider the subjectmr cabdwell considered this to be a uestio of great magnitude for it was inoless a question than this whether when a pubic abuse was to be removed by which private property would be affcted any such measure could be taken by the legislature without giving compensation to jtheparties whose interests were ciicerneout of the con aolideted fund this wa a question much too importaatto be determined by so thinly attendedaa house and at that period of the sessionafter a few words from sir j tylellmr walpole said ho had just received a communica tion from the chancelor of the exchequer who was of opinon that this clause ought to be opposed hear hearthe gallery was then cleared for a division but on our return we found that the motion had been negatived with out a division sir w moraswonth the proposer of the compensation clause not being able to obtain a tellersir w molesworth said he could ndt have antici pated such a result the noble lord lord j manners having expressed the assent of the crown to the clausethe lords amendments on the enfranchisement of copy holds bill were considered and agreed totee ameers of scindeon the order of the day for the adiournled debate on lord jocelyns motion for copies of the evidence and report of a commission appointed to inquire into a charge preferred againtst his ritghess meoer miimoerad haeer of upper scinde of having mnade fraudulent altertions in the treaty of normahar concluded between his highness and the late meer roostum klan and of all minutes aud correspondence on the indian records colinected with the chage and of the report on scinde of sir george clerk icb late go vernor of bombay dated the th day of april mr r baillie rose to continue the seech awhich was interrupted by the rising of the house at  oclook on wed neaday when the adjournment took place he was about to state that the government of iudia had taken steps to render the condition of the ameers as agreeable as it pos sibly could be in their fallen state so long ago as the th of febrpary  the governorgeneral in a minute on the affair of ali moorad expressed his earnest desire to show mercy to the fallen and to raise up from theirdestitute state the members of a family long royal who intheirper  so strikingly illustrated the vicissitudes of human for tune and declared he considered it his duty to submit the whole question of their condition to the court of directors a despatch was sent accordingly to which the court of directors replied expressmng a hope that the governorgeneral would be able to communi cate some satisfactory conclusion on the affair of the ameers on the th of november following the gover norgeneral in pursunace of that despateb made a com munication to the bombav government with respect to the amelioration of the condition of thoexiled ameers on the receipt of this letter the bombay government wrote to mr frere tho commissioner of scinde detailing the circum stances which had occurred and asking for information on the subject on the th of december mr frere replied and expressed hisopinion that the government might with perfeot safety agree not that the ameers should be endowed with any part of the ceded lands but that they miht re ceive a money payment mr frere also brought unaer the notice of the government the condition of some of theimeers family who had been placed under the protection of ali moorad who had illtreated and plundered them and he especially called attention to the state of the mother aud of the eldest son anieer roostum who were absolutely without the necessaries of life concluding with a suggestion that temporary assistance should be immediately afforded to them by the local authorities in scinde till some perma ment arrangement had been made by the government on the th of april last the governorgeneral sanctioned mr freres suggestion and proposal and that was thelatest information which the government had received from india on this subject he had now briefly given an outline of all the proceedings that had taken lace and he begged to add that he thought the rouse would agree there bad been no disinclination or backwardness on the part of the government at home or in india to render the condition of the ameers as agree able as it could be made under the circumstauces of their changed condition his noble friend in the course of his eloquent speech carried awfay by his feelings had repre sented the ameers as models of purity and innocence but with all his eloquence he mr baili did not think it was by any means a matter of course that because one of the ameers under our protection had turned out to be a rogue and a scoundrel that the dispossessed ameers wete honest and virtuous mon there had been very different state ments made about them and he would not pronounce any opinion as to who was right and who was wrong in the matter it was quite probable the ameers were like the average of other eistern princes but under all the circum stances he would be sorry to pronounce any decision on that point astothemotion of thenoblelordhe didmot in theleast find fault with it so far as regarded the existing condition of the ameers but he found fault with his having raked up and brought under the consideration of parliament a question of state policy which had been decided so far back as  a proceeding which lad tho most inconvenient effects in india s it naturally led the people of india to believe there was nothing final or secure in the decisions of parliament in such cases the government had no objec tion to the production of the minutes further than that they referred to past transactions and if the noble lord was dis posed to press for them the government would not object to lay them on tbe table while they thought it would be more prudent nos to do so as the production ofthese papers could lead to no useful resultcolonel estcourt in the absence of his noble friend could not do otherwise than urge the production of the ninntes as he knew the opinion of his noble friend was de cidedly in favour of their being laid before the house and the country tho story they heard had excited the atten tion of the house and he was anxious that the papers should be made public in a matter which he believed concerned the honour and justice of englandmir herries in the absence of the noble lord who had brought forward the motion would not make any observa tion upon it further than to repeat that the government had no objection to the production of the papers though they thought it would have been better had the motion not been made the report of the governor which was very voluminous and related generally to the administration of scinde seemed to have nothing to do with the other papers and the production of it would be quite unnecessarywould therefore be better not to include it in the return and to leave it to a future time if the noble lord was dis posed to press for it particularly as no mention had been made of it in the original motionmr rume had pressed for inquiry so far back as  and had since proved the government had been the dupes of artful and clever men though he believed a more con ecientious man aws prime minister never existed than sir r peel who no doubt honestly thought he was acting for the best he thought the house should have the fullest infor mation on this subject and therefore suggested in order to get at the proceedings of the indiahouse and of the num ber of dissents when the matter was under consideration that the word european should be inserted in the mo tion he regarded the ameers as our most faithful allies in the hour of daiger and must say never bad men been more cruelly andunjustly robbed he said nothing about their morahty but they had been politically faithful at the time of the most vital pinch our government in india had ever been exposed to when their turning round would have produced the most fatal consequences before he sat down he must express a hope tlere would be no garbling of docu ments the papers laid before the houso were but too often garbled and as an example of the mischief which thence ensued he might state that he wasiin possession of the original despatches of sir a burns while the govern ment had acted on those which were laid before parliament in an imperfect state if they had not been so confident and had attended to the perfec despatches he was satisfied the affghau war would never have occurredmr herries said he could not produce any papers be yond those included in the motion before the house andmr huzm having stated he would not press the matter in the state of the house not  members being present but would reserve it to a future day the motion after a few words from mr baillie disclaiming any imputation on lord jocelyn for inconsistency in the introduction of it was agreed to with the exception of the latter part referring to the governor of bombays reportpostal conventionsmr bell asked her majesty government as to the further progress of the negotiations for the reduction of the postage of letters between france and england and also in quired whether it was in contemplation to effecta general reduction of foreign postagemr g a hamilton replied that the negotiations re ferred to had commenced so long ago as  but had been suspended in november  they had however been renewed last february and had been conducted throughout with a desire to reduce the postage between the two coun tries as to the carriage of letters between france and the jnited states that was a question which now remained be tweeu the respective governments of the two countries ho assured the hon member the subject should not bo lost sight ofall the business on the paper having now been disposed of the house adjourned at  minutes past  to  o clmok tomorrow
