i the bioard of ctjtoms i he fomlowing is the ceport of the select com mittee of the house of comrgons on the board of customs  your committee having been appointed in march   and renewed this session to inquire into the constitution and management of the board of customs thought itight to examine firet on the general working of the department the chairman deputychairman and borme of the chief officers in london  your committee then pzoceeded to consider the several petitions referred to them the foremost of theae in number and respectabilit of signatures was that from the city of london prayins the adoption of  such measure as might seem best for directing a full inquiry into the rules practie and management of the customs with a view to their reconstruction and better adaptation to tho altered circumstances of trade and the extending commerce of the country but your committee determined to hear evidence first on the petitions from the london and st rathirine dock companies because the charges brought therein wero of a specific nature aud involved serious imputations againbt the department of customsb your committee was prevented from making foil in quiryinto the facts of the cases in disputo between theustoms and the dock companies by the termination of the session which precluded your committeo from taling the evidence of the practical officers concerned in the inves tigations and seizures made at the docks the only wit nesses therefore examined were the respective clirmen secretaries solicitors and superintendents of the two doclis on the one side and the chairman and solicitor of the board of customson the other with the exception of only one practical offeicer who appeared to produce samples an was merely examined thereon various written state ments by subordinate officers of the customa were lid before the committee but the officers themselvea were not examined your committee therefore will confine them selves to a narrative of such facts as appear to be eata blished bsufiicient evidence  the london dock which was commeiced about the year  has now a capital of  and an area of  acres received in the year  shipping of  tons containing  packages of the value as estimated by the sulperintendent of   exclusive of duty and employs on an average  men  the st katharine dock was commenced in the year  and has an area of  acres  the directors of both companies are generally selected among the mercantile body from those who being the largest importers of goods can give the greatest amount of business and are consequently much interested in prevent ing the abstraction of their own property it has neon eetimated by oue competent witness mr john cattley chairman of the london docks that be fore the establishment of those docks the pilferage amounted to  per cent on all goods imported by another that the annual average loss on west india produce alone was  to the crown and   to the proprie tors while one of the most experieucea officers cf the cus toms states that the discharging of vessels in the docks is a great security to the revenue  your committee find that certain privileges have been conceded to the docks in london under which cargoes are taken iinto their warehouses and certain operations per formed thereon before the landing account is taken by the customs officers the companies are also intrusted with the subsequent deliveries of goods from the warehouses oc casionally without the presence or intervention of customs lockers these arrangements have been attended with ad vantage both to the crown and the dock company on the one hand a couniderable saving haa been effected by the crown in the employment of officers whilst on the other the delivery of eoids to the merchant has been greatly faci litated tho receilpt and cutody of the goods being entirely placed in the hands of the doek companies  it is hardly necessary to remark that any general auspicion of the integrity of these companies excited in foreign traders would not only be a great blow to this country as a commercial entrepot in competition with such towns as antwerp and hambargh but would materially affect the confidence reposed by the crown in those establishments it is therefore satisfactory to find that the board of customs have throughout acquitted the directors of these companies of all suspicion or personal kdowledge of the irregularsties into which they considered it their duty to nquire information of frauds and irregularities in the st katharine docks was first given to the customs in septem ber  apiparently by some of those employed by the dock company but not acted on till the th of december in that year when in consequence of further information a surveyorgeneral and a number of officers attended by the superintendent of the dooks but without any previous in timation to the directors proceeded to search the localities indicated by the information this search resulted in the seizure of seven casks of suar alleged to have been fraudu lently picked or adulterated with the view of admission at the lower duty on molasses and in the detention of sundry packages of other goods most of which packages were found to be sweepings  sweepings and scrapingswhen not good enough to be brought to the importers account have been always con sidered the perquisites of the different dock companies and recognized as such by the customs when submitted to them for inspection and assessment for duty those from sugar are delivered ata fixed price to a contractor those from other articles are periodically put up for public sale by the st katharines dock company but generally exported by the london dock company on their own account the net average annual profit to the st katharines dock company has been stated to be  and the loss by goods aban doned as not worth the rent   the fdrst search was followed by various others and resulted in the seizure of dutiable goods worth  s id and free goods worth  s d on the ground of their not having been brought by the dock com pany to account on the crowns books and therefore also ab stracted from the importers irrespective of the results of a subsequent general stocktaking this took place in sep tember u but some time before lord john russell and sir charles wood as heads of the treasury had been ap pealed to by a deputation of the directori and refused to in terfere the latter gentleman stating that great frauds had been discovered the seizure werereturned into thecourt of exchequer on three indentures of appraisement which were subsequently divided by the crowns counsel into  informations besides these proceedings an additional in formation was filed for arrears of duty notice of trial was given in ten of the informations for forfeitures for february  but the trial did not take place in consequence of the length of time occupied by a similar prosecution of the lon don dock company  the amount of expense to the crown has been  os d inclusive of subsistence money  s d up to june  paid weekly in sums of s to o to  servants of the dock company after their discharge besides some remuneration while still in its employment three of whom accompanied the officer in the search instituted on the th of april  it appears from a subsequent let ter of the solcitor of customs that these witnesses would in the usual course have received onethird of the share of the forfeitures accruing to the seizing officers  these proceedings were eventually closed in no vember  on the application of the dock company and admission by them that irregularities had occurred of a description to afford grounds for investigation by the com missioners of customs and the understanding that the directors would be ready to cooperate in the adoption of such regulations as might appear requisite to prevent a re currence of the irregularities which had taken place  where upon it was agreed with the sanction of the treasury that upon payment of a fine of  all the informations should be withdrawn and the goods delivered up to the company on boing properly brought to accoumt with the crown the law as to the questions at issue between the crown and the dock company is thus left quite uncertain although the chairman of customs considers it one of the greatest importance to the revenue with the exception of a case of nutmegs no proof has been given of the removal of any goods from the st katharines docks without the pay mont of duty underthese circumstances your committee have not preceeded with tho injuiry during the present session in the case of the london dock company the secretary of the company had an interview with the chair man of customs on the  of march  when the latter expressed himself satisfied with the management of the dock on the th of the same month information was re ceived by the customs that lcwt of rice ex the eliza and kesten were lying in the dock in excess of entry and  tons of pepper in warehouse  besides a general allegatioi ab to otner goods  on the th a surveyorgeneral with a letter from the board of customs requesting the cooperation of the company proceeded with other officers to make inquiry at two of the warehouses the result of which was the doten tion ofp ac cationsiatinglof about  tons of various counsel or thoa rw i io deid whihifomaikicnds of goods alleged not to have been brought to account with the crown for duty this seatch was followed by others in a similar manner and extensive seizures woermade which formed the subject of a long correspondence between the board of customs and the dock company af firming on the one hand and denying on the other the ex istence of the irregularities and in the month of june the board of trado and treasury were appealed to by the dock compan toinquire into the wholo case and to meditate but deelinedto interfere  on the st of august the goods seized under cir cumstances similar to those at the stxatharinesdockswere ordered by the customs to be returned into the court of exchequer the value of those liable to duty being  is d and those free of duty  os d and subsequenutly a general stocktaking took plaeo the result of which appears to have been quite satisfactory the average annual net income of the dock com pany from sweepingsis  the goods returned into court were conprised in three indenture which as in the caso of the st katha rines docks were divided by counsel into  informations in addition to which there were three informations for du ties alloged to have been evaded the penalties on the differ ent counts of which were laid at  these informations contained no particulars suffi cidnt to iudicate the procie goods included in eacb aud the solicitor of customs refused to give the further particulars required for the defence excepting on condition that the seizures should be admitted to have beon made as laid in the counts the solicitor for the london dock company then applied to a judge at chambers for au order for particulars of the goods embraced in each of the  idformations an order was accordingly made by the judge on subsequent motion in the court the order was enlarged on the understanding that the officers of customs and of the dock company should go to gether to the docks in order that the former might point out to the latter the particular goods included in each in formation   notice of trial was served in january  on  informations and till the night before the trial theo counsel for the crown did not decide which information would be taken firstc the trial of only one information lastedl  days and ended in a verdict for the crown on foir counts relat inigto two boxes of sugar on the vround of fraudulent concealmenat but not with the intention of evading the pay mnent of duty and for the dock company ou the other soven counts the jury coupling with that verdic shbe recommendation that greater strictnessshould be exbt cieedby the londondock compariywithregardtotheir subordinate officers as they thought that many irregulari ties had occurred the crown first and the dock company after wards disputed the verdict whichled to an argiment ia the court of exrhequer in june  as to what consti tuted the due warehousing of goods within the meaning of the law no judgment hasbeen given oi this point a com promise having been effected early in november following under circumstauces and coiditions similar to those ir the case of the st katharines docks that compromiseag recommended by the customs to the treasury was the payment of a nominal fine fixed by the latter board at  the release of the goods seized and their entry in the crovns books and an admision by the dock company that in respect to somo of the goodslegal grounds for seizure existed it has been stated by the dock company that tho cost of the ieal proceedings to them cannot have been ls than oa they cost the crown  s d inclusive of subsistencemoney amounting to  ss lod to the th of june  paid to  persons who had beenoin the employ of the dock company  no goods are proved to have been removed from the first dock without paymaent of duty excepting in three instances in the case of trifling articles pilfered the duty on which amounted in two years to  s id a conviction of three perions a robbery of prbper from thel dock which involved a loss to the revenue of  and a case about black stuff which will be noticed later your committee find that on one former occasion seizures of magnitude were made by the customs in the london docks in the year  upon information of a similar nature goods of the value of  were seized and re turned into the court of exchejuet for prosecution in that instance the treasury ultimately consened to their restora tion on payment of a fine of  per cent on the value of the goods together with the expenses inurred by the crown amounting to  s pd and upon further condition that the whole of the goods unrecrdedrinthe vooks of thecrown shoald be cleared either for home consmnption or be ex ported within a period of  months  for the reasons already assigued with reference to the stkatharinea docksyour committee have not resumed their inuiry into the london dock cases  your committeehave given the detail of the st katharine and london dock cases upon evidence satisfac tory to the committee and conclude this branchlof their in quiry with the expression of a hope that simqilar collisions aind disagreements between parties whose friendly coopera tiou is so advantageoustothe trade of the countrymay never again occur  during the contest between the customi and the dock companies proceedings were taken against several parties servants of the companies and others your com mittee bave not inquired into all these cases but upon those which they have investigated they feel bound to report thefirst is the case of thomas chandlerthe superin tendent or local head of the london dock at a salary of  per aunum on a specific floor appropriated solely to sugaraquantityofwhatwas called  black stuff hadaccumu lated consisting of oil from the truckwheels lime sawduat dirt off mens shoes and the sugar sweepings of the main gangway estimated by professor brande who attended to examine it at the request of the london dock company at  per cent of the whole quantity previous to  ithad been thrown on the dirthheap as has been always done at the west india docks but in that yeara scumboiler offered to buy it aud on a contract at a to s per cwt it was delivered to him and stated to produce a net annual income of  s  the delivery in casls took place at the principal loophole of the floor opposite the customs lockerbox on an order signed by the dock officers first for black sweet ings and subseguently for black su r sweepings it is positively denied by the officers of the customs that they ever sanctioned or knew of this delivery of this black stuff on the other hand an officer admits that ho tasted it on one occasion and left it without further observation but stated that he did not know whether the cask had been de livered  casks in all were delivered  on the th may  the customs wroto the dock company that sweepings and scrapings of sugar had for a long time been delivered without payment of daty and to inquire under what authority that practice had been pursued the directors proceeded to male inquiry on the subject and answered the letter with an explanation on the th of jane but the board of customs having received furtber information identifying the parties implicated and no reply having been received from the company they on the a of juno institutea proceedings against mr chandler richard randall the inspector and slx of their subordi nates for the illegal removal of  casks consisting of  tons of sugarscrapings allegod to have been delivered at various times without the knowledge of the customs offi cers a judges fiat for the arrest of these several parties was obtained upon affidavits of fact laid before him whero upon an omficer of customs called upon mr chandler at the docks explained to him the nature of tho charge set forth in the warrant on which he was desired to arrest him and accompanied him to the companys solicitors where an un dertaking was given for himself and the seven others who were included in the information but who wero not arrested the penalties alleged to have been incurred by these parties wero  for every offence or separato de livery in which each of them had been concerned or  in the whole but the sum in which they were re spectively hold to bail was   on the th of july information was filed against them in the court of exchequer eventually an analysis of a sample furnished by the dock company and stated to be similar to the article delivered to the contractors was agreed upon the result wasthatout ofcwt of serapings  cwt  ars b proved to be molasues on the th of august tfie dock company consented to pay the duty upon condition that the proceedings against their servauts should be abandoned this the board of customs declined reserv ing to themselves the right of dealing with the case upon its own merits the dock company then paid the duty amounting to  os d under protest since that date the black stuff not being worth the duty so charged has been destroyed as before  the informations against mr chandler and eight others were not it the same time withdrawn a rule to plead was served on their solicitors by the customs on the d of november notice of trial on the d of january  countermanded on the th three days before the sitting of the court and the proceed ings were kept open till the final compromise between other parties viz the customs and the london dock company took place in november last the solicitor of the customs stating on the d of july that it would have been prema ture to abandon these proceedings pending the general ones between the board and the company the next case relates to the st katharines docks on the th of april  officers of cuistoms detained in the st katharine dock a ceak of molasses weighing b the duty on which would have been s because no account of it could be given and becausa they considered it to be falsely marked three weeks later the broad arrow was put on it on the th of may the cask was taken out of the vault where it lay by ten officers and labourers of the dock company and the greater part of the contents transferred to six casks ex the edmonstone which were deficient of the landing quantity it is alleged by these officers but denied b the customs that the one cask formed originally part of the six and that to allow for fer mentation it was necessary to draw out a part of the six the duty on which had been undoubtedly paid some time before at the landing weight on the th of june the board of customs ordered these ten persons to be indicted before the grand jury for felony in stealing bqolb of mo lasses the property of the queen the grand jury found a true biu against four who wero the directing officers the others being labourers and of the four one was a principal warehouseman josepa lean who had served the dock company  years and the others had been engaged with it from  to  years the preliminary iuquiry before a magistrate almost invariably adopted in other cases was not had reeourse to by the customs and the psoners were thus deprived of the advantages of hearing and knowing the evidenee against them of crossexamining the witnesses and of havimg thereon the decision of the magistiute which mtght have stopped the whole case in linine your comn mittee areinformed that this was in accordance with the in vaiable practice of the board of customs in criminal cases but are dsposed to think that such a practice is to say the least of very questionable propriety the four petsons hav ing been arrested at the docks on the th of june on the eharge of felony were held to bail in the contral criminal court no previous notification of any kind had been given to them the attorneygeneral was then irst consulted and moved the case which would otherwiso have come on for trial at the old bailey abouat the th of july by certiorai into the court of queens benea in consequence it could not come on for trial until november onthe th of that month the solicitorof customs gavopoieo raly threcae was ormtin upr file thte solicitors bfthe prisoners at an expense of about  and when they vent into court on the th of november to defend the prisoners they found the record to have been withdrawn and afterwards received notice from the solicitor of customs that the trial had been postponed the effect of this i proceeding was to discharge the beil of the prisoners but the crown still reserved its right to serve a fresh notice of trial a nolk prosequi not having been entered and thel charge of felony was thus kept suspended over the four offi cers till november  when it was included in the com promise of the civil suits pending between the customs and the dock company  the third case concerns six labourers of tho st katharines dock company  there is a dustbin to each warehouse opea to all the servants of the establishment as well as to tho customs officers and empted twice aweek by the parochial cou tractor mamed estley the officers of the customs re ceived information that a quantity of cofee had been con veyed in his carts and to his premises without paynent of duty and accompanied by a policeman they searhled his premises on the th of june  but found oal a quarter of a pound for family use but were afterwad intormed that lcwt had been removed that morning in july further information was received as to the removal of pepper and other goods as well as coffee the customs preferred informations against westley and two other persons out of the docks and six labourers in the docks giving the com pany notice beforehand of their iitention to do so  on the th of september the six labourers iwere arrested on penalties for smuggling to the extent of  and in the flrst instance the dock company not boing sa tified of their innocence refused to bail them and oae remained in prison three weeks the others beiug bailed by their own friends subsequently at the endof october the solicitors to the dock company were instructed to defend them as no real charge could be traced by

officea some of the commissioners have beenrorto their appointment in the service of the crown without wishing to limit to the discretion of the govern ment in appointing on their responsibility to offices of such importance yourecommittee wrould merely urge that suchappointments ought to be made with a scrupulous rezardi to thetpossession of the requisite qualifications of abiitand experience and not so much froun political or personal considerations as has hitherto been too often the casemany of the witnesses have strongly urged the advan tage whinh would result from selecting some members of the board of customs from tho mercantile body and your committee are of opinion that the appointment of at least one such commissioner provided he be otherwise fully qualified would tend to inspire confidence among the mer cantile community in the administration of the depart ment of customs it has been further suggested that theo onstitution of the board would bo improved by the introduction of a superior practical oflficer your comittee do not ques tion that among the superior oficers of the customs someomay be td some have been foundqualifiedfor the higher duties of eommissioneer and that to such men the promotion inieht from time to time be beneficially extendedsome witnesses have suggested that the board of cs tomg should have a more independent action than it at pre sent possesses and that the law under which the commis sioners are disqualified from sitting in the house of com mons shouild be repealed so that one commisioner should have a seat in parliamentitis not for your committee to express an opinion as to this proposed alteration of the law  it involves political considerations of no small importance not applying ex clusively to the board of customs and must therefore in theiadgment of your committee be left to the deciaion of the present commissioners have ten to  weeks holy days annually which appear excessive your committee advise that a minute ofthe treasury datedthedofliarch  based on the recommendation of the commnisioners of inguiry in that year and in  enjoining them to visit the different docks and wharfs in london where business was transacted with a view of judging for themselves of the character of their officers and what rules and regulatious should be issued ought to be carried out although temorarily suspened dturing therent controversy with the oeks complaints have been made to your committee of the inaccessibility of the commissioners this is denied by them and it appears dedrable that the denial should become generally known so as to enable the public in futuxe to profit by the facility of seeing the boardappozrrnn t and promotion or orficersho original appointments in the customs department emrace saix classes there does not appear to be much dif ference in the original examination and probation for them all but the last five classes can never rise to the first and lockors in particular hold situations of very great respon sibility and are freqdontly employed as landing waiters your committee seeno reason why in thecase of meritorious officers the exdusion should be continued but every transfer from one class or even grade to another should be accom panied by a strict examination the general pay of the officers does not appear to be too large but this brings your committee to the consideration of fnes ad satisfactionsup to  the board of inland revenue divided the half of all penalties with the informer its own officer this being found to act against the credit of the witness an act was passed in that year appropriating the whole to the crown but the treasury sain allows part of the fund thus created to be distributed among deserving officers without reference to the seizures theymay have made the practice at theo customsis different the officers detaininggoods for wrong entry get the whole fines imposed which amount in london to an average of  por annum divided among them aud a large proportion of all seizures and atisfactions in   s d were received by the cus toms for all seizures fines penalties or satisfactions and  s d were divided among  officers it is ad mitted that this has a tendency to make them too strict in the execution of their duty and occasionally causes vex atious delay to the merchant your committee recommend therefore that the practice of the board of inland re venue be adopted and that the meritorious officer should look chiefly to promotion as his rewardad valonuat dutiesconclasive evidence has been furnished both by mer ciants and officers of customs to your committee that these duties however good in theory operate badly in practice the gross amount of them in  vas only l while during the samo period the number of seizures was  keeping up a greater staff of officers than would be otherwise necessary and giving great trouble to the board which has to decide on the market value of so many differont articles by law if the crown stop goods for undervaluation it has to pay the im porter  per cent over the value he puts on them it then puta them up to public sale frequently divided into such small lote as must affect most injuriously the retail trader and notwithstanding this precaution the loss to the crown for the port of london alone thereon was in   s d while the detaining officers who get half of any profit but are subjected to no share of loss received  s d your committee are of opinion that the num ber of articles subject to ad valoreim duties may be largely reduced with advantage to trade and without material loss to the revenue and with respect to any which must neces sarily be retamed it appears advisable to adhere to the orders some time since issued by the board of customs which direct that previous to the absolute seizure of articles for
