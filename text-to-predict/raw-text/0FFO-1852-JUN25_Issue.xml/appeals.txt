conformity with the respective notices of motion or of some of them uponu hich the sid orders respectively were foundedat the conclusion of the arguimentthe lord chancetloir said that their lordships would leave two questions for the opinions of the learned judges to the effectfirst whether as lord chancellor cottenham was interested as a shareholder to the extent of some thou sands of pounds in this caial he had the power to sit as judge in this case next whether the decrees or orders or both of the vicechancellor seeing that learned judge acted under the authority of the lord chancellor could for the same reason be sustained and thent whetheras the lord chancellor cottenbam was so much interested in the canal company his lordships own judgments and orders and those of the vicechancellor taken together could be sustained or whether those of either could taken alone be sustainedmr baron parke asked until saturday for the judges to codsider their opinionthe delay asked was conceded and the further considera tion of the case was therefore adjourned to saturday next
