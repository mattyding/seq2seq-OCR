think it right thata description of the oxford commemoration should be closed without some allusion to the ati neal pamphlets aud smaller squibs whiclx the ca sion has called forth many of the jokes are so purely local that it would answer no purpose what ever to extend the knowledge of them eyondthe preoincts ofoxford but some bfthem are sufficiently general in their application to be looked at with in terest even in our metropolisthe most importaut of au is a dramatic pamphlet entitled scenes from an wnfinished drama entited phronfsterion and written by a clever advocate of the old school for the purpose of  showing up the oxford commission it is evidently intended as an imitation of the  clouds of aristophanes and though the author has started with a parallel at tde beginning which he does not maintain t the closeforthe commissionersocrates is but afeeble reproduction of the son of sophroniscushe shosa considerable vigour in the management of those metres which have been employed with so mach success in the english translations of aristophanes and also great command of a branch of know ledge not much cultivated at oxford a fa vorite mode of attack here is to show that the proposed ujniversity reforms will lead to an importation of german heterodoxy and the follow ing  hymn to the infinite embodying the phraseology of the schools of schilling and hegel and supposed to be uttered by a chorus of teutonic professors is an excellent specimen of its kindthe voico of yorewhich tho breezes borewailing aloud from paxos shore is changed to a gbladder and livelier strain for
