hungary proper after a short tour in the temesher banat on the th the monarch was already on his way to grosswardein the news paper reports are so full of bombast and fustian that it appears advisable to suppressthem altogether and simply to inform you that it does not admit of a doubt that the emperor has been so extremely wellre ceived that the antiaustian party in hungary must fain look upon the game as lost the different progresses between czegled and temes war were performed with such extraordinary speed that the imperial guard was completely dis tanced and the monarch was at last accompanied only by his aidesdecamp and servants and here and there a bodyguard of wellmounted rough riding peasants on the th the dnpcror was re ceived on the frontiers of the bannat voivodinaby the civil and military governor count coronini who before the revolution was one of the tutors of tbe imperial princes the correspondent of the ost deutsche post nforms us that the polyglot population of the voivodina received the sove reign with the greatest show of loyalty it ap pears that at temeswar it was principally the germans and bervians who did homage in the audiencehall  as hardly more than  hungarian uniforms were to be seen  but in the streets the hungarian eljen was not less loud than the vivat of the german and the zivio of the scla vonic races afterthe emperorhadlaidthefounda

the people to innovations which for the moment appear unbearable on the th the sentence in contumaniaim of five persons was published and put into execution in lermannstadt for englishmen there is

the same subject the balance sheets will be published as heretofore ex cepting that they will appear twice instead of four times a year the system pursued by m de baum gartner appears to answer so well that many persons who have long cofsidered the finances ofthiscountry as past redemadton inow begin to think  a cure possible if the efforts of the finance minister are properly seconded by the war department it is believed that the behaviour of the hungarians during the visit of the monarch will much contribute to a reduction of the army as it has become evident that such a large body of troops has ceased to be necessary in that province i am credibly informed that the balance sheet for  will be published as soon as it has been signed by the emperor in whose bands it now is the

large portfolio it was obliged to keep be fore the new loan was contracted and if it is so there can be no great harm done but if the government is making the slightest sa crifice in order to lower the rate of exchange it is certainly committing a great bluuder as no ar tificial means can make a lasting improvement the unusually great demand for foreign bills arises from the increasing disproportion between the export and import trade of austria the former is a mere nothing while the latter has in creased enormously within the last few months it may not be out of place to observe that a gen tleman whose opinion is worthy of great con fidence appears convinced that the balance sheet of  will exhibit a very extraordinary ituprove menta vast degree of unnecessary importance is cer tainly attributed to m de heckerens journey to austria and prussia it is absurd to suppose that the allied powers have given any positive pledge to the president nor is it to be presumed that the latter has put the direct question of i what will your policy be should i act in this or that manner  or that he would receive a straightforward reply should he do so few persons not even excepting the omniscient paris correspondent of the lloyd have enjoyed more favourable opportunities of hear ing the knotty point of to be or not to be emperor discussed than myself and my conclusion is that should louis napoleon chooso to have him self elected or proclaimed emperor none of the great powers would feel itself authoiized to inter fere in the matter but that one andall have resolved that should he like his uncle attempt to found a new dynasty in europe be shall also share his fate this language will perbaps be too plain for soine parties but as i feel convinced of its truth i een

to the demand of how things were on change this morning the concise reply was  unpleasant the meaning of this is that the finance depart ment has given little on london and held back the usual supply

the purport of the darmstadt protocol bf the th of april  the carrying of which into effect would decidedly injure the material prosperity of the land and place in doubt the further existence of the zollverein the last national bond of connexion in germany that the chamber hopes the government has reserved the assent of the chambers to the alliance and compact in ques tion and lastly that the chamber will petition the government to use all its efforts to effect the reestablishment of the zollverein with prussia and all the states of north germany as soon as possible and only after it is reestablished to consent to a commercial alliance with austria the motives or grounds of these resolutions are given at consider able length the majority of the committee con demn the coalition against the zollverein as unwise generally and on the part ofthehessian government as unjust as it has been the oldest ally of prussia in commercial questions and is interested in con tinuing so from its geographical position it ascribes the coalition less to a zeal for the material welfare of the states who are parties to it than to a feeling of jealousy of prussia for concluding the commercial alliance with eauover and the steuer verein alone a step for which the coalition is a kind of revenge the present course it is added of opposition to prussia may protract the negotiations for the renewal of the zollverein to an indefinite length but will by no means lead to a decision an swerahl to the expectations of the south german statel fer adducing various facts respecting the fobarative consumption of colonial and other foreign produce from which the chief part of ihe revenue of the zollverein is derived to prove that austria could not for many years to come contri bute a fair shaie to the general treasury the docu ment concludes as follows we mnust therefore assume that other aud political rea sons have caused the coalition and we fear that the smaller states will again as in all cases it is inevitable they should do will suffer by it we admit that it must be disagree able to be the secoad in rank in an alliace instead of the first and we doubt not that there might be a certain satis faction in an union to which two powera equally great are parties between whom differences could not but arise to be in the position of a mediator as the third import ant power between them we think therefore the efforts of bavaria to escape from the firat position amad to prepare the way for placing itself in the second as natural but as this opportunity appears now only at a remote distance eavaria wishes to preent us in the mean time with a zollverein on a small scale in order apparantly to hold in it the position held by prussis in the present one and of which several of the states but more especialy eavaria have complainedthe official report of the berlin wool fair which began on the th states that the wboe quantity of wool brought in for sale was  ccntners nearly
