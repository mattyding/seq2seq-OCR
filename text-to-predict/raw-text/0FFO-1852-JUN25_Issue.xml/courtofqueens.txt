succession of lord campbells friends the area of the court�room the passages and the galeries were crammed with barristera ittorneys reporters divines itilian re fugees papiits iantipapists and two or three adventurdus ladies human faces might beaeen dimly peering through obwure fanlights to obtain a glimpse however imperfect of what was going on mad altogether the proceedings of this remaikable case were conducted to a close amid an amount of interest now seldom witnessed in westminsterball and whichseemed to revive somewhat of the spirit of the olden times when protestantism was still struggling for its as cendancysir a commxnu addressed the jury for the defendant iduring a period of four hours and in a speech which was liatened to throughout with breathless attention we can only give a summary of it aud cannot hope to convey in that imperfect form more than a very faint idea of the ner vous eloquence by which it was characterized it is very ruely indeed nowadagys that our courts of justice are so thoroughly roused from their habitual state of dull repose and some difficulty was experienced in suppressing thespon taneous bursts of applause with which thehighest efforts of the advocates forensic powera were received he said that although the case had occupied such a length of time and the jury had probably already formed some opinion upon the question he trusted they would listen with attention to the observations which he would make andwhich he would condense as much as possible consistently with the due dis charge of his duty the case had now assumed an aspect of deep and painful interest he sir a e cockburn could not be expected to feel any religious sympathy with dr ntewman but he confessed that he did feel sympathy for him as his client and stil more that justice might be done in his case the question was not now whether dr achilli hadbeen ursjustlyandwantonly assailed but whether gross and deliberate perjury had not been committed in the evidence which had been given on the one side or on the ether the women who had come forward and stated that it was drachilli who robbed them of their virtue could not be mistaken nor could dr achilli after whatever lapse of time and however licentious a libertine he mighthave been have forgotten when time and place aud circumstances were all brought to his attention the mother who said she assailed himin the street for having been the ruin of her cbild must either have spoken the truth or have wickedly invented the whole story it would be for the jury to determine and in forming their judgment they would bring to the case calm and dispassionate nminds and not assume the truth onthe one side or on the other he sir a e cockburn was aware that every attempt would be make by his learned friend the attorneygeneral to prejudice the witnesses called by the defendant and iu ad dition to that advantage which his learned friend had he had to answer instead of being answered and that before a jury who would offer a congenial hearing to his oratory but he did not despair in the strength of what he believed to be true and with that confidence he shoula proceed to compare the evidence on both sides and to explain the grounds upon which he should call upon the jury to believe that the trtuth was on the side of dr newman he should go through the various epochs of his life since he was educated as a gentlt man became a monk and lived at viterbo capua naples rome where ho got into the inquiition and afterwards at corfu zante and malta till he came to england to begin with viterbo a witness had been called who in an art less manner had stated that dr achilli was the occasion of her seduction she said she was servant in a country house near viterbo that on one occasion she walked out with him and that afterwards he got her into the convent where she might have thought she would be protected by the sacredness of the place and debauched her was that true dr achilli had had every opportunity of investi gating the life of this woman who was now married he knew some months ago that her name was elena valente and no blame whatever was now cast upon her but she stood blameless and unimpeachable it would be said that she had been brought forward under the inifluence of the priests that she was told it would be for the glory of god and of his church to come and state what she knewv that it was a story got up by the priests to put down dr aehilli and much would no doubt be said of the arts of the jesuits of pious frauds commaitted for the advancement of the roenan catholic religion andof the doetrine that the sacredness of ithe end justified the un holiness of the means but that was a twoedged sword which cut both ways then they would be told of italian perfidy bat that too was a twoedged sword lvho aud what was dr achilli was he not an italian was he not educated by the jesuits m all the arts and artifices at tributed whether truly or not to that community  he was a subtle disputant an ingenious easuist the jury saw him in the box they saw his physiognomy and he asked them if they had seen him in a mnonks cowl would it not bave struck them that he answered the character attri buted to such persons if dr achilli was an italian monk and priest he thought he was entitled to claim for these simple peasants at leastequal eredit therewasanothertestof veracityviz the interest of the parties who got into the box what interest could these women have in coming forward to expose their own disgrace could they believe that dr newman would suborm witnesses to come here to lay the guilt of perjury upon their souls  however much we might differ from dr newman there could be no imputation upod his honourandintegrity but was there no interest upon the other side everything which dr aehilli had in the world was at stake aud no doubt a strong appeal would be made to their sympathy upon that ground all hope of honour and preferment in the roman catholic church was gone for ever his only hope was as a teacher of that religion which he had adopted and if his character failed there was an end to all his prospects the immense interest which he had at stake woula therefore lead them to consider well before they came to the conclusion that the defendants witnesses were perured in the case of elena valente look at the unscrupulous character of the man he said he never visited any gentili in the neighbourhood of viterbso but it turned out that the wife of one of the christofori whom he admitted he did visit was dead and his widow wasa gentili andit was a known fact that married women often passed by their maiden name initaly so that this incident tended not only to confirm the young womans testimonywhenshesaidshe nrst saw dr achili at the house of a lady named  gentili but it also showed the casuistry of dr achidi when he denied that he ever visited a family of the name of gentili in the country near viterbo the next chapter in ths history was at capua and the next at naples ac cording to the evidence of the girl principe she went into the church of st pietro il martyro to pay some money and drachimi took the opportunity of getting ber into the sacristy and there ravishing her she was found with child and the father and mother both addressed dr achilli in the streets with remonastrances and anger as the author of their daughters shame the father was now dead but the mother and daughter had been produced in courtand had sworn to these facts were these delusions  or were the witnesses not to be believed because they were italians and roman catholics dr achilli had looked with contempt on them both and said he never saw them before but their evidence was corroborated by the papor which had been produced with dracbillishandwriting upon it andbv bis ownadmissionthathesometimesreceivedtheimoney which was paid at the ehureh was it to be imagined that these two witnesses were perjured  if dr achilli could not go to viterbo he could go to naples but no imputation whatever was cast upon the character of these witnesses it was a remarkable circumstance that these poor people did not spare dr a chiui when he ws going ong the streets in all the pomp of the procession with the monks  but still more though he was the prior of a convent the charge was spread abroad that he had decoyed a virgin child into the sacristy and there ravished her that was a charge too serious tobe hushed up even at naleaes where dr achillisaid if a priest conformed to his religius duties he might lead what life he pleased the matter was brought before thepolice dr achilisaidhe didnot go buthis friends did and why to silence the voice of the poor woman dr achilli said he was indifferent to the charge could the jury believeit the charge beng that he ravished a child in the sacristy almost within the very walls of the church itself thepolice did take the matter up although at naples there would be every disposition to protect a priest the father and mother were several times heard before the police and then thcaseowassentto take its course dr achilli pretended that he treated the whole matter with indifference and went away onwhthe termed his sacred mission and he nowr camne forwyard to fix indelibly upon the brows of those whom he had dishonoured the guilt and brand of perjury the next case was at corfn and was connected with the story of garamonis wife the entire question on this part of the case depended on oral testimony it was proved by the evidence of two witnesses that garamoni believed his wife was unfaith ful and watched her house �t night and found dr mebilli in the passage one of these witnesses russo bad been in some scrapes and had got into prison bat there was nothing strongly to impeach his eviaence on the other hand dr achili and madame garamoni contra dicted each other the former said mfadame called him across the stveet to speak to him and ask some questions while madame said she was at the window and had not spoken when her husband came in the fact was that garamonis mother had slept in another part of the house and it was pretended that ehe had gone to bed andaleft this young woman up at  oclock at night to ask some ques tions of dr achilli which she might just as well have asked in the morning it was admitted that garamoni bad abused dr achilli and said dr achilli he pushed me into the house obsequious convenient hus band why did he abuse dr achilli why did he astaualt him why waa there a struggle if nothing had been done  to exeite the jealousy of the taior tho nnt eas

before that time he pro bably never thoughl of protestants but as heretics who ought to be burnt but when told that he had to perform certain ceremonies and to make responses ho was ready enough to undertake the part dr achilli bad talked of the religion of the hoad and the heart and he sir a e cockburn admitted that there was a religion of the head and the heart where true religion combined both where faith inthe inner recesses of the heart went in unison with the intellect whichgod had given but there was also the religion of tie breeches pocket which people ossessee when they were turned out of the roman cathoe rchor rice rerad and which others were sometimes silly enough to believe proceeded from conscience mr reynolds ex postuilated with dr achilli for taking such parties into his service tellinghim that the woman had been a prostitute withthe knowledge ofherhusband hisreply wasthat it was indifferent tohimwhattheirchartersz were so lone as they behaved well inbis house dr chilli now deniea thatmr reynolds ever had remonstrated uutil hedr achilli had remonstrated with mr reynolds for being ad dicted to intoxication he also denied the familiarities with that woman although mr reynolds swore that he several times observed them from his window and was confirmed in his evidence by a young woman who was living vith him at the time as his servant an attempt had beea made to depreciate mr reynolds evi ience by reading tvo foolish letters which he had written to a gentleman near plymouth invitinghimtobecome a witness andadding that the defendant seemed willing to be very liberal that could not in any way be construed into bribery to give false evidence these two witnesses then swore dinfinctir that thoy saw drachillie hand on madame coribonis bosom ana that not once but several times dr achilli said they could not command a view from their window aud though his beliefupon that subject might account for his being so reckless in doing such acts in such a position it did not as all shake the credit duetothe evidence of those two wituesses who had no interest to come and comtnitperjry in form dr newmau was the defendant i this tris but the real defendant was dr achilli and he sir a e cockburn knew that the sympathies of the jury would naturally be upon dr achillis side ehe had given evidence in his own favour upon this inquiry and if gilty he had a strong temptation to save himself by false testimony it was a grave question whether in such cases a defendant ought not to be allowed the same privilegelord ca rnnnnif that were allowed it would also be necessary to consider whether he ought not to be compelled to give evidence against himselfsir a e cocxbuain said that certainly would be a question and also whother he ought not to be interrogated beforehand to see how much he would admit and how much he would deny if the jury came to weigh dr achillis evidence with mr reynolds they would remember thatthe latter gentleman had been employed for  yeays in the customs and it was not likely that he could have held his position so long if he had been addicted to intemper ance in the way attributed to him by dr achilli it was an extraordinary circumstauce that whenever a charge was made against dr achilli he made a counter charge against his accuser thus the superior of the cou vent at viterbo was represented in dr achillie work as dying loaded with execratious and a cardinal who had of fended him is said to have lived only that he might add to his crimes his language was that god had confounded all his adveraries and eo among the rest mr reynolds was set down as an habitual drunkard the learned counsel then proceeded at considerable length to explain all the cir cumstances under which dr achilli had been removed from his office of theological professor in the college at malta a charge of immoral conduct had been made against t go convexted priests of the college named saccares and leoniai upon the testimony of anu armenian priest named kaossii at the first inquiry which took place the charge was not brought home to the parties the evidence being only a con fession represented by kaossi to have been maue by one of them but the committee in london was not satiafied and ordered dr achihi and the other heads of the colleze in malta to renew the inquiry the day was fixel for entering upon the subject but before it ar rived dr achili sent saccares avvay into sicily under the pretence of his distributing bibles there the effect of this was to put an end to the inquiry altogether for saccares thereby withdrew from the college and the com mittee could no longer have any jnuisdiction over him dr achilli affected not to believe the charge which related to the admission of females on a visit into the college bat what would the jury say to the conversation which dr achilli was shown to have had with dr bonaira oh  said dr achiui you are a married man if you were a young man you wonld do the same you are too scrupu ious if that conversation took place and could it be doubted  what could be thought of dr achilli but that having been the intimate friend of these young menu he sent saccares away in order that he might stifle the inqury  at last this gentleman came to london and having taken a house in shaftesburycrescent the fnrst thing he did wai to solicit the chastity of his servant if that charge was true what a light it threw back upon the his tory of his previous life  the only thing that coull be said against that young womans evidence was that she was dismissed by mrs achilli for being dirty then came janelegg who stated that he had had connexion with her it was admitted that that witness was a woman of bad character and tov ue the words of gay she hal had  a child of many fathers but her evidencelwas con firmed by her sister mrs logan who had stated that she had told dr achilli that he mnst know best whether ha had to do with her and he remained silent then came the case of sarah wood she had been seduced when  and been placed in a house of mercy near windsor maintaine i by mrs tennant who thus sought to restore her to the paths of virtue having been there for some time and become reformed she was placed under the care of mrs achilhi but again she fell she became miserable her health fell oh and she desired to go back she had had but one stain upon her character and for that she hadi atoned and now it was suggested she was not to be be lieved because she had a book with a cross upon it and it was surmised that she was a catholic he sir a e cockbunn trusted the jury would decide according to their judgment and not be led away by fanaticism and bigotry he cared not on which side it might be exhibited whether by protestants or catholcsand hold the scales of justice even though their hands might shake with the strength of religious passion he appealed to their sense of justice as men and christians and looking on these things he trusted they would remember that whatever might be the great ness of faith and zeal justice was the purest emanation from god and religion loud applauselord cltmpberl said those expressions of feeling ought not to be exhibitedsir a cockburn continaed and after some observa tions on the case of catherine gormau urged at great length the authority to be attached to the certificate from the inquisition at romelord campbell said he had examuined that document since yesterday and though he did not at all regret having admitted it in evidence he must remark that the first por tion of it merely stated the result to which the notary who drew it up had come it was not in the form of a judgment he should have hesitated more in receivingit if he had been made more acquainted with the commencement bat as it was he did notregret having admitted it as he felt disposed to open the doors as widely as possible so as to admit evi dence that might throw light on the issuesir a e cocxbubs continuedthe document pur rted to be foumded on certain accusations made against  achili for incontinence some of whichhad been proved in this court on this inquiry were these charges brought before that court dr achili said they wore not and gave as a reason that the inquisition hadnot jurisdiction in mattels relating to immorality bu only in matters of faith dr grant a roman catholic bishop who bad lived at rome for many years said the contrary he was spoaking of his own knowledge from what it had been hbi duty to make himself acquainted with the document said dr achili was sentenced for his immoraitieslord capbelln said the judicial part of the document did not set out the offence for which the sentence wam pdassedsir a cockburn said this was the first instance in which he believed a judgment from a court of inquisition had ever been broughtforward in any court upon atrial it stated that dr achili had confssed his immoralities and threw himself on tho mercy of the court dr achill said he never was suspended from his functions and that no charge was ever made against him except for false doctrine in direct contradiction to the judgment the jury would hear a good deal of the inquisition but they must remem ber that this was not the spanish inquisition to which so many atrocities had been attributed and they would not be sounjust as toimagino that this was acopy of a judgement which didnotexistandthatno sentencehadbeen pronounmed the learned counsel then proceeded to comment with great severity upon dr acbillis refusing to answer questions as to his general morality although he camo into court to vindicate his character aud after an elaborate aud eloquent address in which he dwelt with great eamestness and feeling upon all the salient points in the case he concluded thus he trusted thejury would brineto the question their best and calmest judgment he could not shut his eyes to the religious bias under which they mrust labour in determining tbe question he knew that in those halls there had been cases in former times in which justice had been perverted and judicial murders had been committed and over those periods history would willingly draw a veil were it not that by holding up her beacon light she warned posterity against the errors of the past and guarded them against those passions which deaden the consdienceand steel the heart those days were ast when human life was sacrificed to bigthy thank that time was past they nowlnew that innocence ested safe under the judges and the liberties of the land the present were different times but the same feelings that then prepon derated might with insidious subtlety shut their ears aud blind their eyes to reason and might induce them not to bring to the present case the same ccar understandings that ho kinew they would exercise on any other he asked them to give the evidence their calm consideration and if they did that b e entertained the strongest confidence their ver dict would be for the defendant applauselod campdell said as there were  charges contained in tbeooneplea ofjustification hewould suggest that thejury should have a copyv of the plea and should say whether any one or mooe of the

justice he asked the jury whether anything bat a consciousness of innocenoe ceuld have supported dr achilli during bis long examinationyesterday lis learned friend regretted tbat the flames of religious bigotry had been ox cited in the country and he had warned the jury in very strong language not to be carried away by it but le the attorneygeneral should be ashamed of appealing to such grounds all thatdr achulli aid in the contest between him and dr newman wasyou dr newman have made use of poisoned arros and if you candot justify yonr conduct youmust be convicted as a slanderer we could only judge of men by their conduct and when there were these vehement attacks by dr newman we coull only attribute them to that feeling of hatred which did not require any personal knowledge of the individual dr newman had ahown all the zeal of a convert against dr achilli who was a distinguished convert on the other side and hence the malice displayed by the former it was said that dr wiseman had attacked dr achilli in the duhtin review if dr wiseman had chosen to throw off his mask dr achidi would have joined issue with him but he did not and it was only for the first time that he discovered in dr newmau an adversary wh was visible aud whom he might encounter in the light of day they wera bothnow before the jury dr newman undertaking to justify the  charges contained in the plea of justification bad the charges been brought against dr achidli directly he would be in a much more advantageous position than he was in at present he had to answer for  years of his life aud to answer  charges  yet notwith standing these disadvantages and the powerful addresses of his learned friend he the attorneygeneral felt confident that without prejudice and in the strict exercise of an im partial desire to do justice the jury would be enabled to come to the conclusion thatdr achili was entitled to their verdict hethought it right in the first instance to bring their attention to charges on the record of which there was not the slightest proof it was alleged in the seventh charge that dr achilli on the st of february  debauched and carnally knew rosa de allei sandris and in september  was found gailty by the bishop of viterbo in the th charge this is alleged to have been committed in the sacristy of the church of st gradi viterbo and in the th charge he is alleged to have given  scudi to the father of rosa de allesandris as hushmoney now no evidence had been given on this subject for the defendant but dr achilli hal etated that he had a relation a nun of that namethat her father died when he was a childthat he had never hali such an accusation brought against him aud that the whole was untrue it had been said that the papers of the puliw court in viterbo bad been burnt during the revolution but this was not a police case then he gamne to the tu charge in which it was alleged that in july  dr achilli debauched another woman whose namne was un known but who nevertheless it was said was chaste and uonmarried laughter but the jury had it in evidence that the greater part of that year he was on a tour of visitation with time and plaae given and means of contradiction wihich had proof beea attempted would have been incontrovertible then ther was the th charge which set forth that in dr achilim had debauched vinceuza guerra at viterbo now iu dr achilli never wa inviterbo but preached the lent sermon that year and remained dt capua it was said thas he had been convicted of these things before the inquiji tion whereas the fact thathe had never been wjthii miles of the place the th charge was that in  at rome naples and malta dr aehilli spoke against the e  charist and chastity and by this had corrupted varionr per sone then some persons who it was said had been de banched in  appeared as again led astray by the preach ing and teaching of dr achill in  the st charg set forth that by an official document in the archive of the policecourt at naples dr achilli had been convicted of habitual incontinence in support of this charge he thought his opponents would have gone to the fountain head but a document was pru duced of the authenticity of which no evidence had beenven and which therefore his lordship had excluded upon the charges he had mentioned no evidence had beeo given and with reference to them dr newman must be found guilty but on the others also on which evidence had been given he trusted to show that they had not been sut stantiated dr newman alleged that dr achil was an infidel in other words that he denied scriptures andthedivineoigin of the chritian religior  achiui had never been an infdel in that sense but if it was meant to make him out so because he did not believe in transul stantiation or in auricular confession or in absolution he the attorneygeneral without tho slightest levity hoped that the number of such iufidels might be daily increased applause dr achili was then charged as a hypocrite and in support of this passages in his own book had been referred to the passages so quoted iflus trated the struggles of a strong mind with its doubts a reference was made to luther and they all remembered how his mind was bent and bowed down from year to year and yet could any one say that because luther had re mained in the church in which he had been born and brought up until his doubts had ripened into conviction therefore he was a hypocrite did dr newman lie down believing in the errors of roman catholicism one night and get up next morning a fullblown roman ca tholic  laughter it was alleged in charge  that dr achilli as ear y as  vas deprived of his faculty to lecture now the only lectureship he obtained in viterbo was in  yet he was in  accused of being deprived of bis lectureship for an offence which his superiors wished to conceal he continued in that lectureship till  and here the jury had an example of the rashuess with whicb the cbarges against him hadbeen made the th charge was that in  dr achillihad already earned the reputation ot ascandalous friar it was said slander well andsome of it is sure to stick yet two menks at viterbo had boen called and had sworn that dr acbilli held a high reputa tion at the period referred to and this character had beeu proved to have been maintained by him for ten years after it was established that he was employed in offices of trust as for example to confess persons of both sexes  that in  he was sent as visitor to the convent of nessi  that whein at rome he preached the lnt sermons that at naplep he was sent for to preach before the dachess of gauony and that in  he was appointed prior of the domintcan convent could the jury believe with such evideice before them then that in  he was a friar of kandalous reputation  could they think so with the fact flat in  he obtained his letters of secauarization which ia  were completed he now came to the sixth charge respecting elena valenti dated on the  st of february  thereohaa been some intimation of the interest felt in roman catholic countries in this inquiry that great faci litioswere given to persons seeking evidence and that a roman catholic solicitor of great respectability was incom manication with a personage high in the romish church whose name he wished to communicat
