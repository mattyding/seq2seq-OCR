the plaintiffs who are two of the share holders of the great northern bailway company seek to restrain the directors of that company from completin an agreement for working the traffio of the ambergate not tingham and boston ain eastern junction bailway com pany and paying that compady per cent on their paidup capital and taking up theliabilitiesof thesame company tb agreemirent entered into between the directors of the tvwo compaoies was stated in our former reportmr bsolt followiug ir bethell and mr denison who were heard on the last day of term for the defendants con tended that there was d othing illegal or objectionable iu the contrat the great northern company might lawfully carry passengers from london to nottingham throughout or to any of the intermediate stations accordingtothe terms of any agreement which they might make with the amnbergate company for running over the latter line and would it not be perfectly absurd and n reasonable to hold that when the trains of the great northern company stopped at grantham or at any of the stations between granthani and nottingham for the purpose of setting down or takidng up the london passen gers they were to be precluded from taking up other passengers from grantbam to nottingham or to any of the stations between those points  common sense and public convenience would alike forbid such a construction of the acts by which these public undertakings were regulatedihen if they were permitted as they muat on every rea sonable construction be to arrange with tho ambergate company for carrying passengers on their line why might they not agree to pay a proper remuneratiou to that com pany for the use of their line and what would be a more natural or proper scale of payment than a certain rate of per centage on the capital which the anibergate company had invested it was said that the aet fixed a miiaximum toll which must be regulated at so much per mile tra versed but to say nothing of the oomplication of account which such a mgde of calculation rwoul induce when ap phed to every individual passenger and parcel it was a toll perfectly inapplicable to the case the toll was fixed by the statute for the use of the road only not includidg the stations vatertanks sgnals porters or any other ac commdation which was indispensable to progress con venience and safety the legislature had fixed no scale of cbarges for such accommodation and these were there fore entirely left to contract between the companies he contended that it was perfectly a mistake to suppose that the companies could not apply their monies to soliciting a bill in rarliameot the parliamentary powera might be insufficient might want some material provisions but yet it was gravely argued that the company could not apply to parliament for a remedy if any recusant sbareholder op posed it bailway companies like all other bodies might seek to improve their position by any efforts witbin the scope and object of their original constitutionmr baiy appeared for the ambergate company who aleo opposed the motionsir w p wood replied he did not deny that under the th section of the railway clauses rct one company might agree to run over the line of another and pay for such traffic but the payment must in some manner be measuied by the traffic and this was in no respect such an agreement the great northern company were to pay all the expense of the line and the traffic the debts to the canal compadies and the  per cent on the capital it was a mnere delusion to liken this to the lawful agreement wbich might be made for the occasional use of the line ol another companyhis hoiourt faid he would examine the authoritiet which had been cited in argument and give judgment on monday morningbefore sr b t
