of clanricarde who had a notice on the paper stating that he should call attention to the stand ing order no  section  requiring the assent of four fifths of the proprietors of a railway in caso of a proposal for amalgaation with a view to a modification of the provisions thereof in respect of bills to be brought into rarliament in any fiuture seesion adverted to the incon venience of a regulation which enabled a small minority of railway shareholders to pass a veto on a proposition for the consideration by parliament of any change in the ar rangements relating to the railway he would submit that in making this standing order the house had overleaped the mark and given opportunity to large companies by pur chasing shares in undertakings that might compete witb their own to prevent parliament from considering the pro priety of allowing such competition he had been informed that besides the case which was before the house last mon day week there was a similar case in the north of england where a large railway company were again purchasing uhares in order to stop competition it had been suggested that there should be no vote unless the shares were acquired be fore a certain date he thought the best course would be to alter the required proportion of assents from fourfifths to we understood three fifths he should propose that it be referred to a committee to consider the auojeet the noble marquis we believe at first suggested the standing orders committee but subsequently proposod a select com mitteelord redesdale reminded the house that the order wa framed for the purpose of protecting shareholdera against their directors and if it had been found oppressivea there would have been more than one or two cases in which difficulty or grievance would have arisen but he knew ef none except those which were before the house last week the shrewabury and cheater ana shrewsbury and birmingham  and in one of those cases the shareholders wele protected by the proportion required being now not threehs but fourfifths in the instance of one of the com panies the shareholders last year were in favour of an alli ance with the northwestern but the directors were in favour of the great western and by management they  increased their number of votes that at the meeting a few months ago they would have carried their point if the pro portion had been only threefifths in the other case the directos split shares preparing the transfer and retransfer with the money of the company directors had powers too which they could exercise with regard to delay i giving a list of shareholders and giving it only up to the time of the applcation they had enormous powers and the house would do well toba cautious and inquire before altering this order it was suggested that no parties except those who had held shares for a certain time be alowed to vote and that was upon the whole a valuable suggestion heteoughtthe standing orders committee was notlthe best tribunal to which this question could be referred ir his opinion it ought to be referred to a select committee les numerous thau the standing orders committee by whom it might be fairly and tempemately discussedlord hatherton considered it of the greatestimportance that the manufacturers of staffordshire should have direct and rapid means of communication with the coastand it was only by competition that such advantages cou  be afforded he entertaineda strong conviction of the ne cessity of a change in the standing order for he thought it would be sufficient to require that amajority of threefifthi of the shareholders should approve of an amalgamationthe earl of stradbroke was understooa to say tha he preferred the standing order in its original formthe earl of harrowby thought that if their lord ships wished to protect the interests of shareholders against the jobbing of directors they should take care not to enable a emall minority of shareholders to obstract propositions for amalgamationthe marquis of lansdownx considered it most im portant to the interests of the public that their lordshipse and the standing orders committee should be able to pro nounce an unfettered opinion upon the merits of any pro posed railway amalgamations in many cases it was most desirable for the general interests of the public that such amalgamations should take p lace for it vas admitted that the public convenience was better met by large and power ful than by smaller companies when a question of this kind arose between two great companies their lordships should be enabled to ascertain which company was most likely with reference to all the local circumstances to pro vide for the wants of the public and they ought not to debar themselves of that power by allowing the obstruc tion of minorities which might exercise equal tyranny with majorities hear hear although he did not go eo far as to say that he thought smaul majorities of shareholders ought to be enabled to carry out amalgamations he cer tainly considered that such arrangements which miht be most advantageous to the public ought not to te ob structed by small minorities availing themselves of the order of their lordship ehouse hear hear hethought the subject was one which ought to be fairly and carefully consideredearl granvaille was understood to say that he thought it would be advisable to restore the order to its original form requiring the assent of only threefifths of the shareholders to a proposed amalgamationlord brougiha was quite of opinion that their lord ships should do now what they ought to have done year agorefer the question to a committee for considerationlord lyndhurst said that the whole of our legisla tion on the subject of railways was in a most confused and unsatisfactory state and required some very material amendments founded upon long consideration and framed with greatcare and caution hiear hear there oguld be no doubt in the mind of any person who considered for a moment the position of the railway in question that it was one of great importance to the public at large andit was quite monstrous that the interests of the public should be defeated by a combination such as that which was practiseil in the course of the proceedings in regard to that railway he admitted that the decision of the standing oxders comn mittee viz that they saw no reason to recommendthe sus pension of the standing order was perfectly eorrect be cause no sfficient evidence had been laid before them for thepurpose of proving the charges which were alleged against the northrwestern company on the particular occa sion but he begged to remind their lordships of one cir cumstance it appeared in evidence before the stand ingt orders committee that previous to the meetinr for the purposet of confirming the areement with regard to the amalgamation shares wero purch ased by the company in the name of their servants for the purpose of defeatingg the agreement and if such asttrivance was resorted to on that occasion what reason hadtheir lordahip to believe that the sameo contrivance was not resorted to upon the second occasion although there wasnot sufficient evidence to enable them to trace it in conse quence of the machinery which was made use of their lordships therefore ought to adopt some means to prevent a repetition of that contrivane and this could be done he though by reducing the proportion of votes neoessary to approve of an amalgamation fom fourfifths to three fifths as it stood at the time the original order was made hear hearthe earl of derby hoped their lordships would ncot follow the advice of his noble and learned friend on thispoint the notice which the noblo marquis opposite originally gav was that he should move fo an inquiry by he standin orders committee into the circumstances conneted withthe standing order no  and he had subse quently with great propriety agreed that thbquestion should be referred not to the standing orders committeej but to a select committee but the noble marquis gave no notice of the particular manner in which hepropeeed the standing order should be amended when their lordships found fault with the hasty measure which wasintrodued ata late period of the session of  for the alteration of the standing orders he thought it would be sti more impri dent ifthey werenow without any previous notiee and upon a discussion which in his opion hbd tned tomuch upon the merits o one particular ease to opsent at once to alter the standing order hear hear bemideshe was not at all satisfied that the remedy which had been proposed by his noble and learneddfriend would be the beust and most efetual remedy for theevil complained of there was another measure which he thought it veryim rtant the commnittee should consider and that was that it should be re uired that the shares of al persons who intended tovote hould have been held for a certain period previous to the time of voting hear hear in his opinion this would be a more effectuaal remedy tat at reposed by his noble and learned friend but he hoped their lord pwould send the whole question to a select comumittee after a feii words
