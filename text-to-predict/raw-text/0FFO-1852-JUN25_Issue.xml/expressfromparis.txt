second editionthe times oppfte ady miugexpress from paristhe following is our paris correspondents letter dated yesterday  pmthe principal points of objection pointed out in the report of the commission of finance on the budget for  are nearly identical with those to which i had previously directed your attention as the budget of next year or rather the financial condition of the country in general is the subject of great interest at the present moment it may be as well to present a brief analysis of the question as exiamined in that report the commission compares the budget of  presented to the assembly before the coupddat of the d december with that of  and finds that the latter exceeds the former by f  but as a saving of f has been effected by the conversion of thefive percents the excess of expenditure is in reality of the increase in the estimates for the public service amounts to ooof the commission complains that the consolidation of the department of agriculture with that of the interior has nxot been of any advantage to the budget but rather the contrary inasmuch as there is an increased expenditure of f taking into account the credits allocated to the ministerofpolice wrhich have been hitherto comprised in the budget of the home department the commission looks upon the new institution of a ministry of state as a sort dl aentral adminimtr tii lcl costs more than ifwoof per annuni ud a lilt it profeises to resect it the comniisi nertheless pro poses certain reductions both with reference to the relative expenses of the national palaces and mauucturqs and to the personnel of the establishment it expresses its regret that the budget of the department of public works has increased to the amount of of which be int further augmented by various expenses of a similar nature appearing in the budget of the late rior and ministry of state produce an additional asm of ooof over the budget of  it proposed a reduction of f which was re jected by the council of state the commission alo complains that the public salaries are exces sive comparatively with the financial condition of the country and advises that they be krought back to the tariff of  and which would toiduce a saving of f it objects to and vouldstrike out from the defte siagere the sum of iyif paid as a dotation to the senators which ought not to be inserted there but should be placed iii a special chapter immediately following the dotation of the prince president but what has given the greatest umbrage to the com imission is the institution of a ministry of police on which it observes that the expense oecasioned is the least thing it finds fault with in it it fears that the loosely defined duties of the agents of that department will produce dissensions and conflicts and though as i have already mentioned it does ilot go to the length of demanding the complete sup pression of the department itself it yet urges a re duction of the expense and certainly the sup pression ofthe inspectors general the war estimates which absorb f for the maintenance of  men gave rise to very serious observa tionsin the commission and which are expressed in the report a reduction of  men and a con sequent saving of f as in fact had been proposed by the government itself was earnestly recommenled this reduction however has been postponed several other reductions of minor importance relating to the theatres c were also proposed after an examnination of the badget in detail the commission ultimately re commended a reduction of f or rather less than half the anticipated deficit but the greater part of these propositions not being accepted by the council of state the commission has given up some but persisted in others the commission expresses its regret that resources which are of an extraordinary kincd should be carried to the ordinary receiptssuch as f the proceeds of the forests of the state and the reimbuasements of railroad comapanies and that the sinking fund f for  should be turned from its ori ginal destination and applied to the ne cessities of the budget and yet with all thlese forced resources there is an anticipated de ilcit of f on the budget of  the commission particularly expresses its regret that that deficit should be added to the of floatitg debt which sum according to its calcula tious will represent at the end of the present year the total anterior deficitsthe aesemble nationale examines the report at lnuch length and concludes as follows if rom the budget we pass to the general financial situatioa of the country we find the monarchy on the st january  with a floating debt of o accord irg to the definitive account of  out of this sum f only arose from real deficits and the rest wal devoted to the service of the treasmuy to settle these de icitsand preparations were making to do sothere were nearly of of resources arising from the payments of the loan of  from the reimbursements of the railway com panies

astonished that the go vernment had not abolished it altogether on the d december a great service would have been ren dered had that militia been dissolved which was so improperly called intelligent bayonets and which had placed france on the brink of destruic tion m de morny replied that the government might no doubt have dissolved the national guard on the d december if it did not do so it was because it knew that a properly orgauized national guard would serve in maintaiaing order it was with that view the new national guard had been organized m latour concurred in the opinion expressed by m kerveguen and at the same time rendered justice to m de morny whose wise administration had he said saved the principle of authority as well as the liberties of the country the credit was afterwards put from the chair and adopted the committee had likewise proposed a redulction of f on the chapter relative to civil buildings the council of state refused to admit it but the chamber after hearing m

agreeing to a reduction of f for the salary of four inspectorsgeneral who had not yet entered on their functions m duzes said that the chapter under consideration iuvolved both a financial and a moral question ila a finacial point of view the present functionaries were suf ficient and amply paid and in a moral point of view he saw no reason for increasing the number of the directors of police inthe departments he would ask if the word police was very popular it was discredited under the empire might it not be the same today what besides was the use of the police the question was addressed in the council of state when one of the councillors m de thorigny replied  i had this morning an interview with m de maupas and the reasons he gave me made me understand the necessity of the policelook at all those cartons said he if you knew what they contained you wolid not hesi tate an instant to acknowledge it laughter the police as it is now organised is not an ordinary police it is anx administrative police the government wishes to know how the prefects fulfil their duties and on this ccasion one may cite that sentence of tacitus etiam miita atque inanimna tecta et parietes circumn

was not menaced since the first chapters had been voted it was only intended to suppress the inspectors which he considered an imprudent measure before order and public tranquillity were completely reestablished m perrot advocated the reduction on the ground that the creation of inspectorsgeneral of police weakened the moral authority oftle prefects m bonjeau councillor of state defended the inspectorsgeneral the present police bore no resemblance to that of former times the victory of the d december had cat in two the snake of socialism but the parts might still unite and to prevent it a strong and vigilant police was necessary it was not contem plated to reestablish an inquisitorial police the inspectorsgeneral will have to consult the wishes and wants of the population the duties of the prefects are too numerous to allow them time to attend to the police and it is to supply that de ficiency that the government had thought proper to appoint inspectore general ml chasseloup lau but having declared that the committee did not insist on the reduction the chapter was put from the chair and adopted the discussion next opened on tlie budget of the ministry of public works the government having consented to the reduction to onehalf the credit of  required for the opening of the new street of strasburg and to ther suppression of  f claimed for the bordeaux and cette and the paris and cher bourg railwsys those items gave rise to no discussion the assembly then passed to the budget of the ministry of war the chapter re lative to the pay and maaintenance of the troops amounted to f the commnittee had proposed to reduce the army by  men but did not insist on its proposition m dumirail said that he found the effective force of the army too considerable anarchy had been conquered and a portion of the troops might be safely dismised in case of any danger they could be immediately called back and the cham ber would readily grant the necessary supplies the governmenthad two sorts of friendsuseful friends and dangerous friends the former were not afraid to tell it that the expenses were exaggerated whilst the dangerous friends granted everything with closed eyes general allard councillor of state replied that if order now reigned it was owing en tirely to the attitude and number of the military forces the government disposed of the proposition could not be acceded to without impairing the esprit militaire which constituted the principal strength of the army that chapter as well as all the other chapters of the ministry of war were afterwards adopted without opposition the first section of the budget of the marine was sub sequently agreed to after some observations ex changed between the reporter and the government commissioner
