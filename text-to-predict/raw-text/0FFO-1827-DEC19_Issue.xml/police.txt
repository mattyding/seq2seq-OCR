policebowstreetanother instance of the jealousy and bad feeling which exist between theconstables of st paulscovent garden and the officers attached to this office occurred yes terday in the case of a man named pardoe who was charged by syerg and wyman two parish constables with creating a riot in the house of grubb of bowstreet one of the persons convicted in the sum of  for selling wine without a licence as stated in our report of yesterdaya waiter belonging to grubbs establishment was the com plainant he stated that on ilonday night between one and two oclock the defendant in company with another man came to his masters bouse and askrd for coffee they were both dressed like working men and his master air grubb told them to go elsewherethat they were not respectable enough for his room they insisted however utpon their right to be served and iur grubb ordered witness to turn them out in endeavouring te effect which the defendant knocked him down witness got up and a scuffle took place in the street vrhen the two constables now present syers and wy man came up and witness gave the defendant into custodythe defendant stated that he and his friend went to grubbs house for a cup of coffee but they were not suf fered to remain upon remonstrating with the waiter his master told him to tum them out and the waiter in doing so struck the defendant and knocked him down without any provocation whatever the two constables then came up and syers took charge of the defendant but let hint go soon aftersir ricsiard birntise asked sycrs why he let the defen dant go after taking hima into custodv syersbecause i was assaulted ana struck byyour officers and the defendant was rescued from me indecd  said sir rrchearrd brttnie  who is the officer that assaulted you svershere pointed to stephensan officer of thisestablishmert sir richard binorrehow do you account for this stephens stephens explained by stating that he was the person who first took the defendant into custody and he was in the act of conveying him to the watchhouse when the two consta bles came up and insisted upontaking that duty upon them selvessir riciard binwieay i see how it is this is one of your contemptible struggles to see whether you or the pa rish officers are the stronger instead of acting together and supporting each other you are continually at loggerheadsstephens said that he was in bowstreet at the opposite side of the way when the defendant and his cowipanien were turned out of rir grubbs house he did not bowever at tcmpt to interfere until he saw the defendant knock the wai ter down when he went over and took him into custody  almost immediately after which yers and nvyman who had been following him up and down for several hours before came up and interfered in the manner he had stated he de nied that he had any bad feeling towards the parish officers or that he was in the interest of grubb and the publicans ge nerallylr fallsolt ntonsense stephens  we know very well what persons you are connected with these proceedings are most disgaceful but as far as i am concerned i am deter mnined to put a stop to them parishofficers and policeofficers are equally bound to protect the public and to cooperate together for that purpose instead of which from some cause or other in this parish the reverse has been exhibited i am determined topunish as far as i can the very next officer of this establishment found guilty of insulting or assaulting the parishofficerssir r birxsti told the defendant that he must enter into his own recognizances to meet any charge of aasault thatmight be prefermd against him at the sessions by grubbs waiter whom he also bound in t same manner and then told the parties that they might if they pleased indict each otberpardoe the defendant then charged stephens the officer with striking him in the watchhouse while he was in custody therebartlett the watchhousekeeper herestepped forward and said that the conduct of stephens was bighly improper he abused every body in the watchhouse and struck paidoe on tbe breast with his staff he added that stephens appeared to be drunk  herring one of the patrol conductors gaid that stephens acted certainly with great im to rietysir ricehard birniseid he appear to he drurnk herringno your worship i dont think he was in li quor but he appeared txbe in a very great passionr hall

suspeaded stephens and yoa may consider yourself well off if you are not dis missedstephens denied that he struck pardoet and attempted to defend his conduct but the inagistrates ordered him to be si
