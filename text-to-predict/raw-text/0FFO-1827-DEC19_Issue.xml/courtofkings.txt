conspired with trancisco antotio de oliveira antonio de souza rocha jose antoiao gonsalvez viana and henrico lopez ferras de beca to defratzd the underwriters at lloyds the defendant pleaded  not guiltythe attopxeygeneatal said that the present prose cution nas instituted by certain underwriters who by singular good fortune bhd escaped from a conspiracy to defraud them into which the defendants on the prersent record had entered the jury would ontly have one defendant alr llmeireillos to try as the others had efld into portugal of which corntry they wrct il natives the prosecution arose out of a policy of insuraoce on the dtana a ship which belongcd to mr jose antorio gonsalvez viana it was etfected for l on tbe voynge of this vessel from oporto to rio janeiro rnd was signed by some of the most respectable under writers in the city of london the vessel was lost on its voyage to rio and mr viana immediately call ed upon the underwriters to make the loss good they atsected that there was some fraud in the demand m utoz themfirst because the loss was said to be the result cf a wreck and next because it wais said to have been occasioned byl holes made by rats in the vessel nhichalwaysmade it leakthe most in fine weather the undertriters therefore called on mr viana to state the amount of bis lases antd to verify it upon oath it then turned out itat he was not the only person interested in the policybut that tbere tas mother person interested in it who lived at oporto aind passed by the name of lopez the ship was valued at  by the defendant ieireilos who was the clerk of lopezend who alsoassisted vianain his business viana in ornmplianca with the call made upon him by the un derwriters swore that he had purtcased the diana of two peroits for  o r mlreas which amounted to about q sterling le likewise swore that he had shipped in it a large quantity of ilks and serge which he had packed up in boxtis on his premnises and with his testimony tbatof rlrewos agreed perfectly being given for the express pgxpose or supporting and confirming it viana alleged that her madp ascasesa o these serges and silks at different fairs in porugal and gave in the dames of the individuals of whom he had purchased thetm after this aniwer had been put inwas dade by the court of lrxchequer in which the undenriurs had filed a bill for the examination of vianas books t aoporto now it was not the intention of visna rrlho had cjme to england to prosecute his claims to have had hit bo aks examined before he himself returned to oporto butowingto the alacrity of tr young the agent of lloyds t ogmto theqboks were emanmned before viana was enabled tot ren nx ofders from hnglaud on the subject he adfizsft hs sook in the care of his fatherinlaw oz de pastos who on seeing the order of the court oxxclpequer allowed them to be inspected upon thnt jrisatccii dsecoveries were made of several cirnsnances quite inconsistent with the answer which viana liad putinnnnd extrcets were taken from the pages in which ss enea were first perceived the lights thus obtained by the underwriters made it necessary for thehi to file a supplemental biu in the court of exchequer and to call for a further answer from viana on discovering that his books had been examined viana made several alterations in his formerstaternent hec made alltusions to several other books itn whicb he kept his accounts and professed his readi ness to bring them into court if it should be go required his books were accordingly exlhibited in the courtof ex chequer as far as they went they certainly confirmedandl verified his answer they also set foth the  rious purchases which he had made in potrtugal of various commedi ties which lie swore that he had put on boaxti his vessel and were confirmed it all their leading de ails by similar depositions from alr meireillos it turned out however thntwhenthesebooks were examined they were found not to contain thc extracts which mr young had taken from the book he had inspected but passages and entries utterlintonsistent with them a suspicion arose that the books had been fabricated for the occasion inquiry was made into the circumstance and it then appeared that when viana heard that his books had been inspected by young he had been seized bv an alarm lest his books should be found inconsistent with hii answer the letters which he then wrote to portugal were couched in a wellstudied obscurity in otder to veil their real object he expressed gemat indignation at his fatberinlaw for having allowed his books to be examined by the contmissioners of the court of exchequer and obscurely hinted that new books ought to be fabricated forthwith he sent by a confidential friend details which he enumnerated and tfie fabricated books vrould he believed be founi to tally exactly with those details he likewise desired that the price given for the vessel in his books should be made to correspond with the price stated to have been given for it in his answer the manner in which this fraud was to be executed came by an extraordinary piece of good fortune to the knowlcdge of the agent at lloyds  and of course the underwriters were prepared to expect that vianas books when produced would fully support his an swer it turned out that their expectations were correct thentderwriters about the same time came into the knowledge of another piece ot isformation extremely valuable in this cause they discovered the person who had sold viana the diana  and they found that he had sold it to viana not for  nmileas as viana had sworn but for  milreas which were not paid in cash but partly in silks and serges and partly in bills which were now dishonoured he would now state to them liow aieircillos was implicated in this conspi racy ilc had before told them that mleireillos was in eng land that he had corroborated by his depositions vianas answer and that he had sworn that he had seen cer tain boxes packed up and sent on board the diarna hle the attorneygeneral had no doubt that such boxes did go on board but he very much doubted whether they contained any silks they would ece from the evidence wlich he should ca betore them that aleireillos went to portugal before viana and that he was present at the remanufacturing of certain books of that individual they would likewise find that entries were made in those bools which were not insert ed the irirt time that young examined them and that those entries which regarded the price of the vessel were made in lileireilloss handwriting they wuld find likewise that one of the books had the sarne cover as a book which alr young examined  but that new leaves had been interpolated in all places where it was necessary to maece an insertion in fa vourof vianas answer and that old leaves had been abstract ci ia all places where it was necessary to withdraw any entry that ewas hostile to it he would likewise prove that aeileillos had been seen busily engaged with the bookbinders and the books at the house of lopez pussos if he should niake out these points in evidence before them he thought that they would teel convinced that when viana and ieireillos were in eng land together they intended to impose upon the underwriters in the first instance by false swearing anol titat when they found that the old books had been examined they devised the project of fabricating new books to verify their answer if they should be of that opinion then in point of law aleireil los was guilty of the conspiracy charged against him in the indictment rhe defendant was a foreigner and he was de sirous on all occasions to treat foreigners with candour and if possible with indulgence  but when a clear case of fraud was brought hetne to them and when the object of that fraud was to plundler the underwriters he felt it necessary that they shoulil be broutght tojustice lf they should be satisfied that the defendant was guilty he hoped that the example which the law would make of him would not only be salutary to this country but also to every other place in which it might be hleard ofjohn andrewsi am ani insurance broker in london i did not effect

viasas warehouses for thie purpose of seeing some bales of silks which he was told were shoot to be sent on board the brigan tine there was a case in the exchequer some time ago witich might be in the
