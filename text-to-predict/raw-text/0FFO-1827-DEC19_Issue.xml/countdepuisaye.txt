biographer he was a partisan of the lirst innovations and of the english constitution he earr manifested himself an enemy of the demagoguesin l iml dc puisaye was raistd to the rank of mlajor general

sanguinary tyranny of the conveatibn the command in chief was given to general wimpfen and the second place to the countde puisaye but the struggle meadelby the normans was equallybrief and fruitless by dint of bribes and difuinkg a spirit of revolutionar ttsa ticism among a portion of the people the conventinat om missiqners succeeded in bringing about the dissolution of the departnental army after a bingle action at paq in which the count depuisayeexerted himself tothe utmosta price being set upon his head ai de puisayesofigbtan asylum in brittany to which province he was a perfect stranger his adventures there have almost a character of romance every hour he was exposed to some new perul but he extricated himself ftom them all by his courage and presence of mind and while a fugitive he conceived the daring plan of arraying au brittany and the clicumjacent provinces in arms agair st the convention indefatigably active brave eloquent and of prepossessing manners he was admirably caiculatedfoe theperformance of such a task such was his perseverance and success that by the summer of he had extended the royalist organization through nearly the whole of rittanv and eren into the bordering province convinced however that the royalist party could bat act effilcaciously without foreign esupport and that england alone was capable of giving that supporta the conat resolved to visit thzis country in order to cornfer vtit the brtish ministers and he accordingly set sail leaving the commnand in the hands of all cormatin and a councilin london aiu de iaisave

trhaty vrith the republicans this treaty ws in fact the work of certain intriguing subordinate agents of louis xviii who had contrived to obtain admission into his servicemen who kept at a safe distance front the field of danger but who were anxious to get into their own bands a authority inthe lroy alist departments and to reduce to a dependent sute or cn tirely exclude those chiefs who had lavished their fortune and their blcod to raise the standard of royalty in the west of france there was no act of baseness which tbese despicable beings did not comnit to effect their purpose calumnies injuries of all kirds and even assassinations were resorted to by them against the count de poizaye they were particu larly active independent of his holding them in contempt and resisting their encroachments he had the demerit of being a man of liberal principlesone wlsothough be defended mo narchy vwas an enemy to despotsm and was known to be an admirer of the english constitution this last crime alone was stufficient te ensure their hatredthe mischief which cormatin had done was soon repaired by the instructions which thecount depuisaye sentovertobrit tany and every thing was prepared by thebreons to join the british andermigrant troops as soon asthey should appearon the coast of france the agents however had resolved that no thing should be done in brittanv as they wished to divert the expedition to the coast of vende  wbere indeea it could be of no utility but where it wouli be under their influence az charette acted in concert with themthey were but too fatally successful in their plans the cormnand of the emigrant regiments was given to the count dhervilly a respectable officer but who was misled by the agents and who even had he not been so was too much bi goted to the routine of his profession to be well qualified for the peculiar kind of service on which he was now employed unfortunately too though the count de puisaye wat intended to hold the supreme command this was not clearly expressed and an opportanity was thus afforded to m d ervilly to thwart all the measures of his supeiior under pretence that he himself had the chief authority over the emigrant regimentstie expedition sailedto quiberon the succours were lanied without opposition and the count de phiezye was jolned bv several thousand brctons it was his plan to advanwc ranidly into the interior disperse or overpower the republisns before tley could concentrate their forces and thus effect a stinultaneous rsing o toe wfleie province but trus canenme was frustrated by ai

cuttiag off his retreat while the regular troops at tecked him in front thia plan would most probably have succeeded bad not the agents rendered it abortive as soon as ml tinteniac landed their emissaries conveyed to him or ders ir the name of louis xviii to march into the interior which orders he obeyed in consequence of this mneasure which was wholly unknown to al de puisaye the attack in front on hoches position failed and the royalists were com pelled to retreat with great ios treason soon after completed what the agents had begun hoche surprised fort penthievre which guarded the entrance of the peninsula and the emi grants were partly slaughtered and partly made prisoners all the prisoncrs were soon after put to death after having exerted himself to the utmost to repel the enerny the count de puisaye at the request of al de sombreuil proceeded to the briti fleen in the bay to obtain succour and while he wase somoreu surrenderedundismayed by this disaster the count de puisaye again threw himself into brittany and by dint of incessant and welldirected exertion succeeded in reorganizing the royai ist party and rendering it stronger than ever in the ccurisof these labours he had many hairbreadth escapes and at one period vas compelled to secrete iiimself for some time in a cave dug under the roots of a tree at each stephe w as contcracted b the agents who stopped at nothing to destroy him his officers were tampered with his plans were thwart ed and his life was more than once attempted the agents even succeeded in inducing sonie of the chiefs to mnake peace vith the republicans they were at that moment eagagedin their absurd plot against the directorywhich was subsequent ly frustrated on the th of fructidor and independent of their personal hatred of the breton leader they were averse fiom sharing with any rival the success which they anticipated from a conspiracy hatched in the gar rets of the french capital dracing the years  and  the count nevertheless peridsted and at lengah at the latter end of  having prepared eyery thing for the contest he visited xnland in the hope of persuad ing a bourbon ptince to put hamself at the head of the
