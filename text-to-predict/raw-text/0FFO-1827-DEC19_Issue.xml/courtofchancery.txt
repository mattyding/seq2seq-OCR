muean to ralmc any argumteot on this point it was upon the resolution that be relied and that contained two very remark able qualfications tire one was that mr ebden was to be consulted as to whether he would consent to the termis of this resolution the otrer was that if all the creditots did not agree to sign the resolution within three months the resolution stould bc vold now the plaintiffs had signed the resolution but sanme dcnbt having arisen as to their debt lessrs howell atd moant wrote to them saying that they had referred the ilaim of the plaintffs to rebden the plaintiffs upon this

eissrsr hlowell and mount had put in their answer in which theystated that they tbought mlr ebden would have agreed to the resolution but that on being applied to he had ret ustd that many of thecreditors had refused to sign the resoluticn and that some of them were so dissatisfied that they had tcrurlly issued out process against alr ebden when he considered these facts and the cruel situation in wkich mr bden bad becen placed by the injunction he could not conceive upot what principle the court had ever granted fheiijanction all the facts could not at that time have been brought before the court now that tbey did appear lie was sure the court would dissolve the injunction because it was quite cearfirst that mlr ebden had not acquiesced in the resolution aud secondly that all the creditors bad not signed the resolution within three months which circumstance alone rendered that instrument a mere dead letterir sigt desq on the other side said that his clients hav  ing writter to the opposite party for a copy of the resolution ha question received a copy of it but that that copy did not contain the qualifications which it now turned out were attached to the original his clierts had not the most remote idea of any such qualifications when they sled their bill nothing could be more singular than the conduct of the defendants throughout this business they had actually paid by virtue of this resolution an instalmenat ofrs in the pound to al credifors who had signed the resolu tion exeering only his clients how came they to do this uen they kcnew that the resolution wrould be void if all the creditors did not sign it within three months  the defes ante too pretended to dispute the debt due to his clients but this vas altogether an afterthought for it plainly appeared by the partnership accounts that a very large sum evas due to thetn the learned counsel then argued that cdroni all th circumstances of this case the court ought to look at it with some suspicionthe vicecrancellor said it was perfectly clear upon tie face of the resolution that it was void in consequence of all the creditors not having signed it within three months there were many circumstances in the case which might re uire explanation on the hearing of the cause but the resolu tion ï¿½ th very terms of it being void he must dissolve the tnjunctionhis hor intimated his
