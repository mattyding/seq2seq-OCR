migratiocns oegrousea scottish markingexperimentappeal to sportsmenprofessor james ritchie of the naturalhistory department university of aberi deen wrrites jthe most familiar things may be among the least inderstoodperhaps because one takes them for granted and so it seems to be with the red grouse of scotland no wild bird receives so much attention from the day of its birth till the day of its death and after no bird has been so cared for by the law of the land since a scottish act of  regulated the season when  murecockes  might legally be taken or since james vi i  appointed donald farquharson to be keeper of the kings forests of braemar cromar and strathdee with instructions to searche and seik tak and apprehend all and quhatsumever persones hantand thairin with bowes cunver ingis nettes or ony other instrument meet and convenient for the destruction of the deir and the muirfo wlis parliamentary commissions have spent years in studying the grouse volumes have been written about it and yet the movements of grouse form one of the problems of bird migration about which we know least it is in an endeavour to correct this lack of information and in order to appeal for the assistance of all who are interested in this unique british bird that i write this short account of the steps we have taken this year to trace the movements of the red grousebroadly speaking the migrations of british birds are of three kinds there are the great oversea wanderings which carry birds from our island to foreign lands and back again there are the local movements of birds which do not leave these islands siulc as the treks of many waders and holidaymakers which spend the summer on the moors and the winter on the seashore and there are the stayat homes satisfied wvith conditions as they find them wlhich spend a lifetime about the dis trict nhere they were bornmass movementsthe general opinion is that grouse belong to the category of the stayathomes they cer tainly do not cross the seas to continental countries and this selfimposed isolation helps to account for the development of the special clharacters which make lagopus scoticus a bird by itself different from all its continental relatives they are looked upon as parochial birds typical examples of that very small group of british birds which lack the roam in spirit in this case however general opinion may be wrong and i believe it is it cannot of course be said that grouse migrate from one definite place to another definite place and back again with the regularity of the seasons or of the true migrants among birds but they seem to be subject to certain mass nmovements the causes of vhich and even the extent of which are not yet under stoodthere is for example that general move nment fronm high ground to the shelter and easier food supplies of the valleys which takes place during times of heavy snowfall but that is a sinmple case to be accounted for by obvious necessities on the other band what proprietor or keeper does not know the moor wvhere in springtime the stock vas numerouis and healthy where young birds were plentiful early in the season and yet which wvhen shooting commences seems to be bereft of its stock the intervening months have been marked by no special increasein the numbers of vermin there haas been no uinwonted mor tality from grousedisease else dead and dying birds would have been founid on the ground the birds have simply disappeared vhere have they gone and why this is by no means the only problem presented by the grouse moor sometimes towards the latter part of the shooting season a moor suddenly presents a new aspect the numbers of grouse are greatly augmented by many newcomers especially birds of the year so far as one can learn they were not born on the ground or on neighbouring properties they behave as if they were new to guns and the ways of sports men whence have they come and whya special investigationsuch are sonie of the problems of grouise movements which await solution and the solu tion of vhich might help to explain the vagaries of the annual bag the ridles can be answered only by definite observations over a widearea during thespringof this year the natural history department of the university of aberdeen with the encouragement and will inig help of many proprietors of grouse moors aind keepers has placed numbered rings upon many huudreds of grouse particularly in the northeast of scotland a record has been kept of the moor on which every bird was ringed where will the marked birds be found  the answer tothe questionand it might help to explain the unsolved problems i have alluded tolies in the hands of the sportsmen who frequent the moors thlis autumn we appeal therefore to every sportsman keeper or whoever may handle grouse from the moors to look out for these aluminium rings upon the legs of grouse and to return such as are found to the wvriter at the university of aber deen with a note of the place and date of shooting so by the united efforts of all who are interested we hope to throwv light upon the nature and extent of grouse movements and thus learn something of their causes
