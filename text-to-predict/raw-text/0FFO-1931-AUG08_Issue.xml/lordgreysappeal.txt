lord greysappealliberals and thegovernmenta policy that shouldceaselord grey of fallodon defined his per sonal view of the policy of the liberal party in the house of commons in a speech at embleton northumberland last nighthe eaid the view of the liberal members of parliament with whom i have been most in touch nvas at the beginning of this parliament that it would be a mistake to join with the conservatives in turning out the labour governmmet they felt that that government ought to have its chance that in fiscal policy they were more in agreement with the labour party than with the conservative party and that as regards foreign and indian affairs their expectation was that they would be able sincerely to support the action of the labour government this enpectation they consider has been fulfilled and as regards foreign and indian affairs they feel that there is no reason for any change of government but that on the contrary foreign and indian affairs and such questions as disarmament have been handled by the prime mtinister and the secre tary of state for foreign affairs with patience and skill and ability in this view i personally conecurwhere i am critical is as to the price which is being paid for keeping the labour govern ment in office in home affairs i think its policy has been damaging and in some ways little short of a disaster its coal legislation has greatly hampered and prejudiced the in dustry aid its action in forbidding such a tliing as the spreadover of hours when desired by both owners and men as being neces sary for the industry in a particular district is an instance of blind tyranny then as regards workmens insurance we areall agreed that where a man desires to work and cannot get the opportunity he should be given main tenance out of the workmens insurance fund btut it is not right to make it easy for men wvho refuse reasonable offers of work to get the dole and it is not fair that where men can earn in two or three davs  or £ w in wages they should be able to get the dole this can not seem fair to such men as the agricultural labourers who are getting less than £ a week for six days work and get nothing from the state whaiever but the government or at any rate the party which supports it shows no desire but a great reluctance to have these anomalies and abuses remediedstill more disastrous is the general policy of the labour party in demandinig increased expenditure without any regard to what the country can afford some members of the party seem to regard it as an object of policy to redistribute wealth by taxation if that were being done without diminishing the total wealth of the country it would not be so serioiis but if the result of this volicy be to diminish the total wealth of the countrv and to hamper trade it is leading to increased unemployment and to national bankruptcy which vould make everybody worse off and lower the general standard of living it is really tinme that this policy should cease and in the interests of the liberal party and of the country i urge that liberal members of par liament should not vote for what is contrary to their convictions in order to maintain the present government in office and that when the governiment introduices legislation which liberals cannot approve it is a mistake to enter into long negotiations with the govern ment with the object of arriving at a com promise defeat should be facedthe liberal party should state definitely vhat things it cannot support and must oppose and then leave it to the government to take wlhat action it thinks fit without any agreement or bargain with the liberal partyit will be stid and said with truth that this i will lead either to a defeat of the govern ment or to a breach with its own supporters i think this shouild be faced the government is a minoritv government and it ouglht not to introduce legislation wvhich is opposed to the vishes of the majority of the hiouse of coommons if it does introdluce such legisla tion it must face defeat in the house of commons wvithout recrimination it is open to the government to advise a dissolution of parliament if it is defeated but it is also open to it to recognize that when we are under a group system of government the government which is defeated on the particular measure that it introduces must be prepared to accept defeatliberal members attach importance to the maintenance of the foreign and fiscal policy of the present government the labour govern ment presumably attaches at least equal im portance to this policy if so it shouild be prepared in order to remain in office and carry on its foreign policy to make the sacrifices which are requiired of it in home policy it ought not to expect that liberal members should sacrifice their convictions rather than that the government should sacrifice its ur propre by refusing to accept any check in its honme policylet miie suim up the situation as i see it first the governiment must not be led to sup pose that because liberals support its foreign policy therefore thev can rely upon liberals in the last resort to keep it in office at all costs second the notion that the liberal party is keeping the government in office and voting sometimes for wvhat liberals cannot approve in order to secure a reforni bill sup posed as i think wrongly to be in the liberal party interest must be proved to be a mis conceptioni third the danger of the financial position of the country is so real and great that the liberal party should oppose increases of public expenditure and vote for a poliev of economy even if this involves the defeat of the government on all these three points there is miiisconception or ambiguity as to the real attitude of the liberal parliamentary party from every point of view both national and party it is essential that misconception and ambiguity should be cleared away for a strong independent tnited liberal party is the thing most to be desired and most lacking in the houise of commons todaylord grey referring to the report of the economy committee said it had shown how grave the financial situation was unless economies in national expenditure were effected ve should incur financial disaster poverty would be increased and thhe whole standard of living wvould be lowered the report had also shown how initensely unpopular economies wvouild be attempts woould be made to render anyone who advocated effective economies un popuilar and even odious because economies were disagreeable it would be asserted that they vere not necessary the way in which the situation disclosed by the report wvas faced would be a supreme test of the character first of the house of commons and then of the nation
