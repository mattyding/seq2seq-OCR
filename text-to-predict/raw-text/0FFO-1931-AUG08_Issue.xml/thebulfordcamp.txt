the bulford camepra re and infantryin trainingprom a mitary correspondentbulford aurg a two days visit to the large camp at bulford field has afforded me an excep tional opportunity of seeing under favour able conditions the training of three branches of the territorial army the ra the re and infantry the camp is commanded and administered by colonel e g st aubyn the brigade commander of the thi hampshire infantry brigade the units in question are the th army field brigade ra lieutenantcolonel a l symes the rd wessex divisional re colonel r b pitt and the th hampshire infantry brigade which contains the th hampshirebattalion lieutenantcolonel b e t parsons from winchester the thth lieutenantcolonel lord templemore from southampton the th lieutenantcolonel g r curtis from portsmouth and the th lieutenant colonel g h hodgkinson from the isle of wightspecial interest appears to be taken in these nits by higher authorities as i found among the names of past and prospective visitors those of lord marley undersecretary of state for war general sir reginald stephensirectorgeneral of the territorial army lieutenantgeneral sir cecil romer com mlandinginchief at salisbury and general

j t hildyard commanding the rd wessex division and colonel wv d stilvell the cr were in the camp going into aul ques tions of training and administration at the time of my visit in the old days such a galaxy of distinguished visitors would have meant a successioni of standardtype cere monial inspections interspersed by rehearsals and no training at all fortunately it ishe practice i these days for such visits to be preceded by a message to the effect that the authority concerned hopes that the training wllh go on as usual while he wavls roundthose hom war esperience has shaken outof the old eran    th freld brigade will take the units in order the lth fleld brigade are an  army brigade not be longing to the wessex division but their presence in camp has been sincerely welcomed they give the infantry of the th brigade for the flrst time since the war an oppor tunity of meeting gunners and of learning something about their methods during the second week there winl be tactical cooperation on an establishment of  the th field brigade st nd and rd batteries have a strength of  with  in camp and only one absentee without leave who may yet appear wvith the gunners as with the other arms in the wessex area august is not a good month for camp attendanre large numbers come from coast towns where the in habitants make a large proportion of their livelihood during the annual influx of holiday makers the guns in the brigade are drawvn by sixvheeled morris cwt iorries supplied by contractors from  onwards the brigade hope to have their own horses hired from contractors carrv the brigade and the battery staff although this is an apparent anomaly i have found both here and else where that horses are greatly preferred to contractorsupplied old motorcars the horse being a far better conveyance for crosscountry work excepting for a shortage of four the officer question has been very satisfactorily solved there is an adequate supply of good lorry drivers in the ranks it is more difficult to find good horsemasters in these days the training is practical and progressive the senior officers have war experiencein the rd divisional ie th th and th field companies i found a full complement of efficient officers but i gathered that engineers in civil life seldom in these days live permanently in one locality an essential for territorial army officers the work wvhich was very interesting included the construction of a horse wateringpoint troughs supplied from an overhead tank supported on wooden frames demolitions with explosives road miaking and bridging heavy liartel bridge the establishment is  the strength is s and the number in camp  both with the gunners and with sappers the proximity of bulford camp has rendered assistance by regular officers easy they have risen well to the occasionthe main bodywe now come to the main body in the camp the th hampshire infantry brigade which is making excellent use of the interest ing ground for small schemes eastwvard of crossings  a b and c  over the river avon the training is progressive beginning with the platoon and ending with an interbattalion operation with the raf cooperating a specialitv in this brigade is the brigade coin manders tactical test for a rifle company and a machinegun platoon from each battalionl i saw one of these in which a demonstration was given of defence by  ballets not bodies  by distributing machineguns in depth so as to sweep all the routes of approach one bour of this practical study of ground is worth six months of endeavour to learn anything about inifantry tactics from books the brigade commander had two staff college officers as able assistants this not being a  territorial year i think that the nd battalion of the hampshire regiment has achieved a record by sending six officers all the way from catterick to help their county brethren of the territorial army now that the relationship between regulars and territorials has become so inti mate i am inclined to wonder why the regular home battalions are not stationed nearer to their own county territorials much expense would thereby be saved and every year would become automatically a  territorial year with the present prevailing spirit the rule could not be universal for several reasons but it miglit be a rule with exceptionsunit strengthsthe nd battalion provides the brigade major major j le hunte staff captain and signalling officer and officers with the batta uons besides three xcos per battalion as machinegun and signalling instructors and for general help including assistance in umpiring with a peace establishment of  ot all ranks the numbers are for the th battalion a strength of  with  in camp for the thth a strength of  vith  in camp for the oth  and  and for the th  and  i have given the reason for the comparatively low camp attendance which is unavoidable i am told that employees are reasonably sympathetic in these hard days perhaps the territorial association will be able to increase the  strengths without lowering the standardscadets in campaddressing school cadets at the camp of the public secondary schools cadet association on mlarlborough downs common yesterdayafternoon genemtsl sir ciiarles ehrugtonsaid he knew the movement was going through difficult times but he was perfectly certain that if those who attacked the movement could only come to a camp such as that they would be ready togive their full support it was by means of such training as was given at the camp that the boys when they grew up and went into the various walks of life would find that they had great advantages they must ever remember the noble sacrifices made in the war because it was for the younger generation to make every effort to secure peace for the world they were the ambassadors of peace the movement helped youths to work together and help each other he thought the people of this country were realizing by degrees what the movement stood for and that boys like themselves in joining the cadet camr were working for the honour of their schoos so that they might become cleanliving anti useful men apart from any question of militarism whatever that might be many of the officers gave up their holidays to look after the cadets and that was one of the best forms of unselfishness he had watched the movement all round the country and in other lands and believed that in future they were bound to get the recognition and support they wanted because the false ideas concerning the movement were gradially disappearing
