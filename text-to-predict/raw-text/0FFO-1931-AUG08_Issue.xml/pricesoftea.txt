the food council set out in the report are as follow  ye have ossumedt that the object of the parliamentary question with which this in quiry originated was to ascertain whether the reductions in thle wholesale atictioll prices of tea have been fully passed on to the con giimer or have in part been retained by the wholesale andllor retail distributors a coom plete answer to this citiestion could be given onfly after the ascertainnient of the profits obtained on tea by a considerable nunmber of each of the classes of distributors apart fromn difliculties which miglht be experienced in se cuiring access to an adequate nuniber of accotints we anticipate thltt it would require conlsiderable investigation to determnine the proper allocation of costs to the tea trade of retailers most of wlhom are dealing also in other foodstuffs in the present circuimstances it has been riecessary for uis to rot tine ouir investigation to the records of auictioti end retail prices which have been published and the one conclusion which definitely emerges is fliatas the imlperial economic committee pointed out in their report of january   paragraph  the margins between average retail prices ministry of labour figures and the average costs of tea to the wvholesale distributor have widened considerably of recenit yearsfrom the information supplied to us by the scottish federation of grocers and pro vision merchiants assaciations it appears to us that thie coipotn sy stem of trading in tla bas little if anything to commend it froni the point of view of the consunoer the systemi lends itself to the method of trading described by the federation under which the qualitv of the article may be dlepreciafee to an extent wlhich the consumer cantnot gaiige it is how ever one whichl applies to a wide range of articles as well as tea and its prevention could only be effected by legislation
