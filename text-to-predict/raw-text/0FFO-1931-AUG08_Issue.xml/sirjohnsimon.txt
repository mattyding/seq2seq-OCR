sir john simon oneconoimlya test for democracysir john simon spoke on the subject of national economy at a meeting of his con stituents held last night at cleckheatonhe said that the mass of people still failed to realize the fuill gravity and extreme urgency of the financial and economic position of this country uinlike some other countries in europe wvhich took part in the war britain had gone through no constitutional revolution and no debasement of currency consequently there had been no such outstanding event to rivet public opinion but we had pursued a policy of deflation wvithout accompanying it by rigid economy or by a reduction in industrial costs and ve were now threatened with an economic and financial crisis of the first mag nitude the country would have to face the fact without further delay there had just been published the highest figure of unemplov ment ever recorded in this country over  per cent of the insured population this vast army of unemployed vas receiving sustenance without producing the exports which were supposed to pay for the imported food they consumedwe have now reached a point he con tinued  vhen serious concern is felt and expressed as to the balancing of future budgets last years budget was only balanced by contrivances and expedients which cannot be repeated nowv the report of the economy committee declares that to produce a properly balanced budget in  a gap of Â£ will have to be filled either by fresh taxation or by economy either alternative will be very unpleasant indeed it is obvious that the limits of direct taxation have been reached and the gap is not going to be filled merely by reiterating our fiscal conxictions i would very much sooner see the gap bridged byeffective economies than in any other wvay but i confess to the gravest doubt as to whether the present government is capable of effecting economies on the scale that would be needed socialism is a creed which believes there is a positive virtue in spending public money the doctrine of the bottomless purse will only land us in the bottomless pit if the government takes up the report of the economy committee and enters upon a national and allembraeing effort to reduce expenditure unpopular as that reduction is bound to be it is entitled to have the good will and the cooperation of all parties in parlia ment if on the other hand under pressure from its own followers or conferences it shirks the duty which now rests upon it no other consideration could justifv the house of commons maintaining it in office but though the situation calls for a national effort it is tllo governments duty and responsibility to put forward its proposals adequate to the nced if the proposals of the economy com mittee do not as a whole meet with the approval of the government then the onus rests upon the government to produce alterna tive proposals if it fails to do so then in the interests of the country it must make way for another governments the time for drift and other excuses for commissions and committees has come to an end the present financial situation is not only a test for political parties it is a test for parliament and a test for democracy the supreme test for democracy is whether it will stand being told the unpleasant truth and the supreme test for statesmen is wvhether they will dare to tell people the unpleasant truith that is the issue onv which our future dependsreferring to india sir john said that the best hope for a solution of the britishindia problem was to appreciate that up to the present the roundtable conference had not solved any of the difficulties it had merely stated what some of them were any agree ment already reached on any point was only provisional we should abandon phrase making and examine the hard practical facts of the problem and invite indian politicians to examine them too
