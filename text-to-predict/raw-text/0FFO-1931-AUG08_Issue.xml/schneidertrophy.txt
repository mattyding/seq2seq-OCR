schneider trophyofficial plans forthe racethe official arrangements of the royal aero club for the schneider trophy race on september  wvere announced yester day the race vill be flown over a triangular course above the solent and spithead as was announced in the times on april  the map given on that occasion indicated the turning points as being flxed at positions northeast of cowves north of st helens and close to the coast of west witteringthe order of starting will be deter mined by lot the first competitor nill be started at  and others at intervalsof  minutes before the race every competitor will be allowed  minutes inhiceh to carry out the navigability trials competitors may cross the starting line of the speed couise at ryde eitber on the ater or in fliaght but if as is customary they elloose the latter course they must not approach the starting line at a height of more thlan oooft tliis is intended to prevent competitors fiom gaining an un fair inmtial speed by divingl on to the course competitors are advised to take the fturning points at a height of at leastthe statement issued by the royal aero club saysthe western pylon will be on the rvde middle the southern pylon will be off st helens point aud the eastern pylon on the foreshiore of the eastern side of chichester harbour this circuit provides a course of  kilomnetres  sea miles or  land miles and will be flowvn round anticlockwise seven times the speed contest therefore being over a distance of  kilometres  sea miles or  land miles the club has de cided on this coarse after the most careful coni sideration of au the factors involved for the safe operation of highspeed scaplanes such as compete in theschneider trophy contest it is essential that the waters on which they operate shall be calm and protected wvith suitable tidal conditions and an investigation of other localities in the british lsles has shon that the solent and spithead is the only place which provides a sufficient expanse of protected water with the requisite conditions and at the same time is easily reached by spectators both in england and from abroad furthermore the locality lends itself to the efficient organization and conduct of the contest owing to the imme diate proximity of the naval port of ports mouth and the royal air force base at calshota continiuous contestthis years contest differs from that lield in  in that the preliminary trials immediately precede the speed tests and form part of one conitnuous contest the preliminary trials consist of a takeoff a climb to approximately ft and a landing and taxiing test of about two minutes durationi the competitor then proceeds direct to the starting line and enters the speed course in the interests of safety it is ossential that the area xvhere the preliminary trials take place shall not be overlapped by the speed course while racing the aircraft fly at a comparatively low height at times as low as looft or loft anid a risk of collision would ex ist wvere they to pass over the same area as that in wlich the aircraft are taking off and landing in the preliminary trials thie most stuitable expanse of water of sufficient size for the preliminarv trials is that stretch of water south of the entrance to southlampton wlater off calshot castle east of guirnard bay and stone point and west of the ryde middle this area therefore will be reserved for these trials and for the landing of each aircraft after completion of the con test the unrestricted use of this water has been made possible by the cooperation of the shipping companies and the southamptohl harbour board who have generously agreed to adapt the sailings of all ships on septenmber  so that both this area and the course itself shall be free of shipping betwveen  pm and  pm the port of soutlampton will therefore be closed during these hoursin order to leave the preliminary trial area clear it has been necessary to plot the speed course to the east of it and the triangular course chosen is that which w hile affording the best course from a flying point of view also gives the public an admirable view from several points of vantage in  a quadrilateral course was chosen but with the incrasing speed of racing aircraft a triangular course is preferable as the legs are longer and the pilots have only to find three pylons instead of four the contest has been timed to begin at  pm in order to obtain the best tidal conditions between the hours of  and  pm there will be plenty of water over all the sandbanks and in chichester harbour and conditioiis will be practically identical for both the first aircraft to start and the last in the event of postponement owinig to bad weather thc time of starting may have to be advanced the hour depending upou the day oan hich the contest is heldthe air ministry announes that portsmoulth aerodrome which is still under construction will be available for use on and after septem ber  and will be open for use by aircraft visitilng the locality for the schlneider trophy race a landing area measuring  vards from ne to sw and  yards from se to nw will be available
