holidays wellspenta dual experiencepromi a correspondntan annual holiday has become part of the life of an increasing number of people and at this time of the year few are without some opportunity of a respite from their ordinary work probably most men think first of the physical benefits of a holiday but each of us is a unity and the interrelation of body and soul is so intimate that we may believe that what affects the one must also have its influence on the other a wellspent holiday brings renewed life to the whole manthe least reflective person who finds himself in a strange place and occupied in new pursuits is conscious of a dual experience which has its owvn special character in new surroundings we find ourselves exercising powers which other vise might have lain dormant and unsuspected and what we really are becomes more apparent at least to others if not to ourselves perhaps most men on holiday display their more attractive and higher qualities it is at this time that they give free expression to their good humour and their desire that others should share their sense of freedom and fellowship the cynic may look with some thing akin to contempt at a holiday crowd and what appears to be its uncouth and vulgar enjoyment but a more sympathetic spectator will find that not seldom it expresses a desire that everyone should seize the fleeting chance of freedom frorn care no doubt some give rein to their worst passions to the loss of all self respect but these meet general condemna tion and remind us that there are always men and women who fail in their duty to others and to themselvesa holiday to most men seems to bring with it the offer of a new life and the consciousness of this must always be exhilarating they find not only in them selves but in others an undefined sense of enlarged powers of life this feeling may be evoked and expressed in different vays it is true that some seem to ring them selves round with barriers of reserve not unallied with suspicion of every stranger with vhom they are brought intocontact but such men forfeit much of a holidays satisfactions on the other hand manv of the truest and most pleasant friend ships are formed on a holiday and though for many reasons they may be shortlived they have their own satisfactions to those who share them men learn how their fellows live and how in spite of differences which must continue they are one in the deepest things of life thus many return home carrying in their hearts and minds memories which shed their own radiance over the drab conditions of their daily work and domestic life and with an enlarged experience they are more ready to appreciate the outlook of others and gain a truer conception of social well beingif the consciousness of unsuspected powers in himself and others is the first experience of a man on holiday it is accompanied by the recognition of his inability to get away from the person he knows himself to be in the routine of ordinary life we are what we are and change of circumstance seems only to make us the more conscious of this fact we may forget it for a while but sooner or later ve are brought back to it with a jerk we cannot get away from our selves we learn that the freedom which brings one of the highest pleasures of a holiday is after all scarcely less limited than it is while we are engaged in our ordinary avocations the conditions in which we find ourselves may be new but they hold us within their power and only as we accept them willingly can we hope to turn them into the means of worthy pleasure here we come upon the secret of all true happiness freedom must be with discipline our welcome to what is new must be combined with loyalty to what is familiar fresh experi ences must be tested by what we have proved to be true and good in common place duty wve learn to rejoice that life is all one and find that the worth of pleasure is most manifest in its develop mient of our capacities for happiness in the discharge of humdrum dutyeveryone is familiar with men vho have travelled widely and perhaps read much they are at home in many different countries and knowv several languages they like to think of themselves as good europeans or they may claim to be cos mopolitan no doubt they may render imlportant srvice both to their own country and to the countrics with which they are familiar by promoting that fellowship between nations which was never more needed than it is today yet experience shows that not infrequently they are strangely ineffective where we might expect them to be most useful so quick are they to express their sympathy with other peoples that they lose the power of identifying themselves with their own nation they arue like men who claiming to be tolerant of all religions have lost their real faith in any of them nationalism is capable of dangerous per versions and we must confess that some timnes it is made the excuse of inter national bitterness but equal harm is done by men vho with the plea that they are the friends of all nations become the enemy only of their owna modern philosopher has told us that a mans religion is determined by what he does with his solitariness in endors ing this dicttun it may be suggested that a holiday affords occasions for that with drawal into the silence wihich all need for their true wellbeing in the presence of natures beauty or power we may be carried beyond that vhich is visible to the mysterious source of all life and find a new joy in the realization of its presence it is an experience which nearly everyone shares and which everyone ought to wel come if we do this we shall find our selves as by a natural movement of our manhood roused in some degree at least to worship hiim by whom all things were made not until this sacramental vitness of nature has been accepted can wve claim to have gained all that a holiday offers of true vigour in soul and body
