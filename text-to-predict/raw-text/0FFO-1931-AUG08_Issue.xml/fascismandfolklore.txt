flowerin these words of signor berretta there is legitimate pride if much has been done by students and learned bodies for the study of italian popular traditions their actual revival in the daily

sendinaa circular to their local folklore comnittees the dopola voro  authorities were soon able to draw up a calendar of  popular festivals wvhich are still celebrated though often on a dwindling scale in various parts of the countrythe calendar is far fromn being ex haustive for example the piedi grotto celebrations at naiples are not mlentioned evidently as being too w ell known while only tio or three specimens are given of the many sicilian festivals these feste are as a rule held on the local saints days and the chief event is the procession in which the imagte of the saint is carried on an elaborately decorated wooden platform in most festivals sacred and secular elements are happily mingled the church epiphany cere nmonies arc usually followed by fireworks commemorating the star of bethlehemcarniva l festivitiescarnival on the other hand bears every trace of its pagan origin and is celebrated by masked processions and banquets at ponti near alessandria the villagers

is sup posed to be an index of the abundance of the forthcomiiing harvestwvooden towers of this kind are a coai mon feature in italian feste a huge tower called the  rua  is carried in pro cession in vicecnza on the feast of corpus domini wlhile large constructions known as  gigli made of wood and cardboard and painted with scenes from the life of san paolino parade the streets of nola near naples on the saints feast day a sound film of this festival lately exhibited in rome aroused great interest a highly ornate car used to be drawn in procession through the streets of palermio on the feast day of santa rosalia the praise worthy initiative of the  dopolavoro  in reviving it a few years ago was however unifortunate a slhort circuit procluced a fire in wlichl the saints image perished an accident to which were popularly attributed the subsequent bad crops and ether misfortunes which that year befell the city since then the  dopolavoro  otlicials have thought it wise to organize the festival wvithout the chariotand so in a calendar of varied and joyful feste the year passes by the naidens have thcir  may day the sea its own proper celebrations medieval pageants and races like the faiuous  palio  of siena alternate with rustic celebrations such as the blessing of the wheat at naro and episeopia as the ycar approaches its close we ponle to the festivals of the deadat palermo tho dead  are at thle same timle generous and unscrupulous for they steal toys and sweets and give theta as presents to the clildren at christmas every chuirchl and in the south almost every family has its titanger in romne the dopolavoro  eonstr ucted an enormous  presepio wvitli  moving figures including inen arid beasts worked by clectricitya mechanical masterpiece which if it rather shocked tie artistic sensibilities of their elders wvas a great success with the roman childrensonng competitiontsthere is no suggestion that the sur vival of these festivals is due entirely to the leisure hours institution somle of them are mentioned xvithout any lhint of their being in decline in dr ashbys some italian scenes and festivals but there were many otherssuch as the celebrations at orsogna dabruzzo in the basilicata and at campo basso to men tion only a fewvihich were tending to be neglected and which without the stimulus of offtcial encouragernent miglht even have disappeared the dopola voro has given fiesh life to many festivals by reviving the competitions for dialect songs as for example at the san giovanni festival in romle the prize winning songsin the last san giovanni celebrations as many as  composers received prizesare sung during the festi val and prizes are also given for the best decorated windows stalls and symbolical wagonslocal costumes dances and rustic bandsthese too are once more coming into their own at the san giovanni and  noiantri  festivals the pipes and bag pipes of the abruzzi played by the pic turesque  zampognari were heard once again after a lapse of many years in the streets of rome while the  saltarello the dance of the abruzzi hills nvas danced by men and girls in peasant cos tunne the pride taken by fascist italy in its heritage of lovely and dignified dresses was demonstrated by the national parade of local costumes organized by the dopolavoro  in rome on the occasion of the marriage of the prince of pied iuont  persons representing all parts of italy marched past the prince and his bride many of them offering simple gifts the produce of their fields or the work of their bands similar gatherings have been held in other centres particularly yenice and florence country steps aredanced to the music of rustic instruments and the folk songs of italy now tauglht in the schools are sunga highly successful folksong competi tion was held in rome in  under the direction of signor miascagri each choir was obliged to include in its programme a folksong of its own district folk music has fully justified its revival the characteristic bands of regona and the  ocarinisti  of porto maggiore are par ticularly successful while suchi folk choirs as the  canterini romagnoli  have paid several visits to rome wlhere thev were asked to sing before the king and queen songs of romagna as sung by these choirs have also been recorded in some beauti ful sound films by the cinespittaluga studios in rome by the initiative of the  dopolavoro  pliotographs most of them in colour have been taken of almost all the different peasant costumes of italy and of many of the most important folk festivals and celebrations while a national committee is now being set up in close collaboration with the league of nations for the scientific study of italian folklore
