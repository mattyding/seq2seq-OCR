watershed of the alaknanda and gangotri rivers apparently the first crossing of the range the expedition also climbed three peaks over ft high tlhree over oft and three over ft topo graphically a considerable area was ex plored and the complicated system of peaks and glaciers at the northern end of the range roughly miapped photo nietricallyhaving established our camp at ft we set about trying to discover a practicable pass over the range our camp was pitched on a rock ridgeseparating twvo glaciers bounded by peaks over ft in spite of previous obser vations and the situation of the camp which commanded glorious views east ward of kamet and other peaks we were still uncertain which of a complex series of ridges to the west constituted the actual watershed of the range at the head of a glacier southeast of the camp a wall of peaks dropped to a low ridge obviously accessible from this side and this we decided to explorebirnie holdsworth s hipton and myself left the camp soon after dawn on july  one hours walking up frozen snow brought us to the foot of the ridge and another  minutes easy scramibling ug rocks and snow to the ridge we ex perienced that subtle thrill which must have animated early alpine pioneers as re cautiously poked our heads over a sharp edge of rock and snow forming the crest of the ridge what would we see what surprises were in store thousands of feet of impassable precipices and ice slopes or perhaps a glacier leading tamely back to the side of the range and another more distant range to be crosseda great glacierwhat wve did see was a short steep snow slope at our feet dropping to the upper snows of a great glacier many niles long that swept dowvn in a southerly direction then curving serenely westwards out of sight through a portal of peaks the problem was solved the glacier before us could only join the gangotri glacier the height of the pass by the aneroid was ft but like our other heights can only be regarded as approximate and liable to considerable correction owing to the fluc tuations of the atmospheric pressure due to unsettled weatherholdswortlh decided to return to camp on ski and birnie descended to the un known glacier with the porter dorjee to attempt to find a new way back over the watershed to the glacier north west of the camp over a pass an indication of which was previously noted by holdsworth shipton and i decided to attempt to climb a peak rising directly to the northwest of the pass to obtain a more extensive view as this peak dorninated the head of the glacier we had ascended wallowing up a very soft snowy ridge and treading thankfuly the occasional intervening rocky sections we reached the sumnmit ft in a desultory snow squall but presently the hot sun burst through and we were able to laze on the top for two hours and now and again we were re warded with enchanting glimpses of the peaks betveen the shifting mist the most beautiful peak of all was the silvery snow and ice peak we had observed from the ft peak above the arva valley a peak of delicate yet superb beauty a queen among mountains wvo ploughed down through terrible snow in a heavy snowstorm to the campbirnie and dorjec did not return until several hours later they had crossed the pass back over the watershed to the north of our peak into the glacier northwest of the camp a fine feat considering the snowvstorm and poor visibility birnie reported that the route lias dangerous and menaced by hanging glaciers only discemnible when the miist lifted monien tarily to recross the watershed they had to descend a steep rock and ridge of ice owing to mist they were unable to find the pass indicated by holdswvorth but saw it later and it appeared devoid of difficultyup a oft peakimmediately southeast of the camp on the opposite side of the glacier rose one of the finest peaks in the district possess ing the grace and symmetry of the miatterhorn this we decided to attempt the th dawvned sullenly with sluggish monsoon mists and shipton and i with niina a porter had scarcely crossed the glacier when it started snowving how ever we pushed on intending to prospect as far as possible the way lay up a steep slope ft high guttered and scored by avalanehe debris to an obvious col kieking steps up the good snow we gained the eol without difficulty there we wvere met by a biting snowcharged wvind causing us to cower under a rock shivering and numbed we stuck it out for over an hour but the weather even tually forced us to retire and we trudged disconsolately back to camp through the usual vile snowthe next day the attack wvas renewed birnie and dorjee the porter starting an hour later than we did the weather was better but the snowv was not crusted suffi ciently to prevent us from sinking knee deep every other step an exhausting process at any altitude from the ol easy snow slopes culminated in a short steep slope leading to the crest of the eastern ridge of the peak this ridge con sisted of ft of hard ice thinly

remote fiom the world peaks unknown peered at us through misty windows dark rock preci pices glared out through ragged rents in storm clouds and fiom the dim glacier abysses came the solemn roll of avalanches once wve caught a glimpse of the gangotri glacier and its stony union with the unnamed glacier on the far side of our new pass returning we met birnie the snow had softened on the ice and great care was necessary birnie found it necessary to cut many steps and only reached the sumnmit after some hardworkour descent was marred by an accident shipton and i decided to glissade down the steep snoxv slope below the col lead ing to the glacier by the time the col was reached the sun had disappeared behind clouds and the snow was crusted with frost such a condition in the alps is always safe as the crust prevents the snow from slipping i started off first dowvn the slope glissading in a sitting posi tion i was somewhat surprised there fore to find the surface crust unable to hold the sodden snow beneath wlhich started sliding in front of me this in itself wvas nothing as it frequently occurs that the glissader starts a small slide in front of him but when the slide attained the dimensions of a formidable avalanche i decided to stop myself this was easily accomplished as i wras above the avalanche by driving my axe into the snowwave of snow blocksi had almost stopped avhen i heard a rushing sound above me looking up i sawv a wave of snow blocks bearing down on me i wvas overwhelmed and strugghng amid a chaos of swiftly sliding blocks i have a dim memory of momentary darkness and suffocation and then of suddenly finding myself on the surface of the avalanche as far as pos sible i adopted a swimming position lying on my back while driving the axe wrhich i had clung to into the firm snow beneath the avalanche in a vain attempt to stop myself but this availed little and i was borne irresistibly downwvards the avalanche became larger as the snow on either side uas caught up by it and added its quota of wveight and power provided the avalanche swvept dowvn on to the slopes below without being inter rupted i felt reasonably sure of keeping on the surface but to my dismay i suddenly saw it bearing me straight for a bergschrund at the foot of the slope the bergschrund at this point consisted of a gaping crevasse with a wvall of ice ft high forming an upper lip desperately i drove in the axe but if this failed me at least it slightly braked me and enabled the most dangerous portion of the avalanche to pass on ahead i then sawv a solid wave of snow shooting like a waterfall over the bergschruend and the next moment i wvent wvith itit was here that the speed of the avalanche saved me for instead of pour ing into the bergschlund and taking me with it and burying me in the depths of the crevasse as did the avalanche that killed six porters on everest it shot several yards over it i must have been thrown ft but remember no shock on alighting below the bergschru nd a few more yards and the head of the avalanche suddenly stopped where the slope eased off but the rear of the avalanche was still pouring over the berqschrund and pressing on the front portion miy position resembled that of a passenger in a telescoping train there wvas a creaking sound as the snow blocks squeezed together and consolidated i experienced a terrible pressure just as i thought i must be crushed like an egg slhell the pressure ceased somehow i managed to free my body and legs from the snoxv as i did so i saw nima gaily glissading dowvn the track left by the avalanche straight for the berqschrund wvith my last riemaining energy i was able to utter a shout of warning and then col lapsed utterly winded shipton and nima soon joined me and rubbed my hands which had lost all sensation into life againit appeared that shipton like me not realizing the danger had started glissading on his own account like me he had started an avalanche and stopped himself but his avalanche had swvept down upon me it wvas a curious accident serving to show how different are himalayan conditions from alpine an alpine slope is safe once it has been avalanched but in the himalaya layers of old snow periodically avalanche as thev become sodden by tho almost vertical midday sun in this case so sodden had the snow become that even the surface crust had been unable to prevent the slope from avalanchinamr siytheis injuriesit tvas a miserable procession that wended its way to camp in a heavy snowstormii and had it not been for the steps made by shipton in the soft snow i could not have got there unaided at theo camp greene diagnosed one broken rib and severe bruising of the thorax and stomach muscles by tlle crushing effect of the avalanchethe following day a snowstorm kept us in our tents nowv ve planned that we should split into three selfcontained partiesholdsworth and shipton to continue the exploration of the immediate district and endeavour to climb more peaks beauman and greene to descend to amana and ascend the alaknanda valley and birnie and i to cross the watershed to the gangotri glacier and endeavour to force the pass to the soutlh and back into the garhwal and preferably into the alaknanda glacier system the next morning beauman and greene left for the lowver valley camp while birnie and i and nine porters left in a mild snowstorm for the pass i started not feeling particularly fit and presently found it necessary to turn back just before the pass owing to anoxaemia caused by the bruised thorax intense breathlessness snpervened and on the wav back i fainted through being unable to imbibe sufficient oxygen and was more or less carried into camn by three porters who returned with me from the camp the porters carried me down to the lower camp to which beauman and greene had descended earlier when i soon recoveredthe expedition has now assembled at badrinath before starting towards ranikliet all the members are verv fit tho same day as the avalanche peak was climbed beauman greene and holdsworth ascended a fine rock peak ft higlh to the west of the camp a long rock ridge oft high vwas ascended the rock being very loose but in places good climbing was encountered oving to thick cloud there was no view holdsworth enjoyed skiing down the glacier sweeping past his companions who perforce toiled through porridge like snow
