colchicumcorms for presentplantingfromi a correspondentsome day when the corms of the little croatian variety of colchicuin mnontanum find their way from the gardens of the few to the popular bulb lists gardenerswill realize that this treasure is one of the most precious of the many new hardy plants of recent years in thle popular eye it will probably never compare with the more showy autumnalflowering colchicurn auttuinalethe socalled autumn crocus or meadow saffronvhich wvill make so lovely a picture of mlerseyside meadows some weeks hence but the comparison is that of the feathered henyard king and the bantam cock for the croatian colchicum is the essence of elegant neat nesssuperficially not unlike that of a crocusyet distinguished from it by the more  globular shape of the flower and the eom parative lack of the slender stem that leaves the earlyflowering crocuses so much at the mercy of our winter weatlher the white bloom has the inestimable virtue of endurance and it can be said of very few earlyflowering crocuses that they hold their petals unsullied by the weather for a month as this variety of colchicum held them at the beginning of this year since the plant was introduced by the late w r dykes more than  years ago it has showvn its independence of the terrors that our winters mete out to plants that ushei in the garden year those wise gardeners who trouble to keep and sow the seed of this firstling of the year vill be pleasantly surprised at the occasional appearance of a seedling with rosetinted petalsanother colchicum that should soon be more often seen is the only yellowflowered species knownc iuteuman indian beauty familiar to those who know the viceregal garden at sirmla or have travelled the road to srinagar before the snows of kashmir have begun to melt hardly new in the sense that the croatian colchicumn is newfor it made its bow here nearly  years agothe indian species has never been common in england hut now that plants are coming so freely from the generous rulers of kashmir and nepal this fine little plant should find a welcome in every alpine plant house in the country and later perhaps in gardens as wellthe autumnflowering species and varieties of colchicum are far more showy than the pair already mentioned and include in their number one that takes the highest rank among hardy plantsthe whiteflowered variety of colchicum epeciosutin it is not at all difficult to grow and in soils that are not heavy or cold increases quickly horticul turally the one drawback to the plant is the weakness of the tall stem which topped by a tuliplike bloom that catches the wvind like a balloon goes by the board in an october gale or deluge it rarely seems to occur to those who grow c speciosum and its albino variety that if a colony of them is not to resemble a regiment of tin soldiers movn down by the welldirected peas of toy cannon each can be kept upright by a tiny wire support no doubt it is a troublesome job and an impos sible one where the plants are numbered by hundreds but with the comparatively small batches of colchicum speciosum usually seen in gardens those who have not tried the plan will fnd the trouble amply renaidthere is an almost endless choice of varieties and hybrids of c autumnnale and c speciosum and few indeed of theni are not vorth having there is one called ritbrutit another glory of heemstede is coloured a deep mauve  and a doulble lilacmauze bloon well named water lily is v ery lovely borninulleri is another beauty generally and as one may see with c auitumnale which is a comoaratively common native plant they are not for hot dry places but for cool moistthough not wet situations in gardens amateurs should strive for some place where the first blasts of the equinoctial gales do not lay them prone naturally the corms are found deep down but in gardens it is usually sufficient to plant themu with the tip of the corm an inch or so deep planting of the species and varieties of colchi cum should not be delayed a day and those who are not familiar with their habits should remember that the autumnalflowering plants throw up their leaves in spring wrhen as they are large and coarse they may be a nuisanlce if not rightly placed
