the vegetable plottreataient of celerythe wetness of the season has helped the growth of celery and the early crop which was probably planted during mfay or early june will now need earthing or blanching in another way the first moulding is due now and should be done when the soil is moist but not vet if the soil is too dry give a good water ing a day before mouldinig begin by tyinig the plants to make the work the easier tie the string round the first plant in the row and then pass il round the next plant and so on with the other plants tiu the end of the row is reached when the string should be secured in position when the moulding is completed release the string and it wvill be useful again cut away all bad and short leaves and remove all suckerous growths then clear the trench of weeds and cut down some soil from the sides of the trench and press it against the stems of the plants but not so high as to get into the heart of the plants or rotting may resulta plan which has much to commend it is to band the stems of the plants with stiff paper passing it round the stems and allowing an overlap secure it in position by tying it at the top and bottom and if you wish then add the soil celery which is likely to be used before the arrival of severe frost might be blanched entirely by this means without adding soil but if it has to stand the winter the addition of soil is needed as a protection from frost it usually takes from four to six weeks to blanch celery the later batches of plants wvill not yet need moulding but celery nmoulded now will need more soil or more paper added after a few weeksas with most other vegetables there are special diseases and pests which attack celery the maggot of the celerv fly is very troube some and difficult to deal with if it has been allowed to get headway the maggot is in the leaves and therefore not easily reached by spraying if it is feared that the pest will bo troublesome the best method is to spray the plants when they are first pricked off wvith weak sootwater till they are planted occa sional sprayings also of some bitter insecticide such as quassia extract will make the foliage distasteful to the flies which lay their eggs in the inner folds of the leaves watch carefully for the first appearance of the pest and pick off and at once burn all affected leaves continue this policy and the pest should be kept at bay the pest attacks parsnip leaves too there are also leaf diseases of the celery which have been very troublesome of late years the disease is said to be present in the seeds and now many firms treat their seeds before sale with chemicals to eradicate it try to get such seeds but do not rely entirely on this treat ment especially if there has been a previous attack even before any signs of the disease which is more likely to lbe prevalent in a wet season are visible spray the plants with bordeaux or burgundy mixture wlhich may now be bought in powder form from any horticultural sundriesman and should be used according to the directions given spray several times at intervals of about  or  days making a special effort to get beneath the leaves and using a fine misty spray this will not actuauy kill the disease if it be present but is a preventive if there are already diseased leaves they should be picked off and burnt when once there is an attack it is better to burn all the remains of the crop as well as the waste matter which comes from the kitchen and in the fouowing year to set the rows some dstance from the previous site
