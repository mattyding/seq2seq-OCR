adventures on thejourneya test of endurancefroal our aeronauical correspondentmr maollison made it clear in conversa tion yesterday that his journey was the outconle of very careful preparation and was undertaken wvith a full knowledge of some of the difficulties it was likely to involve at grosvenor house he gave me the full story of his experiences and while taking a modest view of his ownn share in the achievement reluctantly agreed that he felt the limit of human endurance had probably been reached on this flightho wias still suffering from inflarned eyes and eyestrain due to long flying in the later stages of the journev without goggles he confessed that for night flying when lie was doing his best to pick up diu landmarks he preferred not to wear goggles but the loss of them when they were blown overboard several days before the end of the fliht meant that in the dust and heat and glare his eyes were badly tried but all the way through ho was less concerned with his own physical condition and comfort than with the care of ius engine and aeroplane and with the navigating of a good course either by landmnarks or by means of his instruments he flew everv night except itwo when the monsoons in the federated mtalay states siam and bturma renderedtills too dcangerous and he had taken eare to sving his compass so precisely that it had an error of only half a degree on anv northerly or wvesterly course the only direetions wvith which he wvas concerned even this care did not save hiin fronm involuntary deviation wvhen conditions were bad as his experience in eastern syria in a dust storm showedlost over the desertdescribing that nights flying ir mollison said i was followving the course of tle euphrates in the moonlight it was practically the onlv thing on the ground which i could see and which would give me a direction but the winud was blowing strongly and raising the dust and aifter a tine the layer of dust beneath me blotted out the river and i had to go on relying only on a compass course i flew on until daybreak and by that time was far out over the desert i might have gone manamiles without seeing any place or person but fortuniately i came upon an encampment of nomadic arabs and lauded to ask their lhelp they thought i waas frencl of course because the frenclt uise aeroplanes a great deal for the policing of syria but thev could understand nothing i said and i could not understand thenii got out my map and hoped they would be able to show nme wvhere i was i pointed to places on it and said is this here  or w lhichl direction is this   but i ala afraid they had never seen a man before anid wve didnt get on verv fast theu i said  wlich way is deirezzorr  repeating the name several times and pointinig towards the south eventuallv bv signs i managed to anther that that was myiv way and i took off again theycontinued on page  column mr mollisons flightcontinued from page  column did not seem at all surprised to see me they gave me water and arab cigarettes i dont know to this day just where i wvas or how far off my course but i consider myself lucky to have found that encampment and not to have gone wandering over the desert with little idea of what direction i ought to takemlr mollison not only lost his goggles in the east but flie also left his kit of tools in snriaa sign of increasing fatigue as the journey went on at every stop he had an hours work on his engine cleaning the oil and petrol filters changing the plugs checking the valve clearances and satisfying himself generally that both engine and aeroplane were fit for the next stage at one of his calls he follonved his usual routine but he was sleepy and weary and he just forgot to pack up his tools again and stow thenm in the acro plane fortunaicly by this time he was approaching wellequipped aerodromes and he wvas able to borrow the tools lie needed at his later ports of call so that his aeroplane did nrot suffer from the lossin a jungle clearing he had already had his misfortunes on the earlier part of his flight the forced landing on his first day out he confessed frankly was the result of trying to do too mueh he had intended to land first at sourabaya but he got there with tlhree and a half hours of daylight before hirm and another  miles to go to batavia the next suitable spot for a landing in the enthusiasm and vigour of uis start he decided to go on hoping to reach the dutch aerodrome safely this was the only time throughout the flight on wlhiil he took the risk of a night landing with out having first assured himself tlhat his landing place would be lighted and properly prepared for night flying at batavia he found no lights and no means of recognizing the aerodrome when he camne over it after flying round for some time he discovered a party of natives working in a jungle clearing with the help of flares and after circling low over the place to satisfy himself that lie could mnake a landing he came dowvn suffering nothing wvorse than a collision with a small tree wvhich broke a rib in the leading edge of one wing here again le found help when he needed it wvhile the air man repaired his machine the headmnan of the village from which the natives came mobilized all the inhabitants and set them to work clearing a yards runwvay in order that mlr mlollison might take offby this time the aerodrome officials at batavia had been warned and the landing field lighted so that he might recognize it and eventually he sailed off again skim uing the tops of the jungle trees to cover the o miles between his landingplace and bataviatwo days later he ran into the worst of his trials the monsoon weather along the coasts of malaya and burma he had been warned of this before he left wlynd ham he had been told in fact that he would have to plough through the monsoons all the way from rangoon to calcutta actually he did meet two days of monsoon weatther but it extended onlv from alor star to akyab and he was very thankful that it went no fartherdescribing those two days mir mlollison saidthe heavy rain made it impossible for me to see any distance and my heavy load of petrol prevented me from attempting to climb above the clouds and to fly blind i had no choice therefore bht to follow the coast flying over the sea and keeping the dim coast line close on my right hand sometimes i could not even see the coast so thick was the rain during those spells i found myself rollinig and diving anid sometimes being driven up wards and if i had not had a bank and turni indicator i should have felt very uncomfort able but i regard an aeroplane without a bank and tuirn indicator as incomnlete and though i was a little anxiouis when i had no horizon to fly by i wvas pretty certain that i could keep the machine iunider control pro vided i had suifficient height to recover from these unstable conditionsa check in persiathat happened when i was approaching ivan goon and the monsoon was with me then for twvo days all the way across india and alonlg the persian gulf the weather remained very hot and i was getting steadily niore aild more tired then to complicate natters th oflicials in persia were inclined to cause trouble i had been warned abotit thei before i left and advised to produce the lettei i was carrying from the lord alayor of sydney whbich bore a large and impressive looking official stamp wvhen the persian ilcial turned up with his file of soldiers with fiyed bayonets i thought it better not to attempt to overawve him with the lord mavors letter llis chief anxiety appeared to he to inispect my bill of health as i had no suclh thing i wondered what might happen hut found that by paying a fabulous nulmber of persian rowns worth about a penny each i could be presented with a persian bill of health without medical inspection or anything else so that wvas what i did and came awvay without any more troubleeverybody else on the route mr mollison said had been most helpful and had waived au sorts of formalities in order to let iim get on he admitted that he wvas flying at night without navigation lights and was thereby breaking the inter national flying regulations he might have been delayed by customs autlhori ties and on many pretexts but he was allowed to go on everywherespeaking of the preparations for his flight mr mollison said he first considered the project about a year ago with the help of mr c t ulm managing director of australian national airways he pie pared a guidebook for the flight showing particulars about all the aerodromes about prevailing winds on different parts of the route the times of sunrise and moonrise stocks of fuel an engine inspec tion schedule and a host of other usefuil details he had also carefully mapped out his flight to a schedule whichi would have landed him in england a day sooner than lie actually got here but towards the end fatigue defeated these welllaid plansi had to slip it a bit towards the finish he said and what is more i had to overwork the engine for several days i have been rilnning the engine on full throttle and it has behaved wonderfully it never failed all the war through and there has been no replacement other than plugs and no adjustments except those involved in the ordinary routine inspectionthe airman also paid a tribute to the faith lord wakefield showved in him in continuing his help after mr mollison had crashed the machine at darvin on june  i imust have seemed like a bad invest ment he said  but lord wakefield showed a really sporting spirit in helping me to have the aeroplane rebuilt and to mnake another attempt he added that the engine had averaged  miles to the gallon throughout the flight the supplies ef fuel laid dowvn for him at gwvadar and bandar abbas had to be taken across the desert on camelsfinally mr mfiollison expressed agree nent with the opinion in a leading article in the times of yesterday that given a fast air miail machine a postal service between england and australia could be maintained on a nine days chedule he said he hoped such a ser vice would be set up by great britain mnd would not be left to
