territorial armytrainingi the th divisionpursuit of an enemy inretreatfrom our special correspondenteastbourne auc a violent thunderstorm during wed nesday night and heavy rain yesterday morning reduced the camps of the th division at wannock to what mr mantalini would have described as a  demd moist unpleasant  condition training was suspended mterday while all hands did their best to remedy the situation the queens westminsters had to repitch many of their tents and dry blankets were obtained from dover for the menmall these troubles were forgotten this morning when the sun shone again for the one largescale exercise which had been artanged for the division this year a scheme had been very carefully pre pared in detail by majorgeneral r d f oldman and his staff its primary objects were to study the handling of an advanced guard in pursuit of a retreat ng enemy and on the other side the handling of the rearguard of a force retreating and ordered to carry out a withdrawal when in contact with the enemyune torce advancing from the north was commanded by lieutenantcolonel w h llamsbotham of the artists rifles and was represented by the th infantry brigade and ertain other units real and imaginary on the other side fighting with his back to the sea and to his own battalions splendidly situated camp on the heights near friston was lieutenantcolonel h j sanders of the th london regiment the queens both commanders had the benefit of air observatior provided by machines of no  ac squadron raf the mornings war opened with a spectacular display by a flight wvhich swooped down upon wannock about  am and machinegunned the troops as they were leaving campto describe in detail the progress of attack and counterattack would be as impossible as to answer the invariable question of the pri vate soldier who won sir   even from such vantage points as windover hill with the weald of sussex spread out behind and the roling downs of the battlefield in front the picture could not be seen as a whole since the division has no artillery with it this year even the smoke of the guns was wanting though the artiller represented by offcers specially detailed as commanders played an important part in the schemechanged infantry tacticsbut many useful lessons were taught chief among them was the change in infantry tactics brought about by the mechanization of the batt lion and the use of armoured fighting vehicles general oldman fresh from experi ence in command of a mechanized brigade at aldershot is a firm believer in the inevitability of mechamzation not merely in the striking force but throughout the territorial army if it should ever have to take the field unfortu nately the territorial infantry has as yet no mechanical vehicles on its establishment and the first line transport is stil horsedrawn the battalions of the grey brigade however have been mechanized during the present camp so far as their machineguns are concerned the queens westminsters have had the use of two burfordregresse machinegun carriers lent bv the th rifles which were activelv ernployed with ths advanced guard today the other three battalions have been utilizing hired fourwheeled vans for the purposethroughout todays operations much use was made of green flags representing anti tank guns and brown and yellow flags re presenting forward guns of battalions in armoured carriers in the latter case of course a flag is a poor substitute for the real thing from the training point of view it is to be hoped that before long the financial situation may have recovered enough for a battalion to have at least one vehicle capable of working across countrycommanders and junior ranks in the oppos ing forces and especially the umpires drawn argely from units of the division will have added much to their store of tactical know ledge a wandering spectator carries away some pictures of the lighter side of war one is of the nd brigade battalions marching home along the green valley from jevington with the rd london east surreys who recently won the divisional transport com petition singing tipperary  apparently as fresh as paint another is of the cyclist with a large green flag who either from determina tion to die in the last ditch or because he had forgotten that he was an antitank gun and gone to sleep in the said ditch had got mixed up with a machinegun post of the west minsters the order for his obliteration which might not have been so easy if he had beenthearmouredvehicle he pretended to be would no doubt have been given with even greater promptness if the sergeants mouth had not been full of haversack ration here and there one saw incidents that were not quite according to plan especiauy in the patches of close country that made concealment easy london scottish bonnets would appear in posi tions that mystified the umpires for it takes niore than a red flag to stop some of these grey brigade infantrymen once they get going some of the sappers too leaving the imaginary blowving up of bridges to what an umpire described as the astral bodies of two field companies did some very dashing and well directed work as infantryfinally there will remain in my memory the picture of a small prisoner from somewhere in south london who was being put on hi way to his units camp by a kindly offlcer he had finished the battle far from home but wais by no means  fed up though rather anxious about the future probably with good reason for with him had been captured his company commanders watch which he had been given to carry and which he now regarded ruefuly on his wrist
