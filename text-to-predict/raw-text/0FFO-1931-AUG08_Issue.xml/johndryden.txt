john dryden the poet borna man of histimethree hundced years ago tomorrow there was born a poet the stocka family of pro vincial landed gentry with a baronetcy on both sidesmnay seeni a little unlikely to yield poets but english poetry has sprung from rnany a strange origin and although he has often been coupled with pope in the question whetlher either of them wvas a poet at all study only makes it more indubitably plain that none was ever more certainly a poet born than was john drydenthere is not muclh record of his infancy having lisped in nurnbers as a kings scholar at westminster school he xiiade some verse trans lations from the classics which his great head master dr busby liked well enough to keep and wrote an elegy upon a schoolfellow tha young lord hastings w hichl waÂ£s rather better than most of the otlher tributes at trinity college cambridge he wvrote a complimentary poem on a friends book without revealing a spark of his future glory but all this time lie was studying and preparing himself for his lifes work in  his father died and he inherited a small estate in his native northamptonslhire he did not go and live upon it he stayed probably at cambridge working iand that was well because john dryden wlho was cer tainly a poet born was no less certainly a poet nmadehe was a poet a writer born in the sense that fato and his ambition combined to deter mine himin to that very honourable course and also in the sense that with hini everything turned to literature to expression in words he was acutely sensitive to the thoughts and feelings all about him to wihat is called the spirit of the age he was a man of his time and respoiided to every little current that blew upon it but others than writers have that sensibility dryden added to it the imnpulse the coampulsion as it might almost be called to set his thoughts and feelings down in words when lie was nearly seventy lie could writethoughts such as they are come crowding in sco fast upon iime that nmy only difficulty is to chuse or to reject to run them into verse or to give theni the other harmony of prosethe spirit of the agemanv niien avoid all imputation of incon sistency by keeping soimie of their thoughts to themselves the born writer like dryden must out with thern and if like dryden he hiappens to be exceedingly sensitive to the move ments of tlhought and feeling about him he is sure like dryden to be called a turncoat and other hard namiies in this case the lhistory of the poet made in dryden is mnuch like that of the poet born he was for ever seeing new ways making experiments changing hiis mind about the technique of his art and searchling back for thea principles on wlhieli to found and by which to justify his attempts like lichael drayton a century befdre himl he wvas con tinually feeling the public pulse and giving the public wvlhat he thought it wanted but con tinually giving it something a little better a little fartlher advanced than it wvas prepared for for  years he laboured doggedly on in a turnioil of success and failure praise and blame and beginning stiffly pedantically  conceitedly in a stiff pedantic and  con ceited  period he grew in grace in stature and in power to the verv end one of his secrets was the sincerity and generosity of ihis appre ciation of others literatture his wits a timne of iliuch controversy between ancients and niodeiis between  the last age  wvhichl meant the elizabethan and jacobean and the present betweeni frenclh and english and so forth the strengtth of dryden and one of the peculiarities in hini whlielh were not inuch liked wvas his power of distinguishing the good in both sides he understood shakespeare better than any nman of ihis tinle yot none was so eager to wiil for the english dramia every drop of advantage that could be squeezed out of the classical and the french iiiodelsit is easy iow to see how obnoxious lie was in days of high feelingr to the charge of inicon sistency or of worse the drydens were croin wvellites and wheon the protector died jolhdryden wrote a set of heroic stanzas in the imietre best known as that of grays elegy two years later he produced a poem astraea redux celebrating the happy restoration iind return of his sacred majesty chiarles ii people hmave written as if dryden was the only man who changed his minid about the mnluarchy betwee the deaitti of cromiwell and the restora tion and it was even said that in the heeroic stanzas lie had cominnended the murder of king charles i a careful reading of those stanzas shows that his praise of cromwell is guarded the spirit of the tiime speaking through this born writer lamented a mian indubitably great but soniethinigwimetier it vere instinct or judg inentkept liini fromn untenmpered enthusiasm thus early in hiis poetic career he is seen laying himself open to attack but also revealing to those who look closely a fundiuliental stabilitv of thought which keeps iun one poet one character one personality through all hiis very various responses to the spirit of his acrethe new dramaone thiiig very badly wvanted by his ageor ratlher by the courtly and aristocratic section of it to which he belonged by birth and by marriage vas a new sort of dramiia and into the draima even while feeling that it was work  to wlhich my genius nover imlulic inclined me dryden plunged  dryden said hazlitt bluntly had no dramllatic genius either in tragedy or comedy  and his plays are  one continued and exaggerated commonplace they suggestedi lo schlegel a man walking on stilts in a morass only at great length could hazlitt and schlegel be questioned very few would care to dispute with them about drydens comedy and the field of combat about his heroic and other tragedy is so thick witli slings and arrows that it is but human to run away into shelter and there to think over one or twvo points tlumt are not controversial one of those points is that the tragedy most admired by our own tirme is that which most horrified otur fathersall for love which is the tragedy of antony and cleopatra another point is that all this labotur on rhyme and blank verse helped very greatly to the polisliing refining and tempering of a form which had grown sadly flaccid and straggling in the years before the rebellion and best of all perhaps it is through the plays that wve have drydens songs and drydens prologues and epilogueswas dryden a poet  a score of pure lyric snatches out of the plays are there to prove him a very songbird and though some of tho prologues and epilogues like much in the comedies are gross not pope lumself has achieved in so small a compass so imuch grace wit and wisdomyet all this was to dryden but a preparation or a substitute for his proper work that work was the writing of an lheroic poemi an epic either national or ultranational to that task he felt himself dedicated almost as proudly s miilton did but poetry or literature takes strange wvays wvith lier servants and it may vell be that drydens failure to vrite that poem is a proof that he was not able to do it worthily at the height of his career as playwright heboped to  make the world some part of einends formany ill plays by an heroicpoein the subject of which was to be great and the storv english and nearly  years later he looked back upon the subjects which he had alvays biad in mind king arthur con quering the saxons  the black prince subduing spain and restoring it to the lawful ruler  and upon the eelestial machinery of guardian angels in wlhich he sawv a great and neglected force for christian epic and the reason why he had never written the poem was that in king charless reign his salaries end pensions as poet laureate and his toriographer royal wvere always in arrear end that at the revolution he had lost them all that is not an excuse wvicll posterity can accept as valid dryden did not vrite his epic because he could not seclude himself from the excitements and the interests of busy daily life it is even possible that his annus mirabilis thelong poem which hoe wrote about the won derful year  had been a warning to him but only to have had and to have cherishled the great ambition distinguishles this man of his age from men who are only of an age and not for all time as wvellpolitics and religion about the time when he was writing all for love and also the most despicable f hlis comedies the busy daily life be came more exciting and interesting than ever the year  was the year of the popish plot politics and religion became completely intertwvined next year the commons resolved on excluding the duke of york from the succession and in  they passed the exclusion bill wlhichi the lords rejected and in the following year  sliaftesbury was prosecuted for treason in his support of the duke of monmouth and the grand jury of whig gish london thriev out the bill the effect of this political and religious tur mnoil upon dryden wvas to give hlim a great newv range of expression religion and politics became the channels through which his genius must flow and he wrote  absalom and aehitoplhel with its noble king and its gallant misguided prince and with achitophel or shaftesburv the evil counsellor and buekingham and cer tain others immortalized whether justly or unjustly in wellknown passages of what remains at once the keenest and the noblest satire in the english language whlien shaftesbury wras acquitted his friends struck a medal in his honour and dryden made of that medal a shame and a laughingstocknever did art so well with nature strive nor ever idol seenid so much aliveso like the man so golden to the sight so base wvithin so counterfeit and lighttlhomas shadwell wrote an answer to the medal and in macflecknoe drvden hit back wvith all his might in this mock heroic poem the ruling spirit of nonsense saysshadwell alone my perfect image bearsmature in dullness from his tender years hailadwell alone of all my sonis is liewfho stands confirmd in full stupiditythe rest to sonme fainit mneaning makepretence but shadwell never deviates into sensewith more of the same kind which makes the reader feel that wlhat hazlitt called his  magnanimity of abuse was not a constant  feature in dryden butt his miagnanimity shines alnmost unclouded in his twvo great religious poems the  religio laici in wlhich lie speaks as a faithful and moderate member of the churchl of england and the hina and the panther whiclilie wrote after his conversion to the chureh of rome because that conversion took place after the accession of king jamies ii it has been pietty commonly supposed that it was timeserving and insincere it has even been said that drvden took to whining after the revolution had robbed him of his office and left hini old and poor sonie good critics at least have found  the hind and the panther  irnplicit in  religio laici  and those vwho feel these great matters too high for tihenm may be content that the opening of  religio laici  is one of the most beauti fal things in all english poetry  and that in technical merits in wisdom in variety anid in dignity these twvo pociiis prove thieniselves the work of a great miindtlii old poetand still there remains imluch yet un nenitioned in the achievement of this versatile and adventurous genius ever feeling the needs of his time andt answer imri the deiands of his timle he wrote the most enchanting letters and compli mients in v erse he rescued the ode firom confusion and shapelessness and in thc two great poemis for st cecilias day set an intluence at work whichl can be traced throuiglh english poetry ever since and whenl he was old and poor and out of favour he made translations from the classics and retold old fables of claucer and others in verse wlhichl is still the de light not only of students of the narrative art but of the rhythlns and metres and sounds of the english language and many an admirer of dryden will be wvon dering wvhen this article is going to say a word about the wvork in wvhich some have found him stipreme those prefaces and essays in which his plain and manly prose is the very voice of hiis manly confident sensible and supple mindhe was  glorious john  to thle young poets and men of letters who bowved before bis thronie at wvills coffeelhouse caring nothing wxhetlher he wvas in or out of favour with kings and clergy and in taking leave of him it is pleasant to see him through the eyes of young imr congreve whom the old poet most sincerely loved and admired his friendship wvhen he professed it wvent illuchi beyond his pro fessions    he was of all the men thait i ever knew one of the rnost modest and the most easily to be discountenanced in his approaches either to his superiors or his equals and once wlhen dryden then over  wvas coming back from northlamptonslhire congreve and soutlh erne rode four miles out of london to mneet anid to escort him
