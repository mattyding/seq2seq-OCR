westminster bank mr selby and mr w talbot agar the secretaryafter the disposal of some formal business the pbe sidmet delivered his inaugural address having referred to the continued progress of the institute and to the value of their journal and its ofeshoot  questions on points of practical interest he ststed that on the tb of april the factors act conxolidation bill was introdluced into the house of commons and the lord chancellor promised to withdraw all opposition on the part of the govermnent in the house of lords the success of the bi which had thus seemed fairly assured was to their great disappointment marre by being blocked for purely party purposes by mr biggar and their efforts to remove the block proved unstccessful their hopes with regard to a settlement of the light gold coin question had not yet been realized but he could only repeat that the state of things wshich now existed had continued far too long let them hope that the chancellor of the exchequer having now mastered some other important questions would look into the matter of our light gold coin having expressed regret that no progress had been mnade towards obtaining reliable information as to the gold used in the arts and referred to the continuedzenaency curing ine past year ot banks to amalgamate he called attention to certain innovations in the management of the trade and commerce of the country innovations such as the london produce clearing house and varioas socalled  trusts after reading clauses p and k of the memorandunm of association of the london produce clearinghouse he observed that taken by themselves those clauses would appear to constitute a banking basiness generally but it was understood that the association was started with a different object and in imitation of similar institu tions existing in havre aud hlamburg the lamburg vaaren liqaudations casse had been at work for some time he had had a somewhat long correspondence with some of his german friends an it appeared that considerable fears were entertained that it would lead to a good deal of gambling gambling or speculation for a fall or rise in produce had always existed and as far as he knew there had never been any diifinculty in houses of a certain position buying or seiling for for ward delivery but  gambling made easy  might prove an awkward element in bornl idie business alike to producers and consumers in general as bankers had an enormous influence in all monetary move ments in this country it was well that they should look to possible dangers ahead the socalled trusts would seem to interfere with all the ordinary laws of supplv and demand and they constituted a combination of capital raised with a view to produce an enormous profit to speculators to the detriment of the consumer and the wageearning classes in order to effect a rise in price whch must be more or less prejudicial to the consumer production had to be limited to lhe point which would insure the supply not beingsuperior to the demand at the enhanced scalc of price the  copper trust  he thought ought rather to be called a  copper monopoly gamble it was time for those who take an interest in the commercial welfare of the country to watch the workdng of the socalled trusts where production through competition resulted in a loss to the producers it might be well for the latter to combine so as not to work at a loss but a powerful combination having very different objects in view might be a source of considerable danger alike to producers and consumers referring to the conver sion of the public debt which he described as the most gigantic minancial operatlon the world had ever seen he stated that only ï¿½ now remained of the old three per cent consols which the chan cellor of the exchequer proposed shortly to deal with the success of the scheme though satisfactory from a chancellor of the exchequers point of view might not be equally satisfactory at the present moment to those who having converted followed the quotations of the new stock the current year had been excep tionally fruitful iu the production of new securities having shown that when investing in foreiga securities it was just as well to consult from time to time the foreign offlice annual series of diplomatic and consular reports on trade and finance he alluded to the course of the money market during the year and stated that since october   there had heen no fewer than eight changes in the bank rate which was raised on the d ult to a per cent though in raising the rate the action of the bank directors had been a good deal criticized he believed it had been generally acknow ledged to be right the competition for bills was such that the bank rate of discount was frequently but little guide to real value of loanable capital there was often great misconception in muatters connected with the movement of gold there were times when the export of gold gave cause for anxiety and when it was necessary to tae steps to check the export by raising the rate of interest the action of the bank had pro bably tended to produce the result that the large amount required for and since shipped to russia was scraped together outside the bank he then referred to the recent action of  vagliano brothers v the bank of england and said he had no doubt that the bank would shortly give notice of appeal alluding to the royal commnission on the recent changes in tho relative values of the precious metals he stated that he had given the question of bimetallism or rather the fall in the value of silver his serious attention since  when he was governor of the bank of england the report of the royal commission only reached him on the previous night and he had had no time to study it he intendea earefolly to go into mr barbours notes that gentleman would appear to doubt whether with the large increase of business more gold was not required  but on referring to the issues both of country bankers and jointstock banks in october  and october i and to the clear inghouse returns for the first nine months of those two years he found that while there had evidently been an enormous increase in the business of the country it had been conducted with a much less amount of ordinary currency the vacuum being filled up by the various systems of credit if any one e ed to now his the speakers view on the renortihe would zefer him to the leading article in the imns of that dayon the motion of wr tmtton seconded by mr gbnxnrirl a cordial vote of thanks was passed to the president and the meeting was then idjourned to the jthxjrqx
