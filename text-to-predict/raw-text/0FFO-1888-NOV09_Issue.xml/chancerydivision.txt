i ehigh court of justicechancery divisionfry v lanewhttet v bushbefore mr justice baytlhis case attorus a usesui warming to an intending purchaser of a reversionary int agasinst taking undue advantage ot the poverty or ignorance of the person who is desirous of selling or raising money on an interest of that kind by inducing him to part with it at an undervalue it also illustrates the importance of separate solicitors being empuloyed to act for the vendor and purchaser in carrying out a sale and pur chase of an interest of that nature the racts so far as they possess any public interest were shortly as followsunder the will of a testater who died in  john brown fry the plaintiff in the first action was entitled to onefifth of his residuary estate subiect to the payment out of such estate of two legacies of � each and to the life interest of the testators widow  and william fry george fry and mrs annie brack stone defendants in the second action were entitled respectively to onefifth onefufth and onetenth of such residuary estate subject as aforesaid all the legatees were poor persons in a humble position of life john brown fry being a iaundryman earning � a week and william being a workman i the employ of samuel albert lane a plumber at nottinghill the defendant in the iirst action one of the legacies of � had been satisfied in october  the plaintiff j b fry sold and assigned his reversionary interest in onp fifth to the defendant lane for � the sale being conducted solely by the defendants solicitor and the plaintiff having no independent advice ir ausat f the testators widow the tenant for life jied and john brown frys share thereupon fell into posses sion the first action was brought by him to set aside the sale on the ground that he had been induced to sell his reversionary share for a grossly inadequate price the plaintiff in the second action was the assignee for value of the reversionary sbares of the defendants william fry george fry and mrs brackstone and he now claimed administration of the testators estate and paymnent of the amount of the shares so assigued to him those defendants however asserted that they parted with their shares to the original purchaser one of them at a sale by auctionat an undervalue and without having proper advice and they counter claimod in effect to have the sales and assignments set aside the arguments after occupying aconsider able time were concluded on monoay october  and his lordship then reserved judgment which he delivered this morningmr renshaw qc mr neville qc mr b ford mr r c dobbs mr c h turner mr sidney woolff and mr p  clifford were the counsel appearingmr justic kay after an elaborate statement of the facts as disclosed by the evidence taken in the two aetions saidlong before the passing of the act  vic c  it was stated that the court of chancery would relieve against a sale or other dealing with a remainder or reversion at an undervalue on that ground alone and this even where the remainder man was of mature age and accustomed to business  wiseman v beake    vern   barclay freeman v bishop  iatk  davis vdukeof marlborou h  swan   earl of portmore v taylor    simn   boothby v boothby  i macandg and  beav  foster v roberts   beav  and  beynon v cook   ch app  in such cases it was held that the onus lay upon the purchaser to show that he had given  the fair value  as it was called in  al biorough v trye   cl and fin  or  the market valuetalbot v stanaiforth  j and h    by the  vic cap  reciting that it was expedient to amend the law as administered in courts of equity with respect to sales of reversions it was enacted that  no purchase made bond fde and with out fraud or unfair dealing of any reversionary interest in real or personal estate shall hereafter be opened or set aside merely on the ground of undervalue  and the word  purchase  in the act is to include every kind of contract conveyance or assignment under or by which any beneficial interest in any kind of pro perty may be acqulred this act came into operation on thelst day of january  it is obvious that the w ordsn merely on the gtound of undervalue  do not include the case of an undervalue so gross as to amount of itself to evidence of fraud  and in  earl of ayles ford v morris  ch app  lord selborne said that this act  leaves undervalue still a material element in cases in which it is not the sole equitable ground for relief these changes of the law have in no degree altered the onus probandi in those cases which according to the language of lord bard wicke raise  from the circumstances or conditions of the parties contractingweakness on one side usury on the other or extortion or advantage taken of that weakness a presumprion of fraud fraud says lord selborne  does not here mean deceit or circumven tion  it means an unconscientious use of the power arising out of these circumstances and conditionsand when the relative position of the parties is such as primd fecie to raise this presumption the transaction cannot stand unless the person claiming the benefit of it is able to repel the presumption by contrary evi dence proving it to have been in point of fact fair just and reasonable the most common case for the in terference of a court of equity is that of an expectant heir reversioner or remainderman who is just of age his youth being treatedas an important circumstance another analogous case is where the vendor is a poor man with imperfect education as in  evans v le wellin   cow s felaygarth v wearing   eq  in the case of a poor man in distress for money a wale even of property in possession at an undervalue has been set aside in many cases as in wood v alzey  mad  where the only pro fessional person employed was the purchasers attorney and the price was onefourth of the value  sir john leach saying  a court of equity will inquire whether the parties really did meet on equal terms and if it be foundt that the vendor was in distressed circumstances and that advantage was taken of that distress it will avoid the contract so in  longmzate v ledger    giff which it seemswas affirmedi on appealsee  de g f andjwhere propertyin posses sion was sold for a price greatly below thce value and one solicitor acted for vendor and purchaser and thevenuor was a man aavancecs in years and known to have been of a weak and eccentric disposition in  clark v mialpas  de g f and j  an improvi dent sale of property in possession by a poor and illiterate man the same solicitor being employed by both parties was set aside again the same thing was done in baker v mtonk   de gjand s where the vendor was an elderly woman in humble life and the purchaser a substantial tradesman whose solicitor carried out the transaction for both parties the consideration being an annuity of s a week for the life of the vendor in that case lord justice turner distinguishes  harrison v guest   hlc a case in which the transaction was allowed to standon the ground that there the offer came first from the vendor and the purchaser advised him to take time and consider and to consult someone else about it no such advice having been given by the vendor in  baker v monk the result of the decisions is that where a purchase is made from a poor and ignorant man at a considerable undervalue the vendor having no independent advice a court of equity will set aside the transaction this will be done even in the case of property in pos session and  fortiori if the interest be reversionary the circumstances of the poverty and ignorance of the vendor and absence of independent advice throw upon the purchaser when the transaction is impeached the onus of proving in lord selbornes words that the purchase was fair just and reasonable upon the evidence before me i cannot hesitate to conclude ihat the price of � in j b frys case and � in george frys case were both considerably below the real value the property has been subjected to the costs of appointing new trustees of the will and also to part of the costs of an administration suit and yet thenet produce of onefifth share is  managed in a more careful manner it might have produced more both j b fry and his brother george were poor ignorant men to whom the temptation of the immediate possession of � would be verygreat neither of them in the transaction of the sale of his share was in the words of sir john leach  on equal terms  with the purchaser neither had independent advice the solicitor who acted for both parties in each transaction seems from the law list to have been admitted in march  in october  at the time of complet ing the sale of j b frys share he had not been more than a year and a half on the roll his inexperience probably in some degree accounts for allowing himself to be put in the position of solicitor for both parties in such a case i think in each transaction he must have been considerin the purchasers interest too much properly to guargthat of the vendors nothing i couia oe more obvious than to test the value by obtain ing an offer from one or more of the leading offics ilondon which deal in purcliases of this find but although when  borrowing money for one of the bene�iciaries he did make some application to the law reversionary society when he had to effect a sale he says it never occurred to him to do so he found it was easy to borrow � npon an interest of this kind before he completed the sale of j b frys share for �  hie does hlot seem to have informedeither of the vendors that one of the � legacies had been acrificed and he allowed the sale by auction of williams share to prbceed without correcting the in eccarate statemert in thepitrticulars that this legacywas still due though he says that he informed whittet the intending purchaser of williams share that the legacy had been discharged i reret that i mubt on the evidence come to the concusion that though there ivas a semblance of bargaining by thesolicitor in each case he did not properly protect the vendors but gave a great advantage to the purcbasers who had been former clients and for whom be was then acting the circuastances illustrate the wisdom and necessity of the rule thst a poor ignorant man selling an interest of this kind should have independent advice and that a purchase from him at an undervalue should be set asie if he has not the most eixperienced solicitor acting for both sides if he allows a sale at an undervalue can hardly have duly performed his duty to the vendor to act for both sides in such a  ase and permit a sale at the undervalue is a position in which no careful practitioner should allow himself to be placed no case of delay or acquiescence is made in tho pleadings by either lane or whittet but the point wasnevertheless suggested in argument in ggwland v de faria    ves  sir wilham grant in a like case said  there is i be lieve no case in which during the continuance of the same situation in which the party entered into the contract acquiescence has ever gone for anything it has always been presumed that the same distress whicb pressed him to enter into the contract prevented him from coming to set it aside that it is only when he is relieved from that distress that he can be eapected to resist the performance uf the contract the same rule was applied in  beynon v cook   ch app where the late iaster of the rolls whose jcd ment was afirmed says that the state of distress is considered to continue till the reversion falls into possession his lordship thenpronounceda judgment in effect settingaside the sales in question ani directing a division of the fund in court representing the testators residuary estate and amounting to about � among the residuary legatees subject to direc tions as to costs and to the repayment to the pur chasers of the reversionary interests of the sums actualy paid by them
