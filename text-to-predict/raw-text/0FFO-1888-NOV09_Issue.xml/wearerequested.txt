companied by mir jesse collings and other members of parliamnent tbe deputation urged strongly that the trade had no obiection to the law requiring bread to be sold by weight but considered that the words quartern and halfquartern in the clauses were un necessary and led to complications the carrying of scales in vehicles was nut imposed on the sale of other articles of food sir michael

being carried in vehicles but he would consider relieving the trade froa the obligation to weigh in every case the deputation having thanked the right hon gentleman withdrewbnrrisn fturit guowzbs assoczaionwthis association met last night in the lloyal aquarium to consider the question ot railwayrates in fruit tran sit mr t francis rivers who presided in opening the proceedings congratulated the association on the very encouraging success vhich had attended its for mation they had succeeded in drawing public attention to the necessity of thoroughly exaniining the possible outcome of the

have been formed in vain if it could succeed in attracting the serious attention of culti vators to the best means and methods by which the country could hold its own in the competition with which it was threatened there was good groundfor beheving that the cost of the transport of fruit was much greater than it need be and that this cost pressed heavily on one of our native industries mir albert

thinks tha in one of those aberrations they came so near to mars that they were caught and detained waithin its sphere of attraotinnl as a fact ne of those planetoids sthra has so very eccentric an orbit that it eomes very near miars on the th of september  it came wvithin  miles of mars and has not since been seen but event at that nearness thae attractive force of mars would be manby thousand times less tban that of the sun so we must be prepared to admnit some extra orciary planetic disturbancea before we could imeagine the transformation of one of those planetoids into a satellite of
