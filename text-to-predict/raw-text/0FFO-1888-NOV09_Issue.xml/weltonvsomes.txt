queens bench division wlton v se and anotferbefore mr baron pollock and mr justicemanistymals was an action on a commercial guarantee of gteat magnitude and which raised a question of great importance as to the liability of sureties where a mnterial fact has not been mentioned to them it was a guarantee given by the two defendants in  as sureties for a firm of coffee growers of colombo ceylon to the oriental bank which had made advances to them to the amount of � it appeared that sabonadiere and co of colombo ceylon had extensive coffee estates there the cultiva tion of which required considerable capital they obtained for the purpose large advances from the oriental bank to whom they gave bills for the amount and consigned the produce of their estatesas security and the bank also required as further security the guarantees of two sureties for � at the beginning of the coffee season of  when bills had been already given to the smount of � the bank in an agreement then entered into undertook to make in the ensuing year the requisite advances for the season  to an amot noe exceeding  rupees upon certain terms as to securities this was the agreement in connexion with whichthe guarantee was given by the defendants at the request of the debtorseacb to the extent of �fo the amount of any deficiency the  guarantee was in these terms  wfe will on the st of july  pay to the oriental bauk such sum not exceeding x  as shall be certified by the chief manager or accountant to be the amount of the deficiency in respect of the account of sabonadiere and co with the baun for the season  according to the agreement the amount certified by the chief manager as the deficiency was over � and so in this action the plaintiff the officer of the oriental bank claimed to recover as the guarantee to that amount�  and at the trial before lord coleridge on july  it was held that the certificate was prind facie proof of the amount it was set up as a defence that iabonadiere and co had before the guarantee written to the bank thzt as they estimated there would be a deficiency to a large amountestimated about � and that this fact had been concealed from the sureties and a certain letter from sabonadiere to the bank as to an expected deficiency was put in with a view to sustain this defence but his lordship was of opinion that even if proved it would be no defence as there would be nothing to sustain it or to show a fraudulent conceal ment from the sureties and his lordship said he was of opinion that the bank were not bound to disclose to the sureties the state of the accounts between the bank  and their customer  and that it was for the sureties to make inquiries so that even assuming that the letters stating an anticipated deficiency were not disclosed to the defendants there would be no defence no other tvidencetherefore was offered  and the verdict went for the plaintiff this wasaiu appliea tion on the part of the defendants to set aside the verdict on the ground that there was evidence to sustain the defence set up the case was reported in the times of julv  lastmr conen qc with mr lane appeared for the defendants in support of their application for a new trial they argued that it is not necessary for a surety in order to relieve himself from his liability to show an intention to conceal from him but that it was enough if the creditor concealed something the knowledge of which would have prevented any sensible man from giving the guarantee a smith v the bank of scotland  dows house of lords reorts   mnbaron poilooe cited lee vjones  com tencheportsaslaylng the law down differentlythat case is inconsistent with the argument in the present case it is enough to say there were facts which in some way ought to have been left to the jury the defendants were willing to guarantee a possible deficiency but not to undertake to pay a positive and known deficiency to the amount of some thousands of pounds the guarantee therefore was not binding upon tho defendants and they are not liable upon it yet the defence wvas excluded and overruled at the trialmr h d gnxxn qc with mr english harrison on behalf of the plaintihe argued that the guarantee was entered into at the request of sabona diere and cothe debtors themselvesnot at the request of the bank so that there could not be any duty on the bank to disclose material facts to the sureties  and that the supposed concealment of the anticipated deficiency was no defence for the sureties moreover there was no evidence at the trial that anything had been concealed from them all that was shown was that by a certain letter to the bank they knew of the anticipated defnciency  not that it was concealed or withhold from the defendants neither of whom were called to prove it mr coznmno doubt the defence was not proved lord coleridge would not receive it and said that if proved it would be no defence there was no rejectionof evidence and no such evidence was offered mr cowrnwe did not know of it no doubt lord coleridge tbought that it would not be a defence if proved  but it was not proved that is it was not oroved that the fact of a deficiency was withheld fromthe defendants mni bron pollocxbut lord coleridge said it would be no defence if proved yet the guarantee was against a future deficiency and is it likely they would have given the guarantee if they had been told there was a deficiency  there was no evidence that they did not know of it um baon pollock the defence was raised and overruled by the lord chief justice if there was any concealment from the defendants they would have been called to prove it is the bank in such a case bound to disclose the state of the customers accounts p mr baron pollocwo  but if there is a defciency and they know of it and take a guarantee arc they not bound to disclose it to the surety  certainly not the guarantee was not given at the request or instance of the bank how does it appear that the defendants did not know of the expected deficiency  mr bapron polloceis it likely that they would  the letters were not to them but to the bank but thev gave the guarantee at the request of sabonaadere and why did they not make inouiries of him  mr justice manistythe guarantee was for the benefit of the bank and no doubt was required by them why should that be inferred mr justice manrstrbecause the bank were to make the advances and would require the security the guarantee does not purport to have been given upon any particular state of accounts and it absolutely guaranteed any deficiency not exceeding � so that the defence is not admissible and it has never been held that the duty of disclosure applies to banlers and banking accounts mn justice maxstythis is not a guarantee of a banking account though the creditor happens to be a bank it is merely a guarantee of a loan at all events the bank were not bound to dis close the accounts mr justice miunistyand we know nothing as to any communications between the sureties and the bank just so  and the letter as to an estimnated deficiency was merely the result of an estimatethey were ultimately stopped in their argumentmr comtr in reply urged that lord coleridge had rejected the defence set up and therefore of course it was nut folly proved but he urged that as it must be manieest the sureties would never have given the guarantee if they had known there would be a deciency of � or � there was improper con cealmentafter a long argument commenced last weelr con tinued yesterday and concluded todaythe court came to the conclusion that lord coleridge was right and that the sureties had set up no valid defence to the actionmn banon pollock in giving judgment said the question was one of considerable importance not only in law but as governing the conduct of mer cantile men but though at one time not free from doubtafter the able and protracted argunment which the court had heard they were enabledl to determine it without difficulty the question was whetherthe nondisclosure of the fset of an estimated deficiency affordeda defence to the sureties and he thought it did not  the bank were to snake advances tosabonadiereand co the owners of the estatc pertly on the guarantee of the defendants which however was obtaned by the debtors sabonadierc and co and given at their request the guarantee  wai given for the amount of the deficiency if any in  to the extent of � at the time sabonadicre obtained that guarantee it was known to the bank by a letter from sabonadiere that there was a n estimated defici ency on the last year that ir that some deficieucy already exilsted wai known to the bank at the time of the guarantee nowv what was the law on the subject had een laid down in the courts of law and in the house of lords and it was thisthat the party taking a guarantee was not baund to disclose every material fact  north british insurance comnpany v lloyd  exchequer reports   lee v jones  common bench reports ns axd this doctrine laid down that disclosure was only neces sary when it might from the nature of the transaction be naturally expected to take place in the ordinary course of affairs as between the parties and this doctrine had been upheid not only in the court of appeal but in the house of lords this doctrine had been illustrated in many cases as where a guarantee was given for a servants honesty and he had already been guilty of dishonesty and thls was not disclosed philips v foall    lr qb the principle was upheld in the house of lords in a case of a guarantee of a bankers accoant already overdrawn  hamilton v watson   clark and finellys re ports now was this principle applicable in the present casethat is to showr that there ought to have been a disclosure  he thought that it was not applicable for as to the mere fact of an estimated deficiency it might natutally bi contemplated in such a case that tbere was some existing deficiency it was not immaterial to consider thatthe guarantee here was giren not at the request of the bank but ofthe debtors sabonadiere and co notwithstanding there fore the able argument of mr cohen he could not but agree with lord coleridge in thinking that there was no evidence to sustain the defence set up by the sureties in this case and he also thought that lord coleridge was right in taking the certificate as ridnd facie conclusive as to the amount of the dqciencymn jiustrcs mamsty concurred tbe facts he said were not in dispute  the only question which was all important was as to the principle of law which was applicable coffee plantations no doubt were uncer tain as to their produce the coffeeplanter required advances from the bank and got the defendants to give the guarantee thatfactthat the debtor asked for the gouaranteedistinguished the case from almost all others the sureties friends of sabonadiere the ooffeegrower even if they had known there was an estimated deficiency on the last years crop might very likely having confidence in his resources have been prepared to give the guarantee but at all events they gave it at his request and they were in communica tion with him and not with the bank under such circumstances how could it be  said that there was a concealment of the fact by ther bank v he thought that according to the authorities it could not he said no inquiry had been made by the sureties of the bank there was no communication between the bank and the sureties and how could there have been a duty incumbent on the bank to volunteer a disclosure uf the letter y he thought on the contrary that thq bank in making such a disclosure would have been going a long way beyond their dutv it rwas for the sureties to make inquiries either of the debtor or of the bank and they made no inquiries the creditor was not bound in every case to disclose every material fact he thought therefore that lord coleridge vas rightjudgment for the plaintiff
