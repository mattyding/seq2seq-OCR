with that of epping forestthe chancellor of the excheqiuer coraplained that the government had not been met in that spirit which had marked their proposals with regard to these matters there was no more difficult task of office than to adjust the claims of the taxpayer with the claims of localities interested in crown property he doubted whether the committee proposed would be the best tribunal to inquire into the matter raised by the scotch members he should be disposed to think that a committee to inquire into the disposal of crown rights was one on which scotch members might wish to be much more strongly represented than on the com mnittee into the general administration of the crown lands ie should be glad to have the assistance of hon members upon such a subject as the disposal of crown rights  but it would be premature to say more than that the government were anxious to inquire in the meantime he was well assured that the general interests of the exchequer might be very much en dangered by a conmmittee sitting upon the general question of the disposal of the rights of the crown perhaps hon members would now allow the govern ment to proceed further with the business and with regard to the question of sales he did not wish that eny of this class of sales should be proceeded with till ihe government had thoked into  the matter he wfould undertake that instructions

to know whether thetcret a o the treasury had any reports from the commissioners as to theamount of crown land which could be made available for the purpose of reforesting and keeping up the woods in this contry and whether any waste tanls had been purchased for the purpose he also urged that some attention should he paid as recommended bythe elect commuitteeto the replant leg of woods in irelandmr jacklon said no doubt the point raised lwas a very smportant one but it was entirely separate and distinct from the vote now before the committee the duties of the commissioners were to administrate the estates in their charge mainly from the point of view of making the most they could out of them and the question whether it was desirable that new forests should be planted in this country was a separate one e doubted whether the commissioners would be justified in spending money on the planting of trees unless they thought it was likely to bring in tome revenue and were satisfied that it was the best pur rose to which they coupd devote the land it wvs rue that there was some planting  going on now in the isle of man he had known for many years the gentleman who occupied the position of deputy at the new forest aind not only had this gentleman givenmuch personal attention to the subject of forestry but he was a competent authority on itdr clark said that the item for fees to counsel were doubled this year because the legal advisers of the woods and forests department in scotland had commenced tyrannical proceedings against the nm fortunate tenants in caithness te also complained of the management of the crown lands in scotland and especially in caithaess alleging that in caithness there were no small tenants of thae crown which was a worse exterminator than any private landlorl alls the crown lands in caithness were held by larke farmers who had big farms in that and the neighbour ing counties all the small holdings wvhich were so fertile and so uiseful to the population having been made into great farms he urged that when the leases of those large farms expired the crownshould break them up into small arable farms and allow the people of the congested townships to go back again on to those crow lands nd to have farms of  acres or o acres at a rent of about � or l then the crown would add to the value of its own propertt as well as to the agricultumr produce of caithncssand something would be done to improve the condition of the croftersr s smite remarked that the great evil in the lighlands of scotland and the main cause of discon tent therewas the gradual decay of the small holders and he thought it was esceedingly desirable that the crown should set an example to the other proprietors by having the crown lands

worked in australia and america it was the duty of the government li every way they could to promote the ixfudstry in such a way as to benefit the people at large in particular they ought not to grant licences over too large an area to individuals ia one case a licence extended over an area of eight miles by two id australia the argest concession was  yards by  mr jackson explained that the increase in legal charges was due to two or three actions at iiw with respect to the granting of mining leases and mining royalties the decision lay with sirwarington smyth than whom it would be universally acknowledged there was no higher authoritity and who he believed ene rally gave satisfaction to both parties it wouldg he thought be daugerous and beyond the scope of their duties for the commissioners to try experiments such as had been suggested in the way of small holdings with the ciown lands their duty was simply to nike the most of the land on ordinary commercial principles in answer to the hon member for kings county he had to state that the usual royalty was onefifteenth if the land beloned to the crown and onethirtieth if it did not that could not be considered excessive  very excessive that was on the amount of gold obtained the largest licences which had been granted were of  acres and he had lknown of no such exces sive areas being given over to one man as was mentioned by the hon member the government were anxious in every way they could to encourage the experiments in wales and the chancellor of the ex chequer had conferred with the commissioners with the view of facilitating the gold mining in wales in every possible waykbr i olloy said that a royalty of onefifteenth would destroy all possible profit nd was much more than was charged in any of the goldproducing countries the whole effort in australia at the present time was to get rid of royalties and so to induce people to go into the industry because it was well understood tbat the profit did not arise from the gold mining itself but from the presence of miners and the industry itself prospering the hon gentleman said the bueitios had been decided between the chancellor of the exchequer and the commissioners of woods and forests what did either of those gentlemen know ag to the policy which ought to govern such an indastry  they were doing exactly that which killed the gold industry in tis country ji the end of the last entury and exactly on the same grounds as then the thing was monstrous here was an iiidustry which never could yield to tlc revenue any very large sum and aet the treasury for the sake of adding a thousand or vwq to the treasitry chest were doing the very thin best cacplated to kill the industry in a district where it wasgreatly wantedfdr clark supported the

somme  years le ventured to say there was no country in tihe world where the zates were sohigh as thi royalties eacted in this country the transvaal gold industry was crushed when the territory wad

the ease of wvales the autho rities of the lrepublip only asked a nominal rate of d per acre while the field was being developed and after it was developed all that was asked was  per cent he believed that the future of the gold industry in this country depended upon eveiy facility being given for its development bysuch a poliy he was of opinion that the population of sutherland could be quadrnpled in the next five years there were veins in the quartz and gianite mountains of sutherland where nothing could be grown bat where there might bea prbfitable gold industry if only facilities were given for its development   lir c  miorgan pointed out that gold mining was an exceedingly speculative kind of business and the cost of working was enormous and inl such i case he submitted  a royalty of onefifth not of the net proftsbut of the gross profits was really overwhelming even from the financial point of ievw the treasury would do well  to be generous rather than kill that which might turn out to be a most valuable bqon to a depressed communitymir henyon as a director in the qnly welsh gold mining industry which was paying any dividend at the present time stated that they had been treated with the greatest courtesy by the chaucellor of the exche quer in the matter of royalties  and while so far as the mine with which he was connected was concerned he did not say they were not able to pay the royalty demanded still in the interest of gold mining through out the rest of the cointlfe was of opiix that the tax was one which woald effectually crush a risipg industry and would

looked into it with a great deal of care the majority of hon members would desirethat an infant industry should be allowed to be developedfree from as many diffi culties as they could remove bhut the point in this case was not only that of an infant industry what they had found was that when persons had asked for mode rate terms from the government those who had received such terms had sold that which had been conceded to them anmil had made an extremely good thing out of the transaction the question was whether the public or particular individuals oughtto have the advantage irising from the discovery of gold he had been told that one of the companies now developing the goldmining industry in wales had declared a divi dend of  per cent that proved that the industry could be made to pay well at the terms obtained by the company  the queition was whether the govern ment were to sell certain rights to particular indi viduals below the market value in order to enable them to form profitable companies to develop the gold mining industry they had found that there were plenty of persons prbpared to accept the terms which they pad offered tnd he was of opinion that they ought not to part with public property to private indi viduals except at the full market price hear hear the ptovernment were perfectly clear that they had a good title to the rights in question and they wvould defend those rights in the interests of the taxpayers they did not wish to put such a value upon them as would tend to discourage general goldmining in wales that would be a false pblicy but at the same time there wa no member of the committee who wished the government to sell the mining riglits to persobs at a cheap price in order to enable them to dispose of those rights to companiei who would make good dividendsst miolloy remarked that the policy which the chancellor of the exchequer had expounded had been tried in australia and the transvaal and in both those countries it had failedthe chancellor of the exceeqtjeit said he was extremely anxious to see the goldmining industry in wales develop there were several competitors for these mining rights and the question was ho should iave them early iii the evening the charge was brought against government ofllcials that they parted with rights belonging to the crown at too cheap a rate that charge might very easily bo brought against
