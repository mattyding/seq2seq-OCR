mr gtladstone in the midladsfr gladstone qoncluded his visit to wirmingbgpm yesterday but not until the local public had heard two more sppeches both on tee irish question he rose at his apcustomtpo and appetred to be aone the worse for hi great effort of thp previo evening after an early breakfast at vwhich he was joined by earl spencek sir william harcourt sir j car michael sir james kitson mr y fahony mpmr a c qsier and br s ssdhorst he was wvaited upop by a deputatiou from the irish national club headed by pauncier lbughton the hev father she lock and professor windle the secretary of the club read an illuminated address setting forth that at no disttib period in the past the feelings towards erglnid of the irish and towards the euglish people as represented by parliamnent were those of enmity and distrust when it seemed to many of them as if justicewould never be done to ireland by this country but i lir gladstdpe had by his uoble and disinterested action altered this he had cpnverted their hatred ize friendliness and their despair into hope aud ini thus winning the hearts of the irish people he had done a great service to the empire theseccess of the lush cause did not depend upon any one life or effort since it was now recognized asa part of the programnme of the great liberal party but they ei pressed the feelings of e irishmen all the world over when they said that from no other mans hands would the gifts they craved come so acceptably as from mr gladstones the addrdss having been presented to mr glddstole the ltev father sherloelc said be bad been a home ruler for  yedrs ie expressed a hope that mr gtadsibn might live tocarry oup is toble work of biiiging about peace unity and frdedomd  ii the whole of the united kingdommtr glnstone in reply said gentlemen of the leputation apd father sherlocki receive tis address wrtb a very peculiar pleasure on account of the par ticular sebtinients it contains ad of the particular sentifipnts to which utterance has been given in pteehding it  i eirtainly aree with and understand the i satisfaction that must be felt by these gentlemen iwho are able to say that they have been in favour of home rule for a grieat length of timefor three score and ten years as father sherlock told us i his on case a rdcaljeciioa of that knd almost joins onto that nasiial spatiment of the irish peopie before the union which marks in my opinion the vdry noblest time in the history of ireland the perioq of lord fitzw illfamns dininistrationi mean the tine whei the protestant parliament of irelind zealously and not only willingly passed the admission of romaitcatholics to the franchise ad wvhen they were ready to gp u xfforming the parliament and admit roman catholics vithin the wallsthat i think was the noblest period of the history of ireland it was wasted and frestrated and it was reversed i grieve to say by the party of ascendency in ireland tm fortunately ddpted pettedpatronized and sustained in all its iniinities by the british government of that time bnt gentiempn i wish you to bear in mind this pt is one thing for an irishman to be a home rnler but it is a different thing for an english poli ficiap tt the gonse of commons howvever goodneulemany be  it is in my opinion an essential condition in order to wirrant the granting of it thit it shuld be asked for by the representatives of ireland in the constitutional form provided by our institu tions ear hear new i wish you to bear in mind two propositions one of which is oiite indisputable atd the dtber of whichi think is not subjdct to legitimatb dispute the first of them is that never until december  was there in the house of coiimons a decided majority of teal genuine home rulers hear hear i admit there was a handful of gentleipen who found home rule a convenient cry at one or two elections but you know what kind of homle rulers they have turned out to he ad yon nobw that at this moment though the irish demand has hbegnreduced within the limits of the stdctest mbderation the bulk of those genl emen are among our stiffest and most vehement opponents therefore i say this constitutional demand of ireland in that constitutional form dates from december  lnow i wish to take the second proposition it is a pro position in hich i have a pateinal interest because i laboured on monday in thetownhallin birmingham to show what i believe to be the truth and not to be subject to rational doubtsnamely that in the election of  though the majority of the representatives of great britain was laigely agdaint you yet when we allow for the disturbing influence of what is called the ownership vote nd when we deduct that vote from thie polls so as to asceitain the real and genuine sense of the people of great britainbesuse the ownership vote merely represents the fictitious and artificial influence attaching to the wealth which multiplies a man and enables him if he has property in various places to give three or four votes and theiefore to figule as if he were three or four persona in the general returni think it bas been reasonably shown and it is not subject to doubt that in jne  that period which we justly regard from one point of view as disastrous the majority of the people of this island answeredaye  to the irish demzand rear hear these if they ha true are historical facts of great conse quence we have great evils and great grevances re mairning in ireland ini my opinion as far as i can judge and distinguishing betweer grievances and mere wvantsbecause i admit the legislation of ireland in many sespccts is in a backward state and cannot be brought into a proper state except by the agency of its own people its own childrensitting in dablin people who have the feelings towards ireland that children ought to have to a mothier but whatt are the positive evils  the positive evils i think may be sunmed up thus first of all there is coercion  secondly there is an adminis trative system thoroughly antinational in its methods  and thirdly there is the absence of the power in ire land of managing their own affairs according to their own ideas great progress has been made if ve go back a certain time we see a very different state of things i will not refer to partictlars of land and church and franchise though this i would say that there are no acts of my life with which i have been connected that have given me greater satisfaction than some of those acts inrelationto ireland and not least the abolition of the dreadful monopolynamely the irish eatablished churchand the extension of the franchise in ireland whicb together with the protec tion afforded by the secret vote has given to the irish people once and for all the inevitable means of telling us what they want and what they mean but let us go hack a little i wili read to you a very short passage from a work by a man whcse name was well and honourably known in ireland mir teeling  a narrative of the revolution of s in that narra tivb he sets forth some of the horrorsno weaker word is su icient  we must not call them abuses we must pot call them harshness  horrors is the only word to describe the acts that were dne in ireland at that time and habitually done by the supporters of what you are accustomed to hear of as law and order here is one of them it is in mr teelings narrative pages  about the same period the town of drog heda was the scene about the same period the un fortunate bergan was tortured to death a practice at that period perfectly usual without any course of law whatever  he was an honest unright citizen and a man of unimpeachable moral conduct he was seized on by these vampires and in the most public street stripped of his clothes pinced in a horizontal position on a cart aind torn with a catoninetails after the vital spark was extinct i suppose that mean even after the vital spark iwas extinct  the alleged pretence for the perpetration of this horrid out rage wvas that a small gold ring had been found upon his finger bearing a national device the shamrock of his unfortunate country now there are a great many of these things of which i believe that our opponents are absolutely ignorant if you observe through the whole of this discussion they adyisedly shut their eyes upon irish historr they refuse to understand they refuse many of them to be informed as to what took place in ireland as to the way in which ireland was plundered of her national legisla ture and this man was tortured to death because on his finger was foiz d a ring which bore the device of the shamrock why do i quote these anecdotes to you  it is to enable you to measure the progress that we have made and to induce you to look cheerfully forward with regardc to what remains to be done the shamrock was then the cause and justification of torture torture even applied unto death i hold in my hand a valuable book one of the volumes of the correspondence of daniel oconnell it is published by my old friend mr lurray of albemarlestreet whom i have known for more than  years as one of the sturdiest tories that i ever had to do with but who notwithstanding enjoys my warm regard and esteem he is the publisher of the correspondence of daniel oconnell and what is the emblem he has put upon it see ie withyour own eyes  daniel oconnellon the side of the book surrounded with a wreath of shamnrocks cheers and mr murray is ini no danger whatever ie will not be laid hold of in the street and stretched upon a cart and subjected to the catoninetails nathough the proof against him here is glaring and palpable ie has recognized the national eistenceof ireland and has put the shamrock upon the corre spondence of oconnell and what is the conse quence of all this pogress  some people say  your favourable legislation for ireland has been a failure no i it has been no failure the horrors of that day pronuced the rebellion in wexford now we see abuses going on in ireland  we see the people suffer ing what they ought not to suffer  we see this bad administrative system but it is borne in pitience no method of redress is contemplated except the con stitutional and parliamentary method and the people with au admirable patience and an admirable selfcon trol relying upon their friends in england in scot land and in weales bore and endured in silence and in christian resignation that which for the moment is appointed for them and are they nnreasonable in that  are they reckoning without their host to use an old proverbial expression  in this address you have truly said that the cause is not dependent on any one man inasmuch as it now forms a recognized portion of the progranmmo of the great liberal party yes gentle inen and there i comne to another proposition which i should wish to print in your recollection and that i beliere to ho atsolutelv beyond dispute i am not aware of anx aeatcause y gre t pla any kreotsew ichafteitrhad once b been definitely inscribed on the bocks po to ppeak of the liberal party his failed totale efct imight go on but thee irs no time and no need for me to quote to you the causes with which wehaye had to deal ithe course pf the last q or  years beginning from the time of the ronman catholic emancipation but you know the truth of what i say and you rely upon not reason ing merely but upon experience to warrant the con fidence of te people of englandand partly to explain justijication itdoes not needbuttq expai ithe wonder ul patlence and resignation witl which the irish bear w atthey

wanting for the satisfaction of their legitimate wisnes aaneeds gentlemen i thank you very much the reidue of my life is the property of ireland is faras it may be made use of for the attainment of the great object we have in view cheersthe deputation then retiredmir and mrs gladstone were then conducted by their host to the lawn in tie rear of the house where they were joined by lord spehcer

a copsiunmnatioe wrhich will fittingly crwu your lifes labours for thf welfare of oair great empireafter the presentation of the addresses mr glai sroze saidgentlcmeni have come here as you know rather under cover of a kind oitreaty not dir honourable i hope oiughter that this was to be an occasion on wheich i was to receitevarious manifesta tions of feeling but on which aftep the operations i the last few days which i think have exhausted the poublic of the midland counties  no nlo  i wes not to make a speech however when i arm wei comed not only by so many distinguished and weul tried veterans of the cawuse but also by one of thoae liberal candidates who are engaged in bringing it to the issue over a portion of this district in a praetical and final msanner by an assault on the parliamentary representation of the countyor rather of the honour able legitimate peaceful and constitutional endeavour to give what we believe to be a true and genuine an pression of the wishes and convictions of the people ennot help assuring yen of the pleasure and satisfac tion with which i receive these addresses and i will confine myself beyond that to the expression of one single idea it is thisi have derived very consider able comfort from it in thie course of the last two or three weeks duringwhich i have made it a subject of i careful examination i am here in a district the heamt and soul and intelligence of whlich i believe to be entiiazy enlistedi will not say entirely enlisted but in a preponderating degree enlistedon behalf of the ust claimns of ireland cheers of coursei am aware of the fact shortlived i believe but disastrous while it lives that the representation of this district isuntil i come near the portion of it represented so well and effectually by my hon friend mr stahhope cheersthe representation of this district is entirely a dverse rnot only to ouir ideas not only to the general principles and views of the liberal party bat to something which i place fr beyond even thoae general principles and vreivn smely the great inter national question between the two islands which make up the united klingdom hear hear it is a deplorable fast generally that this should be so bnt the idea which  have been investigating as i say with some comfort and satisfaction to myself i should like to mae also the subject of a momentary consola tion to you i have recollected that our representa tion and our franchise widely as we rejoice to say it is now distributed is not when taken as a whole a simple expression of the views of the population of the country i have shown in birmingham that whilewe have certainly got several million of occuation votes which votes are of course grealy divided in opinion the balance at the last election according to every rational and modrate estimate that can be made was cast not by the true sense of the population considered individually as men but by votes the plural votes given by the owners of property  shame  who have already like everybody else enjoyed their occupation vote and having enjoyed their occupation vote by virtne of their possessions in different farliamentary districts and often in differert conuties of the country are enabled to be represented over and over again at the polls which is like what sometimes happens at the play laughter i recol lect very vell an amusing play at the haymarkettheatre vrith a eliresentation of thte armv of a very small germani potentate you are aware that in those days gsermany wasbrolen up in a muntitude of fractions instead of bseing as at now is a great and united people some of lhese fractions were extremely small and the piotentstes ere counted by the score if not by the hundred the ariny of this potentate con sisted of no rosa than two soldiers laughter this potentate had a policy and he had a military policy and his policy consisted in mainldg the two soldiers shift rapidly from place to place so that they appeared in half a score of places with a capitally dressed and got up sentinel always op guard and on duty laughter the fact being that thero were but two of them some times we saw them skipping across the stage but always they reappeared at the right place and at the right time and produced the impression of a considerable force laughter these property voters are exactly like the soldiers i mmremler of bir buckstones ver sion of it the soldiers of what they call in ger many flerzog or as ir buckstone called it arch hedgehog loud laughtdr each of these appeared as i have told you and in the same manner it is that the ownership voter obtains an idvantige of multi plying bimself and appearing by nimbly moving from one electionr to another on a multitude of polls well if there has been a sparl of amusement in that illustration i am extremely giad of it but it was no joke in the yenr  the efect of which has been to falsify the sense of the country represented in tshe elections i a manner i grant perfectly legal perfectly authoritative not to be disputed for a momnent while it is the law of the country but there is i believe the fact that a minority of the people have possessed a majority of the votesnnd possessing a majority of the votes have possessed also a majority of the seats in parliament and through the majority of these seats partly tory partlydssentient liberal i do not like to draw any broad distinction between them but on the wshole every englishma likes to kmow with whomn ind what he baa to deal and fcr my part i confess i have more satisfaction at the present time in dealing with the tories than with the disseutients but between themi do not care to dispute the shares they have had in this workbetween them the effeca of this political representation but moral msrepresentation cheers of the people of this island has been that ireland is groaning under coercion that ireland has still to lament the existence of an administrativc system thoroughly antinationhl which you gentlemen would not tolerate for a week if it existed in this coimtry and that the day of the fulfil ment of their hopes us somewhat postponed cheers i do trust that yog ivill vhen the time comes make serious efforts to see if yofu cannot mend that state of things in this district i feel anxious about you hut as to the country at large i feel ho anxiety i feel a perfect moral conidence arid certainty ss to what the country at large ill say cheers i know something of wales and in wales i boelieve we will make a pretty elean aweep i kuno something of scotland and in scotlandl am assured and told on the best authority that we shall very nearly make a clean sweep of those sections and parties who mis represent tne country and keep alive and foment dig cord between england and iteland and that the partty of concord vill be uppermost i havb no doubt iet it be uppermost in this district as iell as in other dis tricts do not be behind sow feu con armein this great hbppy
