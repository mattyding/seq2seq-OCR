the east african questionberlin nov in replying under date of the th inst to a eommunication conveying the resolutions adopted at the recent great antislavery meeting in cologne prince bismarck wrote the imperial government has for some time back been endeavouring to bring about an agreement among the powers concerned with the object of taking more effective measures ageinst the slave trade and in this sense is primarily engaged in negotiations with the royal british government we may hope that these will soon afford a basis for entering into similar negotiations with the governments of italy and portugal which are also interested in the east coast of africa and also with the powers that were parties to the congo actit is pointed out that the telegraphic accounts of lord salisburys speech on tuesday last on the east african question which were furnished to tne german press by the semiofficial news agency here omitted all reference to the following words of his lordshipi do not say that the ilavehaders lihai been the only cause of the calamities i should say that the increase of the slavetrade has been the disposing cause and the very great errors com mitted by the german company have been the excitin cause  and the two together have resulted in the terrible misfortunes which have occurreda statement in the burscn zeitung which i quoted last night incladed the remark that the only thing which now remained for the german east african company to do was to liquidate and hand over its trust to the imperial government other journals tender the same advice  but dr carl peters one of the chiefs of the company whom i met this evening assures me that it has no such intention as is ascribed to it it remains however to be seen as outsiders remark whether the imperial government which claims as much paternal authority in africa as at home over german subjects will not seek to exercise even more than douce violence on the company in order to bring it round to its the governments own views of the matter mleanwhile the companys affairs seem to be at a complete stand still and it is not easy to see how it is to regain possession of the territory from which it has been ousted without the intervention of an armed force on land the said force to be either organized by the company after the manner of its east indian prototype or furnished by the imperial govem ment here in berlin people find it difficult to see how a more blockade of a coast even if it put a stop to the export of slaves will serve to re instate the german company in its previous possessions there are even some who argue that the blockade will tend tomake matters worse seeing that it will only irritate the arabs and render them more hostile than ever to the existence of german settlements in their midst a blockade without the complementary organization of a settled land force military or police is regarded here i repeat in certain serious circles with no slight misgiving  but of course the government or the company would be solely responsible for such a forcethat the idea of organizing such a territorial force is actually entertained may be gathered from the factfor fact i am assured it isthat one of the companys men has left or is about to leave for india to male personal inquiries about the feasibility of recruiting mahrattas or some other suitable native race as troops for service within the german sphere of interest in africa in the event of their being obtainable such indian mercenaries would also be utilized in connexion with the uerman emin pasha expedition  but the aims of this expedition seem to be mounting ever higher among the metaphysical clouds even lieutenant wissmann its leader pre sumptive has no longer the remotest notion of what is going to be done or whether his services will ever be required elsewhere than in the second regiment of prnssian foot guards to whichhehas beenatiachedby special favour of the emporor the gallant lieutenant had pre viously served in a mecklenburg regiment and to be now attached to the active army in the second foot guards which is olicered exclusively by sprigs of nobility is for a mere commoner like the afriean traveller a very marked honour but then a man who like lieutenant wissmann has twice traversed the dark continent has surely taken out as good a patent of nobility as could be conferred upon him by any heraldic office in all ermanyberlin nov the beaziner pozitisce lacrichuten declares the state maents published here yesterday by various newspapers as to the impending liquidation of the german eastcom x to be dodod nd adds that ininfluential quarters the fact that germany and england will direct their joint efforts against the arabs is re garded as all the mbre reason for the germans to keep a firm hold upon their posscssionsthe anglogerman agrcement is expected to he pu lished shortly romde nov negotiations are taking place vwith a view to the participation of italy in the blockade on the east african coast
