 ienghc x eocdpsbaf tower unbishig ap i pihncr company cmartsjudgment war given in this case the facts ofe which were reported in the tisw of november mr jelf qc and dmr clay were the counsel for the claimant company hfr vaughan williams and mr ogle for french the execution creditorthe question was whether certain documents re quired registration ander the bills of sales acts as being an assuranceida justice fr ld said that this was an interpleader heard by the county court judge at sonthend in which he had held that the claimants claimr was barred for want of registration  the facts were some what singular fzrench a tradesman at southend had � owing to him from hmr bombernard who occupied a furnished villa in that town and was apparenglyths owner of the furniture in  bombernard was in arrears with his reut and a distress was put in the person acting as distress broker was named durham ye was also an agent and received commissions and in fact received one from the claimant company on this very transaction he was asked by bomberiard far a loan but instead of c omplying with that request he referred him to the company on the th of february panshard the manager of the claimiant company durham and mlr and irs bombernard were all on the premises when the arrangement in question was come to the details given were some wshat scanty but it appeared that dburham signed a receipt for � and purported to sell the goods seized to panshard he panshard then let the goods on a hiro agreement to mrs bombernard she alone executed that agreement which was of a complicated descrip tion by it the goods were to become her propertv after two years if she duly paid the instalments ia similar transaction tool place in july durham care fully seizing only those goods which had not been included in the former arrangement the iearned judge was of opinion that the claimants had failed to comply with the reauirements of the acts the county court judges decision must therefore be upheld the pdliey of the law had altered in modern times the ogd law was directed aginst covinous or fraudu lent sales add transfers uen came the act of  directed aainst secret bills of sales which were said to be in defraud of creditors the act of s ave a wider definition of the meaning of hills of sale saving evidently followed the interpretation given in cdrtain decided cases that act was intended to pro tect creditors for it made the bill of sale void asainst execution creditors unless operly registered yci act of  was framed on a different policy it was intended to protect people against themselvesthe act required that bills of sale should be in a certain formeasily intelligible given in the schedule and if not it was to be void aainst every one even the grantor in certain cases teh learzed judge then dealt with the cases cited of  woogate v god frey   x d  and ex d  lyssden v meadows   q b d   cochrane vmlatthews   ch d   and  worth central wagon company v manchester sheffield c company  ch   what was the principle to be ednced from these it was thisthat an inventory and receipt was an assurance reguiring registration when it was givenina transaction of such a character as to lead the conrt to believe that they were interded as documenta of title and as evidence of title the county court judge thought that this was an assurance in this case the sale by durham was not a sale by the sheriff an independent officer but by the landlords broker now a bzolrer for alandlord had power to sellunder certain statutory conditions one of which was that the goods might not be sold within five days without the consent of the debtor in this case the alleged sale took place within that period this was some evidence that durham was zeally acting for bomber nard he had not obtained sny indemnity in writing from bombernard for his irregularity all the facts pointed to the conclusion that this was not a hostile sale aa the invento which was taken and which it was the duty of the broker to take was written on paper belonging to the claimant company the result of all the circumstanceswas that the trans action was one in which the documents required regition if the sale as a sale by durham as broker inasmuch as  the goods remained in the apparent possession of bomernard the xroceeding was void against the execution ereditor it was also void under the act of  as not being in the proper form eiven by the seheaneexirt jusre wnills delivered a written judement to the effect that if the receipts and inventoriesa in question were assurances given by way of security for the payment of money they would comne within the act of  and not being in the statutory form would be void as against every one and under all ciroum stances and further in that case not only these docu ments but the hiring agreements made at the same time would require registration if however they fell not within theact of  but only withini the act of  they would be void as against the preseut execution creditor and only so far as tegardsthe property in the goods comprised in the respective bills of sale which at the time of the seizore by the sheriff under the x present execution were in the aplparen possession of the persons apainst whom process had issued in the execution of wich process they had been oiven and vict c section the goods vere in the apparent possession of bombernard as durham was not a person executing the process of any court the latter alfernative in zuction  fthe act of i dild not apply the three questions therefore which arose werel was the receipt for money an assuranco within section  of the act of    if so was bombernard the maker of it   was the receipt given by way of security for the payment of money ff tho first and second questions he answered in the affirina tive the third became immaterial if the rst and third questions were answered in the affirmative the second became immaterial the county court judge ought to have answered the second and third ques tions the learned judge then dealt with the facts and came to the conclusion that bombernard was a party to the whole arrangement  that the sale by dar ham was not a hostile and independent saie and his intervention was one of form not substance dnrham was merely a pratc nom to use a french term that being so and the transaction being of a sale bomber dard s ina whose apparent possession the goods were when the execution creditor caused execution to be levied the question arose whether the receipts and inventory were an assurance made by bombernard if they were merely part of the machinery of the sale by durham still they werebombernards doing althongb the receipt was signed by darham tfhe cases on these points wercdiffecult to comprehend bat one tbing wans clear that in them great stress had been always laid upon the fact of whether the receipt had been con temloraneous with the other elements of the transac tion and whether there had ever been a period of tims when the transaction was complete without it it appeared to him that if the money never would have been paid down unless the rest of the connected trans action had been carried through simultaneously then it was more than a mere receipt he therefore answered the questions  and  in the affirmtive the second transaction was practically the same the buy ing and selling ad letting back took place at the same time it was unnecessary to answer the tbird question but for the fact that mrs bombernard was the nominal party to the hiring there was very little distinction between this case and  coebrane v mlatthevws   ch d  and exz parte odell lo ch d  the learned judge did not see that the later cases threw doubt on these decisions they afforded a wholesome example of the determination of the courts in matters of this kind not to be misled by forms adopted by ingenious persons to defeat the ends of the legislature  the appeal must be discharged with costs
