a thomavs hamlet  in bombfrom our itoie corpespondentthe production of the hamlet of ambroise thomas at the costanzi theatre on november  the third of the reproductions of this season gave rise to the most extraordinary demonstration of approbation that i have ever seen in an italian theatre the soprano mdlle calve as ophelia took the house by storm and the enthusiasm after the crazy scene was such that the whole audience rose in a burst of applause and it was difficult to avoid a repetition of the entire act the roman public is critical and even capri cious in musical matters but when it is decided it is very frank a wd warm in recognition of excellence mdlle calve has geat personal attractions a beautiful face and a fnelymodelled figure with exquisite taste in dress and her acting is thoroughly sympathetic apd free from exaggeration her voice isand here i repeat the words of the highest authority here in musical mattersthe purest that has been heard in rome for a long time perfectly trained and clear and full over the entire register she was evidently very nervous in her opening but when after the firsu aria she had a bis with great applause she took heart and thenceforth had the audience with her she sings as simply and naturally as she acts and it is an immense relief to hear a singer wlho thinks more of her music than of her own vocalization the most authoritative critic of the roman press arcais writes of her debutthe first bonours be it said at once belong to signora calve a magnificent ophelia this young singer new to xolame has at once taken the public captive applauded throughout the opera she had in the fourth act an etraordinary ovathon she has a beautiful voice of great range which is as well adapted to dramatic recitative as to the tours de force which she executes with perfect precision she is moreover a most powerful actress here is another great and precious aequisition to the italian stage the repre sentation of last night was a real and deserved trium chthe sincerity of the applause of this roman audience is shown by the fact that the three leading singers are french  and it must have required some courage in view of the recent treatment of italians in france for the impresario to bring ouit french artists a roman audience is appreciative and intelligent and no claque can control the verdict so that a triumph here is justly esteemed by operatic artists as a genuine tribuitea diploma of excellence from authority which is good all round the world the reception of miss hastreuter who is american and mdlle calve who is french is a proof that in art at least the romans are not chauvinists
