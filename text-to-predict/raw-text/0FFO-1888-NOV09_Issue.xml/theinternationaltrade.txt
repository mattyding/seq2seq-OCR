the intbrnational trade unioncongrbssixom a copmesromnmtit seems as if difficulties in beginning business are destined every day to impede the progress of the con gress considerable time was agiin lost yesterday mhis was caused by a noisy wrangle with the dutch nelegates who claimed the right to translate into dutch all the speeches by four nationalities against one it was decided to adhere to the original rule of the congress limiting the translation to english and french at last the first subject put down for discus sion was taken up and m rnier read the collective report of the french delegation on  the most effica cious means for removing the obstacles to free combi nation in foreign countries he complained tha capitalism monopolized everything even the brains of defenceless children whom it reared in feelings of batred and contempt for foreign countries a european war seemed likely and the workers of the world must organize to prevent such an occurrence bankruptcy reports showing the oonstant collanse of small capitalists proved how rapidly a flnancial feudality was coming into existence but the large factories and emporiums established would serve as useful types for that nationalized industry they hoped to organize he read the preamble of the statutes constituting the labour parties of belgium holland portugal spain france poland and other countries showing that one and all rroclaimed identically the same principles and ideas it was the law and the law only that separated the working classes of different nations in france the dufaure law of  against the inter national must be abrogated as also the  and  clauses of the penal code against coalitions the law on the formation of trade unions passed in  was not in force in large industrial centres of france but should also be abrogated lest some reactionary go vernment availed itself of the powers it conferrzd cooperative productive enterprise in france had entirely failed in its object and only created petty capitalists who were worse tyrants than the larger employers international organization alone could solve the labour problem as it was the best means of securing the socialization of the land and the imple ments of production ultimately reaching the ideal when all would labour according to their capacity and zeceive accordmg to their needsm anseele for the belgian delegates expressed their joyful hope at the prospects of reconstituting the international the chief obstacle was the apathy and indifference of the workmen themselves also though they spoke glibly of the abolition of classes they should bear in mind that the spirit of class still pre vailed among the working men themselves it was scandalous to think that because one worker possessed a little more skill than another he was apt to con sider himself as belonging to a superior class all wageearners were equally victims of capitalist op pression capitalism knew no country and employed in preference coolies because the british workmen insisted on beefsteaks and political rights when workmen were oppressed in one country those who elsewhere enjoyed greater freedom should at once protest as a proof of international solidarity he proposed that on the first sunday in htay a demonstra tion should be held in every freae country at the game hour with the same evibems nmottoes and resolu tions these resiitlobs carried to various par liaments should demand diplomatic interference on the part of governments so as to insure the extension of equal freedom to the workers all the world over by thus declaring our fraternity with oppressed peoples would the foundationstone of a new  international be laid it should be such a demonstration as would showv despotic countries the danger of resisting the rising tide destined not to flood but tofertilize the world mr christensen from denmark urged the necessityof assimilating laws affecting labour in all countries and ir croll from holland called for an expression of indignation against some employers in holland who had prevented two datch delegates from attending the congress by threatening to discharge themsignor lazzari the italian delegate said that politicsthe art of governing people or rather ef leading them like sheepwere not looked upon wvith favour by his fellowcountrymen they had most need of education for according to the statistic taken in   per cent of the population could neither read nor write of the working mnen the proportion was probably  per cent therefore it was by speech and public meetings that they could best be influenced capitalism in italy was not so fully developed and workmen might still hope to become small masters nevtertheless a labour party had been formed in italy he did not lay much stress on the need of reforming the law it was easy to avoid the law a great point was to win over the support of the majority nor did he think it ncessary to reestablish the international the great necessity was to raise the condition of the working classes throughout the world bring them up to the same level  and for thispurpose more had to be done in italy than elsewhere for in italy they had fallen to the lowest levelm tortellier the anarchist who represents the parisian joiners said that trade unionism and freedom of combination could only be of service to the skilled workers improvements in machinery were imolacable and no political law could prevent even skilleci workers from being thrown out of employment by new machines it was the unemployedunskillcd labour that should be the subject of their concern their misery eould not be relieved hy any legislative or privateeffort the only means had already been indicated by those who were dying of hunger were not the recent strikes different fromtheir predecessors  the hot breath of re volution wafted over them if the workers were too civilized to kdll if they had not the courage to fight then let them cease work when the land was no longer cultivated when bread was not baked when the worker had signed that sentence of death they would see how the capitalist in his palace could live without their labour if the workers were so degraded it was because of their surroundings a revolution giving to all equal rights would regenerate every onehi y avin challenging the accuracy of the some what anarchical theories propounded by the italian delegate criticized mi torteliers remarks if free dom only benefited skilled workers he claimed for them the legal right to act on behalf of their un skilled brethren to advocate a general strike was simply to preach in favour of a physical force revolu tion were the workers of all countries ready for a rising  were they capable of profiting by a victory if they could achieve it  or would not such a rising be the means by which such advantages as were already enjoyed would be withdrawvn labour still further oppressedz and its leaders and organizers killed or im prisoned  mer setfer while not endorsing either collectivist or anarchist theories nevertheless advocated the re construction of the internationalmr john barns rose to deny that perfect freedom of comsination existed in england and was proceed ing to describe the action of the police and military durino the strikes in wales when he was ruled out of order as the subject under discussion only related to continental countries some of the foreign dele gates took exception to this ruling and there was a somewhat noisy demonstration in the spectators gallery which made the chairman threaten to close the gallery to the publicli mlontas on behalf of the parisian engineers re peated many statements already made by other sneakers but added that the recent decree of the french government compelling foreign residents in france to register their names was an act altogether opposed to true republican sentiment and his society energetically protested against such a measure he thought an international should be reconstructed but thatits central office or council should not interfere with the tadtics of the various local and national branchesthe proceedings then concluded and the
