tbe snyder xpiosivb sehbllhmir h f snyder of new york who is at present in londonhas succeeded in constructing a projectile by means of which it is possible to fire from an ordinary gun shells filled with ex plosives of the most active character  the diffi culty in the way of doing this has been that the charge was liable to be ignited by the shock of the powder explosion against the base of the shell so that the latter wouldburst in the calibre of the gun  but mr snyder has overcome this diffi culty by the expedient of introducing a buffer of indiarubber between tho powder and the base of the shell so that the latter receives a push instead of the ordinary concussionthe projectile as now made by mr snyder consists of two portions the front or actual shell whicih contains the charge of dynamite or of nitroglycerine and a detachable posterior por tion which contains the buffer taking the pro jectile for a in howitzer as an example we find that the front partwhich contains thedynamiteis of the common cylindricoconoidal form and is about hvo and ahalf diameters in length it has a solid base is charged by removing a screw plug from the apex and its posterior half is turned down so as to be of slightly smaller external diameter than the anterior half for experirmental purposes the material is brass but steel would be used in actual warfare the posterior or detach able half of the projectile is a tube of soft brass about in in length which accurately fits the bore of the gun and which receives the actual shell in front the base of this tube is closed by metal and its posterior in are occupied by a plug of indiarubb er which fits into its interior this plug is fluted eternally and contains several cylindrical cavities or air chambers open at the bacl and closed in front the plug being pushed home in the hinder portion of the tube leaving the front in free the charged shell is pushed in to occupy this space of in and then the projectile as a whole is ready to be placed in the gun in front of an ordinary powder charge when the gun is fired the first effect of the powder is expended upon the indiarubber and upon the aiu contained in its chambers with the effect that the plug and the tube containina it are compressed shortened and forced into the grooves of the rifling no shock is imparted to the dynamite and the projectile as a whole is gently started on its way tho explosive contents not being fired until the shell strikes against the object towards which it is directed when an effect is produced determined by the quantity and properties of the charge mr snyders first experiments were made with quite small shells bus finding them completely successful he became emboldened to try larger and larger guns and charges and he has now repeatedly fired b or lolb of dynamite or nitroglycerine from a in howitzer he came to europe intending to place his inventions at the disposal of the english government but his shells and gun were seized at liverpool by the customs authorities and he finds that the laws in force here with regard to the use of explosives are practically prohibitory of the loading processes which it would be neces sary for him to carry out in consequence of these obstacles he went on to turkey where he was very cordially received and had manypportunities of firing at fixed targets with if the testimony of photography is conclusive most destructive effects he is also negotiating with the austrian and italian governments for experi ments in their respective countries in addition to the power of firing explosives with safety mr snyder claims that his system greatly diminishes recoil and also the strain of the powder charge upon the fabric of the gun
