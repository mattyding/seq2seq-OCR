lr aab nlatybs in tganda a communication of quite recent date from the rev pere lourdel one of the roman catholic missionaries in uganda gives a very vivid picture of how the slave traffic is carried on in central africa and how the arab slavers have been inciting the weakminded ring of uganda against english and germans alike this conduct mav to some extent account for the events which have led to the joint action of england and germany in east africa mioreover pere lourdel is able to give news from eimin pasha up to april lastthese arab slavers the pbre states reside for a part of the year at the court of mwanga to purchase the slaves which the king causes to beunted and captured either in his own territories or in those of his neighbours he often sends out on these slaveraids armies of several thousand men at too frequent intervals the missionaries to their grief see these victorious armies return iug driving before them troops of slaves often  or  at a single time the king selects those he wants to keep for himself or to dis tribute among his great eniefs and sends the rest to the moslem slavedealers who sweep them all off either to sell them on the coast to the dealers who supply the arabian market or to dispose of them in upper egypt it is a profitable business which enriches the arab slavers and at the same time procures for king mwanga all that he requires for extending his territory con firming his power and multiplying his slaves and his victimsnamelyarms andpowder these arabs are of course feared and detested by the natives among whom they live but at the same time their power over the weak mwanga is immense they constantly instil into hima suspicions as to the projects of europeans and missionaries and that with only too much success wvhen pere lourdel statesmir gordonthe successor of mir mackay in the english missionarrived the arabs translated a long letter to the king in arabic in which he was informed of the resolution which the eburopean powers had taken to  eat  up all the country of the blacks the germans were to take the whole region between the zanzibar coast and unyaiiyemb the english uganda and all the neighbouring countries mr gordon according to ipere lourdel brought a present for bishop parker and a letter stating that he had not come to avenge the death of bishop hannington but to instruct his people mwanga was e tcmely irritated and told mr gordon he would be regarded as a prisoner and a hostage in case of the reported design of the europeans if the english attaced ljganda or assailed miwangas merchandise  on the coast mr gordon would be killed ee sent a letter to bishop plarker demanding guns and powder as evidence of his good will inside the letter he put some ashes as a declaration of war turning to his people he cried in a voice trembling with rage do you see how this white insults me to my face h oot him insult him  andall the court hurled the greatest insults in the face of poor mr gordon the intentions ascribed by the king to the whites make him fear a war as imminent  buy guns and powder he tells all his people and his chiefs protest they will defend him to the last drop of their blood and that though the whites should come from all quarters they will be exterminated but the great danger at uganda and in central africa is not from the reported intentions of the whites but from the actual doings of the arabs accompanied by all that is worston the coastthoy areat present flock ing towards victoria llyanza and especially towards uganda pere lourdel thinks there is room for believing that these arabs have really some great design for conquest what is certain is that they do everything in their power to render the whites hated and have them drivenirom rie continenit thie tirsb tiung according to father lourdel which europeans will have to do who seriously intend the establishment of colonies in africa will be to make a clean sweep of the arab and coast olementsto succeed it will be necessary to render trade on the coast im possible for the arabs and interdict them under tb severest penalties from importing guns and powder this is a step which ought to have been taken long ago an enormous number of firearms is at this moment to be found in the hands of the natives in uganda alone there are many thousands of every type and it is this which explains the haughty attitude of mwanga a few more years of this traffic and travelling in africa will become impossible for white men unless accompanied by a welldisciplined army it is this also which aids the success of the daily increasing slavetraffic all these guns serve to arm the scoundrels who accompany the slave hunters and the calamities which they carry into central africa far beyond lake albert are incalculable it should be said that while pere lourdel is absolutely truistworthy mr gordon does not speak of any difficulty with mwanga in his most recently published lettersin the month of april  they were without any news of stanley in uganda is he living or is he dead  asks pere lourdel and he asks in vainfor an answver what is certain he states tis that at the moment of stanleys departure from the congo they in uganda heard of his march and his projects mlwanga was in such a state of terror that he thought the end of his reign had arrived they were all in fear of being massacred the moment stanley set foot in uganda but for a year thero has been not anotlher word as to stanleys doings which pere lourdel thinks very strange seeing that the king has evident means of knowing what is going on all round his territory people who had been to wadelai and had returned to uganda before the pbre wrote state that stanley was not with emin pasha still it is satisfactory to know from pbre lourdel that it appears to him impossible that a small army of several hundred armed men can have dis appeared without any one knowing where it has gone as it would be to conceal the news of stanleys death if it had really arrived we may say in conclusion that we believe some of timins friends have received letters from him of more recent date than november  but as usual they are surrounded with mystery and secrecy what purposo is served by shrouding certain african matters in mystery it is difficult for the interested public to see
