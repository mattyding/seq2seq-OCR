certain whether it would be generally convenient that questions as to the progress of inquiries by royal commission should be addressed to members of the commission who may happen to sit in this house it would be more convenient as  general rule thai such questions should be addressed to some member of the government i may say however that the royal commission sat several times before the recess

next week and i hope the commissioners will be able to devote themselves very constantly during the re mainder of the session to the subject of inquiry it is extremely improbable however that the
