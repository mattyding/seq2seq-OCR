thaln one question of law was raised the first of them being of considernole import anee in respect of tha testamentary dipstions of mnarried women the testtrix who aldd inauril of the pregent  year hald by the wi in qestion left the bulk of her personal property to mr harding her executor in trust for persons named in the ijn ment soon after her death mr harding applied at the principal registry for probate in commaon form o a kis pauvit of wictim awam that tli aiproperty amounted t  d  oddmone he de fendant entered t caeav and the plaitiff was con seqaently obliged to come to the coart itself and apply for a grant of probate in solemn form the defendant opposed this application on three grounds irst teat he never approved the making of the willsecondly that his deceased wife was at the date of her death entitled to no personal property and had no estate of any kind whatever  thirdly that the whole of the property of which the wsill purported to dispose was his an his reply the plaintiff besides denying the defendants allegations about the ownership of the property farther pleaded that the statement of defence afforded no answer to the plaintiffs claimmr glinx in support of the plaintiffs case con tended that there was no defence to it shown on the face of the defendants pleadings even before the passing of the married womens property act of  this court bad sometimes made general grants in the case of wlls by married women aor this he referred to ia rethe goods of rice c lrr pd but in consequence of the passingjof that sat the form of grant in the case of such wills was now general this was in accordance with the amended rule of court one of the amended rules bearing date march   was iu these termsi rules  and sin a grant of probate of the will of a married woman or of the will of a widow made under coverture or letters of administration with such wllms annexed it shall not be necessary to recite in the grant or in the oath to lead the same the separate personal estate of the testatrix or the power or authority imder which the will has been or purports to have been made the probate or letters of administration with the will annexed in such cases shall take the form of ordinary grants of probate or letters of administration with the wiu annexed without any exception or limitation and issue to an executor or other person authorized on usual course of representa tion to take the same  a surviving husband however being entitled to the same preference to the nextof kin of the testatrix in case of partial intestacyhe submitted that acting on that rule the court ought to at once grant probate in this casedr tnrstrit and mr statham both argued at some length that the coart ought not to grant probate tiu it he before it evidence that the testatrix pos sessed separate estate to dispose of the amended rule read by counsel for the plaintiff was one under the official heading amended rules orders and instrutctions for the registrars bf the principal probate registry and for the district probate registrars in non contentious business here there was a contest and consequently the role did not apply if the testatrix had no separate property the court in granting pro inte of her will would be granting probate of waste paper suraly the court w ould not do that mrn jjstice but observed that before the passing of the married womens property act of  there was a presumption against a married woman having separate estate that act removed such presumption and now when a married woman disposed by wvill of personal property there was as much presumption tnat is was her separate estate as there would be in the case of personal property disposed of by a man or a femme solc that it was the separate property of the person who disposed of it he asked whetther counsel for the defendant could cite any case to show that the court had ever in any instance declined to grant ro bate of the will of a man or of a fammc sole untit it had ascertained whether the testator or testatrix had any property to dispose ofcoausel for the defendant admitted that they coald cite no such case  bat they suggested that the reason why there had been no such case was that if a man or a femme sole had made a will and there was no pro perty it would be nobodys interest to come in and oppose probate what the married womens property act of s did was to raise a presumption that property possessed by a married woman was her separate pro perty hut it raised no presumption whatever that she had any property at all here the issue of property or no property was raised by the defence and the court ought to be satisfied that the testatrix had property to dispose of before it admitted her will to probate if the court entered on this irnquirv at all as they contended it ought to do then they would ask it to go into an examination in detail as to the ownership of each item of personal property disposed of under the will this latter applicatilon they grounded on some observations made by the late blaster of the rolls when giving his judgment in re thorne which is reported in  lr v pd  the other authorities cited by the learned counsel were

reply cited  brownrigg v pike  plp  p d  to show that the bare naming of an executor without the demise of a legacy to him or the appointment of anything to be done by him was sufficient to show that the document which contained such nominationl was a will if properly executed his learned friends had failed to show that as a precedent to the granting of probate the possession of propertby the testatrix must be proved but here there was at least prisd facm proof of thedosession of droperty by the lady because there was the affidavit of her executor that her separate property amounted to the exact sum of � s dmr justic� burr said the affidavit referred to by the learned counsel was the ordinary one made by an executor when applying for probate in common form and was not even primd facie evidence in a contested issue like the present he would hear evidence in this case he did not at al mean to say that he was bound to do so but his doing so might enable him to dispose of the case without entering further into what mighbt turn out to be the academic questionrdiscussed by counsel on both sides for if he found tht the testatrix had any property whatever of her own he would at once order probate to issue without going into any investigation as to the precise amount of that dronertva question then arose as to the side on which the onus of proof lay it was decided by the learned junde ruling that it lay on the executor as it might be impossible for the defendant to adduce evidence to show that the testatrix was net possessed of any separatve propertythe plainiff was then examined and crossexamined he stated that he had known the testatrix for a great number of years she was a widow named wake when she married the defendant mir wake her first husband died in  and she married the defendant in  in  she hanided the witness a post office savings bank book tq keep for her and he had kept it for her up to the time of her death he now produced it and it showed that the deposits recorded in it were made in the name of wake and that the first of them was made as eaply as  the suns standing in her credi a esent was � os d for principal and � for interest li  she advanced witness � and his i   for it was now among her papers she kept a marine store shop before and after her marriage with suttonuir justicn butt intimated that if this evidence could not be rebutted he would grant probate of the will on proof of its due executionthe defendant was then ecamined and cross examined he said he was a wheelwright after his marriage with the testatrix he gave her all his earn ings his name was put up over her marine store but tbere was no marriage settlement nor was there any agreeraent that he was to share in the profits of the store one of the attesting witnesses having given evidence of the due execution of the willmr justice brw in pronouncing judgment stated that the question whether proof that a married testatrix had separate property must be a precedent to a graut of probate in solemn form was one which this court might hereafter have to decide but the discus sion of it in this case had turned out to be purely academic because there was an end of it as seon as it had been show n by evideuce that the testatrix had separate property to dispose of that had been shown conlusnively it had been shownthat years beforeher second marriage she placed money in the post office savings bank she being at that time a widow that it reinaaed in that bank durilg the whole time of her married life as wife of the defendant that it was in the bank at the time of her death and that it re mained there still as money depopited by her in her own and soe name therefore unless the contrary were showni by rebutting evidencesbe died possessed of separate property  but the contrary had not been shown be regarded with respect auy opinion ex pressed by the late master of tho rolls but the words relied on by counsel for the defendant as having been used  by his lordship in the case qf thorpe formed no part of his judgment in that case and lord bramwell did not concur in them an investigation into au the items of property disposed of by the testatrix with the view of deciding whether any of it and if any how much of it was not separate property was one for which another court had machinery which this court had not he di not thinik he ought to entor upon such an inquiry it having been shown by evidence that tbe testatriz was possessed of separate property at the time she made the will and at the time of her death he decided that the will be admitted to probate with costs agaixst the defendant
