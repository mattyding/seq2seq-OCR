country is diminishing with the in creased consumption of the made cigarette nevertheless trebizond tobaeco will always be in demand on account of the qualities of its leaf which by its size and its

established in turkey for the purchase of tobacco have established their head offices in constantinople or at smyrna their branches in the growing districts send their agents before the harvest and during the season to visit the growers and make direct purchases the turkish firms are occupied almost exclusively with the buying of tobaeco in the country very rarely are they indirect relations with german dutch or english houses abroad in most cases they resell their goods to american firms which have their headreadingto the workersa common feature in the factory life of havana is the employment of a reader to entertain the workers our photograph shows areader on leftoffices in turkey foreiga eompanies in turkey are naturally in direct touch with the european and american markets there are smaller business houses long established in the tobacco zones which are m direct contact with the growers they transact business thus between the growing distriets and the constantinople and smyrna markets the foreign firms in turkey formerly bought their tobacco from these small business houses but wishing to share in the profits they estab lished their own branches in the growing dis tricts the war however compelled them to close their branches temporarily and thus the turkish agents became again the inter mediaries between growers and eompaniesthe middlemansince the return to normal conditions the foreign companies have again attempted to establish branches in the interior of the country but without success the reason is easily explained the cultivation of tobacco demands continual care and considerable ex perience the grower being nearly always short of money needs capital for living and working expenses he is obliged to appeal to the small turkish firms established in his district from them he receives an advance of from  to  per cent of the value of his future harvest and engages himself to sell to them a stipulated quantity thus the growers remain bound by their agreement with the local business firms which thanks to this ar rangement are able to compete with the large eompanies in this manner the tobaeco passes from the hands of the grower to the turkish agents to be resold to the foreign comapanies on the constantinople smyrna and sarnsun marketstobacco bought through the turkish merchants from the country folk is not in any way prepared it is packed en bloc generally with various qualities in the same bundle these bundles can only be sold therefore on a large scale the foreign companies subject these tobaccos to a careful sorting and pre paration according to the requirements of the european and american markets the tobacco thus passes through three hands before reach ing the foreign consumer thereby increasing it price sometimes by  per cent the profit of the merchants i the country and of the intermediaries between the growers and the foreign companies is valued at  to  per cens acording to the quality of the tobacco and the locality the prices for working pack ing and storage are from  to  piastres per oka or kilogrammein view of this situation the government is at the moment occupied in protecting the interests of the tobacco growers as against the intermediaries by the establishment of local cooperative societies on the other hand it invites business houses and turkish com panies to found trusts with a view to
