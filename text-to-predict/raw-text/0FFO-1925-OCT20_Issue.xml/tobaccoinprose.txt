adventure and a defiance tobacco has now for many years been so comomonplace a part of life that references to it have lost much of their flavourit may in fact be held that the palmy days of tobacco in literature are over tobacco perhaps exerted its chief influence on letters during the midvictorian period when the full force of the invader was felt in circleswhich had not known it before and when the  weed  divided all society sharply into two opposing camps there were not only great writers but also great smokers and antismokers of the latter ruskin may stand as the typehe hated it as

the bath footmen imitated their masters for a long time as he told mr weller mr smauker carried coffee because of the resemblance also he found it easy to practise with so the farther back we go in
