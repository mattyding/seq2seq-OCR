i nicotine as aninsecticideimmunity of plantsby professor maxwell lefroythe fermented tobacco plant yields an alkaloid nicotine which is preeminent as an insect poison kilwn snall insects wher brought in contact with their bodies its immense use as an insecticide is due to a combination of hyseal and chemical characters it is sigtly soluble in water easily combined with soap solutions it is what the chemist calls basic and so combines with acids to form neutral salts which are soluble gad easily applied to the plantthe peculiar chemical grouping of the nitrogen atom in the complex molecule makes it readily absorbed by the nitrogen fat conmrounds that make up nerve tissue and so nieotme is taken up by the insect nerve structure entirely stops further absorption of oxygen and kills the insect the fact that nicotine is basic that it forms neutral salts means in practice that it will not injure delicate plant tissueso that you can spraythe most delicate of crop plants hops with it and do no damage a common formula for a nicotine wash as used on hops is b to lb of soft soap with oz to looz of nicotiner  gallons of liquid ready to spray on no other substance compares with this in toxicity and even if the cost is high the certainty of killing power with the immunity from damage to the most delicate plant has made nicotine the most useful insecticide for horticultural purposessynthetic nicotinenicotine is used mainly against such pests as greenfly aphide white fly aleurodes the softer scale insects coccids thrips and such larger sucking insects as the capsid bugs which in this country attack apple as well as the apple sucker pyuids its application against caterpilars is limited and it is without effect against most other horticultural pestsniicotine has never been syntheticauy produced its present price about s per pound does not encourage efforts in that direction and the possible coaltar deriva tives such as pyrsidine quinoline and other nitrogenous bodies relat to nicotine have very little killing power the future lies with the tobaccogrowers will it pay to grow tobaceos which on fermentation vield higher nicotine amounts for purely insecticidal uses or will nicotine become so small a fraction of the wastes as to stimulate production of artificial nicotine substitutes which while not nicotines are equally good insecticides  it may well be that a synthetic product or one of the other plant alkaloids will ulti mately displace nicotine
