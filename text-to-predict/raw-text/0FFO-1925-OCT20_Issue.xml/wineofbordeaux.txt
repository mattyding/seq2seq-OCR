wine of bordeauxlte vintageiom our special correondentthe first thing that strikes the visitor to the mdooevineyards is the tremendous scale of the industry the production of the gironde alone in  was  million gallons and yet only fourfifths of the vineyards are in produee in any one year the second feature is the enormous knowledge and capital reuired the vine is a delicate plant for ithat it grows in ground where nothing else would grow and is subject tb many pagues and pests the most resistant vine is obtained by grafting french cuttings on to american virgin vines which we cau lreepers for the first two years it bears nothing whatever and its best life is over after  years of bearing itmustbe sprayed it issubject to kunstroke mildew or frostbite if the weather is the least bit too hot too wet or too coldl the storage of the wine demands ample and expensive housing in enormous sheds exactly like temples of mithras with tapered square openings lett in just enough light but not too mue cement is disappoint ing wood invites the irreparable disaster of a fire and stone blocks alone are really satisfactory the export trade calls for a second series of storehouses and offices the wine must be put into special barrels of bosnian or american oak which alone is nonporousthe most astonishing thing about the grapes themselves is that a small rather bitter grape produces the great wines and that generally speaking the smaller the harvest the better the wine it is however nearly impossible to tell whether the vintage will be good or bad until the wine is actually made though the famous brands are beginning to be sold in advance the purchaser takig the risk this does not release the producer from anxiety for he knows thatbshould his wine lose its reputation all will be lostthe vintage begins in the latter half ofseptember or in an exceptionally latef year such as the present in the first days  of october when the grape has lost the last traees of a rosy tint and has become a black purple the white wine vintage is always later because the develop ment of the  pourriture  of the grape must be awaitedie the grape must be so bursting with sugar that it is sticky to the touch moreover each white grape must be picked separately off its stalk when it has attained precisely the right stage of maturity and this means going over the vines four or five times the red wine vintage is much simpler the main difficulty is to find the labour which is enlisted beforehand by local gangmasters or mistresses and is becom ing increasingly hard to find only in rare instances such as at pontet canet where the oldestablished house of cruze has made and sold its own wine for years do the same pickersfisherfolk from areachoncome back year after year and even of these many fail to appear at the last moment and the majority of the pickers are boys and girls the women wear voluminous red trousers as though they were the wives of spahis using up their husbands castoffsthe little army moves slowly along the rows clipping off the clusters with scissors and filling each his or her small basket among them pass men with big tin canis ters strapped on their backs into which the baskets are tipped lvhen the canisters are full the men walk out to the dusty roads between the fields where wait the bullock carts each loaded with three barrels into these the canisters are emptied and the grapes either trodden down with naked feet or pounded with a big stick for the bullocks with their face nets like ladies veils move so slowly that as much as possible must be taken on each journeywhen the carts arrive at the pressing houses the barrels are hoisted up to the first storey by a crane and tipped out upon a wooden floor here barefooted men shovel the bruised and leaking grapes into the open maw of a machine mounted on a trolley with high sides wherein busy teeth tear the grapes from the stalks before the mash of grapes and juice is allowed to drop on to the trolley floo the stalks are cast out on the other se and drop through to the ground floor here they are collected and squeezed  ihydraulic presses to make the  secoii wine it is just beginning to be thegeneral custom in the medoc to distil brandy from what is left after the pressing and in some cases even the pips are treated to produce oil so that nothing is wastedon the trolley floor men knee deep in grapes and juice push out the rosy sea through a funnel which decants every thing into the huge hogsheads on the first floor this is considered better than pumping it through pipes of metal as at margau or copper as at lafite because the wine has by this method the mini mum contact with metal the fact thatthe crude juice is so sensitive to mere metal is rather destructive of the assurance comforting to queasy stomachs whose possessors have seen its contact with bare feet that the fermentation destroys all impurities but fermentation whih takes place during the three weeks which the mush passes in the hogsheads is a volcanic business generating force enough not merely to burst and dissolve the grapes but even to bulge the iron hard oak covers of the hogsheadcs it is this fermentation of everything together which gives red wine its colour because the colour pigment is in the skins to make white wine the grapes themselves are pressed and only the juice used that is why there is hardly any deposit in white winewhile the wine is in the hogshead euve its temperature is carefully watehed and if need be it is eooled by being taken out from the bottom and passed back through a pipe into the top after three weeks it is drained off into barrels new made every year and begins the slow process of maturing after fiveinonths the purchaser can take it away if he will but all great wines remam im cask three years and lesser wines at least  months they are drained off into other barrels three or four times the first year and at least twice in subsequent years in order to leave the deposit which has sunk the master of tho  chai or store house stands anxiously beside the lessen ing trickle of wine filling glass afterglass and holding it up to the light so soon as he detects the least cloudinessthe triecle is stopped and the barrel cleaned outthus the whole process of the prepara tion of wine is entirely natural and a conscientious owner would scorn to tamper with his wine in any way there are just two permitted exceptions at the end of the first and second year in barrel the wine is  whipped ie white of egg is introdued and stirred round this forms a film on top of the wine which sinks to the bottom carrying with it all impurities the second exception is that in yearsd where the alcoholic content is very small under careful official supervision sugar may be added as ist done in the case of burgundyto be continuedlord derby will preside at the dinner of the british electrical and allied manufacturerse association at the connaught rooms on november
