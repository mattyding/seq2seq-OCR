mr lloyd george at city templekesponsibilities offree churchmenia traffic analogymr lloyd george addressed a free church gathering at the city temple yesterday after noon on  the responsibilities of free church men among those supporting mr uloyd george were dame margaret lloyd george and dr macnamaramr llod porga said that the topic upon which he had been asked to speak was one which he could not discuss unless he had the tongue of angels or the religious experience of  popular novelist i cannot hope to emu late the flights of either of these exalted beings he declared  i shall have to confine myself to a very much more limited and narrow flield and that is the responsibility of the free churches in reference to the state the power of the free churches was greater than ever when they exerted it together but their dififculties were greater than ever in the old days the free churches moved as one party recently the free churches had become divided between two great parties and they nust recognize it it divided their members from top to bottom and it was with difficulty they could now move together they could not move and mobilize the free churches together in the electoral support of one party except on two conditions one was that one party raised and committed its fortunes to a great moral issue where the other parties were either opposed or indifferent bonv can you get them to move together lr lloyd george asked  the problem of london trafmc is a very pressing problem the difficulty is not so much the traffic that wants to go in opposite directions that can be partially solved by the white line the diffi culty is largely the traffic that wants to travel in the same direction some want to go too slow laughter some would like to go steadily there are others in a tremendous hum and they are always tryiig to manceuvre ahead and to pass the others hence confusion there is another difficulty that happens the vehicles that in the main are travelling in the same direction would like to do it by different routes they are always crisscrossing in front of the other traffic and the result is a complete block it is pretty nearly the same in politics there are some very slow coaches laughter there are some in a terrible hurry to get alongwbat they wanted was a little more under standing good will and cooperation the business of the free churches in the coming years would be to get more cooperation among those who drove buses along the state road of life the business of the churches was to convert rulers and by the rulers he meant the democracy of the land they could do it when organized christianity thought more of its task and less of itself christianity would stand or fall by what it aecomplished in the amelioration of the physical as well as the moral condition of the people to whom it ad ministered the establishment of peace in the world was the paramount responsibility of the free churches  i should like the free churches wvent on mr lloyd george to do what they can to give fair play to the miners and agricultural labourers the miners have some right to the help of the free churches they have real wrongs let us help them to get them redressed we have many times been too ready to condemn them but believe me whatever some of their statesmen may say in their angerin a wrath which is by no means jnexplicable and not always indefensiblethe miners are not reckless by temperament and tradition they are a lawabiding patriotic class of men and when i have seen the conditions nnder which thousands of them hava been coii demned to live i marvel at their continued tolerance the agricultural labourers felt that they had been abandoned by the christian churches in some of the counties they were being paid starvation wagestus locanno pacralluding to the locarno pact mr lloyd george said he did not know the terms whiclh had been arrived at for he had not yet even read tlem there might be a good deal that could be criticized and complained of but knowing the difficulties the old feuds and the new ones knowing the hatreds in the soil of europe and the racial suspicions he knew that this was a difficult jungle to cleave a way through i you could only do it yard by yard it was so dense that you could iardly see the next step thank god for any man who took the hatchet and cut down that jungle cheers no doubt there are things in this agreement that i should not agree with but it is a great step that you should have had france and germany in the same pact of peace it is perhaps even a greater thing that you should have poland czechoslovakia and belgium i care not who it is whether libera labour ocialist or anybody else but i would sup ort the one who helped the cause of the prince of peace cheers why should the free churches be behind p there were risks he knew but if they took risks for war in geds name why not risks for peace  cheersdiscussing the responsibilities of the churches in reference to the drink question mr lloyd george recalled that there were a million and a half people out of work living on the bounty of the state that they had an adverse trading balance for the first time in their history but that nevertheless last year they silent �oooo on alcoholic lhquor cries of shame even if they took away the drink duties the drink bil would be � a year he spoke of how such a vast sum could be advantageously employed and dwelt on how this drink expenditure was poisoning the national efficiency the first thing they had got to do was to consider their problems in the face of the experiments and the new facts and efforts of those experiments of the last  years what was necessary was that they should diagnose and investigate the evils and apply their knowledge to the evils which existed of anl the experiments thathad been tried the most remarkable was that i of the united states it was no use indulging in slapdash condemnation of america after all  people in america had not only carried prohibition but the fact was that at the present moment no political party in the states dare propose an abolition of the prohibition law it was suggested that pro hibition in america was the craze of cranks but when he went to america he found there was not a vestige of truth in that view he never met a man who would give a vote in favour of the reestablishment of the saloon as far as publc opinion in america was con cemned the beerhouse was a thing of the past cheers  its an experiment we ought to investigate cheers dont condemn it in a haphazard sort of way one hundred and ten million people dont continue to make fools of themselves for a great number of years they are the most prosperous people under the sun not because they have gold but because they have not drink cheers he advised them to turn to canada where it is suggested prohibition had not been so successful to see what had happened let them go down to the roots of the matter of drink for it went down to the roots of their continuance as a great nation
