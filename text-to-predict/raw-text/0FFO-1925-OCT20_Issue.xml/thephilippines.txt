the philippinesobsolete ethods andindolencefrom our manyti correspondentthe valley of the cagayan in the island of luzon has been proclaimed by a foreign scientific tobacco planter to be the most wonderful natural tobacco region in the world but that from the standpoints of grower buyer and manufacturer no other tobacco region has suffered from such haphazard unscientific and unsystematic treatment in its develop ment the cagayan valley is about  miles long and varies from two to  miles in width every year during the rains the river overflows its banks depositing over the valley a rich alluvial silt which becomes a natural and effective fertilizer crops have been harvested annually on farms in this valley without the use of artificial fertilization or irrigation for  yearsin  the spanish govemment for pur poses of revenue established a tobacco mono poly which continued in force for  years under its systeni of careful ontroland stric supervision the  industry achaieved a hig degree  of prdsperity and philippine leaf earned a riputation fordelicacy of flavour aid excelleiice of qiiaty vhich it has not ap proached since the monopoly was ablished ini  with  the itroduictifon of modern appliances and modern imethods of curing and preparation for the market there is no reasbn why the cagaya leaf should not reoethe high place itole heldtin the esfieeii of tieitolacc worldu t

aiid pampano varieties are broader and furnish material for the best wrappers the last named most nearly approximates to the havana type of leaf however under each of these varieties miany very unrdesirable hybrids are congregated the farmers allow the plants to flower freely and little precaution is taken to prevent the pro miscuous transfer of pollen wholesale de moralization of legitimate types thus constantly occurs so that the crops are almost invariably lacking in uniformity of size shape and quality of leaflack of incentivewhile blame for the deterioration in the quality of philippine tobacco is generally fastened on the indolence and unprogressive spirit of the farmers whose methods of cul ture and curing have been shown to be anti quated and ineffective neither the government nor the wholesalers can be absolved from all responsibility the agents and brokers are too eager to buy up the crops indiscriminately without respect to quality colour or variety and the planters have no incentive to cultivate superior gradesproperly constructed curing sheds are rare money is scarce and dear in the valley and the small planters are fre quently unable to obtain material to build adequate sheds the planter is in a state of chronic indebtedness usually to chinese creditors vho make about  per cent profit the grower is also dependent upon some halfadozen manufacturing exporters until some wellorganized cooperative system is devised among the growers therefore little general improvement in the quality of cagayan leaf may be looked forin  the philippine legislature passed an act which invested the government with some control over the export of manila cigars to the united states under this law philip pine cigars must be prepared from selected cagayan tobacco properly cured and seasoned well made from suitable spiral wrapper and long filler from which all stems scrap and dust must have been removed this law howevera manila cigar factorythough the peasant farmers of the philippines are criticized for their obsolete methods the manufacture of cigars and cigarettes inmanila is carried out on modem linesdoes not apply to cigars or cigarettes exported to great britain or other foreign countries the normal annual production of philippine tobacco now amounts to between  and  kilogranis about twothirds of this is exported as unmilanufactured leaf nearly all of it going to spain france and central europethe manufacture of cigars and cigarettes is carried on in manila under modern condi tions with a high level of efficiency some  cigars are now exported annually nearly all to the united states the tobacco leaves are unbaled and sorted into grades according to quality and length  filler  variety is kept separate from  wrapper  variety that intended for fillers is kept in the bodegas for a considerable time but the wrapper leaves are used as soon as possible before the tobacco thus prepared is coii verted into cigars it is placed in revolving beaters at a temperature of deg c in order to dry it and destroy any eggs of the cigar beetle this method is not however abso lutely effective in excluding the beetlenotwithstanding all that has been said the cagayan valley leaf continues to afford good material for popular low or moderate priced cigars though far inferior to what it might be and what it ought to be philippine tobacco still seeps its place as one ol the principal pro duts of the archipelago but any merit that attaches to it is due to the extraoidiinary suitability of the soil andiiot to the industrfy enterprise or care of its producfs imiierovc ment in the qualityofthe iaf would involhe radical changes in methiotds of selection culti vation curing and delivery by the planter through the brokers or middlemen to the manufactuiring exporters
