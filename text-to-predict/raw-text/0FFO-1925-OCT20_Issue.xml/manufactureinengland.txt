wlhon they open a now tin or packet of tobaccoif one may judge by their appearance the workilg staff thrive in this atmo sphere of purity tobacco making is essen tially a cleanly trade there is a complete absence of dirt the men and women who handle tho tobacco and tend the machines are neat and clean and as healthy and cheerful as any orkpeople in the kingdom there must be thousands of them but many of them appeared to be personally kinown to the member of the firm a greatgrandson of the founder who conduicted me through the various departments and the friendly words which he exchaniged with them as we passed from room to room gave added pleasine to the visit notihnog but tobaccoof the products of the factory itself if i were asked to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth i could in truth reply  it is tobacco wholly tobacco and nothing but tobacco the tobacco w hich i saw in leaf in the great hogs heads or  tierces  as thev are technically called in the store rooms i saw again in the form of loose smoking mixtures of various blend flake or twist or  plug or con verted into cigarettes or cigars there are of course various grades of tobacco but it is all tobacco and it is all goodnicotiana is a sensitive plant and its qualities vary with the atmosphere and the soil in whiel it grows but long experience is necessary to distinguish the difference betfeon the crops and even in the leaves of a single plant herein lies the art of blend ing upon which depends the imaintenance of the standard quality of any particular smoking mixture for the maintenance of that standarcd however no extraneous matter is addeclif for no other reason than that the factory is open at all times to excise officers whose duty it is to prevent adultera tion there are however other reasons whv adulteration would be unprofitable and the ehief of them is the injury it would do in these days of keen competition to the reputation of the manufacturer who resorted to it this avesteountry factory it must be remembered is but the model of many others where tobacco is manufactured under like conditions and by similar processesbusiness methodsthe romance of the tobacco industry comes to an end at the port of entry its place is take n bv factorv organization and strict business methods the excise officer in the bonded warehouse is certainly a very matteroffact person with little of romance in his naturein businesshours it is he who supervises the wveighing of the great hogsheads and caleulates the duty on the tobacco contained in them the casks remain in the bonded warehouse for two or three years here the tobacco matures and dries moreover so long as it remains in bond it is free of duty and the manufacturer has it readv to his hand without the heavy investment of capital which the pay ment of the duty of s d per lb would invole in the bonded warehouse to wlhieh i was taken  tierces each of a gross weight of b stood one on the other in wellordered ranks it was an impressive spectacle there seemed here to be enouglh tobacco to supply the nation for a twelvemonth there are however many other bonded warehouses full of tobacco and this was bv no means a large one these  casks contained tobacco mainly of the  crop each of them was labelled withimportance of blendingafter the stripping comes the blending most of the fine cut tobaccos such as shag returns and the hke are blended in leaf but some of the better known smoking mix tures are blended after the leaves have passed through the cutting machines the blending process is a jealously guarded trade secret not to be told in gath even firms associated in a joint enterprise havetheir special pro cesses of blending with a common interest in every other aspect of the tobacco trade they are still rivals in blending and success ful blending depends upon sound knowledge acquired by long experience mv v nicotine is a maid of uncertain mood one years crop whether it comes from virginia carolina kentucky or elsewhere seldom resembles the crop of the preceding year it is the care of the expert to mix the leaves in a manner that will redress the balance and preserve uniformity in the various brands blending seems indeed to be the essence of the matterwhen the leaves are blended they are man handled as little as may be they are piled up in heaps on the tiled floor with pitchforks whose prongs are of brightest steel they are pitchforked into a long trough at the bottom of whieh a broad traveuing band carries them to the various departments to be transformed into particular kinds of tobacco for smoking whether it be fine or coarse cut or flake twist or plug cigarettes or cigars on the way to the cutting machines they are subjected to a mechanicl process of steamingthe leaves are placed by band into a funnel at the back of the cutting machineinto which they are drawn and automatically compresdc and brought tmder thb shap gilotinelike knife whieh shreds them at an astonishing speed the rate per minute at which the knife rises and fals varies only according to whether fine or coarse cut tobacco is re quired the shredded tobacco falls from the knife into a trough and is carried by a traveuing band to the next department on the way it passes through a cylinder which removes every particle of dust or sand thon it falls into another trough with a travelling band as its base and it is picked over by women who remove from it as it passes any stray pieces of stem or splintersof wood from the tierce paper orother foreign dubstance which it may still contain the tobacco which is now t a high tempera ture is received into largo square tubs of wood or metal on trolleys and wheeled into the coohig room where covered with water proof sheeting to preserve the meisture and exclude dust it remains for several days in this room also are placed the special smoking mixtures after the shredded tobaccos have been blended and passed through alixing machine in this wonderful coohng room a tub full of any kind of tobaceo can be produced on demand to be allowed to plunge ones hands deep in a tub of finecut tobacco light as air and as soft as silk or to handle ones favournte mixture in bulk sad seemingly drink in its sweet aroma is a delight to the smoker it is from the cooling room that the cut tobacca is wheeled in the tubs to the machine

navy cut or cut cavendish whether it is fuu flavoured medu or mild depends upon the blending the maklng of  twist or roll tobacco is womens work the leaves are piled upon a table at each side of which a woman sts while one selects the large portions of the leaves and spreads them on the table the other fills thenm with broken leaf rolls them up and passes them through a twisting machine the process resembles in some respects that of cigrmaking but needs less skill the  twist  is made in an end less rope of varying thicknesses according to the required size of the roll from the tvisting machme it is passed over a bobbin with a double action ly a lateral rotation of the bobbi an additional tist is given to the rope of tobacco wich is simul ta�eously formed into a neat rol the rolls bounded in stoat rope to prevent their bursting are then placed in hydraulic steam presses from which they emerge reduced by half in heigrht when they are put into thepresses they are a rich brown mn colour but the heat has its effect upon the juices which are spread by the prere uniformly over the crushed leaves d the rolls leave the presses alost coal black plug is made in similar fashion the only differenee being that it is pressed in the form of bars instead of rol twist and plug are the tobaccos beloved of seafaring men a chunk is bitten of for chewing or cut up with a jack knife and rolled in the palm of the hand to fil a pipepacket tobaccosthe loose tobawco is ultimately taken to the packing departmnt where it is made up into one or two ouncepackets by machines fed by women the precision with which the complicated machinery of a tobacco factory works must be one of the wonders of the world and the deftess with which trained fingers feed it is beyond all praise on one side of a machine a wvoman sits and weighs the tobacco in scales worked by the foot each ounee as it is weighed is placedthe year the vhriety of tobacco and the weightit was ehlefly american tobaccol bright and dark virginian and dark american western from tennessee or kentucky but there were also casks of the now rare turkish tobacco of latakia the only tobacco plant which is allowed to flower of havana sumatra and north borneo tobaccos for cigar making and of empiregrown tobacco samples of about b may be taken from the casks and admitted to the factory tomporarily free of duty but they are weighed and labelled for identification and whon the easks from which they came are brought into use the duty must be paid on the samples as well as on the contents of the casks one of the samples was of tobacco grown in nvasaland the leaves were large and rich in colour and to me indistin guishable in appearance from the best virginianstripping the lfafwhen the tobacco is released from bond the casks are rblled past the wide sliding doors into the store room here the casks are opened revealing compact masses of tobacco leaf each weighing b orb most of the tobacco is now dry and brittle and cannot be handled without damage to the leaves but some of tbe  laerer leaves still retain a certain amnount of moisturez and can be spread out for inspection when the tobacco leaves have been sufficiently moistened to admit of their being handled they are conveyed to an adjoiing department where the central stem is stripped from them this ishand work performed by women manyears ago thestem was taken out of the leaf before transhimnt to lessen the amount of the import duty it  was imr austen chamberlain when chanellor of the ex ehequer who first introbuced a differential rate of duty between whole leaf and stripped leaf the difference was originay d pr lbin the cutting departmentcutting machines at work in a british factoryto the right is a pile of blended leaves ready for the machinesbut was subsequently reduced to a half penny a pound but even at that low figufe it provides a large amount of employment in this country without any addition to the cost of tobacco the stems are collected in baskets and handed over to governmeit officials there is a sale for a quantity of these stems abroad but the majority of them are destroyed a certain proportion of leaves retaining the central stem ate allowed to go through the cutting machines thus shredded they are couveited into birds eye which was more popular a geieration ago than it is todayt it is the crosssections of the stem from which this brand of tobacco derives its namein one of a series of trays perpetually in eijon an endless travelling band like the buckets of adredger and is tipped into a receptacle whieh presses it to the required shape on the other side of the machine girls place the outer and inner wrappers on another travelling band and they pass under a shute at the exact moment when the ounce of tobacco is falling from it the vrappers with the tobacco resting on them in the required position are carred on to another device which folds the wrappers over the contents then on to another contrivance which folds the ends and so to another which tucks in the ends the completed paekets are gathered up by a wheel fith a receptaxce for each and thrown to another travelling band which deposits them in basets these baskets are then removed and the packets of tobacco are placed by hand in boxes ready for dispatch some of the speoial tobaccos wrapped in the best lead foil are still made into packets by handcigarettemakingonly the finer sorts of tobaeeo whether shredded or straight cut are sent to the cigarette rooms there is no more bewilder ing sight in a tobacco factory than that of a cigatettemaking machine at work and none more difficult to describe with the pen the cigarette paper is in the form of a large roll of tape similar to that of a tape machine in a telegraph offiee it is mechanically unwound and carried along a travelling band in a narrow trough at the side of the maehine on its way a small printig press imprints the name of the brand on each cigarette length then it passes under the narrow end of a funnel which distributes the tobacco in equd quantities upon it then the paper passes an instrument by which orie of the edges is gummed and a moment later the paper is automatically folded over the tobacco thus is formed an endless cigarette until it passes under a knife which cuts it into sections of the regu lation length  each machine produces an apparently ceaseless stream of hundreds of cigarettes a minutethe packing machines are no less ingenious the popular brands are made up in packets of tens and s the principal operative part of the machine is a revolving disc or tray on which four actions ame performed simultaneously the cigarettes fed into the machine first fall on to a travelling band in fives and an instant later five other cigarettes are superimposed on them the ten cigarettes are carried on the band to the disc where the shaped carton of the inner case receives them the disc turns and stops for an instant in front of another device a small steel arm plucks a cigarette card from a reservoir and lays it on the cigarettes and a second arm holds the card in place while the first releases its grip there is something about the almost human action of this part of the machine that strikes the observer as really uncanny round goes the dise again simultaneously one of the outer coves which are already gummed together but folded filat falls from a reeeptacle into its allotted place and opens out and with another movement of the disc the inner case containing the ten cigarettes and the card is pushed into it thus is the operation completed the packs are tien taken away to be packed in cardboard boxesanother remarkable invention packs the wellknown and popular cigarettes which are sold inpackets of five while one part of the mahine forms the printed papers into which it is fed into cases and places them open under a shute another part carries the eigarettes into the shute and drops them in series of fives into the cases the filled casee are then carried by a travelling band in piles of five to a small platform and are auto matically pushed in two piles of five packets under the band of a woman waiting to receive themit must not be assumed that cigarette making by hand is a lost art on the contrary one vast room was full of women sitting at desks whose skilful fingers were busily emploved in making cigarettes and clipping the ends with specially shaped scissors but the rate of production was scarcely more than three or four a minutecigarmakingcigarmaking by hand is specialized work requiring a high degree of skill and experience in the craftsman or rather the craftswoman for women are more adept at it than men a cigar consists of two parts known in the trade as the wapper  and the  filer  respec tively for the wrapper the leaf of a sumatra or north borneo plant is selected and is cut into the required shape on a board then the operator benches together a quan tity of loose bits from a pile of materal in which hav braiian american seed leaf sumatra north borneo iamaiea and java tobaccos are blended this she rolls on the board with the palm of her hand thus forming the  filer a leaf is rolled round the  filler  and pasted up at the pointed end the filler and inr covering is then wrapped in the specialy selected leaf orwymr andthe cigatthus formed after being rold under the palm to produce an even exteior is pasted up and cut off to the required length the completed cigar may be light or dark brown or oive in colour accord ing to the shade of the outer leaf selected bat contrary to a widespread befief this difference in colour is no indication of the strength or mildness of a cigar the proof of th cigarisinthesmoking these british cigars are made with the same material and by the same methods as havana cigars but the law prescribes that they may not be labelled  havana for no other reason apparently thanthat they are made by british haudsonbritishsoilthe tour of this great factory hurried though it necessarilv was occupied the greater part of a dai that night as i loaded my pipe i contemplated the tobacco with enlightened interest and an instruieted
