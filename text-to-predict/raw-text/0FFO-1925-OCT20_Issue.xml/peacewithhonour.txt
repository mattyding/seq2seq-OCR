 peace withhonourmr amery on the pactof locarnoaddressing his constituents at birmingham last night mr aiy said the task of helping europe on to sound and sure ground had he believed been finally achieved in the last few days by mr austen chamberlin the pact of locarno the signifficance of which l as been realized throughout the world marked the establishment of a real peace by mutual agreement and on equal terms  in that peace he added  there is no question or victor or varnquished of terms imposed or terms reluctantly submitted to it is a peace by mutual agreement between equal nations resolved to create a better future for elropeit was now  years since disraeli came back from the congress of berlin with the proud boast that he brought back  peace with honour mr chamberlain could well afford to say today that he had brought back peace with honour all round no ones honour had been wounded by the terms of this peace and all who had taken part in it had done themselves honour and had done honour to europe by coming to such an agreement which they believed would mark a new turning point in the future of those regions of europe which were so near to us that we were bound to be interested in their welfare it was true that the pact com mitted us in certain contingencies to interfering again in the affairs of europe but the pact itself had removed the very risk of those contingencies which pact or no pact might so easily have committed us at any moment in the future we had created a state of affairs in which the risk of our having to take part again in the troubles of europe was far more remote than it was a few weeks ago the whole of this great scheme of peace was based on the assumption that the obliga tion to settle differences by peaceful means and by arbitration was one which all the parties to the pact meant loyally to observe and loyally to insist upon if anyone suggested that that was mere  eyewash that when an actual difliculty arose some actual dispute this machinery of arbitration and peaceful settle ment was to sink into the background and that the difference was once more to be settled by war or by the threat of war then indeed the treaty just agreed to would be not a safeguard but a danger to the peace of europe because it would only be a treaty deluding the peaceful and encourag ing those who wished to break the peace it was essential for the peace of the future that the whole public opinion of a peace loving world should stand behind any agree ment to settle matters by arbitration and see to it that that agreement was enforced
