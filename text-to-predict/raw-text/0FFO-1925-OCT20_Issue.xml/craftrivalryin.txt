craft rivalry inshipyards how production ishamperedby our laour correspodetthe interim report of the joint com mittee of inquiry into the shipbuilding industry has aroused a remarkable amount of interest and the demand for copies has exceeded the supply in the bands of the joint secretaries the uxions have accepted responsibility for making the report available to their members one of the most striking things in the report was the assurance of the employers that although rates of wages in this country are much higher than on the continent and the length of the working week is only  hours as compared with  hours im germany and holland yet it is not necessarytoreduce wages or increase working hours in order to meet foreign competition if the unions will allow of readjustments in handling work and relax their rules of demarcationthe kind of problem which arises from a rigid demarcation of the work to be done by the members of particular unions can be illustrated more easily than described the employers and the unions understand what is meant by  interchangeability  and  de marcation but only people with knowledge of industrial work involving many operations can appreciate the complications due to the subdivision of labour between craftsmen and to the strict rule which prevents an unskilled man using a skilled mans toolh lt has hap pened for example that joiners have refused to allow labourers to measure with a foot rulewhat may be regarded as an outstanding instance of craft rivalry occurred not long ago on the northeast coast the manager of a shipbuilding firm which had generously shown its interest in the local hospital wanted two large notice boards on vhich to display an appeal for funds it was not shipyard work at all and the notice boards were to be pre sented to the hospital a number of ship wrights weere about to be discharged owing to slackness of work but the joiners were fuuy employed the nlanager therefore asked the shipwrights to make the notice boaras the joiners immediately went on strike claiming that shipwrights were doing their job and they remained on strike for several weeks although the work was taken out of the shipwrights handsanother  trespass  by shipwrights on joiners work caused an eight weeks stoppage at another northeast coast port a vessel was about to leave the repairing yard when it was noticed that a gangway required a new tread the job was a small one and would have been finished in half a day a ship wright was asked to do it the joiners were au employed but they went on strike as a pro test and a general conference of national re presentatives of the em plovers and the mens organizations had to be hela before the dispute could be settledsome of the cases would be simply ludicrous if the consequences were not serious a flanged pipe on a steamers deck got broken one of the crewa b put a rough vooden protection round it rt there was a con frence to decide whose job it was to remove the temporary protection a fitter could mend the pipe but he could not remove the wooden booards though a kick would have knocked them all away was a carpenter or a joiner to be called in p when that had been settled there had to be a second conference to decide whether the repair of the pipe was a plumbers or a fitters worka patent screw top com plicated the matter so much the result in casb was that is gd worth of work costsiboth joiners and shipwrights plane decks but in some districts the planing of passengrdecks is work restricted to joiners while the planing of all other wooden decks is done by shipwrights the character of this work is the same whoever does it and there is nothing to choose in competency between the saip wrights and the joiners recently the joiners society whih could not supply men to complete the work to time on a particular passenger ship refused to allow shipwrights to do it as a consequence the work had to be finished while the ship was taking in stores and overtime rates had to be paid mean while shipwrights were out of work to show that the shipwrights can sometimes retaliate on the joinersbut all to the detriment of shipbuildinga case may be mentioned in which joiners were putting in a hal landing in a passenger staircase the shipwrights protested that it was their prescriptive right because the platform rested on steel beams and therefore it was technically a deck their strike lasted ten days  men were affected and  manhours of woth were lost
