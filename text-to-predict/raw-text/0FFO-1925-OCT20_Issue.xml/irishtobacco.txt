irish tobaccorevival of an oldindusthyvaluable rotationcropfrom ovr dublin correspondentsir walter ralegh planted tobacco in county cork about the year  and ireland is thought to be the first european country in which it was acclimatized after the declara tion of american independence and during the napoleonic wars tobaccogrowing in ireland flourished on a large scale and even promised to become a staple portion of irish agriculture in  however it was prohibited and ceased towards the end of the th century an effort was made to recover and develop the art of tobaccogrowing and the experiment is now at the critical stage of its fortunesthe pioneer of therevival is sir nugentverardat whose estateat randlestown in cointy meath the only iris h indlii  station is at work ln the chancellor of the

equipped and the best methods of cultiva tion and preparation have been devised tobaccogrowing however never will spread in ireland unless a large and wellcapitalized effort is made to develop it the difficultieswhich prevent expansion fall under five heads first there is the inertia of the state grow ing and preparing are hampered by excise regulations which could not exist in a country which grows tobacco seriously and hitherto neither the british nor the free state govern ment has attached sufficient importance to the enterprise to relieve it secondly there is the individual farmers lack of initiative he has not seen like his cousin in america the pro cesses of tobacco cultivation and he must go through the disappointments of the learner for several years before he can become sufficiently expert to grow and cure profitably thirdly there is the expense of erecting a curing shed on the land of every grower fourthly there is the problem of forming  rehandling stations either this must be done by coopera tive groups of growers or by manufacturers vhom the growers merely feed in either ease large speculative outlay is involved finally these is the difficulty of seeuring a sure and constant market in face of these considera tions it may be said that tobaccocultivation in ireland is likely to succeed only if it is taken up on a large scale like the sugarbeet industry which is to be undertaken by a wealthy continental iirm supported by a gov ernment subsidythe annual consumption of tobacco in ire land between pipe tobacco and cigarettesfor the consumption of cigars is negligibleis b in the free state there are  registered tobacco factories of which  are concerns of considerable standing as soon as the free state established its customs barrier the importation of cigarettes and tobacco manufactured in northem ireland and britain fell off and three factories were established in un by british firms these three fac tories now supply the great bulk of the free state market they give employment to about  workersexport tradeat least one of the free state fac tories which existed before the arrival of the english companies does a considerable export trade having popularized certain brands of irishmanufactured though not irishgrown pipe tobacco and cigarettes in belfast there is a factory which formerly manufactured nine tenths of the tobacco codsumed in all ireland this firm has an immcnse export trade and its growing output for the british market com pensates for what it has lost in southern ire landthe tobacco grown in ireland apart from the small quantities sold under irish brands by the irish tobacco company has been bought chiefly by irish manufacturing firms and has been used in blending with imported tobacco quite recently however
