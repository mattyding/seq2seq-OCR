tiee hospitals androad accidentsincreasing burden onfinancesinquiries show that the question of motoring and road accidenturaised in the appeal of theampstead general and  northwest london hospital which was published in the times yesterday is a source of anxiety in many slimilar institutions it was stated in the appeal that a large number of such acidents have been treated during the last few months and a heavy extra burden has been thrown on the institution in that waythe subject has received the attention of the british hospitals association who in their last annual report stated that hospitab were dealing with many rmore motoring acci dents than formerly and that there was no legal or other maachinery in compezsiation cases to enable hospitals to reap any financial benefit from the services rendered to injured people it wfeg added  to introduce any certain meaxpsy vwhich hospitals can first be allowred n proportion of the compensation awarded and then secured in the certainty of its paymanent involves legislationmwr e w morris house governor of the london hospital said the number of emer gency cases arising from accidents caused by motor vehicular traffic created a serious problem in that institution the best treat ment was provided the expense of which was considerable and the hospital could not legally claim any sum for services that it had rendered in a case where the injured person was entitled to compensationthere are insurance companies among our subscribers be added  and there have been instances where motorists and other persons who have been injured have made contribu tions to our funds for these we are thankful but the amount that we receive in that way is infinitesimal when compared with the expense to the hospital in the treatment of such cases there was an accident in which the person injured received treatment for a year but when we learnt the sum awarded for compensation we felt that we could not take any part of it from him we do think that the services rendered by a hospital should be considered in compensation claims the hospital is of course always open to receive such cases and their number is large in the east end of london and the result is that beds are occupied which would be given to patients that are waiting to be received into the institution there are  waiting cases on our iist today a consideration of the expenses incurred in the treatment of persons injured in street accidents for which com pensation is awarded would probably mean an addition to revenue that would enable the hospital to provide increased accommodation to meet the demands of waiting casesit was stated at the office of a motorcar insurance company that while hospitals could not legally make a claim there were occasions when insurance companies did make contri butions for their services to injured persons
