eiareian opationheredity in mentaldiseases heredity in relation to mental disease  vas the subject of the harveian oration dehvered by eir frederick mott at the royal college of physiciaas yesterday afternoon sis bumpnr rtollrssron president was in the chairsm fmasemmrcx morr said that hereditary factors entered into the process of repro duction from the moment of conception one half of the nuclear material being derived from each parent thus in a wonderful manner species sex race and familial ancestry vwere in the main developed by an exact and proportionate division of the cells galtons reseakch upon the characters of identical and dissimilar twins showed that while the former remained similar in disposition although hving apart the latter aithough living together preserved temperaments of a distinct and diftereat character this was attributed to the fact that identical twins were developed embryologicaiy from a single ovum and that dissimilar twins were derived from separate ova the discovery emphasized the importance of heredity and the truth that the temper and raw material of charaeter were inheritable an inquiry which the lecturer said he had instituted further corroborated the theory that  like tends to beget like under his direction miss agnes keuey investigated by means of pedigrees the conditions and histories of tlfree groupsof personsviz the insane the men tally dfec tive and the normal sixty cases were taken in each groupthe frst composed of adult patients in the london county council asylums the second of highgrade mental defectives and the third of normal children from the elementary schools the results showed that insanity repeated itself more frequently in the pedigrees of insane personas than in those of mentally defective personsnamely in the proportion of  per cent of the former to  per cent of the latter in the mentauy defective group  per cent of the fathers were casuai unskilled workers and the standard of living was low while in the normal group a decided improvement in industrial conditions and the care of the home wss maintained although the founda tions of moral and intellectual characters were inborn the influence of education example and environment generaly was much more potent for good or evil than in the case of physical charactersby this general outline of recent researches the lecturer led up to his own investigations upon the subject of heredity in relation to mental disease he said that with the aid of his coworkers he had studied a large number of carefuily constructed pedigrees extending to four or five generations and statistics based on a cardsystem extending to  related individuals who had been or were at the time domiciled in one of the ten london county asylums as a result of his studies he had come to the conclusion that there was a signal tendency to antedating in the following types of insanitydementia nrcoxm manic depressive insanity and involutional melancholia by antedating w as meant that the descendants of those suffering from manic depressive insanity or involutional melancholia were liable to suffer from an insanity of adolescence usually dementia precox pedigrees showed that two three or even four members of the samne cofraternity at about the same age suffered from mental disease which was a more striking proof of hereditary transmission than when a mental disease was transmitted in successive genera tions this tendency of antedating in mental disease was one of natures methods of ending or mending a degenerate stock the ending of a degenerate stock was accomplished by a threefold process in the insanity of adolescence i segregation of the mdi vidual  atrophy of the generative organs  a lessened vital resistance to disease particularly to tuberculosis to which  per cent of the sufferers succumbby comparison of an acquired mental diseasenamely general paralysis of the insanewith dementia praecox the lecturer said he found by means of systematic research that in the latter there was a vital defect of the reproductive organs and of the brain in particular in general paralysis of the infane chance was every thing heredity nothing while in dementia preacox it seemed that heredity was the most important factor the former disease was due to an invasion of the brain by the spirochleta pallida and the latter to a lack of the vis propria of the fertilized ovum a point which the lecturer said was interesting to the public was that the germ cells of every person who was certifled as insane and sent to a mental hospital were not necessaxily possible potential transmitters of a mental disease loreover congenital diseabe was often confused with hereditary disease idiots and imbeciles occur in all grades of society and the lecturer gave anatomical explanations why  per cent of the cases of idiocy and imbecility were due to causes other than hereditythe baly ifedal for distinguished work in physiologychiefly during the
