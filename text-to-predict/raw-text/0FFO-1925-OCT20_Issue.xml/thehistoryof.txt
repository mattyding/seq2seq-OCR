the history oftobacconew worlds giftto the oldearly religiousceremoniesby t a joyce british museumhistory has shown that tobacco needs no defence but if it did it might well claim a religious sanction for when the fleet of columbus made the first landfall in the antilles its principal use among the popula tion of the wvest indies was in connexion with religious ceremonies here the powder of the dried leaf or the smoke produced by its burn ing was inhaled by the chief or priest through a tube shaped like a y one branch being inserted into each nostril this eventually induced a state of coma during which visions were experienced these visions were after wards communicated to the tribe and accepted as divine revelationsbut tobacco was employed for secular enjoy ment also the leaf was carefully dried wrapped in a maizeleaf and smoked as a kind of cigar or chewed nevertheless its primary use was ceremonial or religious the native word for tobacco was cogioba or cohiba and the phrase  make cogioba  meant equally  to inhale tobacco  or  to pray the tube through which the fumes or powder were in haled was called  tabaco and this name was transferred by the european discoverers fronm the utensil to the plantthe pipe of peacein central america too the earliest explorers found tobacco smoked in the cigarforn snuffed and chewed and wheni the incred ible expedition of cortez reached the valley of mexico bernal diaz that hardy soldier and invaluable chronicler writes of montecuzoma  there were also placed on his table thrce tubes much painted and gilded wvhich held liquidambar mixed with certain herbs which they call tabaco and when he had finished eating after they had danced beforc him and sung and the table was removed he inhaled the smoke from one of those tubes  but he took very little of it and with that he fell asleep but the smoking of tobacco had not the same ceremonial importance in mexico as it had in the antilles because the same author speaks of  reeds scented with liquidambar and full of tobacco  on sale in the great marketplace of tlaltelolcothe habit of tobaccosmoking in the cigar form extended also to the tribes of the amazon forest but the supreme consolation of the pipe was also an american invention though its distribution was limited its bestknown form is the celebrated  peacepipe  of the indians of the eastern plains of the northern conti nentthe socalled red indians of which the obvious prototypes are the stone pipes ex cavated from the prehistoric mounds of the mississippi valley from this area the pipe seems to have extended southward to the tarascan region of mexico but not to have penetrated into the mexican valley before the conquest in the southern continent pipes seem to have been used only in paraguay and southern brazil and were therefore possibly an independent invention it is peculiar that the use of tobacco does not appear to have penetrated the sphere of the peruvian empire but it must be remembered that in this region the constant need of human nerves for a sooth ing and stimulating drug was amply fulfilled by the cocaleafralegh and nicotthe importance of tobacco in the ceremonial and medicine of the west indian native seems to have led the first european investigators of its qualities to regard it rather as a drug than as a pleasurable solace oviedo the governor of santo domingo sent samples of the plant to spain in  next year jean nicot french ambassador at lisbon obtained specimens sent from florida and passed them on to queen catherine de medici winning immortality for his name in so far as the herb is known today in botanical science as nicotiana tabacum the first serious treatise on the properties of tobacco is to be found in the works of nicolas monardes who between  and  produced a work in three parts dealing especially with the additions which the discovery of the new world had made to european pharmacy  las cosas que se traen de nuestras indias occidentales  this work was translated into english in  by john frampton who added a good deal to the section on tobacco on his own account monardes had experimented in the use of tobaccojuice and had employed it as a mild opiate with constant success and for that reason he describes it as an herb of great estimation for the great virtues that it hath it was ralph lane in  who brought pre pared tobacco with apparatus for smoking to england from virginia and taught its use to ralegh raleghs devotion to the smoking habit carried to the foot of the scaffold set the final fashion for the just use of tobacco in englanddrinking smokea remarkable feature of the history of tobacco is the extraordinary rapidity with which the smoking habit spread over the old world after the discovery of america whether any form of smoking was practised by any people of asia before this date has never been proved or disproved it is true that certain siberian tribes smoke dried moss in pipes but this may be an imitation of chinese practices and it is quite certain that the smoking of opium is a relatively modern hiabit in china so on the negative evidencealone it is fair to infer that the habit of in haling smoke originated in americaasia received the use of tobacco with open arms and the habit spread to new guinea and torres straits here the local  pipe  is a length of bamboo some two to three inches in diameter closed by a natural  node at either end there are two lateral holes in one of which is inserted a short cane which holds the cigar by means of suction applied to the other hole the bamboo reservoir is filled with smoke and is then passed round the circle for smoking is a social habit for successive inhalationbut continental asia produced an innova tion the waterpipe such pipes extend frcni the levant through india to china in further india the use of the water pipe strange as it may seem is brought into connexion with the employment of tobacco as snuff because amongst certain tribes the tobaccoimpregnated water from the pipes smoked by the women is inhaled by the men through the nosein africa too the native tribes took kindly to tobacco and the smoking and snuffing habit spread rapidly throughout the continent far in advance of the explorations of the european and asiatic introduccrs even the asiatic waterpipe accompanied too often by the fatal practice of hempsmoking has penetrated deep into the interior from the east coast like the american the african prefers to inhale his smoke deeply and the words used almost universally in africa for smoking mean literally to drink tobaccojoyfull newesi have a suspicion that when john frampton brought out his translation of monardes it was his interest in the section on tobacco wlhiclh he supplemented to a considerable degree that led him to alter the title of the work because  las cosas quo se traen de nuestras indias occidentales  became  joy full newes out of the newfound worldyet from the very beginning the  tobacco habit has had many foes against which to contend even the scientificallyminded monardes seemed to suspect something dia bolical in the visions to which the excessive use of the herb gave rise
