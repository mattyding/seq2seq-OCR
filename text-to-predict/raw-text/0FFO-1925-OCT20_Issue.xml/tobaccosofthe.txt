tobaccos of theworld sources of supplydistinguishingqualities by h c archer late chairmancouncil of tobacco manufacturers of great britain and ireland the tobacco plant is today cultivated for commercial purposes in nearly every civilized country in the world but the product of each locality varies to such an extent as regards size colour and flavour that in many in stances it is hardly recognizable as belonging to the same species the size of the leaf ranges from the large and handsome product of kentucky to the diminutive and insigrnificantlooking leaves of dubeeturkey and latakia  while the colour quality and flavour are equally as distinctive according to where it is grown these differences and peculiari ties are determined by the geographical posi tion of the country climate soil and other natural conditions but it may be laid down as a rule that while tobacco of a kind can be grown almost anywhere really fineflavoured and aromatic leaf suitable for making the best and choicest cigars can only be produced in countries situated within the tropicsamerican varietiesthe united states of america gives us by far the richest quality and the most satisfactory leaf in the world for the mantfacture of pipe  tobaccos and lightcoloured mild cigarettes it is cultivated in many of the states the most important being kentucky virginia and north and south carolina it is in great demand in nearly every country very large quantities being annually exported to various parts of the globe in great britain alone something like  per cent of the tobacco con sumed is imported from the united states thus leaving about  per cent to represent the receipts from all other countries com bined kentucky or western leaf is of a dark rich colour full of quality and flavour and of handsome size and appearance it is chiefly used in the manufacture of full flavoured smoking tobacco and roll for which purposes it is unrivalled virginia  the naturalhome of tobacco als produces in some distriets a very rieh ansd filreflavoured dark leaf much piized fqo making the best and most expensive grades of heavy pipe and pressed tobaccos but the larger proportion of the leaf grown in this favoured state consists of a much milder and lightercoloured type than that of kentucky the colours rang ing from dark red to orange and in some in stances a bright yellow virginia has always been considered the finest smoking tobacco for quality and flavour that the world pro duces by far the largest proportion of the enormous number of cigarettes now consumed in this country are knowni as virginia cigarettes but the leaf from which they are made comes almost exclusively from the neighbouring states of north and south carolina towards the end of last century experiments were made in growiing tobacco on the lighter and more sandy soil of those states and the results were so successful that this leaf also known as new belt which is of a brilliant golden colour has quite superseded the richer and fullerflavoured virginia pro duct for the manufacture of mild and sweet flavoured cigarettes  and it is recognized today as being unquestionably the best and most satisfactory material grown for this purpose the imports of carolina leaf into great britain now far exceed those of any other growth and they are steadily increasing year by yearrhodesia and nyasalaindthe nearest approach to virginia sand carolina tobacco is produced in the british empire in rhodesia and nyasaland a large proportion of the leaf raised in the former being of excellent colour and quality and in appearance quite equal in many instances t the finest yellow carolina the flavour how ever is not so delicate or choice and is different in character from that of the american product nyasaland tobacco is more after the style of old belt virginia leaf which it much resembles in appearance t has plenty of quality but the flavour is some what pronounced and rather pungent and although it is extremely useful for blending purposes it can hardly be considered satisfac tory or pleasant when smoked alone al though tobacco has been cultivated for some time in both rhodesia and nyasaland it is only during the last few years that the fermentation and curing of the leaf have been properly and thoroughly carried out the packing sorting and grading all important items now much improved were in the early days most unsatisfactory and therefore pre judicial to the use of these growths inthis country the pieference in the rate of duty now granted to empiregrown products has materially increased the imports from these colonies into the united kingdom  and the recent further addition in the amount of this preference which was raised from onesixth to onequarter of the duty last april should still further encourage the consumption in this country a good deal more of these british african tobaccos would be used by manufac turers here if they were forthcoming at the present time however the supply is not equal to the demand  but it is hoped that eventually the more favourable terms of duty under which they are now admitted will have the effect of considerably increasing and stimu lating the productioncanadaanother of our dominions that has bene fited from the empire preference is canada and fair quantities of tobacco from that country are now being imported in conse quence a very good substitute for the wvell known owensboro burley leaf is grown in canada and although not as a rule equal in colour and quality has proved to bh asatis factory and useful material for blending with the american variety attempts have been and are still being made in canada to pro duce tobacco after the style of the carolina cigarette leaf but so far not with great success dark and heavy grades however very siiriilar in appearance to kentucky and western leaf are now regularly coming forward and are gradually displacing the old substitutes such as java and japan as well as to some extent the commoner and lowerpriced grades of american tobacco in this market asunder the more favourable duty conditions in force they allow the british manufacturer a considerable saving in costtobacco is also grown on a somewhatexten sive scale in madras and burma but chiefly for local consumption the leaf is mean small and very narrow with a thick midrib or stalk the flavour is unpleasantly pungent and acrid and decidedly unpalatable up to a few years ago owing to its unsuitability none of this indiangrown leaf was imported into this country a certain quantity how ever is now coming in under the new preferen tial duty regulations but it is only possible to use it in small proportions in the cheapest and commonest grades of pipe tobaccoturkish and latakiaturkish cigarette leaf so highly prized by connoisseurs and experts for its delicate and distinctive flavour is grown in what foriiierly were the southern provinces of turkey in europe but which owing to political changes now form part of greece and bulgaria the tobacco howvever produced in these districts still retains its original name of turkish soineof the choicestvarieties such as yacca xanthi c realize extremely high prices on the market and are mruch sought after a somewhat similar leaf of the same distinctive flavour but much poorer and commoner in quality is extensively cultivated on theborders of the black sea in both southern russia and the northern parts of asia minor and is largely exported to central enrope where these eastern gtowths are mnch in favourlatakia tobacco socalled after the seaport of that name in the north of syria opposite the island of cyprus is grown on the hills behinid that towvn the leaves are extremely sniall no larger in fact than those of the tea plant tbe strong and rather tarry flavour cllaraeteristic of this growth and its black and sooty appearance are produced artificially by what is termed firingie allowing thie leaf to absorb and become saturated with the fumes and smoke of greenwood fires the crop is niot a large one and is nearly all exported to england where it is used for blending with virginia turkish and other choice gronths in the maniufacture of highclass snioking aixturescigar leafthe most valuable and finest flavoured cigar leaf in the world is raised in a district in the islanld of cuba situated some distance to the west of the city of havana known as the  vuelta abajo or lower valley this favoured spot produces a tobacco which is worldrenowned and unequaled in quality ilavour and aroma by any other growth tobacco is also cultivated in other parts of cuba but although frequently of fair flavour it cannot compare with that produced in the vuelta abajo the finest and choicest leaf for covering purposes is almnost entirely re tained by the havana manufacturers for their own use but large quantities of what is termed filler leaf are annually exported to the united states europe and elsewhere for blending and improving the flavour of the homemade cigars the nearest approach to havana tobaceo as regards flavour cones from the neighbouring island of jamaica but so far only leaf suitable for filler has basen produced the texture being too rough and coarse for use as cigar covers there is no doubt that a fair  amount of very excellent cigar tobacco could be grown in jamaicabrazil and mexicosouth america also supplies the world with many varieties of the cheaper kinds of cigar leaf the best coming from brazil the brazilian leaf is rather pungent and powerful in flavour and is used for blending but rather sparinigly on account of its strength with the poorer and comparatively flavourless tobaccos of less favoured countries large quantities of this brazilian cigar leaf are annually ex ported firom the port of bahia chiefly to geniiany and austria where the native pro duct is particularly poor and lacking in quality a very pleasant and aromatic cigar tobacco comes froni mexico mexican cigars were very popular in this country before the duty on im ported cicars was raised to such an extent as practically to shut them out of the market while the flavoir of this tobacco is excellent the leaf is generally rather thick and coarse and is therefore not suitable or profitable for use by british cigar manufacturers this is very much the case xvith manila tobacco this leaf also has its own peculiarly sweet flavour large shipments of maniila ciaars and cheroots were for many years annuauy imported into these islands but owing again to the prohibi tive increase in the cigar duty the imports are now quite negligiblesumatra and manilabefore the introduction of sumatra tobacco some  or  years ago manila leaf was that most generally used by cigar manufacturers for covers maanila tobacco has a mild and sweet flavour superior in this respect to sumatra anid makes smooth goodlooking eigar but it is much stouter and thicker in texture and therefore not so productive as the latter little if any is imported into europe at the present time sumatra leaf which is today the worlds favourite material for covering cigars has quite displaced manila it is especially adapted for covering cigars the colours being particularly attractive and the leaf itself of extraordinarily fine texture and silky appearance it is the most produc tive tobacco for making cigars that is grown and fabulous prices are paid especially by american and german manufacturers for the choicest colours and grades it has little or no flavour but as a cigar cover it is unrivallednorth borneobritish north borneo situated within the same degrees of latitude produces a tobacco very similar to that of sumatra and if any thing it has rather more flavour the texture and colours generally are however not always so desirable and in consequence it does not realize on the whole such high pricesseed leaf is a variety cultivated in the united states principally in connecticut and pennsylvania it is so called owing to its being raised from havana seed it is very largely used not only in the united states but also in this country and europe for manu facturing cheap and moderate priced cigarstobacco has also been cultivated in a more or less experimental fashion in this country chiefly in the eastern counties and hamp shire and ireland for some years  but while in many instances the leaf is of good size and fair appearance the quality is poor such a result is only to be expected owing to the geo graphical position of these islands experience has conclusively proved that tobacco of satis factory or even passable flavour and aroma cannot possibly be produced in such high latitudes a fact which does not seem to be quite appreciated or even fully understood by some of our more sanguine enthusiasts the cost of production also is extremely high and unless heavily subsidized or protected there would seem to be no possibility of tobaccos being grown in this county except at a considerable pecuniary loss the case tor tobacco grooing in the united kingdom is presented in rticles on page xviii
