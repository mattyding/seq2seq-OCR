storage at theports use of the  kings pipefrom a correspondentmost smokers probably have no idea of the vast dimnensions of the tobacco business at the principal tobacco ports of the united king dom or of the amount of work done there in dealing with the commodity supplies of tobacco do not merely pass through the ports they are often stored there for long periods the average time for which they remain in the special warehouses being about two years during the period of storage various processes are carried out for the importerslast year the imports of tobacco into the port of london alone including cigars and cigarettes amounted to b valued at ï¿½ without duty or including duty six times as much the normal stock of tobacco held by the port of london authority is about  tonsenough to provide b per head for the whole of the population of the united kingdom the most ardent smoker on entering one of the warehouses of which there are  in the port of london itself could put his hands on a coupio of hogs hcads which would be sufficient to satisfy his craving for the normal length of lifelondon docksivirginiian tobacco comes in bulky hogsheads weighing about half a ton each  oriental tobacco is brought in bales varying in weight from b to b and sometimes is very carefully protected with inside coverings while tobacco from nyasa land rhodesia and india is packed in bales weighing from b to bthe royal victoria docks may be described as the centre of the system for tobacco im ports into london electric trolleys specially adapted for bales and hogsheads aie used for the transport of the tobacco from the quayside to the warehouse and inside the warehouses there are overhead cranes for moving the hogsheads most of the ware houses are connected with the railways and so deliveries may be made to all parts of the united kingdomthe visitor to any of the warehouses at all the entrances to which are customs officials will find various processes being carried on there the atmosphere is laden with the heavy aroma of great masses of tobacco on being brought to the doors of the bonded ware house each packet is weighed in order that the precise amount of duty payablenmay be determined each package is marked and from that moment the particulars are care fully preserved in ledgers until the duty having been paid and the delivery of the pack age demanded by the buyer it is removed from the precincts of the portweighing of the hogsheads involves thestripping off of the surrounding wood and metal bands a solid mass of tobacco is then exposed which is placed on a platform seale until the exact weight is determined the weighing and sampling processes over and the casing replaced the loose staves are quickly tightened by means of a lasso the whole is then taken by truck to a hydraulic press where the coopers replace the iron hoops and lid the hogshead is then ready for storage before delivery to the country or for export it is placed beneath the hydraulic press and made quite secure for transport naturally owing to the smnaller size of the packages the weighing of tobacco in bales is a simpler mattersampling and garblingin the sampling of tobacco at the ports the leaves must be extracted according to colour texture size and condition so that the sample may be fully representative of the package from which it was drawn the port of london enjoys a reputation in every european market for the way in which samples are preparedanother important operation is that known as garbling lwhen there is reason to believe that all the tobacco in a package is not in perfeet condition and instructions are given by the importers the damaged leaves are separated from the sound and the latter remade into a new package both in the pro cess of separating the leaves and in repacking the leaves experience and skill are required as well as patience for in the case of eastern tobacco the process of garbling is a long and tedious one other minor operations under taken by the authoritys experts include the laying out of the tobacco for inspection and the drying and occasional cleaning of it further the authority may be asked to open hogsheads and deliver a portion of the contents the smallest quantity which may be passed through the customs being bpossibly there may be found at work in the warehouses a surveyor representing the under writers who will be asked to determine whether damage to tobacco was due to its having been shipped in an unduly soft and damp condition or whether it was caused by sea water salt can be discovered by test and in that event a claim would be paid for salt water damageclose to the warehouses at the different docks is the kings pipe consisting of a furnace in which is burned tobacco so damaged or of such little value that it would not justify the payment of duty great bales of tobacco refuse may be seen waiting to feed the flames a drawback of the duty is allowed in respect of the stems when removed from the tobacco leaves and these stalks together with other refuse are placed in bags usually of loolb each and destroyed incidentally the heat generated by the destruction of this waste tobacco is sufficient to warm water in pipes for drying tobacco in a neighbouring building so there is actually some little gain from this wholesale burning of tobacco
