cultivation inthe empirethe producerstaskpreference the keyto progressby harold t pooleyin dealing with supplies of empire pro ducts to fill empire markets it has always to be remembered that a wide difference sepa rates thoso commodities which are essential or can be definitely standardized from those of which tobacco is an outstanding example that depend entirely upon the taste of the consuming publicindeed the same tobacco plant in different soil and climate produces a leaf of a totally different flavour and no amount of treatment of the leaf afterwards ean alter its essential aroma therefore in attempting to establish a market for empire tobaccos two considera tions have to be ket in mind either by means of blending to give the publie somiething fairly close to wfhat it already likes for exact or even near reproductiou is iinpossible or else to educate the consumer to an appreciation of a new characteristic flavour it is highly desirable to combine both of thesemethods

tobacco has given a fillip to the industry in the west indies our photograph shows a field of tobacco plants injamaicamarket but britain is eminently a conserva tive buyer in matters of taste and in spite of the immense possibilities within the empire for tobacco growing the magnitude of the task of entering this market has until recently forbidden any perceptible movement towards empire production on a large scalethe granting of the preference in  however caused a general stimulation of interest among producers and by the time the imperial economic conference of  was first mooted the tobaccoproducing in terests had held frequent meetings and in the tobacco section of the british empire producers organization had arrived at agreement as to general policy they found themselves under the necessity of establishing their product against the deeply rooted pre dilection for american and turkish tobaccos in this country and of competing with foreign producers enjoying highly proteted home markets in alost every case it was obvious to them that a definite recognition of preference in the unitedkihgdoi market giving a certain amount of security for the future was essential to any progress they therefore impressed upon the economic conference and upon the official delegates the importance ofsome concession being made to the empire industrydinperial preferencethe standard rate tobacco duty was and is s d per lb and the government of the day offered to the conference the alternative of incrsasing the proportion of the preference from onesxth of the gross duty to one fourth or on the other hand the stabiliza tion for ten ys of the money value of the preference as it then stood the former was obviously the better provided the duty did not fall in subsequent years the tobacco producers who had asked for both the in crease to onefourth and then stabilization at that fgure accepted the increase and declared that they would continue to press for stabilization in this

pointsit is essential if the south and central african colonies are to be developed success fully that they should find industries giving full employment to natives and suitable oppor tunities for advancement under the general direction of europeans tobacco is par excel lence the industry for this purpose it is grown by natives under white supervision it is harvested graded and packed by europeans and in a certain proportion by natives industries to carry out this particular and necessary purpose of eivilization are not so many that we can afford to lose an oppor tunity of fostering themthe development of the canadlian tobacco industry has been a remarkable example of the direct effect of the british preference and though developments on the same scale or of the same types that central africa should produee are not to be expected caada should soon fill most of her own needs aud supply the british market with many types now regarded as characteristic united states tobacoeqthe
