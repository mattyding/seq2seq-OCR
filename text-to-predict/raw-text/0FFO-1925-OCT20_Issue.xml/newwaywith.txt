new way with recklessmotoristsconstantinople policemethodsfrom our constantinoplecorrespondentdr eniin bey wlio is niothing if not an enlergetic prefect of this city has hit upon a very effective device for imposing upoii motor drivers that carefulness which has been so conspicuously absent in the pasthe has issued to the police planks of wood studded wvith nails and has given public notice that the police have been authorized to throw down these planks before any motorcar that they think fit at a distance of one yard and in case the car does not stop in tirne to avoid having its tires either punctured or cut about by the nails this will be regarded as proof that the brakes are defective and the chauffeur will be punished accordinglyso far the police appear to have made comparatively little use of these new powers but tho mere threat has had a singularly good effect whereas quite recently it was a risky thing to cross even the narrow streets that obtain here motorcars are now going at such a demure pace that one newspaper has published a cartoon of a man being asked by a driver whether he wants a car and replying no thank you i wil take a cab as i am in a hurry mloreover the threat has been the more effective in that quite a large number of the motorcars are owned by the drivers themselves who would therefore suffer in their own pockets each time that they spiked their tires upon a plankit is however not only the motorcar drivers who are being called to order a number of new regulations have just been issued for tile guidance of the general public the hours for example between midday and  oclock and again between midnight and morning are regarded as hours of rest during which the residents of houses are not to be troubled by music such as the playing of the gramophone in the streets  foot passengers must keep to the pavement where there is one and keep to the right carriages and porters are alone allowed to follow the middle of the road it is forbidden  to stretch oneself out on the pavement or the roadway or to cut wood there or to make building prepara tions without setting up a barrier or to ride either a horse or a bicycle or to drag a handcart on the pavement it is also forbidden to spread out washing there or to beat carpets except on thursdays up till midday
