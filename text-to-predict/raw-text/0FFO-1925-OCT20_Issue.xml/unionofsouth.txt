union of southafrica delicious tobaccoobstacles to overseas tradeby p j nautdl elsenburg tobaccostation cape provinceuntil about  or  years ago the majority of the pioneers and settlers in south africa turlned all their tobacco into roll tobacco on the farms by first subjecting it to a process of fermentation and then twisting the leaf into string this boer tobacco in the form of roll was used for smoking chewing and snuff pur poses today the term boer tobacco means virginian leaf gronn and manufactured in the country as pipe tobacco in cigarette tobaccos we have two distinct popular types that madie from purely virginian leaf and that made from south african grown turkish leaf french hoek in a blended formas tle character and quality of tobacco are almost entirely dependent upon soil and cli matic conditions striking differences in the types of leaf are obtained from the different localities these are the pretoria rustenburg marico and kirugersdorp districts  potehef stroom piet retief the katrivier and oudtshoorni areas  and the western province ttturkislixin the transvaal the tobacco crops are raised under conditions depending on summer rains and are irrigated only when necessary in the middle districts of the cape province tobacco is raised nmainly on irrigated lands for here the stmmlner rains are tuncertain and in sufficient to mature the crop in tne piquet berg district the tobacco is entirely raised under irrigation in the western province where there is an ample winlter rainfall and scarcely any summer rainfall the turkish tobacco crops arc raised exclusively on dry landsmethods of cultivationin thle case of turkissh tobacco the seed beds are prepared and sown durinig the latter part of may to the end of june so as to havc the plants readv for transplanting in september in the dry sunmmer weather the plants have to make growth on the moisture stored in the soil w here virginian tobacco is grown the bed are started in july august and septem ber antd thie seedlings are transplanted in november and december in the transvaal vpecially the summer rains do not as a rule come unltil october and november prior to which the soil is too dry for planting purposesw ell decomposed stable manure is worked into the soil where the beds are to be made before the seeds are sown the beds are covered over witlh bushles branches and twigs of trees which are set on fire the heat of the fire ouglht to penetrate the soil to a depth of four or five inches to destroy the seeds of weeds and thte eggs larve and pupe of insects and to free the soil from the spores of plant disease  wliheni the ashes are raked off the bed are sown with the seed the beds are theni lightly covered with sifted stable manurv andi natered regularlv till the plants are well elstablished nspraying and dusting with various materials are necessary to check the attacks of earthfleas worms tobacco snails wildfire and other diseasesploughing operations must be started well ahead of the planting season usually two or three ploughinigs are considered necessary stable manuire is never used wnhere sheep and kraal manure is used it is best to bring it into the soil a considerable time before planting to enable proper decomposition to take place artificial fertilizer can be applied a few days before or at the time of planting by broadeasting it on the land or drilling it in the rows marked out to receive the plantscultivation must begin as soon as possible after planting horsedrawvn cultivators are in eonstant use until the plants have become too tall to move up and down the rows witliout injurinig the leaves in the case of virginian wheni the flowers are ready to open the top of the stem with four or five leaves is broken off to force more growth into the remaining leaves in the ease of turkish no topping is done the object being to obtain a large number of smnall leaves instead of fewer but larger leavesharvestingthic harvesting of turkish tobacco begins twvo to three montlhs after planting the leaves axe picked off the plants as they mature from thc bottom upwvards picking is done only in the morninlg when the dew is off the leaves the leaves of each davs picking are placed in boxes or baskets and immediately taken to the threading or working room here they are graded and sorted native women and cbildren then thread the leaves of the same ripeness and size on to strings each string of leaves is then tied on to a reed pole ft in lengtlh and the reeds are placed each lav in a vilting room wvhere the temperature and moisture are regulated here the leaves change into a pale yellowishgreen after being in the wilting room three or four days the reeds are taken out to the drying camp where they are placed on trellis and exposed to thle san during the day and covered irp at night to keep out the dew until the leaves are dry after grading the leaves are leled and forwvarded to the farmers coopera tive company for selling purposesthere are two ways of harvesting virginian leaf the first is similar to that already de seribed in the case of turkish leaf except that thae leaves instead of being threaded and strung are suspended from shorter poles and ate loosely tied in btmdles for drying purposes such tobacco is either cured in fluebarns or aircured in sheds built of thatch and poles brick or galvanized iron the otier method is that of cutting off the stalk leaves and all when the majority of leaves are mature and suspending the plants from poles in shedsuntil they are cured and dry this method is the more general hen cured and dry the leaves are allowed to become slightly damp they are then stripped off the plants sorted into different sizes and colours and tied into bundles or  hands of about  leaves each the  handcl  are taken either loose or baled to the central warehouse owned by the farmers where the tobacco is fernented and sold to the manufacturers in the ease of turkish tobacco the fermnentation is under taken by the manufacturer and not by the farmersthe production of tobacco in the union of south africa according to the director of census and statistics is as follows olb

flavour and aroma of soutlh african tobacco are peculiar and as a rule do not appeal to the sanoker who is unaccustomed to them if this tobacco is placed on the overseas market in sufficient quantities to develop a taste for it the increased demand would stimulate productionon the other hand the imetlhods of preparation in the union are unkniown to the overseas buyer and to a large extent the article is not as yet put up in such a form as to lend itself readily for selling on overseas markets it is almost a certainty that if the demand fron overseas were increased the crop would be prepared as required there seems to be no reason wvhy such a demand should not be established overseas delicious pipe tobaccos and cigarettes are turned out for which there is a good local demand by the maitfactire of south african tobacco in england a similar demand can be created over there and all the more easily if blended to suit the existing taste it is quite true that defects can be found in south african tobacco but these will be remedied as the industry makes pro gress and the south african farmer better understands the requiremiienits of the overseas market
