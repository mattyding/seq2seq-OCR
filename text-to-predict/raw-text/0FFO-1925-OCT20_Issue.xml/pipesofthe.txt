pipes of theworldinfinite varietyart in decorationby alfred dunhillwhen america was discovered the tobacco pipe was well established the steps by which thmq form of smoking arose were probably as follows  inhalation of the smoke of leaves thrown upon a fire in connexion with some ritual act  inhalation of the smoke through tubes of which the earliest mention is by oviedo in a yshaped tube with the two horns of the y fitting to the nostrilsthe pipe believed to have been smoked by sir walter ralegh on his way to the scaffold it is attributed to theindians of virginiaand altematively inhalation of the smoke into the mouth from a  bowl  excavated in or built up on the ground through a hole in the side thus forming an  earthpipe   the use of a straight hollow tube from which to draw the smoke of the burning leaves at one end into the mouth at the other and alternatively the detaching of the earth pipe from the ground making it portable  the use of a hollow tube bent up at one end and the fitting into one end of the port able earthpipe or something else serving the same purpose of a reed or other hollow stem in this way or rather these parallel ways we see the evolution from the simple act of inhaling to that of smoking tobacco in a pipe either onepieced such as a clay or with separate bowl and stem such as a corn cobthe pipe after its discovery by the western pioneers was introduced to europe mainly by the english by the portuguse it was taken along their famous trade route to africa india and the far east in conse quence there is a distinct cleavage between the types of pipe generally used in the englishtaught and the portuguesetaught parts of the smoking world though the passage of time has of course tended to modify the difference very considerablyprimtive typesthe commonest pipe found by the english in north america was the tube bent up at one end such as are excavated from the burial mounds of the muskogee indians the pipes first used in england were of this type executed in clay and there is a distinct resemblance between even the modem eng glish  clay  and the muskogee mound pipe the shape moreover has been handed on to some extent to the briar pipe of today the portuguese on the other hand found the natives of brazil commonly smoking a pipe of which the bowl was a nut and the stem a reed or slender tube of wood from this brazilian model are derived most of the pipes of the eastthe turkish persian cinese and those of the countries influenced by china which are characterized by a long stem the japanese pipe of today is short though this does not seem always to have been the case a regular feature of eastern asiatic pipe bowls is that they are very small for which two reasons may be assignedthe price of tobacco or the habit of mixing opium with itobviously the availability of materials in any country must have a great influence on the form of pipe used there and conse quently we find an astonishing variety both in bowl and stem mere tubes of bone even human bone pottery cane reed wood silver dc rolledup leaves alone or inserted in the hollowed midrib of a larger leaf  lumps of clay with or without a stem inserted nuts corncobs gourds c with reed or other stems  bent tubes of clay carved stone bowls with stems of all shapes and kinds all metal pipes allwood pipes and wooden pipes with stems or mouthpieces of other material these are but some of the kinds encountered over the world all moreover may be either plain or ornamental sometimes ornamented very elaborately indeed yet another division is introduced by the presence or absence of a watervessel through which the smnoke passes and is cooled before reaching the mouthwe may now look at some of the typical or most striking pipes of various parts of the world the prkitiv red tndian pipe theencestor of our clay scareely needs illustra tion but the more advaneed varieties such as the sioux and the chippewas smoked with bowls of red steatite and sterns usually short merit attention a very rare bowl is one from northwest america being of wood carved by a fishing indian of the coast to represent a  killer whalechinese influiencethe other type which had its origin in america the nut and reed of brazil has very interesting descendants in the orient world of which the tbrkish chibouque and the long chinese tobacco pipe are notable examples china has exercised in the matter of pipes as in so many things besides a profound influence upon her neighbours the pipes of asia in general are after the chinese medel with a long stem and a separate bowl the latter being of comparatively tiny dimensions chinese pipes often exhibit great beauty of workmanship even the usual bamboo stem lends itsel to intricate decoration and the mouthpiece may be of valuable material such as jade opium pipes in particular are frequently real works of art and highly priced their main feature is the ornaental bowl set nearer the middle than the endofthe stem with a minute opening on thetop upon which the little ball of rointed opium is deposited the ainu tobacco pipe is elearly an offspring of the chinese but the shield which may accompany it is an original feature the chinese have no besads to pro tect against fire the  hairv ainus havea departure from the chinese type is the little japanese pipe often earried in acase of bone ivory or lacquered material which is stuck in the girdle another variation is the pipe called the  nyoungwe du up near the town of that namen in eastern burma the pottery bowl of an example in my possession is beautifully ornamiented with a representation of a peacock and the stem is shortthe western esquimaux learnt smoking from across the behring straits aid they follow the chinese in using bowls of smau capacity but they have not the same materials to work upon as the chinese nor the ability in hiandling wood or metal rhey do indeed make rough pipes of both wood and metal but their most strikingcontri bution to pipemanufacture is the use of walrus and mammoth ivory a very fine example which i have lately acquired has a walrus ivory stem elaborately decorated with scenes from esquimaux life including a herd of reindeer the eastern esquimaux pipes show european and red indian influence and are less notable the bowls are larger usually of stone and wood or metal are used for the stem and mouthpieceafrican varietiesof the varieties of pipes in africa it might be said that their name is legion on the top of the original portuguese influence on the west coast have come countless other influences and we cannot therefore talk of a  typical  african pipe a fine example of individual workmanship however is a pipe of the bushongo of the congo region the bushongo are good craftsmen  and the carved wooden head of a woman which forms the bowl is very refined in comparison with most african art in the south the hottentots and the kaffirs show clear signs of dutch influence some of their pipebowls carved in serpentine are graceful enoughtaking a flight across the world we find the maoris of new zealand like the poly nesians influenced not by asia but directly by the europeans who came to them but there is in the british museum one very fine maori pipe carved in wood with typically native decorationone curious example of the pipes of europe may be mentionedthe  snakepipes  of old staffordshire pottery ware it must have taken some little time to get the first whiff of smoke through its stem the con cluding example is the wooden pipe said to have been smoked by sir walter ralegh on the scaffold before his execution the heads depicted show a distinct resemblance to those on some of the pipes dug up from the burial mounds of north america but sir walter raleghs name is more usually associated with the pipe of clay and there still exists a case of clays said by tradition to have once been hispipes of the worldan indian pipe top left of the
