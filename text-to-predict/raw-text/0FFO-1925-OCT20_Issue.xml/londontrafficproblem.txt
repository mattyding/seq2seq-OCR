like a free fight for the out going omnibuses and in the mornings there were long queues of waiting passengers if the tube could be extended northward from finsbury park a great deal of the conges tion would be relieved not only did the steam trains of the london and north eastern railway not tap a sufficient part of the area but they were very slow and in convenient it might be that the steam
