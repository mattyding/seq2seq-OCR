the west indiesx centre of empireproductionthe untd kingdox marketfrom our jamaica correspondentthe decision of the home government to grant a preference on empiregrown tobacco is of great importance to the british west indies it is true that outside of jamaica tobacco culture cannot be terned an industry but in jamaica it was for years a flourishing enterprise during the last few years tobaccogrowing and its allied industry cigarmaking have been languishig for the want of a large oversea marketsince the grant of an imperial preference on tobacco inquiries have been received in jamaica from the united kingdom as to what the colony can produce but it is too early to state with definiteness the extent to which the preference of  per cent will help to make jamaica a rival of cuba the possibilities of tobacco growing and curing in the british wvest indies british guiana and british honduras are however enor mous for these colonies afford a wide field for exploitationhighgrade tobaccothe governments of dominica and montserrat have already laid out experi mental tobacco plots under the super vision of an expert from jamaica the results of this experiment are distinctly encouraging for although dominica has the heaviest rainfall in the west indies and the island is for the most part mountainous there are areas with just the soil required for the growing of a highgrade tobacco in tortola one of the virgin islands private interests have taken up the growing and curing of tobacco for the market in the three colonies the experimental stage has not been passed with the technical advice effered by the imperial college of tropical agriculture at trinidad however there is reason to hope that the eastern group of colonies will become an important unit in the production of empire tobacco in every colony in the west indies the light sandy soil necessary to the cultivation of tobacco existsthe planting season in jamaica is from october to december the system of planting is in rows of ft the plants being in apart thus giving upwards of  plants to the acre the crops require a good deal of attention in the way of moulding the roots keeping the fields clear of weeds and seeing that the leaves are not attacked by grasshoppers wire vvorms and caterpillars this watchful care must be exercised until the tobacco is reaped three months after planting the yield of tobacco depends entirely on the soil a good crop should realize between b and b of tobacco to the acre without the application of fertilizer if fertilizers are employed then the yield should be between b and b it is estimated that the cost of plant ing including all charges should not exceed � per acre in the more prosperous days of the industry highgrade tobacco has been sold in jamaica at � per battached to the plantations are barns in which the leaves are dried by air after which they are stripped from the stalk and cured by fermentation on the same principle as that which obtains in cuba the leaves having become  bone dry the grading process follows for the pur poses of the cigar manufactory or for export the tobacco may remain packed in cases or in bales for several years before being used but it is necessary to see that it is not attacked by insect pestscigarmakingin jamaica the industry is confined merely to the needs of the cigar factories the nativegrown commodity is used as filler and binder but the outer wrapper is imported from sumatra since tobaccogrowino was taken up in the colony in  by muban families who were forced to leave their native land on account of revolutions efforts have been made without success to produce bythe drying barnjamaican natives taking the leaves after cutting to the drying bamgrowing under a netting a grade of wrapper which would displace the sumatra article somo of those who are concerned in the local trade are however confident that within measurable distance further experi ments will be undertaken towards the pro duction of a fine nativegrown wrapper the need for such experiments is all the more necessary since the island government has for revenue purposes increased the import duty on tobacco leaf from s d to s per lbwithin the past year the virginia variety has been cultivated experimentally in jamaica with gratifying results two hundred acres of land are at present being prepared in one area for the growing of this variety on a more extensive scale jamaica has been able to grow what is known as a mild tobacco of good burning quality with an aroma that is only surpassed by the higher grade of the vuelta absjo or cuban cigar this claim it is asserted has been fully justified by thetobaccoleaves grown ona canadianplantationconsignmeents of cigars exported to england and elsewhere twenty years ago the output in cigtars alone amounted to about  the cigar factories in kingston thenx gave steady employment to hundreds of workmen and more than  acres of land were under cultivationdiinising outputsince  when  cigars were manufactured there has been a gradual diminution in output last year only  cigars were turned out in the one large factory which remains in kingston and the area under tobacco had shrunk to less than  acres the official figures relating to the trade of jamaica in cigars are as followsin  exports to the united kingdom canada bermuda the sister colonies in the caribbean and foreign countries amounted to b of cigars valued at � in  b valued at �  in  b valued at � and in  b valued at � today the united kingdom panama china and bermuda are the best customers of the colony the loss of trade elsewhere is attributed to tariff walls erected by some countries including canada for the protectioa of their own industry in leaf tobacco export returas were as follows b valued at �  b �  b �  b b to the united kingdom and b to belgium valued at �keen disappointment is felt in the island at the refusal of canada to include tobacco and cigars in the trade agreement the colonys hopes are centred upon great britains becoming a profitable market for these commodities in jamaica lands are available for an output of tobacco which would place the colony in advance of porto rico and when it is remembered that still more extensive areas are available in british honduras and british guiana while the islands which constitute the lesser antilles caa contribute their quota there is no reason why the british wvest indies should not become an extremely important centre in the growing of empire tobacco
