mr chiurchill on  locarnopact of reciprocalinsurancethe industrial outlookmr winston churchill chanceuor of the exchequer last evening addressed a meeting of his constituents in queens pavition chingford sgi w h goschsel presidedmr ctuncbiu said that he noticed that mr cramp told the railwaymen the other day that we were in for the worst winter since the hungry fortiesmany speakers said unemployment was increasing rapidly but that was not true there had been no increase in unemployment for nearly five rionths if they took the last  weeks for which figures were available they would find that there were  less unernlloyed than there were and it was more remarkable that it should be so because these  weeks were part of the ordinaryv seasonal period at which one would expect the figures to go up last year in the same  weeks the figures of unemployment rose by  the latest returns which would be published next day showed a diiminution of nearly  on the week somebody wouldt say that there were  more unemployed than at this time last year but he reminded them that the coal industry and the special and exceptional depression wllich had overtaken the coal industry had caused an enormous increase in our unem ploynient figures if they left out coalmining and looked at the general trade of the country there hal not been an increase since last year there had been a decrease of  a decrease like that said mr churchill does not jiustify public men in proclaiming that our affairs are steadily getting worse they may not be getting better in this respect but they have certainly not got any worsea focrsmlnk pmaandreferring to the peace pact mr hurchill said i welcome that first for two different sets of reasonsfirst because it draws a merciful veil acrofs the lurid and tragic past and secondly because it affords a great a sure and i beleve the only possible securitv for the maintenance of peace in the future cheers of course there are and always will be differences of opinion on these great episodes in world policy there are some who say wnhy shouild we call the gernans into council   there are others vwho saywhy should we commit ourselves in any contingeney in safeguarding the frontiers between the nations on the continent of europe   and there are no doubt argu ments of value whichi can be used on both these points biit  for my part rejoice to see germany taking what can only be ber great place in the league of nations i take that event as a sign that europe has definitely begun to look forward and not to look back  when efurope begins to look forward she wxill move forward azid i feel that this is an event of immense hope and confidence here voni have four great nations of europe joining hands together in a sort of foursided pyramid of strength and security firm and solid joining hands together for mutual pro ttection and for the prevention of war between themselves cheers i do not know of any i other way in which you can take effective precautions against a strtuggle in which we should very likely be involved and if it came could only end i the rebarbarization of the whole world i believe this great pact of reciprocal insurance is not only the foundation but the symbol anl the herald of still wider associations which vill be possible among the states of europe and the world when better days and wiser generations come to the world cheers he was very glad to think that this conservative governient had been able to carry forward work which had been done with the assent of all partieshad been able to carry it one great step forward to an achieve ment wlhich made the safety of the british home stand upon a surer footing cheersmr clhurchill went on to refer to the reductions which had taken place in taxation and said that approximately � bad been given back to the direct and in direct taxpayer cheers on the question of the gold standard he said that the com petent expert opinion of the country had long firmly held the view that for an island like this depending on worldwide trade a plain honest uniform standard of trading was onie of the most essential things cheers mr churchill also roused much applause by stating that revenue officials had advised him that for this year next year and the year after we might look not for anything remarkable but for a steady gradual up grade in the matter of incometax which was levied on business throughout the landmr churchill referred to the tactfuladmirable and skilful intervention of the food commissionthe commission which had been so niuch derided the food commission hatl succeeded with the general assent of the great majority of the bakery trade in effecting a diminution in the actual retail price of the loaf which brought the diminution of retail prices much into harmony with the diminu tion that had taken place in this and many other spheres in regard to wholesale prices the consuming power of the public had been well maintained during the year the con sumption of tea had remained constant but sugar had increased tobacco had sub stantially increased and beer had increased considerably laughter the consumption of clothing had increased and people were dressing better and better every day they would be glad to hear that silk was doing very well cheers a considerable number of factories had been set up in england to maiiufacture artificial silk the natural silk trade was never doing better the con suruption was considerable and active and the price of artificial silk had never been raised so far as motorcars were concerned thin foreign cars were yielding their revenue anid on the british cars there had been an enlormous increase in the sales and the prices had as a whole tended lower than before the duty was imposed the general expendi tuire of the masses of the pyeople uipon enter tainniient holidays c had this year reached unexameled proportionsthe government was committed to pay a subsidy to the coal trade which would exceed � and might even amount to � but if they had been plunged into a general strike they should have finally closed the door to all trade revival for years to comer clhurchill concluded with a reference to the position in the mining industry and said he had read with great distress the violent declarations of mr cook which came with such ill grace in view of the genuine effort niade by the whole conumunity to help the niiers whom mr cook represented or said he represented but he mr churchill was sure of this that the time which had been given by the government had been well used and that the country was now well aware of what the issues would be should a great industrial disturbance arise next year the issue would not be a question of the nuiners wags but it would be undoubtedly an attempt on the part of a section and a class in this counitry to dictate their will to the wvhole conmmunity in deflance of the power of parliament and the constitution that was an issue and conflict which should it ever be raised must go forward to a con clusion and to one conclusionreplying to a quiestion with regard to national insurance r ctil hill said the government was considering whether they could add a voluntary section
