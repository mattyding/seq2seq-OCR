imperial and foreignnewsbljigaby today ia kinglesskingdomrom our cental euoreancobespondimtcut off from the rest of the world by a strange language which is like no other european tongue except finnish and is spoken by less than  souls hun gary is a difficult country to study that the asiatic tribes whom arpad led into hungary in the ninth century were a warrior race virile intensely proud and intoleiant with a culture built upon a strict caste system is evident even today except for the welleducated and for those engaged in the usual  international  callings the hungarians speak no language but their own  the tourist can  get on  with german but even he has difficulties the popular idea that german is a  second language throughout hungary is mistaken those foreigners who are interested in the country usually become fiercely partisan  for them with few ex ceptions hungary is all black or all whitebudapest itself has known another colour it is difficult today to realize that it was only in  that bela kun held sway here with his  red  soviet govern mentthat there was death lurking round the corner of many of these fine modern streets and in the doorways of these palaces after bela kun had vanished a terror often described as worse even than his held swaythe white terror of the fascists of hungary those were the days when bands of young men dragged out and murdered in the streets not only those who had worked or were suspected of having worked under kun but men whose sole offence was that they were socialdemocrats or that they had the misfortune to look like jews during the two  terrors the city went through experiences comparable with its sufferings during a century and a half of turkish dominationthat is all past the apologists of hungary tell you it was but a phase a natural reaction from bolshevist cruel ties it is true that hungary is today the most successful of the fosterchildrezi of the league of nations smiled on by international finance with an excellent endofterm report from the leagues commissionergeneral inflation is but a nightmare of the past only onethird of the proffered loan has been touched there is a very large budget surplus and the unhealthy trade balance is on the way to recovery there is a demand for long term banking creditsfor agricultural credits  the reproach is directed espe cially at great britain that she is short sightedly refusing the mercantile credits demanded perhaps the fact that there are still many compositions and failures on the part of mushroom firms which sprang up under inflation and which must wither as elsewhere under stabilization has much to do with this cautious british attitude these are small matters beside the undoubted fact of the general solidity of hungary  but you may ask hark ing back to politics  those who made ths innocent suffer with the guiltywas that all cleared up  it ia an indiscreet questionand it is easy to be indiscreet in hungary but you may get an answer readily enough from the socialdemocrats and even fromn the royalistlegitimists  they walk the streets of budapest today they tell you only in a few cases has it proved possibls to move the reluctant authorities to in vestigate try and pass sentencethe monarchythe royal hungarian army  the royal hungarian govermnentthe monarchical adjective is everywhere  and who is to be your king   this is another in discreet question is it to be otto of hapsburg nearly  years of age and an exile in spain  at the demand of the entente the hungarian parliament once sullenly declared the hapsburg family to have forfeited its rights to the throne but the hungarian newspapers talk of  queen zita and some of  king otto in less than three years time otto will be  and of age under the hapsburgfamily law wvill the holy crown f st stephen be placed on his brow  and if not will it be the archduke josepli favoured because of his magyar coii nexions but opposed by most royalists on account of his adherence to the revo lutionary nationial assembly of hungary  the hungarian egalite the legiti mists call himor the archduke albrecht the favourite of the  awakening magyars the fascists of hungary who if unwilling to commit themselves finally admit him to be a sure starter these are all indiscreet questions all that the discreet will tell you is that hungary is unquestionably a kingdom and that admiral hortliy is the regentno matter for whomand hungarys lost territories   we have been misuniderstood you are told  lf we seemed harsh to serbs to slovaks to rumanians it was not because we wished to destroy the nationalities it was because austria with her motto of divide et impera wislhed to destroy our nationality by planting and encouraging these  easterners  among us it was because we wanted to give these rude races the advantages of magyar culture while preserving it uncontaminated for our selves that we seemed to ke world to be bent on intransigent magyarization now our land has been tom asunder and hundreds of thousands of magyars are sub jected to the rule of the inferior races over whom they ruled for so longour land of a thousand yearsit always comes back to that in hun garythe thousand years and the other side says  a thousand years were given the magyars to rule to understand and to assimilate their subject races and they only aroused hatred among them at last the hour struck for the magyars what they could not achieve in a thousand years they shall not be permitted to attempt again they must bow to fate and the little plate bearing in angry protest a little map of hungary showing the lost vr as the hungarians call them the  occupied territories answers  nem nem soha   no no nevereast and westin the hotels you will see men in dinner jackets straight from savilerow dancing to gipsy orchestras with women in paquin gowns the budapest citizen points with pride to performances of shakespeare of moliere of calderon as evidence of his finished western culture though perhaps the most striking evidence of how far the west goes to meet the east in budapest was the announcement that none other than little tich himself was starring at the leading musichall and the reogni tion despite the disguise of  udr had aeree  on their hatbands of two men and a woman singing on the popular river promenade familiar airs in the familiar uniform of the salvation army imre mï¿½agari who fascinated london audiences ree months ago is back at home giving nb to the folksongs of thegipsies and of  the

prisonient last month for lkes majeste after trial behind closed doorsamong the villagers there are still a few who were born serfs and as the hun garians tell you there is still a real dis tinction made among the peasants them selves between the sons of serfs and the sons of freemen only a small minority of the members of parliament are elected by secret ballot the others being elected by voters who have to enter either a door way which declares them government supporters or one which proclaims them its opponents under the supervision of a government gendarme and of other persons who are prepared to see that they vote right  you must not confound our peasants with your english farm labourer says official budapest  they are political children who cannot yet be trusted to vote by secret ballot then one wonders why let them vote at all since it is tacitly admnitted that the votes given are not those of the individual but of those who decide which way it is  wise for him to vote there is much else to be studied in hungaryif one is prepared to be indiscreetto be continued
