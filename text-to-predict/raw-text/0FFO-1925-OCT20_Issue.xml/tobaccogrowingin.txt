tobacco growingin englanbthe aiipsireschemea plea for protectionby f j snook salisbury tobaccofactorytobacco was first introdueed into england from north america towards the end of the th century james i greatly dis liked smoldng and did his utmost to discourage it he imposed a duty of s lod a pound on the growersa large sum at that time considering the comparative value of money the growing and use of tobacco however increased till  when it was being grown in  counties at the restoration the virginian planters were an influential bodythe smoaking cluban amusing cartoon published in  one of therules of the club was no gentleman to be a memberi of the society who cannotsmoke three pipes at asittinjg   and in the first year of charles iis reign in order to encourage the trade of our american colonies and to enable them to buy british goods tobacco growing was prohibited in the british isles by act of parliament this pro hibition remained in force till  though in george iiis reign the restrictions had been relaxed in ireland with the result that in   acres of tobacco were grown in that eountry the finance act of this year reduced the duty on empire grown tobacco from fivesixths of s d to threequarters of s d this included english grown tobacco the growers of which ask for an effec tive form of protection to start the industry after the removal of prohibition in  tobaeco growing was begun in norfolk and hampshire and on a lesser scale in other counties at present the only remaining grower in norfolk is mr w d mackenzie of croxton methwold who annually grows a satisfactory crop which is cured and rehandled by mr a j brandon of church crookham hampshire three years ago an experiment was carried out in devon with the object of pro ducing the costly perique tobacco the ameri can practice of subjecting the tobacco to various fermentations at varying temperatures being followed the result was not satis factorythere remains mr brandons plantation at redfields church crookham hants which has been conducted successfully since  the soil here is distinctly light containing s per cent of coarse and fine sand the aefeage at redfields growing tobacco has varied since  from  to  acres this variation is due to the necessity of accumulat ing tobacco in bond so that none shall reach the customer till fully matured method of cultvationthe seed is sown

curtainsanother method ofgatjieringthe leaves in preference to cutting the whole planthas been recently employed with success the leaves are handpicked as the number of leaves allowed to remain on a plant varies from  to  obviously when the whole plant is cutfor curing all the leaves are not in the same state of maturity the higher ones being greener and less matured if all these leaves are cured at the same time an even grade of leaf is not obtained the method of cutting is quicker than handpicking and therefore as regards harvesting more eco nomical handpicking has however many advantages variations of soil in even a small plantation result in various sized planits when the leaves are picked those of the nmore mature plants are first removed and cured together in similar conditions and a moreniform grade of leaf results also the leaves left on the plant continue to grow in size and weight and consequently when gathered the whole crop shows a more uniform quality and colourin either case the greatest care is necessary in handling the leaves as any damage lessens their value after about two months in the aircuring sheds the plants are renmoved to the rehandling shed iit the process of re handling the leaves are stripped from the stalks if of course they have not been picked by hand already and graded in grading the leaves which are finer and more mature thani others are separated the grading and sorting are done by women and girlsafter grading and sorting the leaves are made into bunches of  tied round with a separate  leaf tbey are then placed in a temiperature of

plantations if inducemenit were given to the landowners and farmers to pro duce the plant at present millions of pounds are spent annually in foreign countries for tobacco which could be produced in this country thereby giving employment to its own workers the industry is a flourishin one in germany france and behium and could be made so in great britain
