tobacco machinebyfascinating devicesspeed and tireless repetitionby j h toddit waas inevitable that at some period the meehanical age should invade the tobacco in dustry you see the ittle shop at the corner of the street there you may buy thehandy packet of tobacco or cigarettes beautifully made cigarettes faultlessly cut and packeted tobaecoin perfect condition multiply the stock of this little shop by the tobacco stores in your towin then consider your town as one in the nvorlds million towns and you see that nmachinery alone has made possible tobacco for the mulltittidethe application of machinery to the prepara tion of tobaeco is of comparatively recent date yet the progress of tobaccofrom its unpack ing to the finished cigar the cigarette or the pipe miixturemay be and in vast proportion is by wav of machinery machinery so in trigning as to seem almost uncanny in its tulderstazaing movemennts its marvellous accuracy and its tireless repetition at un befevahle speedthe moistening processfrom the tobacco leaf to the prepared smok ing mixture may seem but a short journey but there are many interesting operations to foll ow ere you nmay  put that in your pipe and smoke it tobacco may be broadly divided into two classes first that for cigars and second that for cut tobacco or tobacco pre pared for the pipe or cigarette in each class the preparation is practically the samelresh from the hogshead tobacco is so dry that it muist be moistened to make it pliable and to prevent waste by crumbling so we lay it on the travelling wire belt of the steaming machine which passes it over jets of softly sprayed steam then comes the stripping or renioving of the stem from the centre of the leaf muclh stripping is still done by hand hut machine stripping is rapidly coming into favour the operator flattens out the moistened leaf ani slides the stem end of the leaf be tween the circular knives of the machine and tliee revolving slit the leaf neatly from each side of the stem the stem drops down a chute anid the halfleaves are stacked into books the next machine is a revolving copper eylinder slightly inclined here the tohacco is civen the necessary percentage of moisture by passing it through atomized water after a pause for absorption the leaf is taken to the eutting machinecutting and dryingtthe moderni eutting machine is a develop ment of the original cutting machine designed by robert legg and patented as early as  the firt legg cutter wvas purchased by john roger of oxfordstreet and legg cutting machinies are now in worldvide use the eutting macliie is a wonderfully efficient guil lotine aan endless feeding band carries the tobacco leaf through carefully gauged rollers it is thiein pressed into a cake or cheese and gradually geared forwarda v ery tiny section at a timnetntil it meets the slashing sweep of the knife which shears  times a minute past a hardened steel cutting strip the maeliine maay be regulated to make either a coarse or fine etnt it will cut b of cigarette tobacco per hour the cut tobacco is next subjected to steam drying the steam drying maehine is also an inclined copper cylinder it is fitted with internal steam lheated paddles wvhich gently toss the tobacco over and over as it travels down the sloping cylinder the vapours meantime being drawn off by an exhaust fan the tobacco must now be cooled and sifted a conveyor receives it and delivers it to a revolving hexagonshaped sieve covered with flr mesh wire the sieve eradicates the sand and dirt from the tobacco cooling being accomplished by means of a fan the tobacco is niow ready for making into cigarettes or for packingthe cigarette mlakerthe next machine is a lightning cigarette maker rolling out milelong cigarettes and taien oashing them off in the correct length at a rate of  cigarettes per hour the fiheh cui tobacco is fed into a large hopper ahd movte gradually forward on to two rollers these rollers are spiked with pinslike the oldfashioned musicalbox cylinders the pins pick up the tiny threads of tobacco and carry ing them forvard drop them evenly and lengtlwise onto an engliess tape running below the face of the rollers simultaneously another device on the same machine is unwinding a spool of finie narrowr paper like a long tape about lin xvide this tape passes through the printinig rollers which print the name and brand of the cigarette in two colours or black and gold speeding over its little rollers this paper tape passes under the chute which dlelivers a continual streamof tobaccolaying it evenly along the middle of the paper paper anid tobacco are then received by a plough or ftir nel which turning up each edge of the paper encloses the tobacco in a paper tube one edcge of ihe paper runs across a gurnmiing wyheel which lays on a thin strip of gnm the endless cigarette then passes tinder an electric heater which dries the gum then the razoredged cutoff slicing with the rapidity of a machinegun meets the flyingtube of tobacco and cuts off in accurate lengths  and delivers the perfect cigarette on to a catcher band  from this band the operator gathers the cigarettes and packs them on racks ready for the packeting machines the same machine rill tip the cigarettes with gold straw cork silk or waxthe cigarmaking machine is of americanorigin and makes a complete cigar duplicating every detail of the handmaking process it first selects the  filler of the cigar straighteus it out and automatically weighs it the head and tuck amr neatly snieked off and the filler  laid on a rolling beft flere it is encased in the binder leaf making the  bunch  of the cigar each bunch is ingeni ously  handrolled by machinery and the whole is then sheathed in the outer leaf wrapper the finished result is a cigar of perfect uniformity packeting and wrapping machines are certainly among the more fascinating devices of the tobacco industry like arkwright the inventor ofthe spinningjenny william rose the inventor of the tobaccopacketing machine was a barbers apprentice similarly also with his great prototype he was seriously handi capped by poverty neither inventor had any mechanical training and in each case their early inventions were sponsored by wealthy patrnsroses first appliance for wrapping up half ounce packets to sell over the counter was a primitive affair but it contained the germ of a big idea he continued experimenting with wooden camplates arms and brackets early experience brought many heartbreaking disappointments but he possessed remark able tenacityand he also had the goodold styleone of the early types of tobacco leaf cutting machinefortune to interest mr h h wills in his invention wills warned him of the pitfalls awaiting poor inventors and in order to secure to him the full advantages of his labour gave rose permission to include his name on the first patent specification registering the tobaccopacketing machine wills purchased the first machine rose began in an attic workshop and today owns the premier wrap ping machine factory in europepacketingthe tobaccopacketing machine guillotines the wrapping paper from the reel in some cases making also an inner sheath of foil the paper passes below the hopper which holds in readiness the correctly weighed tobacco tobacco and paper are pressed downwards into a mould the mould wheel revolves and the ends of the packet are met by the folder fingers folded neatly and then pressed and recessedthe cigarettepacketing machine is a most interesting combination of counters folders and wrappers the operator fills up the hopper with cigarettes and the hopper device then proceeds to convert the cigarettes from an undisciplined mob into perfectly drilled units the cigarettes leave the hopper in perfect alinement and fall in a ceaseless cascade over the counter wheel they are then met by the counting finger counted two fives for a ten packet and two tens for a twenty packet slid into a foil wrapper folded in the slide section of the box and then fed into the outer case the later machines each pack at the rate of about  cigarettes per daynew stylethe latest type of cutting machine an endless feeding band carries the leaf through earefully gauged rollers to the knite which shears  times a mainute
