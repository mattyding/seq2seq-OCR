health andtobaccothe test ofreactionpotent agency ofcivilizationby our medical correspondentthere is no subject on which more positive statements are habitually made than that of the effect of tobaccosmoking on health every body has his owil opinion and usually quotes medical evidence or testimony in support of it thus it is affirmed that pipes are more wholesome tlian cigarettes that cigars alone are  safe that a pipe is detrimental because it is usually foul and so onthe truth is that no substantial evidence is in existence which would entitle anybody to make any positive statement we do not know exactly the influence of tobacco on health we do not know which form of tobacco is most and wvhich least wholesome  finally we doamong the snuff boxes in the british museum is this one which belonged to edward gibbon the author of the declineand fall of the roman empirenot know whether or not tobacco affects the heart or brainthis ignorance is not enlightened by dis quisitions on the pharmacology of nicotine or pyridine for while these poisons do un doubtedly give rise to grave symptoms the fact cannot be overlooked that vast nimbers of men and womiien who use tobacco daily with pleasure remain apparently quite free from them no doubt the tobacco smoker takes small doses of nicotine just as the coffee drinker takes small doses of caffeine but equally without doubt he or she does not ex hibit the symptoms of nicotine poisoning after smoking has becorne a habit on the con trary the smoker has established what is called a  tolerance  to tobacco that is to say he is reacting against its unpleasant effects just as a trained athilete reacts easily and with advantage to the stresses of the contest in which he delights these stresses it is quite true might and probably would exhaust or even kill a less highly trained individual but that would scarcely be accepted as a proof that exercise is harmfulpenalties of excesswvhat we ought to study in connexion with smoking are not the effects of nicotine when given in large and poisonous doses but the reactions to small doses of nicotine in human beings who are certainly not being poisoned these reactions are familiar to every smoker a sense of peace and comfort of well being of complacency an increased power of action an added clearness of thought tobacco is entitled to be classed as an agency of civiliza tion because it is so powerful a stimulant to social intercourse and happiness and because it renders those who use it better able to bear with equaliimitv the troubles and frets of lifeand this can be said of every form of tobacco from snuff and fags to the most exquisite brand of cigars there is no form of tobacco wvhich does not bring soothing and comfort to son eone even the abuse of so valuable and potent a source of happiness is of small account when compared with its multi tudinous uses the abolition of tobacco might conceivablv improve the health of a few vain glorious boys and a few stupid girls  it would on the other hand rob humanity of a vast storehouse of inspiration and strengththis is another wav of saying that tobacco harmls onlv those vho are failing to react to it the  beginner  is a case in point he is like the beginner in any other enterprise and must expect to pay for his experience  until his reaction to tobacco has been established he cannot possibly hope to experience the joys of this reaction like the man wvho is out of training and who feels every call for effort a weariness lie feels every whiff of smoke a pumishmentanother case is that of the man who absorbs tobacco in excess of his powers of redction  his state is exactly comparable to that of the athlete who attempts feats of endurance in excess of his physical strength in both cases incomplete reaction resultsthat is to say the signs on the one hand of nicotine poisoning on the other of overexertion show themselvesthese signs of nicotine poisoning are not difficult to detect there is a sense of sickness and of weakness the victim becomes prostrated and may vomit he feels exceed ingly unwell the heart may become slow and the breathing laboured as a rule this trouble soon passes away in cases in which the victim is ill with some disease the signs may be very acutei happily however most people as soon as they become unell go  off their smoke just as they develop a disin clination for physical exertion thus the chances of damage on this count are relativ ely very smallit must be repeated that these cases of poisoning prove nothing against tobacco ex cept that in certain instances the human organism is unable to react to its influence they do not tell us anything about the effect of reaction to tobacco on the heart or lungs or brain and this it is evident is the one point on which information is really needed does the habitual and comfortable use of tobacco influence any organ of the body ad versely  again are such terms as  tobacco heart tobacco nerves  cigarette smokers cough  justified effect on the heartsome years ago an attempt was made to test the influence of tobacco on the heart elaborate instruments were set up and very skilful investigators employed a number of selfsacrificing people submitted themselves as the human material of the work the result was practically nothing it was fomnd that smiking usually slightly increases the plilse rate and may raise the pressure of blood in the arteries similar changes are noted during any animnated conversationthus it is difficult to say wvhther the heart is affected one way or the othe by smojwng tobacco it is equally difficult todogmatise about the nerves or the throat there ate cases in which obviously excessive cigarette smoking has caused a red and raw throat and so set up a cough but these are probably fewer than is generally supposed there are other cases in which the use of a foul pipe has brought on the condition known as  tobacco blindness but here the fault is probably not so much the tobacco as the burnt oils in tho dirty pipe tobacco blindness seldom occurs in those tvho smoke cigars or cigarettes or pipes kept even moderately clean some authorities hold that it can be absolutely pre vented by systematic pipe cleaningit must be added that the power of each individual to reaet to tobacco differs some what from that of his neighbours we have all of us our own allowance if we exceed it vre suffer if we keep within it we derive benefit and this applies to women as well as to men it is a safe statement that none of the evils predicted for the woman smoker have been realized smoking does not injure women
