iyasalandin excellent tobacconeed of railways and roadsby r s hynde editor the  nyasalandtimesthe early pioneers in nyasaland had often perforce to subsist on the products of the country smokers among them soon found out that an excellent pipe tobacco could be purchased from the natives indeed there was an export trade in tobacco before the europeans introduced the cultivation of the virginia plant when the ivory caravans started for the coast they were often accom panied by private individuals who carried loads of nativegrown tobacco which they sold to the coast arabs and indians the tobacco was plaited into the familiar  rolls  so often seen on the east coast and the country had a reputation for the excellence of its productlater the europeans took up the cultivation and after the initial difficulties had been over come the industry made rapid strides the first recorded export was b in  last year it exceeded b the varieties used are all virginian and the nyasaland product and that of northeast rhodesia a near neighbour closely resemble the american tobaccothe plantations or  estates are situated mostly on the higher and healthy altitudes from ft to about ft above sealevel estates average about  acres of which from  to  acres are under tobacco the ground is prepared between june and october large gangs of natives are em ployed to  hoe  the fields as most of the land is heavily wooded it is not practicable at the outset to use ploughs the trees are felled and the land dug up by hand labour but after a few years when the stumps have rotted the use of the plough becomes possible and these are more and more coming into usepest preventionafter being thoroughly cultivated the fields are ridged and left till the plant ing season which is the beginning of the rains usually about the end of novem ber meantime nurseries have been prepared these are laid off in long beds about three feet wide they are burnedie grass and brush wood are piled on them which when fired heats the top layers and destroys the weed seeds the ashes also act as fertilizer to the young plants the nurseries are sown about six weeks before the probable planting date but as this is uncertain a succession of sow ings is made so as to have plants ready for either an early or a late season the seed is usually treated as a precaution against various fungoid diseases such as wild fire after sowing the beds are carefully watered shaded and tended until the plantingout time comesafter the onset of the rains the young plants are set out in the fields about three feet apart unless the weather is very favour able many casualties occur which have to be made good at the first opportunity plant ing is done by native labourers who become fairly expert at the work thereafter there is a battle with the weeds which compete wvith the young plants and with insects caterpillars and diseases at a certain stage the plant is topped that is to say the flower bud is pinched off as this sends all the sap into the leaves and makes them larger and more even about three months from the time of sowing the tobacco plant is mature or  ripe and then harvest ing beginsearvestingeach properly equipped estate has a number of fluecuring barns besides other necessary buildings the barns are rectangular build ings some ft by ft and about ftbigh these are fitted with fireplaces and flues by which they can be heated from air temperature up to about deg f ventila tion is controlled by shuttered openings the tobacco is hung on a series of tiers extending from ft from ground level to the roof harvesting is usually leaf by leaf one or more ripe leaves are picked from each plant and these leaves are strung on bamboos and hung in the barn a barn has to be filled in a working day and immediately it is filled the fires are started and the heat is gradually raised until the leaves have been thoroughly dried out if possible to the required colour the skill of the curer is shown in the success he obtains in getting the desired colour but sometimes this is almost impossible particu larly when there is exceptionally wet weather at harvesting timegrading nd packingas soon as a barn is cured it is emptied and the dried leaves are  bulked  in a long build ing called a  bulking shed to mature when the curing is finished the bulks are taken down and the leaves are graded or sorted accord ing to colour and size and are then either sold to a local buyer or packed in bales for ship ment to london or liverpool if the tobacco is bright the trade term for the yellow coloured leaves the leaves are after grading tied into  hands or small bundles of from  to  leaves each and are first dried thoroughly and then subjected to hot steam to prevent breakage in packing while still hot the bundles of leaf  tobacco are packed if the tobacco is red brown or dark it is usually stripped which means that the thick centre stem or midrib of the leaf is deftly pulled out without tearing the leaf these leaves are then tied into bundles called  strips they are then redried and steamed and packed in the same way as the other leaves except that often the  tie  is removed and the strips are packed  loose ie not id bundles no blending is done by the planter but in grading he endeavours to keep the leaves of each grade as uniform as possible as regards colour size and quality each bale has its grade mark stamped on itsuch is a rough outline of the work entailed in growing tobacco nyasaland produces twvo distinct kinds of virginia tobacco and follows closely the american methods throughout the yellow tobacco is all fluecured the darker varieties are usually firecured or  smokecured eg the smoke from open fires is allowed to circulate among the leaves which gives them the peculiar aroma required by manufacturersresearch worktobaccogrowing in nyasaland is a compara tively young industry and a considerable amount of research work is still required the nature of the soil governs the type of tobacco which should be grown and this question is being carefully investigated by the govern ment agricultural chemist who is carrying out a soil survey of the tobaccogrocwing dis tricts this should lead in time to better results since the varieties grown will be fitted to the soils at present all nyasaland tobacco is classed as one whereas there are at least two or three typical soils the products of which are bound to differanother handicap on the industry is thle large acreages and the difficulty of rotation crops large acreages make the problem of executing all the different cultural operations exactly at the right time and the checking and control of disease more difficult the want of payable rotation crops leads to increase of insect bacterial and fungoid pests it also increases the difficulties of manuring and culti vation and the expenses of production as the labour cannot be profitably employed at times when tobacco work is slack these difficulties will be lessened when the proposed zambesi bridge is built as the growing of such rota tion crops as maize and legumes would then be possiblegenerally speaking the industry has been worked by europeans who have provided the capital and the knowledge while the natives carry out all the different processes from plant ing to curing grading and packing gradually however the natives have been induced to take up the cultivation and over b out of the b produced in  was grown by natives on their own account the cultivation is rapidly extending among them and the aniount produced this year is expected to be double that of last yearfuture of the industrymarkets are one of the problems for both european and native growers the imperial tobacco company have an uptodate buyiig and packing factory at limbi near blantyre it has installed two automatic conditioning and packing plants and it buys over  per cent of the crop there are one or two other buyers and some of the larger groxwers ship direct to liverpool and londonthe future of the industry largely depends as is shown by the report of the east african commission on the improvement and extension  of communication there is an immense area of fertile land suitable for tobaccogrowing labour is fairly plentiful the climatic conditions generally are favourable and the preference on colonial tobaccos helps the industry by widening the market at present many poteiitial areas are impossible owing to want of communications the ex pansion of the industry therefore will be gradual but every lowering of freight charges every improvement in communications such as the building of the zambezi bridge and every extension of the railway will widen the area of production on the other hand as experience increases anid scientific investiga tions proceed the quality and yield should improve  with specialization the product vill he more popular with nmanufaaturers the benefit to the empire will be an increased demand for home manufactures as nyasa land imports the great bulk of its trade require ments from britain
