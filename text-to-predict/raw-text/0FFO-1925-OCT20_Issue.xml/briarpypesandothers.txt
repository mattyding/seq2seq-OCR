in england about the time of the crimean nvar at the same time as the cigarette the french diseovery of the use of the hatd root of the heatlher brutym gave a new ben to the art of pipemaking lthe first briar pipes werejean nicot  the french am bassador to lisbon from whose name  nicotine  is derived he introducedtobacco into francegenerally short and in england the still extant though not now very popular  bull dog  shape was one of the first the short curved and straight shapes with smooth rouncled bowls are equally popular in both countries and in italy and belgium and nowadays also in holland and norway in denmark and sweden the briar pipe has not yet displaced the big german china pipe but the cigar is more popular there than the pipe longstemmed briars have never been very popular in england though they are oftent met with in france and italy horn mouthpieces were common in this country until about  years ago but now they have been completely displacedbvvulcanite the hareler the better all sorts of patent pipes have been devised at various times to prevent the backflow of the  nicotine  to the mouth and enable it to be got rid of bv some more scientific form of abgums as the germans call it than the mere unscrewing or unplugging of the mouthpiece for even the best briar cannot be wholly absorbent especially when it is old and foulvogue of the grainfashions in briars have altered from time to time the silver band on the mouth piece formerly indispeosable on a  decent  briar is less popular than it was in france and italy they have never worried much about the  grain and general appearance of their briars and here the ripesmoker is not so particular about grain as he was in the nineties when the respective partisans of the  straight  grain and the  birds eye grain vere in keen rivalry with the result that for a time the straight grain was  the only wear and no undergradulate who valued his appearance would be seen smoking any other there is now a vogue for a knobby or roughened form of briar and a peculiar flattened form of bowl cheap wooden pipes of cherry long and short or even hazel are still smoked but less now than formerly he american corncob with its cane stem and the calabash still count many devotees but after all nothing can really compete with a good briar no pipe is so generally satisfactory whlether it is of the simple type or provided with patent  gadgetsgerman china pipesby cavalier times the tiny elizabethan bowl of the clay had grown into a goodsized re ceptacle too large to hold a cicar in the dons fashion england and holland were probably about equallv responsible for the development of the long clay pipe of the th centurv both peoples had much the same tastes hi their smoking and drinking and the dutch then laid the foundation of their ancient tradition of good smoking and connoisseur ship oi pipe tobacco which has persisted till today in both countries the long clay still exists unknown now else where though as a matter of fact it is commoner in england than in holland where a shorter elay not so short of course as the irish dhudeen with big bowl of archaic form is still a favouritein holland arose the method of glazing the clay pipe so that it would no longer colour the dutch painted their pipes gaudily as they painted their glass whereas we preferred virgin whiteness in the pipe and in the glass the harder its material the less absorbent was the pipe till when the painted clay and delft glazed pottery pipes of holland had developed inl germany mnthe early th enutury into the china pipe therewas no escape from the  nicotine the china pipes beeame so unutterably foul that acenturylater the abgusm or  off pouring  was invented by whiï¿½h the bowl was made separate from the rest of the china part of the stem and fitted by means of a short stalk into a bulbous receptacle which could be emptied at pleasure this develop ment was rendered possible by a change in the attitude and construction of the pipe it assumed an erect attitude its stem hung straight down from the mouth when being smoked and its bowl turned upwards parallel with the stem it could not be all made of china without imminent danger of breakage so the teutonic mind adapted the wooden stem from an oriental turkish original communicated through austria and gave it a screw mouthpiece eventually the abgus was invented which continues to be the chief feature of the ordinary german china pipe to this daythe meerschaumin england the long china pipe never made headway and ib now unknown another teutonie invention or adaptation however was the meersehaum the soft easily carved material comes chiefly from asiatic turkey whence it was introduced into austria where the pipemakers of the th century found it adlmirably adapted for the carving of pipeheads as the germans call the bowls in elaborate relief it coloured more finely than the softest clay especially when carefully tended while hot with washleather and with wax so the cult of the meerschaum grew up and at the beginning of the last cen tury when the soldiers who had fought in germany took to the german form of pipe the big meerschaum crossed the north ea and till the sixties remained the pipe par exceulence since then it has diminished in size and its teutonic characteristics have vanished in an approximation to the shape of the french briar and now hardly any body smokes it except the select few who know and can it is far too expensiveat the end of the th century in england there were three forms of pipe in vogue the native long and short clays the invading german forms in the shapes of themeerschaum and the china pipe the latter disappeared here before it had aequired its abgws the others continued to flourish and in the mouths of the good and great the noble military meerschaum took the place of the vulgar long clay when a pipe was smoked at all in germany the long clay still popu lar till the middle of the century was now fast going out and in the th century had totally disappeared though it still existed in holland in france where they never were great pipesmokers they had nothing hzut clays short and long and potters pipes till somebody began to smoke a pipe with a bowl of hard wood allwooden pipes pro bably existed already in germany but it was mn france that the use of the root of the bruydre or heather which we wrongly call briar for making pipebowls was first dis covered its use reached england in the fifties and become general in the seventies and by the nineties the briar pipe had become sovereign in britain france belgium and italy and common in holland the short clay is becoming less and less common in england and in holland ad the long clay the  churchwarden is now almost a

cherry or other wood and its bulbous mouth piece of amber or glass is now smoked only by a few of the elders though the narghileh or waterpipe still claims many a votary in the cafesthe cigarette did not reach england till the fifties it was the gift of the crimeanwar and it also came to stay but it did not assume its present com plete form till the eighties till then every body made their own cigarettes with their own papers then was invented the machine made cigarette sold in packets and after the great war it seemed that the pipe would be altogether ousted by the cigarette but happily a reaction in favour of the more nly form of smoking is observable the cigarette is not pontrorf hrvpb it all its own wav
