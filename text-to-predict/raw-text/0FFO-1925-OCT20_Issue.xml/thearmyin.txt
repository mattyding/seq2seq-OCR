the army inlessons of themanceuvresabove  standardit will be some time yet before the chief of the imperial general staff can present the report on the army manceuvres to the secretary of state for war meanwhile a military correspondent who watched the army training ezercises both in  and  indicates some of the valuable lessons which have been learnt in the article which followby a military correspondentfor two years in succession it has been my privilege to watch in most favourable cireum stances the training of practically the whole of our expeditionary force cf regular troops and of a considerable proportion of our territorial army i have seen the various units under dif ferent conditiozts in barracks in training camps in bivouac anid on the march both in fine and in very foul weatherlast year i wrote that apart firom questionis oi armameit equlipnment organization and the soundness of training the general impression left upon my mind was one of cleanliving viaerous youth in the pink of condition striving to reach the standard of those wonderful old contemp tibles wlho slipped quietly away to the seaports before the couclusion of the training season of in now after seeing all the expeditionary force put to tihe test of divisional training fol lowed inunediately by the ordeal of mnano uvres held in the worst weather whlich i can rememlber in the month of september  have no hesitation in expressing my opinlioin that the standard of has been passed in  ln support of tbat opinion i can quote the high authority of lord haig who held the aldershot cominmanid in  and commanded the i corps lst and nd divisions in the retreat from mons we must however bear in mind that the uniits observed this year were at peace strenigthi no account has been taken of the efficiency and strength of the reserves which forni so large a proportion of our army when mlobilized for service in that respect the presentday expedi tionary force is not yet up to the  standard although its strength has been reduced approxi mately by onethird let us hope that the measures recently adopted for improving the situation as explained to the house of comrmorns in debates on the estimates will bear fruit in clue course meanwvhile we must take note of diis mweak spot in our military positionimproved territorialsbehind the expeditionary force of  we had a territorial force of which the members were liable only for home service new we havo a vastly improved territorial army acceptinig as a whole the obligation to serve abroad in grave emergency the establishment of the ter ritorial force by lord haldane under a liberal regimne followed withini ayear or two an an nouncement by lord balfour as prime minister of a uinioniist government that india uncer certain specified conditions might require rein fercenients amounting to nine divisions but that th need would not materialize in full for a period of  months from the date of mobiliza tion at that time the  german peril  had not arisen the defence of india was looked upori as our principal arrmy problem these points are recalled here on account of their bearing upon the statement much criticized at thetime that the old territorial force would require six months training before being fit to take the field we have no equally authoritative statement about the period whikh must elapse before the new territorial army can be ready i have taken the opinions on this point of several general officers wvho know territorials well their opinions differ as might be expected on account of divergences between various localities and classes of the population but mny inquiiries have led me to the conclusion that four months would be a safe average upon which to base our military policy provided that the numbers can be made up by wvartrained veterans one terri torial brigade the nd east midland took part in the manceuvres and requires special referenceas for recent progress in the training and equipment of the army one of the points which stand out most conspicuously is the good march disciplineone of the best tests of efficienev which peace experience can afford there is little wrong witlh infantry when wvhole brigades can cover  miles in  hours and battalions even greater distances by road and across country and keep up their marching averaces under the most adverse weather conditions wve must bear in mind in this connexion the large proportioni of young soldiers in the ranks owivng to our drafting system and the dates of the oversea trooping programme a verv large percentage of the meni who had been through company training had left their battalions before the inanceuvres their places being filled by recruits infantry brigade commanders whom i have consulted consider these youths wonder ful falling out on the line of march is looked upon by them as a disgrace some of the pack batteries ra hold still higher marching records both in distance and in speed i have already reported upon one of these the th pack battery which i accompanied for a short dis tance on their march of  miles between  am on september  and the afternoon of september  i timed their rate of marching at well over four miles an hour i rmake a point of accentuat ing these marching records as they represent physical effort inspired by keenness and esprit dc corps common both to peace and to war conditionis whereas it is not possible to simiulate in peace traininlg any approximation to the strain and environment of actual fighting the subject of infantry and pack artillery movements would however be incomplete without some reference to the facilities offered by lorries for increasing the speed of movements off the field of actual battle and for saving the strength of the men until needed for some supreme effortbuscolumn  movementsthe rd division has now specialized for two years in practisinig these buscolumni movements last year by battalion this year by whole brigades the th brigade carried out some very good nlight work of this nature in an exercise againist the cavalry divisiori new lessons are learned every time such nmovements are attempted thlt chief oue being the need for forethought niastery of detail and practice a point that emerges very clearly is the great in crease in the weight of impedinieiita machine guns light automatics heavy supplies of ainiu nition and so forth for which infantry require crosscountry transport the reflection occurs to one that while nmen can never be  mechanical ized  mules and horses can it is a question of expense rather than of design great progress having been made in devising suitable forms of motordriven crosscountry vehicles the need for a move in the direction of mechanicalized firstline transport for infantry is indicatedbefore developing further the subject of motor transport i interpose a note on the drivers of the lorries many of them civilians during the buscolumn movements to which i have re ferred their work by day and by night was most strenuous and they displayed both skill and great endurance night driving without lights was very tryingthis leads me to the general question of motor transport we all know that a horse or a miule can pull a far heavier load than he cambhese new normal rates wiu be subject as from october   to the deduction of i per cent which was made as from july

too vast a subject for so short an article durinig the training and nanceuvres i found so much to observe and report on near the front line that it was not possible to do justice to the ntremmuous but
