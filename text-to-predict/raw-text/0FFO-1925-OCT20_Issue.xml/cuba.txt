cubathe cigarsmokersparadisechoice havana leaffom our havana correspondenthavana is today quite a modern city and yet there stil remain remnants of its antiquity the mention of havana invokes remembrances of a good cigar such as is not thought of when speaking of cuba and this is possibly because the best tobacco is reserved by the havana manufacturers for their choice cigars which are practically all exported cuba has a population of about  and consmmes  cuban cigarettes and  cigars dailythe total croptaking an average there are  bales of leaf tobacco of about b weight eachroduced yearly in cuba of which  bales of the fair to poor grades are exported mostly to the united states where the leaf is manufactured into cigars cigarettes and pipe tobacco the remaining  bales are required by the cuban factories to pro vide for home consumption and for making cigars for export the quantity of cigarettes and pipe tobacco exported is very small and the cigars exported amount to a little over  per year or less than one third of the number consumed in cuba the havana factories employ experts who are in a position to obtain the very chboicestof the bales of tobaccoleaf each year and it is from this specially picked tobacco that the choice export cigars are made the best cigars go usuauy to englalid although the united states purchases a greater quantity of choice cigars others going in varying quantities to almost every country in the world the high duties in many countries restrict the movement of havana cigars and make them an expensive luxury the total value of the cuban tobacco crop may be roughly calculated as between  and  it gives employment to a large number of people quite out of proportion to its monetary value this is mainly owing to the fact that the cigar industry has not found suitable machinery to supplant hand labour all the good cigars are hand made and all the different processes of tobacco manufacture are the results of hand labourthe growers taskthe cuban tobacco farmer is kept busy from the moment the seeds are planted until the cured leaves are baled his crop can be affected by many detrimental forces so on his daily rounds providing irrigation and killing insects and bugs he prays as earnestly as did the siboney indians that hurricanes cyclones and droughts will not cause damage which would be for him irreparable under normal conditions the wonderful climate and soil make possible the general excellence of the havana cigar nevertheless constant attention is required by the plants while growing and in the curing selecting pack ing and shippingthe tobacco crop is gathered between january and the middle of march after the harvesting the fields are allowed to rest and to weed freely during a couple of months in april and may stable manure and tobacco stems are piled up in the fields and covered with soil allowing these fertilizers to decom pose for spreading in june the fertilizers are evenly spread on the fields and disc harrows moved by power machines are run over them turning in the weeds and grass and brevaking up the soil to a depth of in the grass and weeds are left on the fields to decaypreparing the soilin normal years the heavy rains appear during july and august as tobacco fields are never ploughed unless perfectly dry these are easy months for the farmer as soon as the rains cease the fields are again ploughed but this time mostly with hand ploughs drawn by oxen or mules on up todate farms tractors are also used the plough being a special type having a long sharppointed share this plough merely loosens the soil without turning up the subsoil in certain cases cottonseed meal is broadcasted on the fields at this time during the months of september and october the final preparation begins and the fields are ploughed several times at weekly intervals harrowed if necessary in order to break up any lumps and gone over to remove the undecayed dry weeds to prepare for furrowingin the late autumn the tobacco seed is sown in seed beds usually placed on the side of a hill as near as possible to the field which has been specially prepared for the plants when the seedlings are about six inches high a selection is made and those having healthy roots are transplanted to the pre pared fields where shade tobacco is desired coarse cheesecloth is now spread on frames over the fields while the plants are growing earth is heaped around the roots a shorthandled cuban hoe being used the farmer has constantly to protect the plants against the numerous insects which feed on the leaves some are coloured so as to make detection very difficult and others attack the plant only at night a mixture of paris green and cornflour is used to overcome these pests irrigation is effected in various ways according to the nature of the fields where conditions permit water is allowed to run freely between the rows of plants but when this is not possible the roots of each plant are watered separately this operation is performed by hand because the water faaing on ume leaves has a tendency to spot them and thtlr damage their appearvuelta abajo cubaa tobacco plantation in the vuelta abajo where the choicest cigar tobacco is grownbarns where they are strung on short poles this is done by piercing the leaves face to face and back to back usually about  are thus strung on a pole and then hung on racks in the barn the pairs of leaves of sun grown plants called  mancuernas  are simply rested over the pole instead of being strung on it these poles are placed on racks in the tobacco barn at a distance of about one foot from each other and they are watched so that the leaves shall not stick together the barn windows are opened or closed according to the atmospheric conditions the tobacco cures quicker in dry weather moist weather not only delays the curing process but is also likely to cause a great deal of damage the curing process takes about two months when the rains begin in may or june if the leaves have attained the necessary uniformity of colour they are taken from the poles and tied into bundles for s weating these bundles are placed one on top of the other in large piles and the temperature developed is noted daily the usual system of taking the tempera ture is by the farmers pushing his hand into the centre of the pile long experience enables him to know when the correct tempemature has developed on uptodate farms a long stemmed thermometer is used for this pur pose as soon as a temperature of aboutdeg f is reached the bundies are separated shaken turned over and again placed in piles this process is repeated until the tobacco is perfectly conditioned after the tobacco has been properly  sweated as the above process is termed it is taken to the selecting house where each leaf is closely examined the btndles are then untied aid the leaves are separated and placed on a board and sprinkled with water in which tobacco stems have been steeped the leaves are then tied up and left stem downwards to eliminate all excess watergradingthe next day the leaves go to the selectors for separation into different classes of which there are four principal groups subdivided into various grades according to sizes and kinds of leaf these four groups are as followswrappers binders filers and colas the subdivisions are the following ligero light seco dry fino fine medio tiempo medium and maduro dark or heavy the subdivisions according to sies are various special care is taken to separate the unsound leaves these are solado strawy sentido rotten bronco coarse amarillo yellow and manchado spotted the leaves of different grades are tied together into  hands  of  to  leaves according to size of the wrappers and binders and the  hands  thus made are placed in cedar boxes called  casillas where they evaporate any excess moisture that remains from the wetting processwhen they are in condition for packing the  hands  are eiven a slight wettingwith a sponge and piled into  burros which are covered with blankets to keep the tobacco in a soft condition for packing four  hands  are tied together making what is called a  carrot and   carrots  are put into a bale which is wrapped around with the bark of the royal palm in a special device for this purpose and tied with a fibre made from the bark of the majagua tree the bales are then marked for grading and classed and shipped to the warehouse in havana where the tobacco undergoes a ftuther process of curing the freshly baled tobacco is stored in single rows but after the time necessary to eliminate any excess of moisture the bales are stored in rows of not more than five or six high depending on the quality of the tobacco even then the bales have to be turned over occasionally to keep the tobacco in good conditionthe vuelta abajothe different grades of tobacco in a crop cover a wide range a number of bales will sell for  each wherea others will bringper bale this difference is not  marked in tobacco grown in the santa clara province where it is grown mostly for export the finest product is grown in the vuelta abajo district the moat suitable

lime  magnesia  sulphuric acid  chlorine  and nitrogen cigiarmakingthe warehouse should be a stone or brick building perfectly ventilated with very little light and a temperature not varying more than lodeg fahrenheit when the tobacco is thoroughly cued it is sent to the cigar factories where the bale is opened and the leaves sprayed with water laid in piles and allowed to stand for several hours until they become su moist and pliant that they can be handled without cracking the tobacco intended for fillers is stripped of the stems women perform this work by hand the leaves are then graded for size and strength and they are laid in barrels or bins with wide tops for ventilation this process takes from two to six weeks experts examine the leaves daily to deter mine when they are ready for the cigarmaker the outside leaf or wrapper is handled separately from the filler after selection it is moistened stripped and sent to the wrapper department where it is again examined by experts and distributed to the cigarmakers according to class the moist cuban climate assists the operation of rolling the cigar as the leaf retains the flexibility which is necessary for making the perfect cigar the cuban cigarmaker by reason of ms experience is a past master in his craft but he has to thank his climate for the per fection of his product cigarmaking machines have appeared but none can turn out cigars to compare with those produced by an expert cuban rollerthe finished cigars are examined by in spectors who reject any which show a fault after sorting according to colours the cigars are placed in seasoned cedar cabinets slightly ventilated where they evaporate any excess moisture they are again selected for colours and shades and are packed into cedar boxes of   or  cigars havana cigars require proper care and storage until ready to be smoked they absorb moisture and take up impure air and smells if allowed to come into contact with them and their aroma and flavour are spoiledexport tradethe prospects for the tobacco industry are quite good as regards both exportation and cuban consumption panama and chile have recently reduced their duties and it is hoped that england may follow suit the addi tional  per cent ad vakrez tax which great britain imposed in  gave such bad results that his extra tax was taken off in the ollowing year but it had the effect of

quality any seed buds appearing are cut off and the plants reach full maturity in about  days from the time of transplanting where there is not a suitable water supply the farmers have to depend solely on the rainfall and thus suffer greatly when rain is scarce while a gentle ram is beneficial for both the leaf and root the farmer does not permit irrigation water to fall on the leaftwenty years or so ago the practice of american tobaccogrowers of covering their fields with cheesecloth was copied by cuban farmers with the result that a lighter leaf was obtained and the constant demand for light tobaccoclaro or colorado clarohas compelled farmers to increase this practice of protecting the plants from the sun most of the tobacco grown in cuba is however still raised in the open field without artificial shade after the furrows have been made the plants are inserted and sufficient soil plaeed round them to cover au their roots they are then slightly irrigated with a hand sprinkler after four or five days any sick or dead plants are removed and new ones inserted a prewetting of the soils has been found to assist in reducing the action of rootattacking worms when au of

during the growth of the plants and insects suckers c are removed as soon as the seedbuds appear the plants are  topped that is the seed bud is cut off and from this time the plants begin to mature and develop until ready for gatheringsljn and shade grownthe harvesting of shade tobacco is different from that of sun tobacco shade tobacco leaves are gathered at three different periods first the lower four leaves on the plants called  libra de pie are plucked three or four days later five or six leaves are taken from the middle of the plant which are called the  principal and finally the remaining leaves from the top called the  coronas are gathered the leaves as they are har vested are strung in pairs face to face over long poles which are hung on racks in the drying barns the leaves of the sun tobacco are not plucked but the plant is cut up into as many parts as there are pairs of leaves so that the centre part or stalk forms a connexion which straddles the pole in both the shade grown and sun grown tobacco a second growth crop called  capaduras is taken but it yields only low grades utilized mostly in the manufacture of cigarettesthe prime leaves of shade grown plants are placed in baskets and carried to the curing
