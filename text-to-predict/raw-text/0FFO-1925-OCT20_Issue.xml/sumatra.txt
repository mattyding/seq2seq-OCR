sumatrathe finest wrapperleafby l p leversonowing to the fact that tobacco culture in sumatra is in the hands of a few big com panies which limit the crops in accord ance with the demand this industry is in a highly prosperous condition more over there is no tobacco which can take the place of sumatra leaf as a highclass cigar wrapper the producing com panies are therefore in the fortunate position of having no serious competition from other countries the demand for sumatra tobacco as a cigar wrapper is worldwide with the exception of the isle of cuba where the im portation of foreign urimanufactured tobacco is prohibited it can safely be asserted that wherever cigars are manufactured there sumatra tobacco is to be found neutral in flavour silky and pliable in texture pleasing to the eye it satisfies both the smoker and the cigarmakerthe sumatra growers from long experience and ungrudging expenditure for scientific re search have brought the growing of their tobacco as near to perfection as possible the crop is started by sowing the seed in carefully selected seed beds or nurseries when the plants have reached a height of about six irches they are transplanted to wellprepared fields each of about two acres in size eachtobacco in bondhogsheads of virginian tobacco in one of the huge warehouses of the port of london authority at the king george v dock these bulky hogsheads weigh about half a ton each the warehouse is equipped with underhung cranesfield is under the care of a chinese coolie who is partly paid by results and watches the wel fare of the plants under his care the coolies again are under the supervision of european managers who besides their salary receive a generous percentage of the profits arising from the crop of the estate under their management as the tobacco leaves on the plant become ripe they are picked separately the picking starts on the bottom four leaves of the plant which arc known to the trade as  sandleaf in most tobacco crops such leaves are considered the poorest tobacco and have the lowest commer cial value in wrapper and especially in sumatra wrapper however the contrary is the case sandleaf yields the most popular colours and is much sought after by con tinental chiefly german buyers who are pre pared to pay fancy prices for their favourite colours the next pickings are known as  first second and third footleaf which each consist of the six following leaves of the plant the first and second footleaves  and to a minor extent the third footleaf supply the american buyers with the tobacco they require and consequently also fetch fancy prices the remainder of the plant is divided into  middle and topleaf and produces the cheaper and less desirable wrappers which are sold for the cheaper class of cigarhigh dividendsafter picking a string is passed through the base of the rib of each leaf these are then tied to sticks and are hung up in barns for drying and curing the tobacco afterwards goes through a fermenting or sweating process by being bulked in staples which are allowed to reach a temperature of about deg after the fermenting is finished the leaves are sorted according to size and colour during all this handling the tobacco has to be treated with great delicacy as any leaves torn or broken lose a great part of their value the sorting according to colour is also no easy task as there are a great number of shades each of which has to be sorted and packed separately mixing of colours in a bale would greatly affect the marketable value of the tobacco and give the estate a bad reputation for reliabilitythe crop is ultimately brought on the market in holland and sold by tender in parcels which vary in size from about  to over  bales as it is no uncommon occurrence for the growing companies to pay  to  per cent in dividends after generous writing down it will be seen that the care lavished in the raising of this crop is not wastedthe value of the  sumatra crop the last crop for which figures are available amounted to approximately  dutch guilders or nearly ï¿½
