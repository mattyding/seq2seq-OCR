the british filmindustryrelief proposalsteady progress is being made in the drawing up of plans for the betterment of the british film industry and there is a hopeful feeling throughout the industry that the dawn of better days for the trade is at last athand arising out of the memorandum presented some montbs ago to the board of trade by the federation of british industries on the matter of british film production a comnittee of members of the film trade was formed to draw up concrete proposals for the relief of the british industry which might be put before the board of tradeit is understood that among the proposals that the government are invited to consider will be schemes for a compulsory proportion of british films in every programme and the creation of a central fllm studio the scheme for such a quota of british film is modelled on thoe german  kontingent scheme now in force but is likely to be a distinct modiflcation of it under the german arranigement it is provided that the distributor must acquire one nativemade film tor every foreign lm im portedi but it is not incumbent upon him to exhibit it to the public neither is there any compulsory stanidard of excellence with the result that many poor and cheap films are made fewv of wlich are ever exhibited it is more probable that the government will be asked to pass legislation compelling exhibitors to show a reasonable percentage of british filmls in their programmes and it is realized that the german proportion is far too large the arrangement which has been drawn up it is felt will operate fairly on both exhibitor and renterthe provision of a central studio has been discussed in the trade for some montbs and wlhile it is bitterly opposed in some quartes there is no doubt that generally the idea flnds favour it has been suggested that an ideal site for such a central film colony might be found at the exhibition at wembley which is soon to be wound up and if the govern ment were to show an active interest in the matter there is no doubt that tlie idea would be wvelcome to many sections of the film tradethe london picture theatresthe arrangement at the leading london picture theatres for the week arecapitolthe foolkings cress cinematolay the admirable criddon thudlay the ham wamrior atd th de o ibe high seabmarble arch pavilionypralnew gallery kinemamodema madnesslhilharnontc hallthe lxce of the bastpolytechnic cinemared russia and mockostoil picture theatreioday tito devtis ci sand wesi bound  thunrsday u i maarry jds and tcv raidertivolithe gold rushempire thestehmadame sanasethe broadcasting programmes for today and broadcasting notes wll be b fund on patl
