auttomatic machinesboon to belatedwayfarersbyw norman bubbgeneral senretarvnational union of retail tobacconiststhe practice of plaeing automatic machines outside tobaeeonists shops after closing hours is rapidly extending these machines are un doubtedly a boon to belated wayfarers who find themsehes without a smoke on the other hand they add automatically to the profits of the tobacconist and since no per sonal service is involved it has been held that they do not constitute a contravention of the shops early closing actsthis  automatic machine judgrnent has given food for thought to many in the tobacco trade so far as the sale of tobacco and cigarettes is concerned there has been it is true no decision in the high courts but the case of the willesden urban district council v morgan still stands and is appli cable althotglh it refers to the sale of milk and arose out of the halfday closing order and not the shops early closing actssome time ago there were a number of cases before the police courts in different parts of the coantry in respect of selling cigarettes after elosing hours by means of automatic machines but these prosecutions have now ceased although there has been no actual decision in the high courtsthe most notable case and one whiclh may be said to have settled the question was that of the london county council v mirs sarah girling the licensee of a public house whiclh came before mr gill at the north london police court in november  the proceedings were taken under article  ta of the order set out in part i of the scehedule of the shops early closing act  as amended by the act of  in reference to an automatic machine whiclh on the insertion of a sixpence released a packet of cigarettes it was admitted that the defendant had fixed in her saloon bar an automatic machine which supplied on a sixpence being inserted a packet of cigarettes and counsel for the london county council submitted that such machines were illegal in an open shop there was only one decided case on the pointthe willesden urban district council v morgan in that case a dairyman closed his shop as required by the act but fitted to his door an automatic machine through which milk could be sup plied whei a coin was inserted the judges in that case held that the shop was closed counsel differentiated between the willesden case and the present sumrnmons because here the shop was actually openlegally open of courseand there were assistants in the bar and he pointed out that if they were called upon to attend to automatic machines after  oclock they would be doing a work which the law did not intend them to do for the defence it was urged that so long as the machines were automatic and were filled before  oclock they were covered by the decision of the judges in the high courtfarreaching decisionin the course of his decision mr gill said the distinction of fact between the two cases is that in the willesden case the shop was physically closed milk being supplied by an automatic machine fised to the door no one being employed in the shop while in the present case the premises were open for the sale of intorieastng liquor and persons wer there employed for that purpose i am of opiaiot that the principles laid down in the willesden case decided under the shops act  are applicable to the shops early closing act  and that the words  open for the serving of customers  must be construed in the same wav in each act that case in effect lays down thit the shops act  was intended to benefit those who serve in shops by restricting the hours of their employment and was not in tended to prevent the buving and selling of goods if such buving and selling waa not inconsistent with the object of the act and accordingly the court held that  serving customers  meant personally serving customers and that as no person was employed for that purpose during the prohibited hours no offence was committed applying these principles to the present casethe persons who were employed on the premises were only engaged in serving customers by selling intoxicating liquor which is not an infringement of the act there is no evidence that any act was done by them in  conneion with the automatic machine the fact that an automatic machine was availahle to customers for the purpose of purchasing cigarettes had no effect upon the hours of service of those employed on the premises i am of opinion tlit there was no personal service involved in the sale of the cigarettes and therefore that the premises were not open for the serving of customers within the meaning of the act the summons wil therefore be dismuissedit should be noted that the legal advisers to the london county council never appealed from this decision to the high court the position is perfectly clear so long as there is no seiviee sales by automatic machines do not constitute a contravention of the shops early closing actsthe  oclock regulation  oclock satur days is undoubtedly a benefit to tobacconists and other traders provided that the act is properly eniforced and administered the administration however unfortunately at the present at all eventsleaves very much to be desired the public have to a great extent accustomed themselves to shops being closed at  oclock and now that these automatic machines are becoming universal it cannot be said that any incon venience is caused especially as tobacco and cigarettes can be sold after  oclock with a meal moreover tobacco and cigarettes are so portable and can bepurehased m such eoa venient quantities that there is really no occasion for the very long hours in practice prior to the war
