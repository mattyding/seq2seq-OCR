the united statessupremacy ofvirginiaa natural herftageby carl avery wernerin the production of tobacco the united states is supreme among the nations of the world this however is not due to unusual enterprise but is merely a natural heritage of that country where tobacco was first dis covered it then grew nowhere else in the world from the fifteenth century up to the present time the united states or that area which is now the united states has produced aiid manufactured more tobacco and con sarmed more tobacco per capita than any other country the total world production annually iaking a threevear average is b the yearly average in the united states is i bamerican tobacco may be divided into two general classificationsnamely the types tused for cigars and the types used for cigar ettes pipe and chewing tobaccos and for export the digareaf tobaccos are grown in connecticut pennsylvania new york wis consini ohio and to a small extent florida and georgia cigar tobaccos are subdivided into three kinds according to their suitability for wrapper binder or filler purposescigar tobaccothe typical wrapperleaf soils of the con necticut valley and florida are fine sands and sandy loans containing only a small percent age of clay and having a very limited capacity for holding water the subsoils are variable in composition but as a rule contain at most only moderate amounts of clay the binder leaf soils at wisconsin are sandy loans light clay loans and the prairie soils which are a dark rich loamthe best time for sowing the beds is from the middle of march to the middle of april it is seldom safe to set the plants in the fiela before the middle of may or june  on account of the danger of late frosts and cold nights in cold frames from six to eight weeks are required to produce plants of suit able size for transplanting to the field and in hotbeds four to six weeks are required if cloth instead of glass is used to cover the seed beds eight to ten weeks are necessary to develop the plants to the proper size for trans planting before pulling the plants from the beds the soil is thoroughly wetted to avoid unnecessary breaking of the roots the plants are pulled from the bed separately and put into baskets or small boxes in which they are carried to the field they are kept cool and in a moist condition especially at the roots no plant that is wilted is transplantedplantinga rapid and uninterrupted growth is neces sary to secure the finest textured leaf and clean thorough cultivation is essential care is required in the preparation of the soil which is brought to a fine tilth special attention must be given to the matter of fertilizing the crop the use of fertilizers containing chlorin is avoided as this element tends to injure the burning qualities of the leaf the plants are set in rows ft in to ft in apart in the rows the plants may be set from in to in apart the best distance for average conditions being about in the setting of the small plant requires care in order that the roots may be given an opportunity for rapid develop ment so that the plants may grow off promptlyin hand setting the method is as follows a hole four to six inches in depth is made with a dibble to receive the plant unless the soil is already thoroughly wet the holes are filled with water the soil quickly puddles after the water has been applied and the plant is set immedi ately the roots are placed in the puddled mass before all of the water has been absorbed by the soil the surrounding soil is then drawn about the roots and stalk of the plant and firmly pressed so that the plant is main tained in an erect position alloxving the bud to remain just above the surfacecultivationafter the field has been set about a week cultivation is begtn and is maintained as long as the size of the plants permits ordi nary surface cultivation to maintain a loose fine mulch about the plant witlh frequent hoe ing to keep down weeds is essential cultiva tion is shallow especially in the later stages of growth to avoid injury to the roots of the plant wvhen about onehalf of the plants in the field have developed seed beads but before these have bloomed  topping  is done this consists of breaking off the top or crown of the plant at about the third sucker or branch below the seed head so as to allow the plant to develop more fully the lower leaves after topping suckers or lateral branches will soon develop in the axiles of the leaves and these are removed by hand before they become large enough to retard the development of the leaves in topping and suckering the field must be gone over two or three times the aim being to cause all the plants in the field to mature at about the same timeeither of two methods of harvesting tobacco may be used the one most commonly practised is to cut the whole plant when the middle leaves are  ripe ie when the leaves have assumed a lighter shade of green and have thickened so that upon folding a sec tion of the leaf it creases or cracks on the line of folding the stalk is cut near the ground and the plant is carefully laid upon the ground where it is allowed to remain until the leaves have wilted sufficiently to avoid nm ch breaking in handling it is then hung upon a lath four feet long by piercing the stalk near its base with a removable metal  spearhead curingcuring is an important process for much can be done to add to the quality of the tobacco at this time and if the weather is damp and rainy much needs to be done to prevent the tobacco from being ruined tobacco requires from  to  days for the preliminary cure and during this period it needs constant care when the barn is filled with fresh tobacco it is closed tight and if the weather is cool or damp small chareoal fires are built in the barn to warm up the tobacco and wilt it down when the tobaeco has wilted and started to yellow the doors and ventilators are opened to allow the circu lation of air to carry off the moisture if the curing season is a normal one the doors and ventilators are opened every morning and closed at night but if the season is dry the reverse of this action is required especially when this stage of the process is nearly com pleted when the precise degree of cure has been reached the barn is left closed until there comes a damp foggy atmosphere or rain then all of the doors and ventilators are opened letting in the moist air so thatthe leaves can be taken down without crumbling or breakingthen comes the process known as bulk sweating the tobacco is placed in piles is covered with blankets and undergoes a sort of natural fermentation which eliminates all traces of rankness and renders it sweet mellow and palatable this process ollow ing the withering of the leaves while hanging in the barn also changes the colour of the tobacco to the rich shades of brown which are familiar to all cigar smokers it is then care fully sorted and graded and packed either in wooden cases or in bales after being packed it again undergoes still another slight fermentation after which it is taken to the factory ready for conversion into cigarscigarette tobacconow we come to the second general division namely those types of tobaccos used for cigarettes for chewing and pipe mixtures and for export these are found in the tobacco belts of kentucky virginia tennessee mary land and the carolinasthe seed beds are sown in january febru ary or march the bed is surrounded with logs or boards set on edge to a height of six to ten inches to form a coldframe over whichare stretched wires to support the cheese cloth whieh is plaoed over the frame before the plants come up the precautions regard ing watering and hardening the plants prior to transplanting as described for the eigar types are carefully followedprior to transplanting the land is thoroughly tilled by ploughing and harrow ing after which the rows are laid off the pre ferred distanee between rows being ift in kentucky and tennessee the plants are usually set in ehecksthat is they are set ifl apart each waywhile in virginia they are generally spaced ft to f apart in the row transplanting is done mostly by hand fertilizers are applied in the process of pre paring the land for transplantingharvestingwhen ten to  leaves have appeared on the plant the top is broken out so as to force all of the growth into the leaves left on the plant and cause them to grow larger thicker and darker a favourite practice is to pick off and diseard three or four of the bottom leaves and then top the plants so as to leave eight to  leaves on each plantthe plants are generally ready for harvest ing in from  to  days after topping at this stage the leaves will have taken on a light colour and become thick and heavy and small yellow flecks will have appeared especially near the edges of the leaf in har vesting the stalk is first split with a knife from the top down to within a few inches of the bottom in such a way as not to cut or injure the leaves the stalk is then out off near the soil and laid on the munnd to wilt sufficientlyplaced on the end of the lath as a rule six plants are hung on a lath and distributed evenly instead of spearing the stalk it may be hung upon the lath by means of a hook or a nail driven through the lath at a sufficient angle to hold the plant securely six hooks or nails are put at equal distances on the lath the three on one side alternating with those on the opposite side the laths carrying the plants are placed upon a rack and hauled to the curing barn where they are hung in tiers with a space of six to twelve inches between themin the second method of harvesting the leaves are picked from the plant as they ripen the degree of ripeness is not so advaneed as that deseoibed for stalkcut tobacco the proper degree of ripeness is very important for upon this largely depends tbe developmcnt of the desirable qualities of texture body colour elasticity c during the process of curingshlade gronvingthe shadegrowing method is one of the institutions of modern tobacco cultivation and its purpose is to produce tobacco suitable for cigar wrappers the sun shining on the tobacco plants draws the nutrition from the earth and the plant ripens quickly the leavesthe farmer and his family ready to begin the harvest in a north carolinatobacco field cigarette and pipe tobaccos are grown in virginia and carolinahaving a tendency to be heavybodied and not very large to defeat these results and pro duce large thin silky leaves for cigar wrapper purposes the grower sometimes covers his field with a tent of cheesecloth or with a lattice work of lathing which protects the growing tobaeeo from the direct rays of the sun thus the ripening process is slower causing the leaves to grow larger and thinner and less gummyand being thinner and less gummy they are of a lighter colour when finally curedpacking the leavesthe dried leaves being packed into hogsheads m akentucky storeto permit handling without breaking the leaves the plants are then placed astride sticks and hauled to the curing barn in virginia the plants are usualy placed on the sticks before being laid on the ground to wilt the sticks are ft in long and five to eight plants according to their size are placed on each stick the sticks carrying the plants are arranged on the tier poles of the curing barn at intervals of sin to inthe flue method of curing is that most commonly used the agent for curing is dry artificial heat produced by a wood fire in an outside furnace and carried through the barn by means of flues running around three sides of the structure sometimes the heat is sup plied by having heaps of charcoal on the floors underneath the tobacco a thermometer is inside the barn to determine and regulate the degree of heat required at the various stages of the curing process the entire operation requires about  hours of course the object of curing is not so much to dry the leaf as to fix as far as possible the qualities of the leaf as to colour strength elasticity and flavour even the texture may be improved by skilful manipulation in curingwhen the curing is completed the tobacco is assorted into various grades and colours and is strippedmeanilg in this case that the leaves are stripped from the stalkand tied into bundles the bundles are then packed in hogsheads having a capacity ranging from b to b the tobacco is then ready for the market and is disposed of at auction warehouses called  tobacco breaks located
