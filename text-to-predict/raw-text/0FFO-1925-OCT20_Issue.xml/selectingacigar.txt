selecting acigarsafety in wellknownbrandsrimts on lighting andsmokingby f c judgethere is no royal road to the selection of a good cigar a cigar pleasing to the eye may be all the more deeeptive by reason of its appearance the wrapper may have that fine finish that betokens a cigar of outstand ing merit yet the filler may well be such that it is merely a case of another good wrapper spoilt and another smoker disappointed nevertheless although a finelooking wrapper may not every time assure a good cigar it is an important factor in selectionevery manufacturer ha havana whose brand of cigars has obtaied a marked degree of popularity uses a deliberately selected blend of the numerous and varied types of havana tobacco thus securing a definite flavour and aroma various brands of havana cigars have secured popularity in this country by the consistent maintenance of a standard of quality and it is there fore safe to select a cigar of a wellknown brandthe real testapart from wrapper and brand the real test of a cigar is to smoke it experience will prove to a smoker the charaeteristics of a brand that suits the palate and if he be vwise he will remain constant and faithful to the braind of his choice theash of the cigr is some indication of its quality a first grade havana cigar rolled fron onepiece leaves and not from smnal fillings will maintain a firm greyish ash of considerable length before falling it is not wise to hold a cigar to the ear and  crackle  it because it splits the leaf and does not tell the smoker anything except that the cigar is dry or otherwisea light wrapper oes not necessarily denote a mild cigar a dark wrapper may just as easily cover a cigar that is as mild as one can desire the colour markings to be seen on cigar boxes range from claro very light colorado claro light colorado brown to the almost blaek maduro there is an extraordinary liking in this country as well as in other parts of the world for the lightcoloured or claro wrapper the demand for claro colour is one of the reasons for the steady increase in the price of havana cigars in recent years leaf wrapper of true claro colour has reached an almost fabulous price in havana its supply is short and to secure it manufacturers must pay the high figure that the keen competition for its possession entails fortunatelv this craze is showing signs of waning and the smoker is beginning to realize that to appreciate the havana cigar at its best he must smoke the colour beloved by the cuban this un doubted connoisseur in the art of selection makes his choice of a cigar wrapped with a leaf of full brown colorado claro or of the darker shade of the colorado knowing that sweetness of flavour and rich aroma are only to be found in a wrapper that has been nurtured and ripened in the warm rays of the cuban sun in this respect the cuban is typical of the older generations of smokers in this country who before the craze for claro developed called for cigars of dark colours realizing that they represented the finest products of the cuban tobacco fieldsimperfect bujrningwith regard to shape and size the pre dilection of the smoker alone must decide the straight shape cigar has found greater favour in late years than the pointed or torpedo shape the straight shape has a tendency to burn better than its companion pointed type but with ordinary care in smoking the latter will burn equally well and there is little beyond the question of popular fancy to account for this preference the bad burning of a cigar is often due to im perfect curing or to poor quality of the tobacco used in its manufacture bad work manship can also produce a cigar that is imperfect in its burn a cigar unevenly filled that is one that has its filler loose in one place and tight in another will by the uneven draught generated by irregularity burn down one sidethere are a few simple rules on the lighting of a cigar the knowledge of which may add to the smokers enjoyment a discriminating cigar smoker would not use a wax match cigars are extraordinarily sensitive to odoturs and flavours and the inward draught caused by drawing the flame to the end of the cigar would quickly impregnate it with the taste of the wax in a lesser degree the same objection applies to the sulphur of the ordinary safety match a wooden or paper spill is the ideal method of applying a light to a cigar in lighting up the flame should be held about half an inch from the end of the cigar thus the end is not carbonized but the tobacco lights evenly and a fewv very quick draws create a fine red glow then smoke your cigar slowly and evenly many a cigar is spoilt by the neglect of this latter rule the heat generated by quick smoking has the effect of carbonizing the tobacco resulting in a rank and badlyburning smoke draw upon your cigar mildly and regularly and a cool and sweet smoke will add to your enjoyment of it a cigar should not be smoked beyond about fourfifths of its length as all the oils become concentrated in the remaining portion to smoke a fine cigar with ones friends after a good dinner is one of the joys of life let it also be said that there is exquisite pleasure in silence and a good cigar
