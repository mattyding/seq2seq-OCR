brazil bhigh quality cigartobaccoimportant source of supplyfom outr rio de jaweiro correspondentthe cultivation of tobacco in brazil dates from the foundation of the town of bahia by portuguese colonists in the middle of the th century in  a brazilian grower exported tobacco seeds to lisbon these were sown in the garden of jean nicot a prench ambassador who introduced the plant into france where it was called  nico tine  in his honourof recent years export has remained com paratively steady as follows  kilos   kilos   kilos   kilos the chief buyers in  were ger many  kilos holland  kilos argentina  kilos and spain  kilos great britains im port dropped to  kilos as compared with  kilos in  and the united states import to  idlos as compared with  kilos in  on the other hand hollands purchases have shown a steady increasearomatic tobaccobahia produces the best quality of aromatic tobacco it is more or less a cigar type and the total production varies from  to  bales aircured and graded according to length of leaf rio grande do sul the next most inmportant producer  to  bales normally but as many as l  bales under favourable weather conditions grows a leaf bearing a certain resenrblance to burley wheri first cured rio grande tobacco is sweet and mild but owving to subsequent poor handlinig it is apt to aequiire a stron odour and taste it is also aircured but in opensided sheds in xvhich the jeaf naturally loses colour fluecuring is still in the experimental stage mlinas geraes andl coyaz specialize in a dark strong gummy leaf usually transformed by the growers themselves ixto roll or twist fx ported tobacco is almost entirely blahiani leaf in bahia the market is centralized in the capital of the state the larger dealers alloint buying agents on commission in the various growving centres such agents being usuallv local merchants in a position to finanice the smaller fafnenoversea marketsthe chief oveniea markets for bahian tobacco are hamburg breinen buenos aires and in lesser degree havre and milan the nature of rio grandle tobacco is sucli that very little is exported unless by reason of surplhus production or marked advantage in exchange in whiclh case it sometimes happens that a smal percentage may be used as a substitute for other tobaccos in the tiianufac ture of the cheaper grae european cigarettes it does not follow that rio grande tobacco is inferior but merely thit its flavour is niot in favour wvith the european consumer on the other hanid wheni crops are not large and prices well miainitained all rio grande tobacco is easily absorbed by the brazilian cigarette inlustry sales methods are much the same as in bahlia and centre on porto alegre but in rio grande there are a few coopera tive associations of farmers who sell direct to dealers without the intermediary of local purchasing agentsat a conservative estimate there are in brazil some  tobacco factories of which  omploy  or more hands a limited number aro large comparable in point of production to most of the factories of europe or the united states the ehief mantifac turing centres are rio de janeiro so paulo bahia pernambuco and rio grande do sul in the order indicated rio sao paulo and rio grinde are peincipally cigarette manu facturing districts using rio grande leaf and bahia and pernambuco cigar manufac turing centres using baliia leaf even the cigarettes manufactured in the last two districts are made of the darker and stronger cigar tobacco cigars cigarettes and plug or twist of local manufacture represent  per cent of the total consumption the remainder being the import of a limited quantity of english brands and of havana eigars for the oxacting minority in fact the tohacco industry furnishes  per cent of the total sales tax revenue an amount only exceeded by the  per cent furnished by beverages chiefly beersforeign capitalgermany holland and great britain supply the greater part of foreign capital in the industry the trade is hampered by alniost yearly changes of taxation by the federal government and by the imposition by many individual statos of taxes on manufactured tobacco imnported from other states a neasure designed to place local factories in a position of superiority this accounts for the large nuniber of small fabricas and in itself makes for difficulty in adequatesupervision by the revenue authorities ii tue reclera uovernment vetoed inter state discrimination and refrained from experimental changes in taxation the industry would greatly benefit the general outlook however is by no means unfavourable domestic sales are protected by such a high tariff that the producers are guaranteed for what it is worth the whole of the domestic market and large areas are entirely snitable for the cultivation of good quality leaf it therefore seems that the expansion of the industry depends on the gradual introduction of scientific methods of culture technical education improvement in transportation and stability of taxation granted these factors there is no reason why biazil should not become and remain an important source of world supply
