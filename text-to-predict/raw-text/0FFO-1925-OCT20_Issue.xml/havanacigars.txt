havana cigarsthe favoured vueltadistrictby f c judgethe havana cigar may be said to have begun its history in  when columbus landed in cuba he found the native indians to be a happy contented people accustomed to the use of tobacco the crops of which were the subject of special incantations and invoca tions so far as the rest of the world is concerned it was not until  when governmental monopoly restrictions in cuba were removed that the havana cigar became generally knowntobacco is grown in many districts of cuba but there is only one spot in which tobacco suitable for fine cigars can be raised this is the famous vuelta abajo lower valley district in the province of pinar del rio situated about  miles southwest of havana little does the critical smoker realize the difference it would make to cigar smokers if the vuelta abajo district were suddenly wiped off the map nowhere in the world is there a scil like that of vuelta abajo the wihds which sveep across its hills and valeys are tempered by the surrounding aseas and give the land a climate so mild and beneficent that earth and air seem to smile with perpetual delight the tobacco districts in this justly renowned area are about  miles longv and  wide and the heart of the vuelta lies between the small mountain range which fringes the northern shore and the southern coastfinest leafthe finest leaf grown is raised in tbe ections skiited by tlhe guani guanico mountains frequent rains that keep the land well watered and cover it in the overflow season gravitate down the ilpes and carrv with them alluvial deposits giving the soif the finest fertilizer in the vrorld the result is chocolate coloured earth twvo r three feet deep of peculiar richness with a combination of mineral properties that with the stimulation of strong suns contributes to the distinctive and pleasing flavour of the tobacco grown the vruelta abajo leaf on account of its superior quality is very much in demand only a limited supply is available and only the best fac tories are able to obtain it for their brands other factories must therefore make use of the cheaper grades of leaf from other parts of the islandplanters corporations and governments have tried time after time to grow the vuelta leaf in other lands and climes the seeds have been sown in the philippines india turlkey sumatra south africa the rich florita and in every possible parit of the world outside that wonderful section of the province of pinar del rio but the plants that have sprung from these seeds were merely changelings withi little or no resemblance to the unique quality of the parent stocka work of artthe limate of cuba is an important factor in the operation of rolling a cigar as the moist atmosphere keeps the tobacco pliant and easy to handle in the hands of that past master of his artthe cuban cigarmaker who takes strip after strip of filler in the palm of his hand until by sense of touch aloai he knows he has the requisite quantity hle gives these strips a few sharp rolls on his hardwood board covers these with the wrapper in a few more rolls finishes off the tip with a minute touch of gum cuts the end off with a knife and proceeds to repeat the process there is practically no variation in the weight size and shape of the resulting cigars as a cigarmaker the cuban is first and last an artist to see how lovingly he handles the cigars of his creation is to realize that he has put his very soul into the making of it while the men work they are entertained by a  reader who sitting on a raised plat form reads to them the news of the day or the latest novel when the havana cigar has been made it passes to the inspector who detects the slightest variation in the rworkmanship the keen judgment of these inspectors is hereditary their fathers and grandfathers were inspectors they are hypercritical judges and their selection is always infalliblecare in storagethe great cuban manufacturers send their cigars from havana in perfect order but the fruits of their care are fre nently destroyed by indifferent dealers in england it is essential that proper care and storage be given to the cigars until they ale ready to be smnoked they will absorb moisture hke a sponge and take up any impure air and smell near which they may be placed thus spoiling th ir characteristic aroma and flavour if choice cigars are subjected to sudden heat the tobacco will quickly throw off its natural moist ure and with it also its character its flavour and its aroma the cigar is not changed in appearance but it is now a flavourless stick compared to what it was it follows from this that complaints are sometimes made of the quality of a brand when the fault is not really with the brand but with a dealer who has not kept the cigars in a suitable plaeit is generally assumed that the dark coloured cigar is a strong one but this is not necessarily the case the wrapper determines the colour the filler or inside of the cigar which is  per cent of its weight determines its character both dark and light wrappers may be strong and bitter if they have not been thoroughly cured cigars should be kept in a dry wellventilated room out of draughts at a temperature of ï¿½ fahr or  fahr they will then reach and remain in perfect condition finally havana cigars should be smoked slowly or the combustion will be imperfect and the delicate aroma lost
