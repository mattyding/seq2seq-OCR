receive good wagesfinallv a very considerable proportion of the tobacco supplied to the state factories fivethirteenthsis produeed on national soil the cultivation of tobaeco brings to french agriculturists a sum of about f a vear and moreover enables them to use profitably many hours which otherwise would remain unemployed it is also to be noted that tobaec forms an excellent rotation cropthem greater vigour and development this work is generally done by women and ehildren who pinch off the tops of the stems with finger and thumb about eight to  leaves are left on the plant according to the amount of nieotine which it is intended that the plant should contain the more leaves that are left the finer and lighter they will be it is necessary however to fight incessantly against the enemies of the plants sach as worms insects eaterpillars and parasitic mnaladiesthe planter thus must give constant care to the plants without even the assurance that inclemency of the

towards the point this is the moment to seizethe leav es presenting these charaeteristics are ripehar vestmtowards evening in the golden ravs of the setting september sun the garnerers men and women alike pass down the lines of plants and gather these ripe leaves one by one then in the twilight wagons drawrn by bulloeks convey the generous harvest of green leaves to the barn or to the drying sheds hung on strings or canes the leaves remain for one or two months sheltered in wellventilated sheds where they lose a part of their moisture and turn from green to brown then the leaves are ranged in heaps and towards the month of december the planter and his assistants untie the bunches and sort them according to the lengths indi cated by the monopoly administrationheaps of the same class are then collected in bundles of  or  and bound together with a leaf these bundles are called  man oques finally during december or janii ary the tobaceo is made into bales and de livered to the storerooms of the rlgie where they are valued by a commission and arice ifixed according to the rules laid down by the administration in the store rooms the tobacco is subjected to new and important manipulations the leaves must lose about another  per cent of their weight for this purpose they are gathered together in large masses fermentation takes place accompanied by an increase in temperature thus tho aroma is developed and theonly this most popular of french tobaccos in goldtipped cigarettes it is true this tobacco peculiar to france is mainly com posed per centof leaves gathered on national soil or in algeria a proportion of from  to  per cent of american tobacco kientucky dark firecured gives it its characteristic aroma other exotic tobaccos which are only used for filling purposes come from the philippines para guay san domingo colombia java and burma the experiments which are being carried on in the rich soils of the french colonies are more and more supplementing the purchases from abroadthe process of manufacture is simple but delicate it consists of the moistening of the tobacco with water containing a small quantity of salt to prevent fermentation the blending of the different grades of leaf the cutting of the leaves into strips of eight tenths of a millimetre and lastly roasting this final operation is peeuliar to french tobacco the object is to give the tobacco a certain flavour of the oven which however must not be exaggerated this flavour is pleasing to the taste of the consumer it is produced by passing the tobacco as it falls from the cutting machine rapidlv through a revolving cylinder heated by a coke fire and through which passes a stream of warm air thus is maintained a temperature of from deg to  lodeg centigrade after being dried in rotating machines in a current of cold air the tobacco is stacked in masses of  kilogrammes where it acquires its definite aromathe tobacco is made into packets or into cigarettes by machinery besides the scaferlati ordinaire the monopoly pro duces a small quantity of  scaferlati superieur which has a similar eompositioa but for which is selected the finest qualities

a very important branch of the agricultural activity of the countrywith an annual production of about  million kilogrammes the french harvest alone represents about oneeighth of the total produc tion of tobacco in europe the production of tobacco in france is exceeded in europe only by that of russia and bulgaria and from the point of viem of quantity it ranks with that of germany and greece it must be admitted that french tobaccos have not those aromatic qualities which the plant only acquires in the warmest climates and in the most favourable soil we are evidently a long way from pro ducing on french soil tobaccos of the quali ties comparable to those which have made the reputation of havana for cigar tobacco and of roumnelia for cigarette tobaccos never theless the tobaccos of france taken to gether are well developed burn well are not too charged with nicotine and have an agreeable aroma which makes appreciated not merely by frenchmen themselves but also by a very large number of foreigners the celebrated tobacco known as  caporal which contains about  per cent of home grown leafluxuriant valleysthirtytwo departments with a total of  planters are authorized to grow tobacco large quantities are grown in the rich valleys of the basin of the garonne the departments of lotetgaronne of the dordogne of gironde and of lot the soutltwest region in the warm and luxuriant valleys which are sheltered under the last escarpments of the alps together with the departments of the savoie the haute savoie the isere and the department of the drme also produce large quantities of tobacco the strongest tobaccos that is to say the tobaccos most rich in nicotine and therefore less appropriate for smoking are cultivated in considerable quantities in the departments of the nord the pasdecalais and the lotthe cultivation of tobacco necessitates meticulous care particularly at the beginning of its growtli owing to the fragility of the young plant the seeds cannot be sown on the open land they must be sown upon small and specially prepared plots under tglass or oiled paper wvhen the young plants have reached a certain degree of vigour they are taken to the open fields for transplantation the seeds are sown in france between march  and april  although in someof the departments in the south they emn be aewn about a month earlier meantime the fields destined to receive the youngplants are thrice tilled the first plouglig takes place in the winter the second in the springtime and the third before the trans plantation with the first two tillings the soil is manured in most of the regions of france it is between may  ancd june  that fhe young plants are taken from the seed beds carefully protected against the weather and insects they have now attained a height of between  and  centimetres and are sufficiently strong to be transplanted in the open fields the trans plantation demands the greatest care to avoid injury to the still fragile roots and to the young leaves the roots must be given the necessary supply of water and the plants must be protected from too fierce a heat from the sun the plants are placed in uniform rows at regalar distances the number of plants per hectare varies according to the reghn and the quality of the tobacco which it is desirhd to obtainbetween  and  planits to the hectare for light tobaecos ie tobaccos which contain little nicotine and between  and  plants for the heavy tobaccosthat is to say those charged with alkaloidcultivationduring their growth the tobacco plants demand incessant care weeds must be destroyed and the soil cultivated the stems must be earthed up as they grow and the lower leaves removed an important operation wich is neoessary about two montls after the platiting is the removal of the extremity ofthe stem together with the flower seed as a consequeice of this operation the sap flows to the leavcs aid giveshumidity of the leaves is reduced to the required limit after several successive fermentations the tobacco is in perfect condition for dispatch to the factories the leaves are then pressed into bales of about a cubic metre and sent to the factories from eight to  months after being gatheredall the operations of cultivation and of manipulation in the store rooms are con ducted under the supervision of a special corps of technicians from the ministry of finance whose duty it is to prevent fraud and also to give the necessary directions to the planter the french monopoly possesses on national territory including alsace and lorraine twenty tobacco factories employ ing from  to  workmen and workwomen who work under the supervision of  foremen and about  engineers scaferlatithe principal product of the factories is the tobacco known as  scaferlati for consumption in pipes or for cigarettes the rgie produces about  kilograames of seaferlati tobacco which accounts for about fourfifths of the total weight of the tobacco manufactured about ninetenths of this quantity of scaferlati is the celebrated csporal ordinaire which is now sold to the enstumer in packets of  grammes at lliof thi is the tobacco of the workman and the peasant but it is also that of a large number of frenchmen of the middle class and even of the rich for this tobaceo has a fresh and agreeable perfume a little strong perhaps but which does not affect the throat the great writer flaubert did not disdain to smoke pipe after pipe of  caporal  while working on his manuscripts and some of the riehest hankers of paris smokergie itself also makes various cigarettes of light tobaccos composed entirely of tobacco of the very best quality from the near east every effort is made in the choice of the yellow leaves and in the important opera tion of blending to obtain without the addition of any foreign ingredient tobaccos of tlle finest taste and aromatic flavour another notable success has been obtained by the production of cigarettes composed of virginia tobacco the taste for whioh was acquired in france from the british and american allies during the warcigars and cigarettesthe french monopoly also manufactures with aromatic tobaccos from havana and brazil cigars of excellent quality and cigarillos a cigarette with a tobacco leaf for its outer covering the  picarduro  is a cheap cigar having native tobacco as its base which has achieved wide popularitv since its introduction by the director general bf the monopoly m blondeaux while he was the direetor of the manifactorv at havre some of these cicars both in form and in quality recail the best products of the tropics and cost a great deal less in price aul the cigars and  cigarillos  of the freneh rigie havre for their outer wrapping a tobacco leaf from the dutch indies java or sumatra for several vears past however the enterprise begum by germans in the cameroons which is now placed under a french mandate has been continued and has been supplying the regie with tobaccos having the same quality and value as that of sumatra tobaeeo in tobacco cultivation there is a very pro mising future for this colonythe monopolv also makes about  kllogrammes of snuff still much appreciated by a faithful public and  kilo granmes of chewing tobacco twisted into rolls of which the consumption is sensibly diminishin year by year the ragie also offers to it customers a  denieotized  tobacco sold under the namne of  caporal doux  a virginia tobacco for pipes a special smoking tobacco made witlh the leave of algerian tobacco csuch is the french tobaeco monopoly it had its onrgin in a royal ordinance of  it passed through various vicissitudes iuntil in  napoleon i established the reyine which exists today wellinformed and impartial minds in france are persuaded that the monopoly system is not only the best for the country but enables the state to derive the largest resources from the tobacco industry under the active and verv able direction of m blondeaux who became dizecteurlnal des manufactures oni janiarv  last and under the energetic guidance of m caillaux the minister for finaxiee the industrial and commereial methods of the french rogie are being brought to a state of perfection to the great advantage of the finances of the counitry and also to the satisfaction not alone of the smokers of the country but also of all those foreign visitors who appreciate the excellenco of the
