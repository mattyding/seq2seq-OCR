the art of blendingctimate and tasteby t constantinidesart is essentiauy a thing of the senses to be able to select from a mixed and varied array of tobaccos therefore so much of this and so much of that to mix them together and often without prior experiment to suc ceed in exactly producing the required effect in smoking is unquestionably an art calling for inborn talent and abilityblending for the connoisseur however is a comparatively easy matter compared with the work of satisfying the main body of smokers who may ha pp en to be living simultaneously in a dozen different climes what guidance for example is to be found in the fact that britain and china share a common socalled  preference  for the virginia type of cigarette on the face of it it would appear that climatic conditions play no part whatever in the determination of taste yet if there is one factor more than another which does account for taste it is essentially that of atmo spheric conditions and the answer to this particular problem of course is that the mild and bright virginias as smoked in colder britain bear little if any relation to the more pronouncedly flavoured  virginias as produced for and smoked in china and what again is to be deduced from the fact that while america ships annually to britain some b of virginia tobacco her own cigarette consunmption consists very largely of the superior and more expensive tobaccos of the near easta preference incidentally which in her affluence she shares with impoverished continental europe turkish and virginianapart from the basic fact that warmer climates demand definitely more pronounced degrees of aroma flavour and strength there exist all manner of other considerations monetary exchange values more specifically adapted and generally more economically situated sources of supply and the like which go to show that so far as the mass produced everymans everyday  smoke  is concerned any real or fundamental pre ference as between virginia and oriental does not existonly when catering for the discriminating smoker does the blender encounter any decided preference which is for the essen tially unstandardized tobaccos of the near east for greek and turkish tobaccos whose endlessly varing virtues were largely discovered by the british army officer at the time of the crimean war still maintain a position of unassailable superiority and distinction to which no blending skill in the world could possibly raise the highly stan dardized products of america
