tobacco and wine taste after tastejust gradationsfrom a corespondyestwhether the spread of the habit of smoking led to the decline of the habit of wine drink ing or whether as men learned to be more abstemious at table and after it tobacco began to take its place as a substitute for alcohol may be a debatable point but it is a fact nevertheless that tobacco and wine have never been on terms of easy friendshiptobacco after beer and beer after hard labourwhat can be better t but tobacco not after but during wine is another thingtypes of japanese pipes in their elaborately carved cases these arecarried hung from the girdleentirely and one on which connoisseurs of wine are bound to frown and for this simple reason the wine drinkers palate is a highly specialized organas witness all the subtle epithets which a wine merchants catalogue will displayand the goodness of wine like the goodness of anything else is by nature unmixed and so not susceptible of mixture unless for the worse this is an indisputable philosophic doctrine strictly speaking there fore tobacco must not be present when wine or at any rate good wine is on the board its place is elsewhere and there should be some ceremony to mark the transition from one good element to another an intermediary may be necessary before the two can be reconciled if so there is fortunately one ready enough as a rule to handcoffeethe words  gentlemen may now smoke when good wine is on and not merely the conventional glass for formal brandishing at subsequent toasts may have oiten to be interpreted as  gentlemen had better not begin to smoke yet or  gentlemen are advised for their own sakes not to light up until they have had their coffeeport and a good cigarsurely though everyone probably knows of examples to the contrary no one can do justice to good port or to a good cigar if he does not keep them apart  in these temperate days too the period of waiting will seldom be long and what smoker will not relish his tobacco all the more for having had for a few moments to wait for it  in the interests of a reputa tion for discrimination if for no higher reason let those who dine insist on the proper pro cession of the courses taste after taste upheld with kindliest change as milton says and he it may be remembered was accustomed to a pipe after supper and took his tobacco with what the austerest smokers will sometimes declare to be its only tolerable liquid concomitantplain waterbut ceremonial and stately winedrinking has become so much an affair of the past that it is no wonder that diners light up at the first intimation from the chairman that they may the wine they drink is negligible except as a symbol only in a few places is the old ritual of the postprandial glass main tained there are still a few colleges and similar foundations where it is kept up and happy is he who is admitted to share that almost vanished ghmpse of society as it was in the pretobacco age dinner in hall wine and dessert in a more cosy chamber then coffee in another and lastly the full liberty of armchairs and settees in a fourth with unrestrained tobacco men who observe these just gradations must be true epicures they cannot fail to be right in their treatment of the pleasurable to them almost alone of mortalsi shallbe entrusted the fluial arbitra ment on all things good and sweet the rest of humanity must live up to the highest standard it can attain but it can never reach these godlike heights as for those unhappy wretches who find it necessary to srnoke between courses or during them they shall go down to the lowest limbo of the tasteless as knowing nothing either of viands or of beverages or of tobacco
