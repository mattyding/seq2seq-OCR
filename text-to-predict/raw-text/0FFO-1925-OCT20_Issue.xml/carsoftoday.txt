cars of today hp rollsroyceby oub motorin cowuwopdomntthe latest  hp rollsroyce with four speeds and six brakes is undoubtedly a better car than the previous one which however can still be had when an owner does not wish to spend � more on the modern braking systemthis rollsroyce is not designed for great speed but its running is highly refined the acceleration is swift and sure the controls are admirably convenient and effective and above all the car is silent herein lies its greatest merit in my opinion traveling on top up to about  miles an hour one hears only the tires the indirect gears are commendably quiet and even at  on second and over  on third there is the least possible hum while the eine makes no sort of complaint up to these three rates the balance of engine and transmission is good and one travels with ease and without mechanical vibrations so efficient are the suspension the steering and the fourwheel brakes and so wiling is the engine that the car wiul make a high average over a long journey without undue fatipue to man or machine the general runnmng is sweeton the trial the engine showed no sign of overheating and one can start on the level on third with smoothneas and but a little clutch slip the spark is controlled auto maticaly within limitsextremes can be regu lated by a hand lever on the top of the steering columnand the tichness of the mixture can be altered from the instrument board the change speed is of the visible gate type with a safety catch for reverseplaced on the off side and changing is delightful so quietly and easily is it done the steering by worm and nutis light and has quite a satisfactory lock but it is not free from shake on a rough road it is difficult i know to get absolute steadiness with this pattern of steering especially if a selfcentring action is approved of nevertheless au rollsroyce steering would be improved to my thinking were greater steadnuss obtainedthe hand brakeswvorked by an offside leverwere useful the pedal brakes on smooth surface produced an amply strong pro gressive decelerati n during the journey to high wycombe i noticed that with severe and unsympatbetic pedal pressure the car was apt to pull a trfle to the near side and more so on a rough surface it is my rule in all trial reports to review the particular car submitted to nie the defect in the braking of the  hp rollsroyce must therefore be mentioned though the fault was hardly noticeable at the end of the run and was probably due to a difference in frictional surfaces more than to lack of adjustments no amount of compensation wil balauce the effart af two brakes it one has temporarily got some foreign substance such as water from washing serving as an insulator the chassis suspension is good although there was a little wheelbouncing on rough surface possibly the tires were a trifle hard the fourseated touring bodyby barkerwas most comfortable there are four doors and in spite of the offsided brake gear and dipping head lamp levers tie drivers door way is quite usable the arrangement of the side curtains of the hood is not sufficiently up to datewith three persons in the car dashwood elld average i in  was rushed on top with a minimum speed of  mph at this late although under heavy load the engine was perfectly happy the torque is good and smooth even under trying conditions and the engine loses none of its sweetness when pressed in this way with a standing start on third at the foot the crest was passed at  the road surface was dry but rough on a short open stretch with an adverse gradient the speedometer worked up to  the gear ratios are    and  to  the wheel base and track measure lft in and ft sinthe latter being an increase of in ver that of the previous modeland the tires are high pressure of  by iin the bore and stroke of the sixcylinder engine are mm and lubrication and quietnessthe watercooling is by a honeycomb radiator held to the crossmember a fan for the belt of which there is a hand adjuster and a geardriven pump this last unit must be removed if the gland is to be repacked a tap and pipeare supplied for draining the valves are overhead and are worked by push rods as so much quietness is obtained ido not object in this case tosingle valve springs the lubrication is well carried out and no doubt is largely answerable for the quiet running clearance is effected without trouble below at the foot of each push rod timing is by helical gear and on the near side are the tandemdriven generator and magneto there are two ignitions with a common distributor and one set of sparking plugs to change fromu battery to magneto ignition merely entails the withdrawal of a plug terminal and the insertion of another and the fingerand thumb connexion of the magneto shaft for this last is not driven when the magneto is not being usedthe distributor and coil are to hand though the latter by its position gets rather warn on the off side also is the carburettor which is accessible it is fed from a vacuum tank on the dash the rear tank has a filler to one sidebut no gauzeand a gauge the oil filer has no strainer and the filter is in the bottom of the sump oil drainage involves crawling under the car engine singleplate dry clutch and fourspeed gearbox are assembled as a unit held to the frame at three points there are vibration dampers either side of the crank case the clutch bearings cal for hand lubrication the inspection plate might have winged nuts a speedometer drive is taken from the gearbox and there are level fllers on the box and rear axle case in the lastnamed the drive is by spiral bevel and torque is taken by the springs half eliptical suspension underslung at the rear is used the front springs are shackled in front and anchored at the back endsno bad plan the front brakes are worked by a servo driven from the gearbox and the rear of the four wheel brakes are servoassisted these can be used with the car stationary the system is so arranged that the back brakes are given a defnite and permanent lead all shoes expand in enclosed drums adjustment can be effected on the primary rods in the cases of the rear brakes and individually in that of the forward brakes all means of regulation could be made more handy the anchorage for the front operating arms is to the axle and the general construction is neat cables are used throughout for brake application i suggest the provision of guides for the rear cablesthe equipment includes a radiator shutter controllable from the instrument board where there is a thermometer here too is a starting carburettor regulator shook absorbers are supplied as standardthe new  hp rollsroyce engine has vitality courage and a pleasing disposition the chassis costs � plus � for the four wheel brakes the complete touring car as tested �an enlarged edition of cars of today containing over s reviews and  the art of driving are published by the times publishing company at s and ls respectively
