souttern rhodesiaflourisrhing tobaccoindustrysbipments to englandfrom a rhodesian correspondenttobacco has been grown in southern rhodesia for many years it is a branch of farming which is rapidly developing into the leading agricultural industry in the past pro duction was largely limited to the require ments of south african manufacturers but anoverseas market is now being created and the culture of the crop is extending rapidlythe natural conditions of the colony are eminently suitable for tobacco growing the climate soil transport and labour conditions are all conducive to the production of this crop the rainfall varies from in per annum in the western section of the colony to in in the eastern districts the rains begin in november and cease in april it may be said therefore that the rainy season com prises the summer or growing months dur ing that period the temperature is high enough to promote vigorous growth of plants without being oppressive to the white man in most tobaccoproducing countries the growing season is much shorter transplanting and harvesting have to be hasteud and the possibility of damage by frost during the later stages of growth becomes a source of con siderable anxiety in southern rhodesia there is no risk of frost during a period of more than six months and there is therefore ample time for cultivation and harvesting the various operations can in consequence be extended and the farmer is able to utilize his native labour to the best advantagesoil timber and watertobacco thrives best in sandy and light clay loam soils in fact practically the whole of the tobacco grown in the world is produced from soils of these types the geological formatiqns of southern rhodesia are such that more than  per cent of the soils of the colony are sandy or light clay loam there are therefore vast areas of land suitable for the production of this important crop besides soil and climate timber and water are of prime importance in connexion with tobacco growing timber is required for building purposes and as fuel for curing while a permanent water supply is necessary forrhodesiaa grading and baling shed on a rhodesian tobacco plantationthe growing seedlings before they are trans planted inito the fields southern ithodesia is both aufficiently well watered and wvell tirpred to meet the necessary requirements of a large tobacco industryboth the turkish and virginia types of tobaccos are grown in southern rhodesia and both yield profitable retumns when the crop is properly handled generally speaking the western section of the country matabeleland is more suitable for the production of turkish tobacco than the eastern part mashonaland but on the other hand in the latter area natural conditions are more suitable for the production of virginia varietiesmost of the virginia tobacco is fluecured for the production of bright leaf which is used for the manufacture of cigarettes and high grade pipe mixtures a certain aniount is however firecured to obtain dark heavy tobacco to be used for the manufacture of shag and for similar purposes both light and dark types as well as the turkish find a ready sale in fact the demand is increas ing more rapidly than the productioncooperative organizationthe tobacco growers of the colony are well organized for the preparation of the crop for market and the sale of their product the tobacco wvarehouse and export company limited at salisbury the capital town main tains a wiellequipped warehouse and retains a staff of trained men to handle each branch of the business the company undertakes the grading conditionpacking and sale of tobacco and its work leaves little to be desired the company is of limited liability all shares being held by tobacco growers and its operations are conducted on business lines more than  per cent of the tobacco growvers of southerni rhodesia are members of the company many of the lareer growers al thougli members of the war house company have their owvi accommodaiion for grading conditioning and packing their tobacco which is marketed through the organization it can therefore be said that in usouthern rhodesia there is a cooperative organization capable of looking after the interests of the tobacco growersthe quality of the tobacco grown in tihe colonv is excellent the bright fluecured and dark firecured leaf is recognized by the trade as the best obtainable substitute for these types of tobacco from anierica the turkish tobacco produced in the colony while sonmewvhat lacking in flavour and aroma is much sought after for cigarette purposessouthern rhodesian tobacco is now beng regularly slipped to england where it finds a ready demiand at remunerative prices in fact the prices obtained in great britain after deducting shipping charges have averaged higher than those prevailing locally farmers are therefore increasing production with the certainty of a profitable market so long as they maintaiin the quality of their productimperial preferencethe market for colonial tobaccos rhodesian and other growths is undoubtedly due to the empire preference policy of his majestys covernment the grant of a pre ference of onesixth of the prevailing rate of duty on empiregrown tobacco did much to stimulate production by colonial planters and the use of their product by british manufac turers and consumers now that the prefer ence has been increased production will rapidly extend and greater quantities of colonial leaf wvill be marketed in britain to the benefit of the empire as a wholein southern rhodesia the government is alive to the importance of the imperial pre ference and the tremendous beneficial effect it will have in the development of the latent resources of the colony there are vast areas of cheap undeveloped land suitable for the cultivation of tobacco and encouragement for the growing of this crop is being given by the government of the colony a tobacco ex perimental farm has been established for research work and a training school is being started in connexion with this farm addi tional tobacco experts have been obtained from virginia these men will visit farms to give practical advice to tobacco growersa bright futurethere is undoubtedly a bright future for the tobacco industry in southlerni rhodesia farmers are showing their confidence in the future of tobacco growing by increasing their production and companies are being formed for extensive development it is expected that the outpult of cured tobacco for the coming season will be double that of the previous year and as new settlers and fresh capital are coming into the country the production there after will increase annually until southerni rhodesia may ultimately send more tobacco to the british market than any other colony in the empireto summarize southern rhodesia offers the following advantages for tobacco grow ingl cheap suitable soil  suitable climate no irrigation required  good supply of timber and water  inexpensive and adequate labour  organized market ing facilities  an assured market for the product  good health and social con ditions no other colony of the empire can offer similar advantagesinquiries regarding settlement in southern rhodesia should be addressed to the secre tary office of eigh commissioner crovn house aldwych wc the official in charge of the
