advised after a careful consideration by counsel of tho highest authoritv that the provisionsof the h section of thepeorliw amend ment act combined with tho definition of the term  officer in the th section authorized the aipointment of collectors by the guardians under the orders of the poor law commisni jieners in lasteater terra however one of the orera of the com missioners autiorizing a

collection of the rates was not ono of the purposes of the poor law amend ment actin consequence of this decision we thought it our duty to inform every beard of guardians to wbich such an order had been issued of our intention to  revoke the order at the ear liest convenient tirae and we further requeted their an swers to the three following questions   whether any inconvenience and if so of what nature and amount would be incurred in your union by the imamedi lte revecation of the order   the earliest time at which tho order can be revoked without serious inconvecience i  whather any
