london friday april  a letter in this days times bearing the signature of  an old volunteer deserves to be read with at tentionthe writer though a landsman appears to be atruek as indeed every englishman possessed of his proper senses and within sight of any of our unfor tunate dockyards must feel himself by the deserted and miserable condition of those former depositories of the national power of england reduced now not so much to shadows of what they once were as to be silent tonbs of what only a single generation back was life and energy and grandeurit is melancholy to see it put on record as our correspordent represents that  in portsmouth har bour a ship with her masts up the national flag flying and her watch set would appear to be a phantom of other daysit is said to be sure that more hands than hereto fore have been latterly employed in the shipwright and other work subservient to the materiel of the navy and we ate all aware that an additional grant for the purpose was made by the house of commons in the naval estimates recently votedhut wnere is it asserted that the hands thus tardily hired into the dockyard service have suc ceeded in getting one threedecker into actual fitness for sea suppose an immediate call upon great britain for her fleet by a sudden freak of any foreign powcr how many ships of the line could she send out of harbour within a week a month or even within three months from the present day comprehending the best portion of the summer sea son could she complete the armament of  lineofbattle ships or of  or a squadron of a dozen sail judging by the rate of lord mlxmros past preparations his lordship and his clearheaded brother sir chrles ana might well be defied to equip for service the pitifal number of half a dozen gogun thips before the st of au gust the carpentees work might be finished and the copper sheathing possibly the masrs set up and the standing rigging but would a single yard of canvass be over head and above all would so much of a ships company be on bhard any one of those vessels as might enable her to weigh anachor and get to the westward of st helensthe difficulty of au others to be most deplored or dreaded is that of procuring seamen for hurn a ruts ships there has never been a period at which ueful men were so ingecessible as dn ring the last six er eight years and we shouli be ineiined to look upon this evil with despair as one altog ether past retrieving if it could not be traeed to spemsific causes aud to a system of mismanagement suscep ti ble of prompt correctionwith regard to the class of warrant and petty officers a hardship in their condition which has reacted grievously on the naval service for many years past is not now for the first time bfoldghlunder public notice we have observed on former occasions what pains had been taken to banish from the navy the very best and paost valuable portion of its crews by with holding from the entire body of warraut and petty officeur any part of the pensions whipih they had earned by faithful irreproachable and longcon tinued service so long as they should serve on board a man of war be it ever so many years after that period at whicil the pension had been rightfilly theirs and from which time forward they would actually have been entitled to demand and recover it ty the simplo mealsure of quiting the royal servicefor instance by this as we consider it most im politic regulation a and  btwa petty officer who might have served some  years on board a man of war fighting bravely in numerous en gagemonlts and evincing traits of scill courage and high character which in the eyes of all the world but loid lrxbouiuas would establisi strong claims to their countryl gratitude and pnunificence these wellirained na

beidg in theprime of life and vigour of his faculties he beeomesiater of a merchantman at  per sdam pocket i ing hs peusion besides it is plain that the y has lost a prime seanlan and that the maerclant ï¿½ervice has acquirea onebut what happens to  b an individual of eaual merits and of the likh descrintion  heis no less equitably entitled to his pension whi thersoever he may go or to whatever mode of life he may betake himself but instead of entering the merchant service he loves that of the manof way in which his youth has been spent aad wherein he has obtained with the knowledge and reputation the tastes habits and professional pride of a thorough bred manofwar seaman his pausion is the royal navy ho is reluctant to leave the description of officers under whom he has served and of sailors to whom he has taught their disciplinehis messmates and the friends aad companions of his daysand what is his reward for this attachment to hun majestys service l why he is told that if he volunteers to remain on board a manofwar he must be satisfied to receive no more than the mere pay to which he was rated that he is not to touch a single shilling of pensiona so long as he chooses to remain on thc deck of a kings ship but that unless he breaks away from the service altogether his past bravery fatigues and sufferings shall go for nothing and he shall not enjoy a particle of comfort beyond that with which he begannow is this justice or economy or common sense unly mmnd the folly of itthe party alluded to we set out with taking for granted is a seaman of long experience and tried fidelity and excellence the very man beyond all others whom it is most desirable to retain in the pub lie service if he gets his pension together with his pay while serving on board a manofwar the state is no loser even in a pecuniary sense and in every other sense an unquestionable gainer by the bargain she is no loser in point of pounds shillings and pence because if the same pensioner quits his ship and adopts any other course of life he still receives his pension though in a colony or a foreign country while some other person who succeeds him in the manofwar pockets the same pay that he did the only difference in the latter case is that the exact same sum of public money is divided be tween two parties one of whom does nothing in rcturn for it instead of going to a single party of whose valuable qualifications the growth of many years experience the state has the exclusive benefit it ought to be strenuoisly enforced upon the admi ralty that such a rule as that now described should be forthwith rescindedbut respecting the manifest slowness with which our line ofbattle ships have been recently manned for foreign service we have reason to know that the minds of many experienced and able officers have been turned to that important subject in the hope of devising on behalf of the public interest some sen sible palliation of the evil if not the means of en tirely removing ita little pamphlet written long since by sir tho stas cochraneb and not published but circulated pri vately appears to us to contain some admirable observations on this point so vital to the navy it is entitled a proposal for the more efficient manning of her majestys fleet in  a letter to lord mxlville k tthe letter though brief for the form which it as sumes viz that of a pamphlet is nevertheless just at present inconveniently bulky for a newspaper extract we shall therefore state that the matters hiefly insisted on by the gaullant author relatively to the existing arrangements of the service arethat the short period during which each manofwar is left in commission namely three years deprives the countryof her services as an efficient ship during too large a proportion of thatperiod inasmnul as a man ofwar seldom arrives at a thorough state of efficiency in discipline and practice before the lapse of eighteen months from the day on which she has been commissioned whioh state of formidable complete ness and usefulness continues for a twelvemonth or a little more when the prospect of paying off comes in view and their discipline gan exercise c begin to relax and if at home the ship is paid off at the end of three years and all belong ing to her dispersedrecommission this ship the next day and she is per fectly a now creation and the same routine to be repetadal ready stated to your lordship the men who were lately in her bave no more inducement to retura to that ship than ary otheras ske is bat the shell they fornerly inhabited  and although a crew may be collected all of men lately serving in a manofwar yet you will have the same complaint f rom the present as from her former captain as to their inefficiency and want of union and the same discontent will for an equal period exist and the sbip be in a similar state of inefficiency for a similar length of timei have always considered that a peace establishment was as much a preliminary preparation for war as for any other sarvice that consequently your ships thus employed should be manned with pieked men and that they should be in that state of training and efficiency that eaoh ship on a rupture taking place could turn over one watch to form the ground work of another vessel to be fitted out to accomplish this muchdesired end allow me to suggest to your lordship the following planthat when a ship is commissioned she should never be entirely paid offthat if the ship herself become uniservice able that the whole be transferred to anothor of equal size let the captain and officera be appointed for the period they are now kept in employment and the men be entered for a perioe not under five years and as much longer as they please and instead of paying off altogether the captain officers and men be discharged respectiyely as their period of service expires and that if the ship be employed on a foreign statien thoemen whose time is up and who wish their discharge to be sent home in the first manofwar or allowed to find their ewn way the advantage to be derived from this plan i conceive to be the followingfirst that as before mentioned at the end of  snontls the ships company have become knovn and attached to each etherthey have got over the drudgery and annoyance of fitting outof exercising in all its various branchesand have only to keop tho sbip in the state she is then in there is no general looking forward to dis ecuarge in a frigate of a complement of  after the firs four years the numbsr to be disohargew will be about three per month sopposing a ship is out five months and raturnluag into port discharges men these me n instead of going on shore in a herd with  or  others without a home or qne place more than another of which to make cheice each encouraging the other in every species of digsi patiorn and vagraney they are landed with the knaowledge that they have left a home where they might have retuain el and continuutd in the enjoyment of every cemfort thoy havo ne multitudi to keep them in countenance in their de bancheries and the want of old associates seon makes them tired of their present life and cast an eye to

her very rnpopular if  out of the  do not return or ifbefore quitting her they do net give in their names to return again after their cruise is ont it must be quite clear to your lordship than any san alould ratber retura to a oamfortable wellregulated mess f old acquaintances and the drudgery of equippitig over thasi go whero he vrould meet none but strange faces and all thl vexation of first

overturn a system that has been pursued with suo eeu  m whila la tw hf aa   a ahibly falls into these elready adopted and neither officers nor crew wil feel that change which they inevitably must do in woming a newlyoommnhioned shipwe hold that the foregoing extract contains many very valuable as well as highly interesting observa tions and that by the expedient of a prolonged perioa of commission for each ship or in liea of that a prolonged service and gradual aid partial instead of simultaneous and total discharge of the crew the very worst and most discouraging circum stances attending the present administration of the navy and relatively to the personnel of the service would be skilfully and effectually mitigatedsome hints on the frequency of desertion in newly commissioned ships which arises principally from the want of comfort and strangeness of the men to each others faces and charaoters we shall pro bably notice on another occasion only adding at present what is stated by sir tnomas cocomnz viz that some of the oldest and most distinguished officers in the service as sir guotge martin sir byam majtirn and especially sir gxonog cocxnurnu have been consulted by the gallant author as to the principles and probable working of his plan and have one and all declared to him their warmest approba tion and concurrence but lord minto and we fear his bright counsellor sir caknlzs adam are not men of a very teachable order
