aerostationpolytrchnic institutionfrom a corresdondentthe numerous objects of attraction vrhich are daily exhi bited at this institution have received an additioa of a novel and gratifying character of which mr ciarles greens im provement in the management of a balloon forms the sab ject the various experiments made by this celebrated aero naut are introduced as illustrations of an interesting lectare on the principlas and application of aerostatiou delivered byr johin cooper the grand points whieh mr green has gained are briefly these by the use of a simple piece of machinery he is enabled to propel asd to a certain extent with the assistsnce of a rudder in a calm atmoaphere par tially to direct the course ofthe balloon as well as to attain an ascending er a desoending power by the adoptien of tie guiderope mr green has obtained what may be termed a resisting medium and by it too he is enabled to preserve a particular elevation or altitude the machinery can sists of a spinde which is acted upon by works simi lar to those ed in a watch to the end of which are affined two vanes or fans set in au angle of  oa the opposite side of the car is fixed another fan which acts s a raudder of conrse whatever power ef direction or steerage may have been gained by the adoption of this invention must of necessity be more or less weakened by the violence or mo deration of the wind or the currents of ail into which the baueon passes when at a considerable elevation fron the earth so long as the fabns are kept to act horizontally aud therefore propulsively in the same course r green by the eperationef his guideropehasthe baloa so entirelyunder his control as to preserve any degree or level of altitude that in his judgment may hest suit the object of the day vhether that end be to he obtained by means of an elevation into a strong current or by sinklsg into a lower position with a view of coming witin a less forcible action of air for the purposes of a trip across the sea the guiderope would be ballasted by copper vessels eharged with water so thatalmost any amount of waight or resihtmg power which the balloon could bear might thereby be gained the idea and adeption of tso guiderope originated with mr green whilst the merit of the invention of the ians and rudder is due to mr j jepson  taylor an engineer residing in grace churchstreet who has tiken out a patent for his discovery the intention of mr ta ylor in the construction of his ex tremely ingenious although simple maehinery was that it should be applied to the propulsien of ships amd it was net until subsequently that ho canceived it might be advantage ously attached to a balloon when sentioned to mr ireehe at once took steps to test the inventioe and was highly gratified at the success but probably the most valuable portion of this discovery is that which affords the aeronaut the povser ef ascending vwithout throwing awny ballast and of descending without the sfightest expenditure of gaz this end is attained by effeoting a change in the poeition of the fans in their application already raferred tv these instrn ments are placed o ars to work at a right angle with the wind in a horizontal position and the alteration consists in shifting their action into a vertical course by this alterationj green is enabled either to asoend or descend to any rrn elevation the gas with which the balloon is inflated at this moment beieg the medium of buoyancy rather than that by which the increased or depressed altitud is attained in fact the aeronaut it is conjecturedi will thus have the op portunity of selecting his degree of elevation and of picking his current of wind the experiment abovorofctred to dwet to bear cut mr greens anticipations and the cientiflo por tion of the iudience expressed their gratification at the ebi lition it is proposed to fix the machinery on a platform to be suspended between the car and the baloon where it cul be put into action without inconvenience to the voaygvrwe hear there is every prospeot that a trip fromn amerioa to europq will be attempted in the oimrso of tho proachina summer mr green has offered to coakributo soethe expense and ti forfeit l which he will deposit be fore be quits england if not successful
