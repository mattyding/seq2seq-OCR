coal outlookmr hodges warning toowners and menmr fairn hodoes former secretary of the miner federation addressed warwickshire miners yesterday at dordon on the outlook in the coalfiels the remedies for the evils of unemnployment and low wages he said tetl into two categoriesaction within the in dustry jointly by owners and men and action without the industrv by the goverilment with regard to the former the possibility of action was unfortunately not likely to mature immediately with regard to the latterwell it was a tory government as to joint action the owners and workers ssemed to be drifting apart belligerency was taking the place of reason and calm judgmentso far as government action was conerned nationalization of the industry was definitely  off  for several years a higher minimum wage by lawr vsowz not be sanctioned the ellminatiot of the middleman the factor and the merchant would not be proceeded with  therefore there was little if any relief to accrue to the general public the public only growled in their sleepwhilst every one of dthe wellknown anomalies characteristie of the indastry was likely to retuain until either uniticatiou or nttionalization was established we had to find the mesns of relief for the industry within the existing system as long as it lasted and that would surely be at least as long as the present government existed a supreme effort ought to be made now to get the coal ship off the quicksands to thatend both parties in the trade were directing their attention mere vapid bellicose declarations on either side would not help at all but the industry must improve an the miner must livethe first and most vital question of all vas how could the volxme of trade and employ meni be inuriavsedin order to give full tiinfito those workirg short time and to find employ ment for those whose collieries had been closed down  beside that one au other questions were insignificanthaving quoted figures dealing with un employment lost shifts and less of output mr hodges said the coalowners in an in dividual capacity were demanding as their remedy an increase in tbe length of the working day that was but a prelude to an official and collective demand equally individual and umofficial was the cry for a dailyinaimum wageof l s per shitt for the lowest patid men wvith proportionate increases for the highergrade wvorkers with tbe etention of the present wvorking day that might also be regarded as symptsomatic of a more oifiicial demand later onin view of these conflicting mentalities proceeded mr hodges  we may as well state what is obviousl that under no circumstances would the miners be induced to concede the owners demands that such a demand as that indicated as representing the claim of the men could not be conceded even if the state of the trade automatically improves beyond the position it is in it is clear there fore that if these demands become official and are persisted in a conflict is inevitable at the termination of the present agreement as things are the coalowners proposal is folly personified but it moust be examined their reasons or such of them as have been publicly stated arethat an increase in the working day would increase output that inereased output would reduce costs that reduced costs would reduce price that reduced price would stimulate buyers that neew and heavier buying would increase demand that in eonsequence prices would go up with the magnificent result that there would again be great prosperity in the coal industry this is a poor start it is fatuous to argue so in the teeth of  unemployed men and the rest who lose in a week  shifts forlwck of trade and transport it is established beyond doubt in the history of the industry that the shorter the working day the greater the need and spur of technical efficiency with the consequential increase in production why not ask for nine or ten or  hours per day if the owners dogma be correct  why not ask henry ford  why not face the real facts of the situation instead of burying their heads in lhe sand ostrichiike or shamefacedly crymng out for an extension of the working day they should cooperate with the npen in ascertaining and agreeing as to the realbeause of the disaster which has overtaken the trade they would not have far to seekthe northumberland miners are on the right track in deniiuding an inquiryupon an unprecedented scale into the entire problem economnic social scientific the owners may rnottake my advice but surely it isselfevident that in their own interests they should join with the men in such an inquiry rather than await the issue of further political and onomic upheavalsihe very prospect of a struggle in june next must be the means of much nervousness in the market even now buyers are shy and hesitating competitors are alert and eternally vigilant a further reaction wouldbe experi enced within the trade and unnecessary suffer ing created the owners should frankly and officially abandon all talk of extending the working day the miners would starve before theyeveronseate to giveuptheiseerthe rights the workmen too must see the futility of striking for such an increase ia wages as indicated in the midst of an unprecedented trade slump with an armay of unemployed whoseonly cry is work
