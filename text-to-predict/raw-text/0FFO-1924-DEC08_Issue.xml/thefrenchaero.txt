the french aerosiiowincrease in metal   aircrafthigh speed claimsfrom out specialx corbesponwdentparis dec today with the visit of the president of the french republic m doumergue who was accompanied by the prime minister m herriot the paris aero show received its offioial recognition and now no doubt bigger crowds than ever will flock to it it is undoubtedly a remarkably fife world advertisement of fronch aviation and suggests that the british air ministry might find it useful to offer state help for a british aero show in london there is nothing in the paris show that would lead one to the be lief that the french designer or con structor has found any secret or method un known to his british confrcreas i have already said allmetal construction is very much in evidence and without doubt strongth combined with lightness has been achieved the test of the merits of the various con structions must however in the end reduce itself to that of manhours which in the mechanical war of the future will become vital however efficient a ma chine may be in the air it must be ctpable of quick replacement and it is for british engineers to consider how far any of the methods onshow here will

much to admire in the breguet xixc twoseater which calls for detailed commnent as apart from its recently achieved world prominence it embodies a form of wing bracing all its own this briefly transfers the lift of the top wing through a single inward sloping strut to a smaller lower wing and on again through steel cables to the axle of the undercarriage the wheels of which float between a double flange on a sort of fixed hub the absence of head resist anceanid the enlarged arc of fire gained by the reduction of external bracing wires is noticeable but this form of construction seems open to the objection that it may be unwise to make the attachment of the wing bracings the very paryt of the machine most subject to violent shocks the aeroplane has a speed of  miles an hour as a twoseater fighter a ceiling of ft and a speed of  miles an hour as a daybomber with a useful load of nearly olbthen there is a new farman observa tion machine fitted with a  hp farman engine which shows a comn plete departure from the old boxkite frofcnstruction it is virtually a monoplane with short planes projecting from the flat underside of the deep fuselage and carrying at their tips the wheels of a widetrack undercarriage arid also the lower ends bf the outwardly sloping bracing struts of the plane above it is credited with a speed of  miles an hour at ft and a useful load of about a tonthe fourengined farmarn nightbomber already referred to is too big with its overall span of sft to get more than the fuselage and the port side of the centre section with the engine units each containing two  hp farmans in tandeminto the show the side of the fuselage is cut away to show an imposing array of bomb sights release gear wireless apparatus electrical in stallations and other fittingsa new alloy of aluminium copper and manganese produced by the famous schneider firm and called alferium is the basis of their new twinfuselage allmetal twoengined monoplane of ft span and b total weight a humpedup projection on the top of the wing between the fuselages houses two gunners and pilots and it is claimed a greater arc of fire is secured this aeroplane has not yet flown a pretty piece of allmetal construction is shown by the secm firm now building their frst big aircraft for the french govern ment an aluminium alloy tube is used and instead of machined forgings to join the various points as in british construction sheet metal is in effect wrapped round the tubes and is either riveted or fastened by nuts and bolts an ingenious attempt by pierre levesseur to give the pilot of a naval aeroplane a chance of escape if foreed to alight on water deserves a mention the underside of the fuselage is watertight the whole undercarriage can be dropped away by one release the airscrew can be locked horizontallv and the aeroplane can therefore slight as a flying boathanriot shows a very neat streamlining of a  hp sahnson engine in an all metal singleseater biplane the nieu portdelage machines are well worth careful study the c which was seen at the raf pageant at hendon has been followed by a twoseater the c with a  hp  hispan osuiza and presents several new features it is sesquiplane in type somewhat like the breguet carries its wing struts down to the underearriage but to a crossmember in rear of the actual axles the two being enclosed in a fairing which is practically another plane the main part of the fuselage from the nose back to the gunners cockpit which is almost a turret is all metal as is the wing con struction and the rear portion of the fuselage is monococque in build the streamlining compels admiration and every form of parasite resistance is at a miniimum its speed is given at  milesan hour with a useful ibad of about ooob and a duration of two hours its ceiling is stated to be about ooft it is closely rivalled by the spad e fitted with  hp gnomejupiter radial engine and carrying a useful load of bout b it is a singlestrut biplane and fitted with four machine guns it is claimed to have a speed of over  miles an hour at ft and aspeed near the ground of  miles an hourthis machine has a variable pitch air screw the nieuportdelage has a steel airserew of novel construction and the american reed metal airserew figures in several machines a crashproof tank is a feature in the breguet type and a fire extinguisher systein by which a chemical fluid is sprayed at will on engine earburettors is another noveltyfrom the commercial point of view none of the french machines is so economical in horsepower as the british types the majority working out at about hp per passenger as compared with our hp higher speeds however are shown and perhaps more comfort
