lakeland in decembertwmight and sunrisefrom a corrtspdenqat this time of year in the westmor land dales day comes long before the sun and lingers for two hours and more after his departure indeed during some five hours only does the sun on fine days shine into the vale of grasmere and for the rest of the time on either side of night the vale is filled with a sober twi light that seems to come from nowherethere is no afternoon in grasmere in december twilight and sunrise sunset and twilight follow each other and night is foretold and prolonged by long periods of a clear grey light that casts no shadow in these sunless hours the leafless woods stand as shadowy breadths of a dim and faded brown and above the slopes of tawny bracken rocks and screes take on the sombre clearness of objects seen through still water the belated sunrise serves but to set shadows astir in a world already full of daylight to dissolve the even depths of the sunless lilht into auuquer worr ot moving sunlight and tree shadows in the long twilight after sun set the darkening of earth and of sky pro ceeds so evenly together that an hour or two after the sun has disappeared the west seems to glow with an unaltered brilliance beyond the black shoulder of silver how and the vale to be involved in some fading peculiar to itselfum tne vale of grasmere sunrise shows first a most remote and godlike gold of dawning on the fells above far easedale there distant from man and all his works the fells and the sun greet the new day together and even in the sober twilight down among the rothay meadows the brilliant silence the sweet sharp scents of bog and mountain fern that lie upon that distant skyline become as real to the watcher as are the river mists that creep waist high about himiii rvar naseciale silver how takes the torch of day high above the shadowedlake its summit glows with a ruddy gold the vivid light spreads swiftly down the slopes the heights about easedale tarn and at long last the topmost rocks of helm crag are bathed in the descending glory until the whole western rampart of the dale stands in a crystalline clearness lit by sunlight so golden that the shadowed vale beneath seems yet sunk in darknesswhile the western fells exchange their solemn salutations with the day above the blue smoke that ascends in nebulous fingers from the foothill farms the broadening light enters upon its slow journey athwart the valley bottom towards the night that remains entrenched along the base of rydal fell though sunrise lies in a golden breadth on the flat summit of seat sandal and slants in misty rays from behind the rocks of stone arthur beneath them the white farm of gillside and the ancient hamlet of winter seeds stand yet sunk in the grey rime of night the main road past the swan runs between fields that are vague withierip rnhuu wan with fros t for perhaps an hour after the easedalepastures shine wet and glittering in the sunshine and even when these western facing slopes are at last blessed with stn light when the hoarfrost has been melted from the backs of sheep that moved in the grey of dawn wraithlike through thle frozen grass theslopes of red bank still harhour winter and the shades of night here above the lake itself along that sun less shore breathed upon by formless frosty vapours its vague waters resting motionless against the greywhite pastures winter stands incarnate throughout the day a frozen shadow dwells along this far ride of the lake and the unmelted hoar frost and hovering mists of these sunless slopes wait but for nightto extend once more their dominion over all the valle llpast z in the afternoonthe sun drops behind silver how and thetwilight that soon involves the dale gains but gradually upon rydal fell and stone arthur now giliside and winterseeds their windows glancing in the sunlight above the shadowed vale receive atone ment for their belated dawning now the sunset light lies in an old rose glory along the slopes above them the deepening rose colour of evening ever encroached on by the rising shadows until it lingers but on the topmost summits and then like a bird takes flight from earth to sky all things but the clouds are once more involved in that shadow of the hills that precedes the deeper shadow of the night yet they lit with rose and gold above the vale send down a reflected glory that sets a faint afterglow alight upon the fells and thus night is heralded at last by the dimmed colours of a day already long dead
