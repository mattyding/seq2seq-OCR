the progress ofsciencei   mind and bodyroai our scuisipmc copatesronentsir chlarles sherrington in a presi dential address tio the royal society last week described and discussed a recent advance in knowledge bearing on the relation of mind to body of consciousness to automatic action the tough skin of a kidney bean covers a pair of seed leaves swollen with stored food for the youing plant and joined in the concave hollow by a hingelike structure thrufit the bean indifferently into suitable soil and presently it will swell and burst the cotyledons will open out and from one end of the hinge a young shoot will grow upwards towards light and air soon becoming green and bearing leaves and from the other end a pale rootlet will thrust its way downwards into the soil the root and the shoot grow from pre detertnined ends of the hinge atd if the oean has happened to be thrust into the ground the right way up the growth of the embryonic parts is straightforward but if the bean has been planted upside down or on one side the shoot and the root grow straight out parallel with the long asis of the bean for a little way and then begin to twist in the direction wvhich suiits their ultimate functions the onetowards the light but before it can be affected by the light through the opaque soil the other towards the centre of the earth the shoot is negatively geotropicit tends to grow away from the centre of the earth the root is positively geotropicit turns towards the centre of the earthvery many growing tissues of auimals and plants and also very many lowbr animals and plants with powvers of loco motion have been shlown to have the power of directing their growth or their niotioitoards or away fromi conditions in tleir enviromnont hese tropisros relate to gravity light warmtthi or cold mlloisture or dryness and a number of cieniiiial stintidants for the lnost part of a kind that we should recognize as affect  ibig our onw soieacs of smell or tusto but they have generally been supposed to be limitedt to organisimis or to parts of organisms below the level of iconscious ness sir charles shlerrington described work  which proves their influenice to extend to some oÂ£ the highest of the mammals and to relate to capacities in intimate connexion with the part of the brain associated with consciousness the researches moreover ccncern the responses to gravity the tropism which has beenregarded most definitely as a special capacity ofvegetative life and of lowly sessile animalsfor the last  years professor magnus and dr de kleijn of the university of utrecht have been investigating the nervous mechanisms engaged in the main tenance of the erect posture in rabbits cats and monkeys the chlef of what may be called the receptors for positiog are minute mineral concretions in a pair of hollow nervelined chambers embedded in the wall of the skull gravity rolls these stones about with the changing positions of the head and the geo tropism the orientation of the whole body with respect to the earthl is made effective by a complicatedcorrelation of movements of the eyeballs and an intri cate system of coordinated nervous and muscular impulsesmnmtd and bodyit was a great achievement to have worked out the details of those mechen isms and so to have added to knowledge of bodilgfuuetions but the high import ance of the results is due to a farreaching discovery the geotropism was displayed and the chain of reflexes se going in animals from which the whole of the higher brain had been removed rabbits cats and monkeys in which the possi bility of consciousness had been destroyed walked and ran maintained or regained the upright posture precisely as if they were making purposive responses to their surrounding conditionsthe utrecht results are in agreement with those of the many investigations into the mechanisms of the body to which sir charles sherrington himself has devoted his life and the tenor of which he summed up in his presidential address to the british association at hull two years ago their direction can be described most simply as being exactly opposite to that of the popular philosophy and psychology of the day there is agap between mmd and body between conscious purposive action on the one hand and tropisms and reflex action on the other which has not yet been bridged in theory a popular school takes the easy way of denying the exist ence of the gap it assigns conscious purpose to all the manifestations of life and glibly ascribes motives to an amoeba purposive striving to the root and shoot of a germinating seed but such interpretations are opposed by familiar experiencewe know very well that many of our bodily functions continue their useful course when we are asleep or sleep walking under an anaesthetic or stunned by a blow clinieal observations on human beings and experimental pliysi ology in the case of higher mammals have firmly established the existence of many orderly actions which are definitely below the field of consciousness the work of sherrington magnus and other recent investigators has greatly extended the sphere of unconscious mechanism and has shown it to rule in many regions hitherto set down to conscious purposive action these moreover are historically older than the conscious part of the brain wlienwhat the anatomist elliott smith called the neopallium began to develop and to provide an organ for consciousness dawning mind had simply to take cognizanee of what the body had already discovered instead of imposing its  intuitions  on the body it foundthem readymade we may believe that mind arose as an inevitable outcrop of a certain complexity of brain struoture or that it was imposed from without when the brain structure was sufficiently complex the new knowledge does in some respects deepen the gap between mind and body but it moves it higher up in the animal kigdom and closer to the mental characters peculiar to oi at the least most highly developed in man
