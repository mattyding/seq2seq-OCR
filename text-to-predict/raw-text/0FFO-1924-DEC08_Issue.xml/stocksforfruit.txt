stocks for fruittreesresults of researchfrom a corrmlspowenttextbooks written in former years dictate that standard trees should be propagated on the crab stocks modern researches at the east malling fruit research station in kent has shown that the true story is more com plex the station collected supplies of stocks used by nurserymen in great britain germany france and holland and even the most preliminary investigation confirmed the belief that in many cases the distinctions be twveen the various stocks were but little re garded all those apple stocks that could be raised by vegetative means were popularly known as paradise and those raised from seeds as crab the pips of any apples on being planted give rise to seedling apples which vary to a marked degree and all could not be relied on to induce vigorous growth in scions seedling apples in fact contained tall dwarf and intermediate types deep and shallow rooted coarse and fibrous rooted broad and narrow leaves the behaviour of the popular crab stock is a matter of chance and it cannot be relied on to produce a vigorous treethe socalled paradise stock was found to contain  distinct types easily distinguish able botanically and varying in health and vigour of growthfrom the very dwarf through the intermediate types to the very vigorous in effect the same type of paradise would produce dwarf trees bushes and cordons but other types would have a vigour and robust ness of growth previously supposed to belong only to crabs there did not appear to be much difference between the root system of the stocks of the paradise and crabs origin as had been traditionally tught by most past writerstypes of fibrous rooting and coarse deep rooting were found in both classes the roots of each particular type of the  paradise stocks were remarkably constant and very characteristic of the variety the discovery of these varieties of paradise stock each dis tinctly recognizable from its botanical characteristics and distinctive rooting habit has opened up a new field for apple propaga tion and reduced the matter to an exact science with great practical possibilities for practical purposes it is but necessary to recognize four types the very dwarfing represented by the french or the jaune de metz paradise the semidwarfing as represented by the tree doncin or the improved doncin the vigorous type represented by the broadleaved english paradise or the nonsuch paradise aud the very vigorous represented by types known as malling types xiii to xvinurserymen are now able to choose stocks to develop trees of varying sizes the large standard tree for the grass orchards the half standard and bush tree for the commercial fruit plantations and the dwarf bush and cordon for the small private gardensthe investigation has also shown that when the same variety of apple is worked on to the very dwarfing or the semidwarfing stocks precocity of bloom ing and fruiting occurs for instanceover  per cent of the trees of bramley seedlng on the french paradise came into fruiting in their second year at the researeh station whereas on the vigorous stocks no fruit would be expected until the eighth or ninth season these standardized stocks are now being used by the british nurserymen and fruit growers provided with this know ledge are able to order trees on the stock swtable for producing the type of tree which they consider sutable for their orchards or gardens
