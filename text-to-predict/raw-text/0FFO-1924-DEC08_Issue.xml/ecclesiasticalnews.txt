ecclesasticalnewsangdlo catholic reply to dr barnesthe rev g d rosenthal vicar of st agatha sparkbrook birmingham in the course of a letter to the bishop of birmingham dr barnes on behalf of the birmingham regional committee of the anglocatholic congress movement of which body mr rosenthal is chairman refers to the passage quoted by dr barnes from a recent visitation charge of the bishop of gloucester which was published imder the title  the church of england the doctrine of the apoitolic sacceslon is taught in a mechanical way grice is said to have come down icn the apostles by the

obviously give a meaumng to the wotds which you quote entirely dufferent from that which you assigr to themafter observing that  it is not only some particlatr custom connected with the use ol the reserved sacrament but reservatior itself which  you condemn mr rosenthal quotes a lengthy passage from the same charge by the bishop of loucester as show ing that he is prepared to sanction what you dr barnes describe as an  idegality with a  false doctrine  behind itttasubstirmaton  and re al pnessucce mr rosenthat also contends that a quota tion made by dr barnes from carton storrcontains a gross historical blunder  reserva tion it is said  was not heard of until the doctrine of transubstantiation was pro pounded it is of course wel known to all who have studied the history of the church that reservation was practised from the second century onwards and that the philosophical theory respecting the mode of the eucharistic presence which is known as  transubstantia tion  was first propounded by paschasius radbertus in the ninth century and was not fully developed till much later the doctrine underlying the practice of reservation is not the theory of transubstantiation but the truth that the bread aud wine become by con secration the body and blood of christ your objection therefore is not against the theory of transubstantiation but against the truth of our lords presence in the sacramentyyg w a statement by dr barnes thal i is ordered by the rules of our church thal these elements should be at once consu med after the communion service mr roseutha says  you refer we presume to the sixth rnbric at the end of the order of holy commu nion in the book of common prayer but it can hardly have escaped your notice that the modern interpretation of this rubric as for bidding reservation has been repeatedly challenged therubricwasadded in  with out any refereuce to reservation but to pre vent the abuse of the consecrated sacrament being used for ordinary food the practice of reserving the blessed sacrament has now beenrestored in the church of england for well nigh  years without any idea on the part of those who have adopted it that they were contravening the rubric the presence of the rubric in one of the two liturgies used in the scottish churchthe english communion office has never been thought inconsistent with a note in the other liturgy which is there in use the scottish communion office recog nizing the lawfulness of reservation and the language of the rubric closely resembles and probably was based upon the well known provision of the western canon law enjoining the reverent consumption of what remained after the distribution of commrunion decretum iii de consecr dist  cap  a provision which admittedly coexisted with the uaiversal prevalence of reservation compare lyndwood provinsent  we repudiate the accusations of i lje gality  and  false doctrine we believe that the doctrine underlying the custom of reserva tion is the true christian doetrine of the holy eucharist which goes back through the tradition of the eenturies to the words of ourhimsel and that reservation asnnot be treated ss illegal in the english churchin
