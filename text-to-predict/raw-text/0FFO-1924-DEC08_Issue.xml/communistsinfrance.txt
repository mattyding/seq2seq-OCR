with angry cries by the communists was provoked by an interpellation by m cachin the communist leader who protested against the dismissal from his post of m le flanchec the communist mayor of douarnenez a strike of pre served fruit tinmakers has been in progress at douarnenez for some weeks past feeling has run high and there has been at least one collision with the police the charge against m le flanchec was that he incited the strikers to resist the police whose duty it was to maintain order but the communist deputies maintained that so far from inciting the strikers to resist the police he exercised his influence as mayor of the town to cahn them the interpellation was postponed by  votes to the clerical partyit was apparently to pacify the com munists and the extreme section of his party that m herriot declared that the government would defend the democratic institutions of the republic not only against the communists but also against clerical reaction the clerical party deeply resent the indignity of being coupled with the communists as enemies to public order and the goverrnent is warned that irritation among catholics will spread throughout the countryas for the communist agitation it is held in some quarters thai it can only become threatening in the degree that it affects the amy and the army will only be affected by it if the government neglects its duty though some of the opposition organs draw an alarming picture of the communist peril par ticularly in the industrial north the majority of the government newspapers make light of these fears and suggest that the communists will be astonished and delighted at being taken so seriously it is however admitted that they should be prevented from creating disorder which would lead to reactionas commuhist disorder led to reaction in italythe quotidien takes a more serious view of the situation and devotes a whole page to the text of a confldential circuilar no  containing detailed
