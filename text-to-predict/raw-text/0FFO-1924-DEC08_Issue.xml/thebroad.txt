 the broadappeal to lovers ofoxfordfromi our universrncobrespondentoxford dxc all lovers of oxford are grateful to the times for drawing attention to the dangers arising from the possible sale of the site on the south side of broad street in oxford there has been much talk today and the general feeling seems to be a sense of relief that it is now possible to speak openly with a know ledge of the facts rumours had been rife for some little while but they were vague and uncertain there are of course two factors in the problem which it is well to keep apart the one is a matter of aesthetics the site might be vulgarized and the street robbed of its character by the erection of high and imprisoning walls this is a danger which all who value the beauty of oxford whether university men or not must alike fear but to the univer sity the chief danger would seem to be the irreparable loss which would result if the ujniversity or the adjacent colleges were finally excluded from this central area which is anlmost the only spot left in the town affording a possibility of further expansionthere is every reason to believe that the city council is alive to both these considerations the western part of the site has indeed already been let on a building lease for  years but the council will have some control over the plans aid are not likely to permit the erection of an unsuitable building should they pursue a similar poliey with the rest of the site it is to be hoped that they would be desirous and able to insist on a comprehensive plan of building for the whole under the direction of some firstrate architect it is also exceedingly improbable that they would be villing to part with the freehold of the site to any ordinary purchaser though they might be ready to do so to thuniversity or to some of tho colleges it is natural now that leases are falling in that the city should desire to make the site produce as much as it can in relief of rates but the council it is understood fully realize the importance of its passing if possible to the universityit need hardly be said that neither the university nor the colleges have free funds available for such a purchase a college might by the sale of other property collect enough to buy some small portion of the site the university wvhich holds capital in trust to produce income for its scholarships and other endowments would have to treat any purchase on economic lines and maintain its income what seems to be needed is that some lover or lovers of oxford being fortunate in having the means to assist her should make it possible for the site or part of it to be acquired without loss of income the publicity which the times has given to the matter is the first step in this direction and the university cannot but hope that this most important object may be attainedletters on this subject wl be found on page
