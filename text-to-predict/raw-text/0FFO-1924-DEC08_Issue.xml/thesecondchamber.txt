the second chambera weakness in theconstitutionlordl birkenheads viewthere was a big gathering in the brighton dome on saturday when lord birkenhead gave the inaugural lecture of a series in con nexion with the sussex university college schemelond burrox who presided said the scheme was adumbrated in  and Â£ vas asked for as a beginning the response to the original appeal was not sufficient to justify the promoters in continuing the scheme on the right basis then came thew ar which put a stop to the enterprise for the time being and that was followed by what was even more disastrous from thepoint of view of getting the moneythe peace the committee had now come to the conclusion thlat they must carry out the idea in a more modest way and had therefore decided to institute a series of lectures and they were extremely obliged to lord birkenhead for his kindness in accepting the invitation to deliver the firstlord bas axxnnd lecturing on the merits and demerits of the british constitu tion said the constitution under which we lived today vas the one of all that he was aware of in the ancient or the modern world which made it the nmote certain that that which the majority of the voters of this country desired should be carried into law and made effective in the field of administra tion conscious as he was of the faults weak nesses and risks of the democratic system of government he was still inclned to count tlhem as less than the mischief which had arisen wben in large empires small cliques hzld grasped and retained in their hands the rigbt of supreme power our system was on the whole thte most perfect the most complete and the most direct instrument thel world had ever knownas a contrasthe instanced the constitution of the united states  it was certainly established with the purpose of giving direct contact with the democracy but the practical result was not quite in accord wvith the theoretical prognosisanalysing the communist mind he said they seermed to think that under our constitution the dice was always lheavily loaded against tlose who would overturn the existiug system lihat was qulite unreasonablco asid illogical lit was glad to notice that on the whole tnembeis of the iabour rarty in thie hlouse of conmnonis and certainly its leaders were aidapting themselves more and more to the spirit of our parliamentary institutions it hltd been claimed for generations though it was uever so severely tested as it was llkely to be in the near future that the house of commons would imperiously assimilate and dominate all those who became members that claim was not too boldly made if they ex amined the past of that great assembly he pointed out that on the extreme left the russiau bolshevists denied the people the right to be masters of their own destiny on the extreme right the democratic system in italy under the fascisti had been superseded by the rule of junkers it had certainly averted bolshevism and anarchy but having accomplished that he believed the ultimate political goal of that country would lie on constitutional and parliamentary linesour system depended on two chambers and a constitutional monarchy he maintained that they could never keep together an empire so deeply based on sentiment unless they appealed to the historic sense and to theidelity and loyalty of the empire ihe could not conceive of a president of the british isles making the appeal to the outer dominions that was made by the dynasty which threw its roots back to the verv beginning of our island history possessing a constitutional monarchy a house of commons elected on ai democratic suffrage and not limited to a single sex and a second chamber in wvhicll lord buxton and he were compelled to live comparatively inactive lives laughter but which he was still bold enough to think could unaer a scheme of in telligent and sympathetic reform be made a valuable contributory part of our constitu tionpossessing these he would not exchange our constitution for that of any other country in the world the greatest demerit of the constitution was of recent developitient we find our selves he said  alone in the great countries of the world with a democracy to whose powver in tle first chambei no limits are by the constitution assigned and find ourselves at the same time protected by the weakest second cbamber in any considerable country in the world in this country differing from most latin countries and from the united states we had no differentiation between laws directly affecting the constitution and other laws in the united states particularly any citizen could challenge a new law before any supretae court on the ground that it con flicted with the constitution we had taken that risk immense and indisputable as it was not posseesing the additional bulwark existing in america and france of a stable second chamber possessing the same measure of in dependent democratic strengththat the country had taken a great risk was manifest to all supposing the present government was succeeded by their most pro bable successors one might speculate on the danger to which the country would be ex posed in the legislative and administrative field he was not inclined however to despair and refreshed himself by thinking of tlheir political historv and of the timeproved political instincts of the people of the country the dangers would be faced and overcome there stood foursquare against those who would break the maiestic spirit of our consti tution as firmly as ever in history the plain men and women of england who sawv that thev belonged to a great country and were legatees of a great and majestie community of national thouglht their inheritance of freedom would be preserved in the consti tutional trenches they would fight for and defend that which after all its shortcomings had been at once the example and admiration of the civilized world
