agriculturethe fat stockshowsback to prewarstandardsislington todayby our aouiculrurl correspondentwith the records of the norvgich bir mingham and edinburgh shows as a gulide it requires no great courage to pre dict an exhibition equal to the best pre var standard of excelletce at islington this wveek it i beconhing increasingly evident that the herds and floeks of this country wvhatever their particular ftin tion in the economy of the farmwhether meat or milk productionare fulfilling their purposes with remarkable efficiency in breeding and individual merit the farm livestocks of thebritish rsles haveievor beeni more impressive thanthey are today it is wvarrantable to make this assertion although the standard by which comparisons are made rises progressively from year to year when alloyvance is made for age differences in an address at aberystwvyth theother day lord bledisloe spoke of the pioneer work of our great improvers of live stock and named bakewell of dishley among otliers as worthy of permanent recognition bake well experimenting with longhorn cattle and leicester sheep the breeds ready to hand is believed to have begun the work of syste matic improvement that has been carried on succesively or contemporaneously by eliman in southdown sheep the colling brothers in shorthorns tomkins in ilerefords quartly in devon cattle and watson and mccomnbie in aberdeenangus the list of names that might be compiled of owners whol have left the country richer in highclass breeds of live stock than they foundit might be extended to an imposinglength the labomrs of the distnguished compamy are represented in different formsdifferent breeds classes and purposesbut the foundation wlhich some of the older of them laid will be fittingly re fdected in the handsome arrays of finished animals that will be on view in the royal agricultural hall from this morning till friday eveningit enhances rather than diminishes the national services of the early breed improvers to say that their successors down even to the exhibitors of the present time have con tinued with enterprise and skill the task they began bakevell and the others of a century ago and later made the more rapid progress of subsequent years possible they gave the clue to the lines to follow in justice to later generations however it can he recordedthat they have played their part with creditand distinction if the class of animal stalled or penned this week does not suggest to the eye noteworthy improvement upon its pre decessor investigation would probably reveal interesting
