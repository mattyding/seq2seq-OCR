salien londoncitizens in the makingneed of restrictionsfrom our special correspondentit is not easy to arrive at the truth as to the degree and rapidity of the social and political assimitation of the jewish immigrant from eastern europe who belongs almost exclusively to the working class or to the very small bourgeoisie other alien immigrants have not presented the same problem in london at all events  the italian who usually belongs to much the same social strata as the minwi grant jews seldom desires to settle per manently in this country he comers to better himself and this done returns to italy a fully developed petit bourgeois the catholic poles and lithuanians of the working class who are fairly numerous on the clyde appear to be decreasing in london the belgian joiners and cabinet makers who were imported in  and subsequently seem to have been already absorbed there are a certain number of belgians who came over as refugees in  in the engineering trade but they form a very small percentage of those thus eniployed the continentals other than the italians and the eastern jews who have settled here in the last halfcentury bave gene rally belonged to the middle and upper middle classes if jews as a fair propor tion have been they have been generally absorbed by the corresponding classes among the ritish jews the nonews have equally generally merged in a population with which they readily intermarry and which has the same interests and occupations just as the mucli more numerous flemings huguenots and northi germnans whether hanoverians or men of the kings german legion were quickly assimi lated b the much smaller population of their day lihe aussian refugee from bolshevist misrule is not nearly so numerous in this country as he is in germany the border states or even france as for the stray asiatics or africans their numbers are so small and intermarriage with them is so rare that there cannot be said to be any real halfcaste problem in the eastendsocial assimilationthe case of the eastern jewish inmmigrant has always been peculiar his religion which entails the observance of different holidays from those which the gentiles keep restricts his dietary and prohibits intermarriage and his history and the distrust of the nonjew to whlich it gives rise make soeial assimilation a slower process in his case than in that of the christian immigrant further obstacles were and still are to be found in the concentration of the immigrants and their families in certain quarters and in certain occupations in east london whatever the strength of his judaism the middleclass jow who settles outside the largely jewish areas is bound to see more of the gentile and i think it would be rather an exception to find a jeaish family established for more than a few years in london outside the jewish areas of east london and a few smaller settlements who had not gentile friends as well as ac quaintances but it stands to reason that an eastern immigrant who settles in a white chapel street amid a multitude of his co religionists and is engaged in a craftcheap tailoring for examplewhich is manned to a great extent by jews has no inducement to make friends with gentiles and little oppor tunity of so doing the mixed council schools attended by both christian and jewish children vwho get on admirably together promote social assimilation up to a point and one wonders whether the present system under which a school is reserved for jewish children when their number exceeds  per cent is desirable from a national standpoint however con venient it may be from the point of view of the administrator confronted with the fact that the two confessions keep different holidays at the same time one must admit that present condi tions tend to encourage an assumption of mental superiority on the part of the young eastend jew explicable enough in a quarter where the native population is generally mentally slack by comparison with a stock which is mentally acquisitive alert and precocious and has never neglected learning but sometimes annoying when he emerges from whitechapel anld en cohnters british minds of a sturdier typethere are jews not necessarily foreign bor who dislike social assimilation on religious grounds and urge that if the jew gains thereby in  bteadth of outlook he loses in depth and strength of character but one cannot see why broaff views should not coexist with gtrong characters among jews as among gentiles many distinguished examples prove the con trary and history scarcely encourages the opinion that tlle combination of a narrow out look  ith strength of character is entirelv desirnble at all times among individuals or communities political assiuilationin estimating the rapidity of the political assimilation of the eastern jews vho have settled in this country in the last  vears it must be remembered that these people fall into many different categories an alien immigrant whose character has been formed in the slums of kieff or lodz cannot be expected to adopt an english political outlook whether he came over in  or in  this variety of immigrant still causes annoyance mingled with amuqement by attempting to bribe home office clerks when endeavouring to obtain pernmssion to import a relative and there is a tale that one of them once solemnly pushed a penny towards an important home official from whom he was attempting to obtain some concession hie sometimes causes unfriendly comment if he moves into a mainly british quarter by annex ing a british name i have known irishmen to be moved to fury by the conversion of solomon into osullivan and cannot see why the immigrant jew who finds that there are wartime and postwar prejudices against hunnish or bolsbevist surnames and wishes to change his should not fall back on the stately and familiar names of the old testamentthen you have the britishborn offspring of the immigrants and those who came to this country as small children the extent of their political assimilation varies with the character of the home from which they come but most of them are or have the makings of good citizens their children are politically even more anglicized though in the eastend it is noticeable that the people of immigrant stock if jews are not unnaturally inclined to adopt a more international outlook than the british even the middleclassjew of recent alien origin is less inclined than the british bourgeoi to condemn the bolshevist root and branch because to him the bolshevist represents a movement which removed jewish political disabilities as regards the naturalization of alien immigrants one finds marked differences of opinion in east london and elsewhere immigrants have not been naturalized at all frequently or rapidly since the outbreak of the great war in some quarters the slowness of naturalization is criticized as causing an accumulation df foreign settlers with privileges but without political duties on the other hand the power to deport the unnattiralizel criminal or undesirble has enabled the authori ties to crush the usually french or german souteneur and other pests and is a useful check on the activities of the professional revo lutionary the behaviour of the alien jews int the eastend during the war was often unsatisfactory they indulged in wholesale panei during the airraids and in too many cases did their best to avoid military service not only in the russian army which was explicable enough but in the british their behaviour explains the annoyance felt byxestdentsof xoartheast and artsofwcst london at the invasion of their quarters by jews from the eastend the invaded british also complain that thenewcomers too often deal exclusively with jewish shopkeepers often aliens themselves to the detbinnent of the nonjewish retailer oj the other hand a large proportion of the britishborn children of aliens followed the fine example set by the british jews aid played their part like men during the war there were exceptions among them s among other communities but these m ere unduly noticeable because the young jew who could have volunteered and did not wlas inclined to trail his coat and make himself conspicuous while the englishman in like case blushed if he could unseen but the most serious cases of misconduct among naturalized aliens occurred among men of recent german origin who were of nmuch higher social standing than the average dweler in the eastendwork of british jew sfor the successful political assimilation of a large proportion of the children of the eastern jewish settlers we must thank not the foresight of victorian statesmen but the kindly initial tolerance of our muasses and the energy of the british jews the lazy liberalism of the past sympathized with the victims of pogroms to the extent of allowing them to over crowd east london and form and man new industries there it then left them to their own devices serenely confident that  selfthelp the influence of a liberal environment  and other magical formulas would convert them whatever their habits history and traditions at express speed into normal englishmen the british jews had the wits to see that these incantations would not alone effect thlis change their efforts for the relief and improvement of the condition of the poorer immigrants whether on the part of the jewishl board of guardians or the founders of the many jewish orphanages and endowed schools or of such admirable institutions as the jews shelter are well knowzn equally deserving of support are the efforts of many jews bothl liberal and conservative in religion to inake the children of often unpromis icg intinsgrants into englishthinking eitivens not mere technical british subjects the work done by the jewish lads and girls biigades for many years past and more recently by such institu tions as the oxford and st georges jowish lads club and others deserves to be better known and it is thanks to them that so many children of alien parentage have become valuable citizenseanwhile the success which has attended these efforts encourages many british jews to plead for a  more liberal  policy towards foreign immi granlts many of them also seem to fear that antiseniitic tendencies may have inspired recent antialien legislation but is not the question of the religion of recant alien immigrants altogether a secondary one  wiiiat british govern mnents have to consider is whietlher given present conditions of housing and un employment given thle decrease in our birthrate the increasing urbanization of our population and ouw tertible loss of men in the prime of their strength in the great lvar we can possibly relax the present restrictions in favour of prolific aliens au enormous majority of whom come from poor and crowded slums in eastern europe wlich are probably more stricken now by misery and contagious disease than at anv previous period whose physique is generauy poor who have often been exposed to the wildest revoltioniar y influences and who are usually as politically ignorant as they are intraitied in the practice of the civic as opposed to the domestic virtues if tlhey were all protestants by creed and  nordics by race hie same considera tiozis would apply to their case to return to the careless liberalism of the past before the complete splution of the problemiis of housing and employment vhich now confront us by opening the present barriers against their entry would increase our difficulties in days when we could absorb alieii elements with comparatively little difficulty they un doubtedly made very valuable contribu tions to our national life as some of the children of aliens are doing today but our situation has changed wve cannot find work or housing worthy of the name for too many of our own best indigenous stocls we can onily add to their dis contents by allowing unrestricted foreign settlement in our already overcrowded slums
