new petition toking ftadzzaghlueists indifficultiesattack on cabinetfrom our own corruspondentcairo dec ahmed pasha ziwar the prime minister has written to ahmned pasha mazlum the president of the chamber of deputies with reference to the petition of decembera submitted to king fuad by a number of deputies who invited his majesty to convoke parliament imme diatelythe prime minister repudiates the criticism contained in the petition of the cabinets action which he regards as being unjustified and as couched in unduly severe language in which the petitioners do not take into consideration the respect to which the judiciary of the country is entitled he points out that the wording of the petition does not make it clear whether the signatories merely wish to obtain a reduction of the period of prorogation which the king in virtue of his prerogative has already decreed or whether they claim to exercise the right which clause  of the constitution confers on an absolute majority of either house to call for an extraordinary session of parliament ziwar pasha considers that as the petitioners contented themselves with asking for the immediate convocation of parliament without referring to this pro vision in the constitution it is clear that their request must bear the first inter pretation but as mazlum pasha has informed him verbally that the signa tories intended to rely on their constitu tional right the prime minister requests him either on his own responsibility to confirm such verbail statement in writing or to obtain from the petitioners an ex plicit declaration that such is their intentionif as mlazlum pasha has stated the deputies rely on clause  they will be defeated out of their own mouths obviously no extraordinary session is possible in the middle of an ordinary session therefore if the deputies insist on having an extraordinary session it must be because they consider that the recent prorogation put an end to the ordinary session but such an argument would automatically remove the ground of their petition which is based on the supposed violation of parliamentary privilege by the arrests of deputies opposition to these arrests was itself based on the argu ment that a prorogation does not inter rupt the session and that the privilege of immunity from arrest during the sessions of parliament continues during a proroga tion if the zaghlulist deputies stand by this argument there can be no extra ordinary session as by their own admis sion thie ordinary session is still in existence if however they now claim that the prorogation put an end to the ordinary session then the parliamentary privilege of immunity from arrest is suspended and it cannot have been vio lated in such case the very yeason for their demand for an extraordinary session disappearson the other hand if notwithstanding mazium pasba the petitioners reply that they wish a curtailment of the proroga tion this would constitute a challenge to the royal prerogative which would cause the question to assume a far graver aspect than it had when the petition was first signed a new petitionziwar pashas reply which inci dentally by its dignified language strikingly contrasts with the almost insblent tone with which the deputies addressed the king certainly placed the deputies on the horns of a dilemma and  the fact that they scented the weakness of their position is indicated by their action in presenting a new petition to king fuad last night the preamble to this advances the new argument that the cabinet cannot constitutionally take office without submitting to a vote of con fidence in parliament and the ziwaf cabinet has not only not done this but has deliberately ignored parliament by pro roguing it the preamble goes on to attack the ziwar cabinet for having agreed with the british on questions rejected by both houses and thus acting without regard to the interests of the country and absolutely contrary to the decision of parliament it accuses the cabinet of publishing a lying explanatory note and of misrepresenting the previous cabinets notes wherein vith the sanc tion of parliament that body had refused to submit to the british demands relative to the sudan and foreign interests it criticizes the cabinets recognition of the autonomy of the foreign advisers autho rity and of  the british  directorgeneral of the european department of the ministry of the interior and its accept ance of the british demands relative to the sudan it accuses the cabinet not content with these surrenders of having intervened in the affairs of the muni cipality of alexandria and thus violating both the constitution and the existing laws such a policy threatens the destruction of national existence and of the rights of the country and therefore the signatories request his majestys assent to their petitionthe petition itself declares that dangers are daily becoming worse and that the arrests not only of deputies but of otherswithout proofs have produced a reign of terror and the signatories beg the king by reassembling parliament to enable that body to fulfil its duty of pro tecting the liberty of individualsthere is an unconsciously ironical touch about the reference to a reign of terror which the signatories of this re markable document allege now to exist what has been done during the past fort night is merely an endeavour on the part of the present government to carry out the undertaking given by its predecessor to find out fhose guilty of the stack out rage no matter what their position or age and the reign of terror if indeed it exists anywhere can only be among those who have so much to fear from justice taking its proper course
