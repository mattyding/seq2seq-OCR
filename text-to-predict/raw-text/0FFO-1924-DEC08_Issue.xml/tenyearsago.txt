ten years agothe failkiandsvictorya decisive action frto oub naval correspondinton december   there was fought what is generally regarded as the mnost de cisive naval action of the war in so far as immediate and material results were con cerned when admiral sir doveton sturdeb maet and defeated admiral graf von spee ff the falliland islandson this occasion the german armoured cruisers scharnhorst and oneisenan and the cruisers leipzig nurnberg and dresden were engaged by the british battlecruisers invincible and inflexible the armoured ciuisers carnarvon com wall and kent and the light cruiser glasgow with the result that all the former ships weree sunk except the dresden which mianaged to escape for another three months intil destroyed off juan pernandez no such overwhelming loss wasinflicted ol the germansin any other naval action of a siipilar kind andthe relief afforded was described by mr churchill then first lord as instantane ous before british ships were spread all over the world in their search for the enemy and onconvoy duty and trade protection afterwards there remained practically no vestige of the enemys power in the outer oceans he was driven to resort to underwater craft with which to harass our seaborne trade andoversea communicationsit was merely a coincidenrce but a fortunate one that lord fisher was re called to the admiralty on the day before the loss of admiral cradock at coronel it was fisher who ten years before had inspired the battlecruiser design and therefore knew better than anyone else the uses to which it might be put in battle he took the invincible and in flexible from the grand fleet where  sir john jellicoe rose to the occasion and parted with his two battlecruisers with out a word says mr churchill and these splendid ships travelled  miles to the falklands without a hitch swift ness and secrecy were the twvo elements which chiefly contributed to the favour able situation that developed devon port dockyard would have kept the ships until friday november  to execute urgent repairs apart from the need for haste the day and the date were repug nant to lord fishers and mr churchill ordered the ships to leave on the th which they did taking to sea somo dock yardworkmen and contractors officials nvith themall wireless signalling was forbidden on the passage out and the secret was so well kept that according to the german official naval history no suspicion that the ships had been sent out reached the admiralty staff in berlin much less admiral von spee admiral sturdee was ehiefi as  commanderinchief south atlayttic and pacific from the post of chiefiof the war staff but neither his appointrnentnor that of his successor rearadmiral henry f oliver was published absorbing rearadmiral stoddarts squadron at abrolbos admiral sturdee reachedport stanley in the falklands on the night of decem ber  and at once began coalinga womas assistancesince the coronel disaster the islanders had naturally been concerned for their safety and had raised a keen and efficient volunteer corps who gave valuable assistance to the guardship canopus under captain heathcoat grant rn this old battleship having been run aground in the inner harbour to protect the wireless station the element of luck which seemed to have favoured us throughout these operations was again evident in von spees decision to attack the fauldands which brought him off the islands on the very morning after the british squadron arrived on decem ber  he had captured a british barque with  tons of anthracite and but for a delay of tlhree days in clearing out this prize and sinking her he would have been at the falklands a day before admiral sturdee his purpose was to destroy the wireless station and any naval stores as ell as to capture the governor as an actof reprisalat  on the morning of december  the signal station on sapper hill reported two strange waruships approaching mrs felton the wife of a sheep farmer sent hermaid and houseboy to the top of a ridge to report everything they saw whilst she telephoned the sighting of the enemys ships to the signal station and she continued to send reports of their course the services of both mistress and maid were rewarded by the admiralty with remarkable quickness seeing that coaling was not finished and that some ships had their machinery under over haul by a quarter to  all the ships had steam up and at  the battle cruisers and the cornwall left harbour and joined the other ships already out side wheni adniral sturdee made the signal fora  general chaseby this time the german admiral realizing the significance of the battle cruisers so surprisingly opnosed to him had decided that his only hope lay in flight until pm when the british opened fire on the rearmost ship the leipzig the germans had kept together but soon afterwaidsthe light cruisers were ordered to scatter and make for the south american coast while the armoured cruisers headed in an opposite direction the main action began about  the invincible engaging the gneisenau and the inflexible the scharnhorst adrniral von spee tried to closeto a range at which his powerful secondary battery of in guns could be used but admiral sturdee kept the range open sufficiently to prevent this while at the same time enabling the british in guns to perform their work deliberately he had been ordered not to jeopardize his ships as they were urgently needed for the north sea and this tended to prolong the action when the gernian flagship sank at  pmit was im possible to stopto save life but from the gneisenau which sank at tpxn about germansweresaved in the main action the german ships were destroyed and about  officers and men with the loss of only one life on the british side an able seaman beinr kitled in the ijflexible yet it was curious that theinvincible was hit  times and the inflexible only twiceteecuasemeanwhile the other british ships had gone in piirsuit of the lighter german vessels the glasgow the sole survivor of the coronel reiverse taking part in this action endeavoured to overhaul the flying dresden but without success and there fore engaged the leipzig hoping that the former would turn to her assistance the hope was unrealized and the glasgow assisted by the comiwall sank the leipzig at about  pm after five hours fighting the pursuit of the niirn berg was taken up by the kent an older and slower ship by extraordinary exertions on the part of her engineers who burnt the wood of their own ship to keep her going the kent maintained  knots speed although only designed for  the niirnberg surrendered a little before  oclock but sank before boats could be gotout a strange sight wit nessed from the kent was the appearance of a large fourmasted barque under full canvas as if to bear out the tradition that whenever the british navy is in action there will always be ghostships under full canvas sailing bythe falklands victory as sir henry newbolt said not only wiped out all memory ofcoronel from the worlds con sciousness but established anew the worlds valuation of the british navy sir doveton sturdee was created a baronet for his skilful conduct of the operations and kinggeorge was among the first to offer him congratulations sir doveton has often paid tribute to the bravery and chivalry of ihis opponent admiral von spe who when at val parais after the coronel affair spoke in a dignified mariner of admiral cradock and the royal navy the open fighting of those daysno submarines no mines no torpedo craft or air craft and none of the hideous deathdealing devices adopted laterwas in keeping with old time naval engagements where the exertions of the men behind the guns were of more consequenceit is interesting to note that of the shipswhich fought at the falklands only the glasgow remains in the navy she is on the noneffective list at portsmouth the invincible was sunk at jutland and the inflexible was scrapped in  in this year the kent whose flags hang in canterbury cathedral was sold at hong kong for breaking up by chinese marine dealers some souvenirs of the kent were sent tothe association of men of kent and kentish men who hold their annual meeting on or about the anniversary of the battle to commemorate the gallant service of their nameshipithe action had also its value as a teacher of empire the name of the falkland islands has come to stand for much more than a distait and obscure possession far awavin the south atlantic and many of the visitors to the falklands section at wembley must have displayed a keener interest therein from the recol lection of the services of the british navy in that vicinity
