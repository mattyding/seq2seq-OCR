lord derby atmanchesterspeech on currentpoliticsfrom our o n conrsponndtmanchester dec lordderby presiding at a meeting of the council of the lancashire division of the national union of conservatives and unionist associations held in mfanchester this after noon reviewed the political situation in the country and in lancashire as left by the general election and made a personal  state ment concerning his relations with mr baldwins new oovernment lord stanley mp sir archibald salvidge and sir percy woodhouse were among those on the platformas some of my friends have been good enough to say that they regret i was not included in the present cabinet i want said lord derby to make mr baldwins positign and my own erfectly clear i want to say and i have mr baldwins authority for saying it at the risk of being accused of sour grapes the prime minister has told me that if it had not been for my own ex pressed wish he would have asked me to join the cabinet i want to tell you my reasons for that wish lest it may be thought that i have any resentment or that there is any lack of loyalty in me to the prime mfinisternot only during hir baldwins previous admitnistration but mir bonar laws i was one of those who did his best to secure the reconciliation of both wings of the conserva tive party i also strongly advocated that those who even if they had not got the conservative label were with us heart and soul in the flght against communism should be included in the government and i told both mr bonar law an d subsequently mr baldwin that if there was any chance of their being able to bring other members of the conserva tive party or any outsiders into the cabinetf they might always consider that my resignationi of my post was in their pocket just before the last c eneral  blection and during the election i repeated that to mtr baldwin and he took meat my word and i am glad that he should have done so  but even if be had not taken me at my word i had quite made up my mind that i should not accept office i have never been aseeker after office and i have always felt that there was better work to be done outside than inside the cabinet my duty lies and my inclination is the same luckilyin this county and as long as i can be of any use to you and to the government it is in lancashire that my volitical work will be donc i shall endeavour to the veiy best f my ability to assist the government in this county with wholehearted loyalty saying goodbye prob ably for ever to office no with no feeling of ralentment and no feeling of regret  tireaa op foon tsxescontinuing his lordship said that though the last election was to bq taken as a great victory for the conservative party it was also a great lesson there was a transfer of hundreds oÂ£ thousands of votes within a period of ten months and they must not shut their eyes to the consideration of what made that change in his opinion the election of  was huried and illconsidered and the troops were without ammunition the policy of  had been materialy altered in the recent eleetion and they found themselves in the same place as they were in under mr bonar law in  only rather more so  it has taught me this lesson added lord derby  and that is that the principles of free trade are deeply grounded in the minds of the people of this country and that while they are only too rendy to consider anything which can help to a closer touch between ourselves and our colonies when any question of a taxation of food is raised that consideration will outweigh any other that is why i welcomed mr baldwins poliy at the recent election defnitely pledging himself and his govern ment to put no tax on the food of the people however ve stand now with a defiuite pledge which i am sure will be kept in spirst as well as in the letter that no tax shall be put on the food of the people i hope some other means may be found by which the much desired end of closer relations with the colonies may be attained i was in favour of the morenna duties and the safeguarding of industries act but the powers under both thoee measures have got to be exercised wilh the greatest possible care every case must be considered on its mersts as a free trader i cantot see any objection to dealing with foreign competition in the industries in our country in the way laid down in the safeguarding of industries actlobd densy went on to applaud mr baldwins avoidance of exaggerated promises before the electiom and his general assurance to the counary that he and his governmeut wousld dealnwith all those things that at present most concern the life of the people especially lack of housiug and unemployment  we have got their pledge that they will do their best to remedy both those great ills but i am glad they have given lo definite promise as towhat they vill do or howthey will  it ii hope that in botlh those big questions they will have done such magnificent work four or sive years hence that they wsil be justifled in asking the country for a reaewal of its confidencein a reference to the growing danger of socialiem lord derby said he was sorry for the decrease of the historic liberal pary probably as much opposed to socialism as far as many of its representatives were concerned as the conservatives were  i would infnitely sooner have  won more seats from the socialists atd fewer from the liberals than we did lest time in lancashire we must above all go in for propaganda and get hold of the young men the socialists dont ignore even the children today platitudes are of no use in argument against socialism you have to knowthe socialist case and be prepared to answer it youmusthave good and experienced speakersand here i may say what excellent work the philip stoll college is doing it is not going to be easy work we have had the advantage of the attack during the past ten months  now we are on the defensive and we must not wait till the general election to do it but must be pre pared to argue the policy of the government at all timeslord derby then moved his resolution congratulating the prime minister on his reappointment to office and looking forward with confidence to a long period of stable government on the lines laid down by mr aldwin during the election campaignthis was seconded bv sm arcitald salvidge liverpool who said the first and paramount duty of the
