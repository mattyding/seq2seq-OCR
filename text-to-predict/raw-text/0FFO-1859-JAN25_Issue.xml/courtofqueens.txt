vicar had made several attempts to remove him but ppantly without any knowleage of the tenure upol which he held his offire the vicar on the first orsioa was leing abroad and sent a letter to the clerk removing him butwithout assigping any case and withoutgiving him any opportunity of being hesrd the clerk therefore took no notice of the letter but went on performing hi duties subsequently the vicar came to england and re cognized the clerk in his office so that the first removal went for nothing in the course of last year the vicar re turned to reidence and when in the month of may the clerk sent to him for the keys of the church the vicar sent him a messae by the pewopener that he alould no longer be iparish clerk in july the clerks attorney wrote to the vicar stating that he had nothing to allege against the clerk which could legally or morally justify his dismissal and that he was advised that his dismissal was void the clerk took no further notice of that dismissal but went onx with his duties and received his fees as uisuai subse quently the vicar called upon the clerk and told him to carry buack a stove which he hid some time previously removed from the vestry telling him at the same time tbat its removal was transportable he then said ho dismisse i the clerk from his office and forbade him to enter the desf again he was thus dismissed upon the ground that he had been guilty of a transportable offence it appeared that ihe stove in question belonged to a mr bouvene who had sent it to tho testry about six or seven years ago  but it had failed and was laid aside and removed inti the beufrey the clerk had spoken to mr rogers mr bouveries steward on the subject of the stove ana obtained his per mission about six years ago to have the stove and use it on his own premises and he lad there used it openly for six years general bonverls had lately called on the clerk and told him that the vicar had spoken about the stove and he had better send it bak the clerk accordingly sent back the stove and gave notice to the ticar to restore him to his offloe tut the latter repiied that he should do nothing of the sort the vicar had publlcy stated that he had removed the clerk from his office and co prevented him from receiving his fee  but as he could not exclude him from the church tho clerk had gone as usmal and sat in the readingdesk and continued to say  amen laughter but he could not get his feeslord capiellthe vicar cannot say that he has not removed him the vicar has power to remove the cleik for a just cause after having haird him but he cannot remove
