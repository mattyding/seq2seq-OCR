or longitudeand lay onx her beamends until sunday morning when she was settling very fast captain morris then caued on the men aft and told them to look oat for themselves as he should go down in the ship she soon had every appearanceof sinking the ship had six boats three of which were ntove by the drifting spars about the deck  two were stove alongside and the sixth was launched in safety fxve of the crew jumped into her but sbe was capsized soon after by a heavy sea four of the men got on her bottom and the ff tk  the man savedcaught a rope hanging from the ship and hauled himself on board again he then stripped off part of his clothes and swam to the ships house which had become detached from the wreck he fotund two of the crew on it and was soon after joined by two more who had been floating on portions of ihewreck at this time the ship had entirely disappeared two men soon died from exposure the third man becamo delirious on the ninth day and jumped overboard the fourth died two days before kennedy was picked up he says that ho caught seven smau fish with his bands and occasionally caught water when it rained he accounts for his beinu  days on the wreck from the fact that the
