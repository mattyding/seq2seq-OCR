  the gre asteabr  theprerprations necesary for fitting this noble vessel for on bhave at ladt beei decided en and in the course of another fortnight orso an army of workmen will be buaily engaged in all parts of the shipinside and out for various economical reasons it is considered better that the work of finishing her in every respect aiould be divided betweem three separate contractors and though the contracts iayre not yet been finally entered into thero is tery little doibt butthat this will be the course pursued toone person iill be entrusted the iron work still zequisite in the hull and in the constructiont of the poop and masts while separate con tracts will provide for the igging and salis and the cabn fittings and joiners work nd money will beewasted in the mnerefrippery of decoration though at the same time all thettings will be of the best and most subbtantial kind and quite worthy the position which the ship mnust occupy riot only in england but in the metcantile matina of the world the design for the poop i complete in all its details all of it will be constructed of izon and some ides of its size may be gathered from he fact that the chief dining saloon  feet long by  feet wide and  feet high under the beams wi be in that part of the vessel there is to be a large number of bathrooms allotted to each clas of passengers au of which wll be tkept xuppelewith hot and cold fresh and sea water the contractors are to commence their work on the th of february and are bound under penalties to complete all in five months from that date the longexpected first trial trip will therefore take place about the middle of july when it is intended to run out from weymoith to the middle of the atlantic and try the ahipunder all possible

would instantly in the nautical phrase have taken charge of the whole riverso much has been truly said andwritten as to the im portance of the great eastern in a mercantile point of view that all have tacitly overlooked how as a vessel of war she would to this country at least be almost invaluable in thoe ever recurring estimates of our national resources with whieh the continental press so perseveringly favour us the assistance which two or three such vessels as the great eastern could afford in time in war is never alluded to because never auspected yet in the construction of this unequalled vessel and forming a noble model on which others may be built our national resources have we believe received such a development as few at the first glance would peredve the great eastern however would manke the fastest strongest and most ter riblle of al war ships if war instead of commeice were to bs her destination her carrying power alone would be a meet formidable element ten

in less than half the time now occupied by the fastest ships a there would be no delay for coaling if even the least ban guine eectatlons as to her speed are fulfilled she would be able to land a
