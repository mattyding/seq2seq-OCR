one entitled bst ce la paix esd cela guerre  has been variously at tributed to lf de la guerroniere m de persigny and a  deogirardin bitt i aipretty sure erro neously yet the notionof a general congress sit ting in paris like that of vienna in  for the settlement of europe which is advocated in it is one to which the emperor has been so partial as to lead some to suppose that the writer has a certain authority for his arguments more than five years ago i alluded to the wish of that cherished dream being some day carried out and i doubt that it is as yet abandoned the author dwells on the incom pleteness of the paris treaties of   there were many things he says left unsettled notling was really solved inhis opinion servia is not the real cause of the dispute with austriawe must not deceive ourselves it is the italian ques tion which is at the bottom of the present misunderstand ing certain journals havetried to lead away public opinion by calling attention now to the danubian principali tles now to servia what matter is it that austria with a disregard to treaties may have promised evertual suecourto the pasha who governs belgrade  we are accustomed to the taunts of austria she always speaks loud when the mnuskets are piled she observes a pradent silence when the cannon thuhders ithe writer assumes the fact of deep discontent and irritation in the lombardovemotiax provinces and their invincible antipathy ts austrian rulers no matter how paternal or how liberal and argues that as the continued ocoupatin by austria has be come a public nuisance it ise for the interest of europe to remove it by tkswir means ie possibleif not by force here is ihe ingenious argument em ployedby the pampblscteercivilized nations brave intrduea in their

former case re has a nght to indemnity of what nature shau it be and what i its importace this isdt our busiless to decide it is that of a european congress we merely observe that austria herself hs applied this principle of indemnity when she deprive her aristocracy of their feudal lights she then did whateurope will tery soon be inyited to do with respect to the aestroitalian possessions the motive wustria had for rodeenin her feudal ils  clsame which instinctively impels franice to come to the succour of itslian independence austzia knevw that by taking the initiative in redressing those

it austria did hotvbej the siminmonsaddredsed to herthis is an offhand mode of settling the business if the principle be admitted of compelling a govetn ment to abandon certain portions of territory when its authority is unwillingly received and discontent haa broken out into resistance there are few that might not be called upon for such a sacrifice russia ana pruia might be  invited to disgorge their respective shares of poland the sultan might be sumnmoned to give up nearly the whole of his euro pean territory what is sought to be enforced on austria in respect of her italian possessions is appli cable to her for hungary and her rounman subjects nd to bring the matter nearer home france her self might be cited before the bar of this great euro pean tribunal and receive due notice to quit her african dependencies which are her excuse for keeping on foot great armies for it was only a day qr two ago that an expeditionary force was once more on foot to put down another rising of moun taineers who has given to france the right ofdummoningacongress h the object of compellinga portion of her territory to which her right whatever it be other wise is at ieast as legitimaate asthat of france to her colonies in the meantime i regret to say that confidence in peace is grwing less i have already lluded to the reports of reinforcements of the french troops at rome as well as other indications of a warlike tendency and i find that some who very recently dis believedinwarseem now toalmost despair ofitsbeing much longer postponed there is nothing done on the part ot the offcial organ of the government to allay the fears of the public or to neutralize the efflect of the warlike journals a brief frank de claration from an official quarter is looked for in vain this silence is productive of immense evil morally and materially the day for dissembling has gone by dissimulation says lord bacon is but a faint kind of policy or wisdom for it asketh a strong wit and a strong heart to know when to tell trath and to do it therefore it is the wseaker kind of politicians that are the greatest dissemblers with lombardy so completely disabled for any serious attempt ast rising we are yet told thait austria will not take the initiative in the rupture  that sardinia will hardly do so unsupporied and that france will watch events and be readv for every eventuality such a position cannotlastlong it is like the situation of the group in the cztieuncles nieces and whislcerandos holding the dag gers at each others throatsyour observations on the necessity of maintaining an imposing naval force against eventualities have met with warm approbation from all reflecting men here should war once break out no one can say what complications may arise and vithout being alarmists there is no harm in being well on the look outan aidedecamp of prince napoleon arrived this morning in paris from turin with despatches from his highness to the emperor can it be the treaty between france and sardinia or the official acceptance of the demand of the princess clotildes han  or botha private letter from vienna states that the rumour again circulates of the probable formatioi of an austrian army of observation on the frontier of poland of the concentration of troops by russia in that province and the fact of this last report not being denied but rather countenanced at the rus sian embassy in the austrian capital it adds  the movement of troops is not discontinued and the warlike sphit is appearing among the austrian youthnumerous volunteers present themselves for enrolment in the battalions of chasseurs but for the present their ser vices are declined there are people who still speak of con ciliation the latest accounts fromn lombardy mnention no new incident but it is still the calm which precedes the tempest so long as the italians hope that they wil have the cooperation of foreignersthe situation of trade in france at the present time may be described by one wordstagnation a period of excessive activity has bcen followed by a time of extreme caution after too great rash ness has comiie extraordinary prudence this re laxation affords the commercial world an op portunity of renewing the discussion between the partisans of free trade and the defenders of the old prohibitive system which prevents french manufac tures from making any progress the latter more over are endeavouring not only to influence but even to exercise a pressure on the government it is to be hoped that the emperor wvillnot yield to the petitions presented by individuals who under pre tence of protectingnational interests are endeavour ing to serve their private ends the course hitherto pursued by the government is to advance slowly it is true but with caution so as not to be compelled subsequently to recede the question of free trade m corn is that which at present is most warmly debated at a late meetino of farmers m pommier an excellent authority on the subject told themdo not cadl for protection it is a twoedged sword though it prevents foreign corn from competing with you in your own markets it deprives you of a vast field of enterprise by pre venting you from exporting your corn nluse rous examples have proved that he was right and spain at this moment affords another after hanving permitted the free importation of foreign corn for two years the spanish government has lately closed the ports and the consequence is an unnaural rise of prices in the interior andd b complete stagnation of commercial operations at santander bareelona and cadiz the keeping open of the fennch polts lst year for the free admission of foreign corn was of immiense advantage to france in gnral not withstanding tho large quantities imported through havre and marseilles there was so much ex ported that tlhe balance of cash reeiived was greatly in favour of france and contrited to form the of which have been added to the circu lation within the last  months the greatest pro tection that can bo given to the farmers is to open new markets for thtm the dangers created by the sliding scale ire scarcity when the crop fails and an exeesivetylow price when the ports are closed against exportation when free trade in corn is proclarvmed there will be neither scarcity norexcess or prodnction and prices will naturally find a
