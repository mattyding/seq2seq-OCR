among whom were the hon p p boaverle ilp mr f pigott xp mr d h burr the rev w phelps the mayor of reading mr j b monek aldermen harris and walford cthechaib gave the usual loyaltoastslï¿½r moxck proposed  the health of the county meon bers loud applausemr palmr iip wasloudly applauded after thank ing them for the kind manner in which they had received him he proceeded to say that he had now been their meoa ber for a great number of years and it was really high time they ahould get lome one more able to do their busness loud cries of  no no he could not but feel that they might have some one more competent to discharge those duties than he couald pretend to be at his time of life fov his wa part he was always anxious to give satisfaction to those whom he represented and during the time he had been in their service ho mnight for themost part have succeeded applause of course they were all aware that in a very few days they woltd be caued to their duties and probablv one of the earliest propositions they would be called upon to consider was that known by the name of reform or alteration in the representation or the people it would be impolticon his part at thepresent moment to pledge himself to any course of proceeding on that question they had seen a measure within the last two days which had been brouht together with great care and inventionby a man whominhimself was not unworthy of attention but he wvould not pretend to sy at the present moment that that was a measure necessary or that it was one that would be adouted he understood that there was a schedule which had come out in a paper that morninga paper of very great authority and by which people were all more or less influenced they wonld be able to compare the two mneasures ut they must remem ber there was still a third of whieh they were all igonorant and there was no one except the members of the govern mentwhowas at allawarewhat that measure of reform might be when it came forward they might find that it was a measure much more liberal than many people thought it would be rear hear whatever it might be or whateverother measares might be propounded at the present time he should pledge himself to nothing a laugh but he should do his best to give them his most careful con sideration applaulse he should give his support to that measure which be considered best whether propounded by government or anybody else and more than all he should not do that hastily without having had an opportanity of ascertainiing the general opinion of those in whom he placed so much confidence loud aonlausexne nion r r zovverre alf said that certainlythey were on the eve of the consideration of a reat question and having avowed himself when he hadthe onour of being re turned in favour of progress he might say that there were certain propositions of reform in which be shonld concur the reform biu of the present year  was a very dif ferent thing from that of  having a seat in the house of commons at that tune he was one of those who voted in favour of the chandos clause which gave the  votes but it seemed to him that the present measure whether it was lord derbys or mr brights or the one propounded in the times newspaperwhichever it was de served the appellation not of a reform bill but of an enlargement of the franchise mr brlght bad propounded many principles with which he could not agree loud applause the rev gentleman who had addressed them had spoken in favouer of a limited maonarcby mr bright was also in favour of a limited mxonarchy in this he thoroughlyagreed with the hon gentleman but his next proposition was one from which he totally dissentednamely that the house of lords is the representative of the landed interest only in his ur bouveries opinion there should be members of the landed interest in the house of commons lond applause instead of leavig it to be represented by the house of lords ap plause the house of lords were supposed to be generail statesmen and they knew from experience that many of them were statesmen by no meazs inferior to anyinthehouse of commons and they judged au the measures that came under consideration but the great proposition seemed to be the enlargement of the fran chise and whatever those schedules might contain until they knew to what extent the franchise would be enlarged what the number of voters would be under the new eigme it was very difficult to say what places should be disfran chised as his hon colleague had stated at present he should pledge himself to nothing a laugh in mir brights scheme he thought there was a great deal that was good and he thought also there was a greatdealthatwasbad loud applause therewere at least  members given to the metropolis that seemed to him out of all proportion at the same time he would avoid the other extreme every man had his own nostrum and he must confess that he rather liked the scotch system where three or four small towns were put together and they generazly sent a very good representative bat if the smau countytowns wereto be deprivedofreprentation heshould think there ought to be more repreentatives given to the counties if the numberof voters in counties was very much increased he presumed that the counties would be subdi vided however till they knew the whole story they hardly knew which way they should vote but he nevr could for one moment acknowledge that the landel interest was not to be represented in the house of commons because there was a house of lords appiausethe c urrse proposed the healt of the borough members mr f pigott and sir h keating apdlause re was happy to say that the learned gentleman vas im proving in health and shortly would be able to resume his dutiesa fact which all who knew his talents and his worth mnust feel grateful at hearing loud applausemr pigotr mp in responding paid a high compliment to the consistency and high character of mr r palmer observing that there were very few men in the house oi commons who held a higher position than he did and the county of berks scarcely could have a more usefal member loud applause both the hon gentlemen bad touched slightly upon the question of reform thy were both his seniors ind they had both shown rauch discretion in treating the subject for after speak ing of what was likely to happen they wisely concluded by sayinggentlemen we pledge ourselves to nothing laughtehe begged to occupy the same position renewed nghernut tb is ewould say bethoughb the country was likely to have a great deal of choice the all looked with the deepest anxiety for themeasure of the government the production ofthat would show them at once what part they were to take and whatever part that might be he trusted that they bad but one object in view that was the welfare and stability of the institutions ofthis great country loud applause there could be no doubtthat society owed much to the reform bill of  times had very much changed since then but stil they were au inaprogressive state and it was necessary that institutions should undergo repair and re novation the same as aaything else loud applauseother toasts of a local nature followed
