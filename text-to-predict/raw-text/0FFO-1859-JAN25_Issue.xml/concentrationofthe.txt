oorntatratiroz of he law courtsst night sir richard bethel presided and spoke at a meeting of the law amendment society specially con vened at their house in waterlooplace to consider the question of the concentration of the courts of common law and equity in a convenient and central situation in the metropolis there was a condderable number of mem bers both of the equity and common law bars present and the subject gave rne to an animated discusdonmr edward webster of the equity bar read the eport of a committee of the society specially appointed to consider the question this document stated that while we prided ourselves on our laws and considered the ad mimstration of jnstice in this country one of its highest tlitles to the admiration of the civilized world we had no fitting temple devoted to a department of die public service m which so much of oar liberty happines and national honour was involved the committee considered that the erection of nlew superior courts of civii procedure ia the metropolis had become indisaensable and it was a nuestion of great natienal imdrtance where they should be located the dispersion ofthe chambers and offices belonging to the several courts was a great public evilandserious y etrimental to the profession and the suitors the committee urged that the courts should be situated so near to each other that after an advocate had been selected and feed he should be able to render the services for which he had been engageda result which under the existing arrangements was nearly impossible they suggested the establishment of a hall as a place of resort for the members of the legal profession which would be to lawyera what the royal exchange was to merchants and by affording constant opportunities for conversation would save an immense amount of epistolary correspond ence on matters of business the committee dwelt in much detail upon the inconvenienoe and expense consequent upon the present arrangement alike to professional men suitors jurors and witnesses and upon the obstacles it presented to the proper administration of justice they deprecated the dealing wiith this importantsubect in a piece meal way and argued that what was wanted was a large palatial building a temple of justice worthy by its archi tectaral proportions for the great national purposes to which it would be devoted and situated as near to lincolnsinn as it could be consistently with a due regard to sanitary considerations the site they indicated as the best for such a buuding was the district located between careystreet lincolnsinn and the strand and the remainder of the report was devoted to a consideration of the question of expense connected with the projectsir r bertell said about three years ago being at that time in office he drew the attention of the then exist ing government to the plan then embodied in the well written report which bad just been read the meet ing was aware that the subject had received the attention of the law society some considerable time ago he was then in communication with many leading members of that society and certainly approved very strongly of the principle contained in the plan sauggeaed he put the matter to the government in nearly the same shape as it was now presented by the report some httle difficulty was felt on the financial part of the subject it did not ap pear to him ite right to derive the whole of the neces sary funds from the fund in the castody of the court of chancery but he thought a very considerable portion of the funds might be derived from that source provided a guarantee was given that in the event of a claimant to any part of the fund in the custody of the court of chancery making good his right at any time the demand would be met by the government it was found on a com putation then made that the country could afford to pay a very considerable annual sum if they received proper accom modation in this matter and he therefore proposed that an annual rentcharge should be made on the consolidated fund being a sum paid by the govermment in return for the accommodation thus afforded to the public aud it was part of his plan to capitalize that sum upon the financial details he almost satisfied the iealous and hesitating mind of the chanceuor of the rxequer but governments were proverbially slow a laugh and the english mind was still more proverbially reluctant to get rid of any old hereditary institu tion however mischievous it might be a laugh it would not therefore be a matter of wonder that there was considerable slowness shown in embracing the proposal still he had reason to suppose that he should have been allowed to bring in a bill on the subject in the course of the session in which the government came he would not say to an untimely endbut to a natural death a laughl he hoped however that the next session would not be entirely occupied by other discussions to the exclusion of this great plan of legal reform ehear hear he called it a great plan of legat reform because it was a thing most earnestly to be desired that that dissociation of the different branches of the administration of jastice which had so long prevailed from accidental cirenmshnces should be put an end to and that all departments concerned in that administration should be brought into the most easy constant and habitual communication with each other hear it was perfectlytruethatin agreatnumberof departments the division of labour promoted utility and economy but then that must be where au the operatives were working together for one common end and it must not be where they had the departments of a system work ing in competition to one another he was in the hope of bringing what might be caued tho legal and equitable mand into public harmony and leading them to perceive in reality one great leading principlethe administration of justice in simple and uniform modes of procedure he was desirous that all the members of tho profession should be brought into the daily habit of ob serving the administration of justice and then becoming as it were the critics and commentators of its rules and modes of procedure they might at last hope to arrive at a uniform system and set of principles in the administration of justice such as obtained in almost every other country except oar own the system of administering justice in this country had been divided by accident and that which was our misfortune had become our characteristic they would observe whatagreat misfortune it had been for the common law to be administered in westminster hall the equity law in lincolnsinn and the ecclesiastical law in that old cavern or den which used to exist at doctorsecommons laughter they must be brought together in the end there was another minor advantage of union which had not been touched upon no one who was desirous of advancing the law and improving the adminis tration of justice could fail to entertain along with it the desire that those rreat institutions of the country the inns of conrt should flourish together with the improvement of the law and the mode of administering it and he sir richard bethel was extremely desirous that the courts might be placed in such a locality as might be convenient not only to those societies but also to the public at large he thought therefore if a great palace of justice were locally situated immediately between the temple and lincolnsinn and connected by a light elegant bridge thrown over fleetstreet that the value of the build ings of these societies might be very much augmented while justice would be located on its matural site in imme diate connexion with the habitations of those who would daily and habituallyresort to the tribunals where it was administered hear hear by suchan arrangement they would recur to the ancient usage under which jastice was administered in one place westminsterhall was the old habitual local habitation of all law and it was consi dered as dwelling there according to the theory of the con stitution and the langpage of our acts of parliament the learned gentleman concluded by repeating that when in office he had made it his especial duty to bring this subject under tbe consideration of the government and expressed his regret that its progress had been retarded partly by the vis inertue characteristic of all governments and partly by the dissolution of that of which he was a memberadding however that he hoped soon to see it meet with that atten tion an respect from parliament which its great public importance demanded cheersmr aituur kinnaurd mp as a layman expressed a hope that if the vis inertims so peculiar to governments should manifest itself in the existing government with re spect to this great public question the learned gentleman sir r bethell would himself take an early opportunity of urging it upon their attentionin the discussion which preceded and followed the speech of sir richard bethell mr alfred hill mr b f moore mr hastings mr trower mr t webster mr edward lawrrence br collier mp mr goldsmid and other members of the bar took part and evenutally on the

matter under the consideration of the governmentmr john stuart ill was unanimously elected a member of the society and the meeting separated between  and n ocock
