believed that the sardinan premier is the prime mover in and promoter of this alarming agitation and that ne has for months past been doing all in his power to involve his country in war the responsibility he incurs is heavier even than would be that of almost any prime minister who should pursue a similar course cotuit cavoul is a great power in italy so great is the confidence repoxed in him that i do not go too far in asseftirig that a signal from him would suffice to produce an insurrection in almost any part of italy or through out the whole of the country however hopeless of success such an attempt might be the people might ee they had no chance of victory but they would believe cavour before their wn conictions he obtains the same implicit and confiding obedience from many political men here who are ready at any time blindly to follow whithersoever he may choose to lead there are persons here both in and out of the chamber of deputies who following their own judgment would decidedly disapprove a war but who yet will do their utmost to bring it about if cavour says that it is to be  a man may well be proud of inapiringjbyhis talents charactr and past career such unliuited confidence but it also mireases the measure of his responsibility there are in piedmont ardentand devoted partisans of the italian cause eager for the liberation of their country who yet do not think the moment well chosen nor the ally safe they eo louis napoleon looked on with suspicion byall the powers of europe they themselves shnare thegene ral mistrust and theyhave a keen

may with impunity be despoiledibutsitsdiffi cult to believe that she will be brought to that pads until after a long struggle  some ofmy military friends here who had personal opportunitiesof juidgingthetroops of austria in  and those of earance in the crimea are quite convinced that acampaign betweon the two powers would qutckly terminate in favour of the latter hat tho austrians would everywhere be drivenmj said thei french win in a canter i attach more weight to this opinion than at first sight it mightb seem to deserve because it isthatof at leastone officer of great military experience and aecosilishuhents andwhosejudgment i noti think biassed by national sympathies andantpthies b even ad mitting that a french and piedmontese army quicldy established an overwhelming superiority over the austrans in the field the latter have a formidable array of fortresses to retire to and it would be unreasonable to suppose that they would not defend these so as greatly to protract the coi flict during its progress who can foresee the changes and complications tat might arise t would it surprise any one who has studied the paitlistory and the persistent instincts of the great european powers to see a general war terminated by a coa lition of russia prusia and austria gainst france this may almost be conidered a pro bability which would be rendered faint bnly by unprecedented aind improbable moderation and selfdenial on the part of france who can expect her to display these qualities is she goi gtb engage in a costly war out of pure love to italy and her cause and will she bedisposed to retire from if if successful uncompensated for her expenditure andunaggrandized by her victories if theeniberor i napoleon m were inclined to content himself with the

costly feast of gloryeven though a lice of savoywere added by ayi of dessert supposinghowever a contrary event here thought most improbablendthatfrance siid piedmont were ultimately worsted the italians think their object would be at least partially at taied for that the great powers in re deranpoing matters would be careful to get rid in some iayof that standing peril to the peace of europe whichl austrian domiunion in italy would have been provedl to beif the threatened anonialous crusade of despotic france against despotic austria in the cause oft italian liberation is to lead to a gnental war pro bably most persons not italians wll tbnkthe price rather high topay forthe emancipation of iombardovenetiais even though that eniaii cipation should lead as it very probably would to a general amendment of government through out the whole italian peninsula it is impos sible to say what the secret wishes and policy of certain governments may be but if the questioh were put to the vote among the nations of europe i sispect that a very strong majority would vote against war the italians of course take a diffe rent view of the case and their eagerness to drive matters to extremities goes far to justify the asser tion sometimes made thatthey ari perfectly ready to set europe in a conflagration i order that they may cook their dinner by the blaze they feel thatin the eyes of the world this is the weakpoint inl their position and they seek to cover it by saying that the question must end in war some day or other o that it is best to fight it out at oncecertanly an
