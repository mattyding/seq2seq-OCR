austriauforo our own oorb pondrntvienna avam it is extremely difficult to convey a correct idea of the exact position of affairs in austria just at pre sent though it is universally acknowledged that things are not as they should be either the will or the power to remedy the evil is wanting the people are systematically taught to believe that the presence of a handfull of fugitives in england is the  sole cause of the disturbed state of hungary and italy and in this idea they are confirmed by a ser vile press it is still the fashion here to sneer at the antemarch rgine but at all events the statesmen of the old school managed matters infi nitely better than their successors the trae cause of the impotence of the cabinet is its total want of moral courage and candour it would perhaps be unjust to afflrm that things are systematically misrepresented to the sovereign but it is certai that matters are so managed that false impressions are frequently produced it is not ne cessary to be more explicit on this subject as you must be well aware that since the infamous attack on his majesty we have had almost daily proofs of the correctness of my assertion the deputations from all parts of the empire have been so numerous and the professions of loyalty so warm that if we were not well aware that the prisons are crowded to excess we might be induced to believe that there was not a single dissatisfied man in austria govern ment affectsaprofoundcontemptforthe opinion of the foreign press but the unanimity which the leading english and french journals have shown in con demning the confiscation of the property of the lombard exiles has produced a much deeper effect than people are willing to confess the foreign re lations of austria are but little more satisfactory than are home matters her position in regard to switzerland and sardinia is too well known to re quiremention here the french emperor shows himself less compliant than formerly because he is well aware that all the influence of this court is employed to prevent the popes leaving rome the czar is warmly attached to the emperor francis jo seph and will certainly always make common cause with him in keeping down the revolutionary party in europe but the interests of the two countries are so much opposed in the east that the intimate alliance can hardly be of long duration unless austria is prepared to yield on all points the hatred to great britain has reached such an absurd pitch that a person who is well aware how dearly austria is obliged to pay for the assistance received during the hungarian war a few days since ob served that  a fillip from russia was more ac ceptable than a favour would be from england it is highly possible that other accounts from vienna may represent matters in a more favourable light but you may be assured that there is no exaggera tion in what has been saidmustapha effendi the sultans adjutant arrived here the day before yesterday in the evening a tyrolese
