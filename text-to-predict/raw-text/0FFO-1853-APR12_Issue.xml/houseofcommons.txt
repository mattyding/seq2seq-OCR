same time he might fur ther state tbat looking at the lamentable nature of the eaccideut he had thought it right to issue special directions for a full investigation and that investigation would em brace a consideration of the rocket apparatus and lifeboats ased on the occasionil kennedy inquired of the president of the board of trade whether any investigation had been made by her jfljestys government into the causes of the numerous disasters which have recently occurred in the coasting and channel traffic of the united kingdom more particularly those having referenceto the following

officea employed smnder the board of trade had orders to report on every occurrence of the nature referred to and with reference to ihe case of the victoria he stated that captain walkers mreport had been laid on the table of the house and had been communicated to the ballast board of dublin and to the company to whom the steamer belongedwrit for carlow countyon the motion of lord mosicx a new writ was ordered to issue for the election of a new member for the county of carlow in the room of colonel broed deceased mhe noble lord explained that though the death of colonel sbruen occurred some time since yet as the petition against hsis return and claiming the seat had only been withdrawn that day the motion for a new writ could not be made earlierthe customs departmentmr wilson gave notice that as on thursday next he tehould move for certain papers in relation to the report of the customs committee and in reference to the report made to the treasury by the commissioners of customs thereon he should take that opportunity of stating to the flouse what steps the government intended to take in aespect to tnat important questionclergy reserves canadasir j pakington asked the noble lord the member for the city of london wvhat in the opinion of her ma jestys goverrment of course he meatan opinion founded on the opinion of the law officers of the crown would be ihe force and effect ef the guarantee upon the consolidated ffund in sec s of the act d and th victoria c  in the event of the clergy reserves bhing seculrized by the legis lature of canada lord j russell replied that her majestys govern anent had not asked for the written opinion of the law offi cers of the crown but he had seen them and they had given their opinion to him that in the event of the clergyeserves being secularized by the legislature of canada and the act receiving the royal assent there wvould be no claim for payments to be made from the consolidated fund hearsir j pakington said the answer of the noble lord made it necessary for him to ask another question  and ithat was whether in the course of the progress of the clergy eserves bill through that house it was the noble loras intention on the part of the government to take any ateps to give effect to that guarantee the obligation of which he hasd distinctly recognizedlord jrussell said it was certainly not the intention nf government to introduce any clause to make that gua mantee binding hear hearpauper settlementsir w jolliffe asked the president of the poor law board whether it was the intention of the government to bringforward duringthepresent sesion measures either lo alter or repeal the laws with respet to pauper settlement in england and wales and if bills with that or any other oor law objects were to be proposed at what period theyere likely to boon the table of the house mr banes observed that on monday next the noble ord the member for london would in reply to a question of which notice had been given state what were the inten tions of the government with respect to the subjectuniversity reformmr milnes said that the noble lord the member for the city of london had in his speech on the general subject of educationstatedthedesire ofthagovernmentto give every encouragement to the universities to institute measures of nezfreform the noble lord in that speech used the word  universitica and it was desirable to know whether in rsing that term the noble lord intended to use it in the aaorerestrictedsense of the corporate body of each university er in a more comprehensive sense extending to the separate colleges this subject excited considerable interest as a large body of persons however anxious they might ibo to make alterations felt themselves bound by certain abligations from which nothing but superior powers could relieve them re therefore asked the noble lord wheiher in his declaration of the intentions of the government on the subject of the reform of the niversities he intended to imply that the support and assistance of the government would be given to such col leges as might be desirous to obtain the aid of parliament to enable them to dispense with their obligations to their resent statutes and to substitute such other statutes as night seem to them advisable for the advantage of their nseparate societie and for the public goodlord j ruissell said that in the general way in which she question was put he was unable to give an affirmative answer to it for the question seemed to be this would eho government lend aid to the colleges to dispense with lheirstatutes whatever those statutes might be and to mibsutitute others for them it was impossible that he could isind the government to such an extent but he would say with respect to the colleges as with respect to the univer tnices that the government would take into consideration nny proposition from the colleges as well as from the univer sities supposing the public good to be attained by the pro posed alterationclbrgy pveives canadaon the order of the day for the third reading of this billmer walpole moved that it be read a third time that ay six months the right hon gentleman said that enter laining as he did a very strong opinion on the subject he izrsted he should be permitted to state the more prominent xeasona that induced him to resist the further progress of his bill he was the more anxious to do so in cousequenceof the discussion that took place in committee and the btrange admissions then made on the part of the govern anent and partly also in consequence of the somewhat singulzr and certainly surprising announcement made upon eke subject that evening by the noble lord the member for khdon it was clear to him from the discussion in com mittee that the principle on which the bill had been recom xnended to the house was not strictly that upon which it had keen framed inay more he thought itwouldappearthat the maain effect and object of the measure was not exactly whatit was represented to be and that it would have a different operation from that which constituted the principle upon which it was stated to have been framed at the time of the second reading they were told that the great object of the measure was to give to the canadian legis aature the fulleat powers upon all matters of purely local concern and interest but in committee it appeared that it would not be confined to those matters but in fact zelated to investments made in this country and enabled the canadian legislature to deal with those investmentsander the plea of local selfgovernment though no local in terest waa in any wayaffected by them again at the time of the second reading they were told that the effect of the bill would be to put the english and scotch churches on precisely the same footing as the romau catholic church of canada but in committee it appeared the footing would be different and the endowments given to roman catholicsmight not be touched without the concurrence of the im ferial parliament whilo endowments given to the protestanta of canada could be touched dealt with and de stroyed by any measure pased by a majority of the can dian legislature alono hear hear again at the time of the second reading they were told anud properly so that there were certain existing interests reserved for thos to whjomatlsey now belonged on the ground that the faith ofthe crown was pledged to maintain them but whor they preseed her majestys ministers for an answer as to the way in which that pledge was given no answer could be elicited because they knew that if they looked to the act of parlia ment the faith of the crown was no more pledged to those particular interesta than it was to maintain the whole of these reserves hear again they were told at the time of the second reading that the settlement of  was not a compact in the sense of its being a nationalengagement but in committee the d clause was withirawn on the express groundtbat the settlement of  was a compact as far as it affected the liability of this country these were incon aiatencies and anomalies which convinced him that this bill was not drawn up with that consideration which might be expected from the government now let them consider upon what principle the bill was founded and what were the considerations which induced the government to introduce it they were meet ably stated by the chan cellor of the exchequer and he thought the argument upon which the government juatified the measure so put by the right hon gentleman might reeolve itself into theeo two main pointsfirst that it was the duty of parliament to give to the canadian legislature the largest powers with reference to matters of purely local selfgovernment and secondly that if those powers were diminished or abridged there was a danger of provoking discontent in the colony or of a collision between the canadian legislature and the imperial parliament he was not goidg to dispute the ques tion of local self government for he was for giving such power in the fullest sense of the word as zoon as a colony wasa capable of receiving it and undertaking the responsi bility of constitutional government but he doubted whe ther the question of selfgovernment strietly arose on this occasion and for this reason that he thought there were anterior obligations reting on the imperial parliament to take care that certain rights which had been guaranteed by paallamentshould be preservedto those for whom theywere intended and if that were so it was their business to in quire whether the imperialparliament had notdutiesto dis cbarge with reference to this case which it could not dele gate to other parties unless it was eatisfied that those par ties would disebarge the duties sodelegated as well as them selves were they satisfied that would be the case  sup pose they delegated to the canadian legislature the duties they had imposed on themselves by the acts of  and  were they sure the canadian legislature with all the influence prefsing upon it was capable of deaiig with the question as they themselves wouldt were they sure it wvas capable of adjusting all the differences that had arisen and that would arise between the different religious bodiesbe tween the rooman catholica and the protestants the preeo byterians and the episcopaliansbet ween those who were advocates for secularization and those who were advocates of religions endowments unless they were satisfied of that they could not delegate these duties to the canadian legislature it was the imperial par liament that made the settlement of  by that settlement a compromise of rights was effected and that compromise was matured according to the opinion of the chancellor of the exchequer into a distinct compact parliament prescribed the trusts upon which this property was to be held and guaranteed those trusts in perpetual continuance partly by the declaration in the preamble of the statute that the gettlement was final and partly by pro viding that it should not be disturbed without the concur rence of parliament itself it was stated by the chancellor of the exchequer that the trusts would be duly folfilled because he believed that the canadian legislature would deal with this question as the imperial parliament itself would and would not eecularize these reserves but did the ma jority of hon gentlemen in that house entertain that opi nion hear and ifthe reserves should be secolarized in what position would parliament be placed  they were in the position of trustees having the control over these funds and knowing that would they allow them to be dis posed of in a manner contrary to the express terms upon which they had been held could they do that without making themselves gravely responsible they could not enable persons to do a wrong act unles they made themselves equally guilty and responsible with the persons by whom the act was done but then arose the queation was there not such a trust as that to which he had alluded that must be determined by reference to the statutes or charters under which the reserves were given originalyand subsequently confirmed to the protestant clergy of canada henbelieved the title of these reserves was almost coeval with the cession of canada they were intended for endowments of the protestant clergy and the promotion of the protestant faith at the time of the cession canada was peopled by french people of the roman catholic religion iost properly and wisely therefore the parliament of this country by a bill in  secured to the roman catholic clergy all their accustomed dues and rights but thinking it desirable to encourage protestant emigra tion to those new poesessions other dues and rights which had not been appropriated to the roman catholic clergy were by the same act reserved and secured to the protestant clergy who might go out to canada and they were made up by royal proclamation in  which directed for the first time that oneseventh of the nonappropriated lands should be applied to the pnr pose the title of the roman catholics and the title o the protestants therefore stood on the same footing if they shcok the title of the one they shook the title of the other and that title was distinctly confirmed by the constitutional act of  the chief commissioner of the board of works had rested his argament mainly on that sta tute and thought it gave a less clear and perma nent right to the protestant clergy of the churchos of england and scotland than the act of victoria but that statute showed that the lands allotted up to that time and all thereafter to be allotted either to the maintenance of the protestant clergy or the promotion of the protestant faith were given to them in words and terms dra wn up in the best way to provide for their permanency it waseaid there was a varying power in that statute which i enabled the canadianlegislature to deal withthesereserves he thought there was no such power and that the clause which was said to be an enabling clause was but a restrain ing clause the constitutional act of  gave to the canadian legislature the fullest power of legislating on canadian matters with certain restraints before the assent or dissent of the crown could be expressed upon any of their act those powers were contained in the statute of  before they came to the d clause which was the im portant one and that clause instead of being an enabling clause was a restraining clause which prohibited the crosw from assenting to any lawof the canadian legislature unless the bill had been laid before parliament for  days  and if either house refused its concurrence in the bi and addressed the crown on the subject within  days the crown waa restrained from giving such assent it must be remembered that when these appropriations were made all the lands were the property of the crown and the crown had as much right to make these appropriations to religious bodies for the purposes of religion as to dedicate them to any other purpose he contended that a pledge was given that the permanence of the trusts should nobt be altered and if that were so in wrhat way wrould they displace the right was the title ever disputed until quiterecently it was true that in  there was a contest as to the mode in which the reserves should be distributed but that did not apply to the title it was also true that in  and down to  the house of assembly in upper canada tried to deal with these reserves and to get the crown to assent to it but the legislative council always resisted it the governors and the home authorities always resisted it and no change was made in the statute of  by parliament or the government of this country until  and in what way were these re serves dealt with in that year  they were dealt with by the statute ofyictoria in very nearly the sameway as they were dealt with in the act sent over from canada in the previous y ear in that act it was provided that the reserves should be held exclusively for religious purposes and that the english and scotch churches might be entitled to them in the same proportions as provided by the act of the imperial parliament and the onlydifterencebetweenthe two acts was that bythe atter statute onehalf of the reserves was tobedis tributed by the governor and executive council among the diferent religious bodies in canada while by the former the reserves were to be distributed with reference to the proportion of each section of christians in canada the parliament that made that settlement considered it final and the canadian legislature which accepted that settlementconsiderea it tobepermanent and so itcontinued until  as far asengland was concerned that was proved in the moat conclusive manner by the noble lord the mem berl for leondon the noble lord said it would be better to settle the whole question at once and to comprise that set tlement in one statute it was also proved by the statute itself which declared that the settlement was intended to be final and as far as canada was concerned it vas proved partly by the act of the canadian legislature to which he had referred and partly by the declaration of some of those persons who were now moving for the repeal of that statutetr robert baldwin late attorneygeneral for upper canada declared in  during a debate on the re serves that the bill passed by the legislature of upper ca nada in  led to a final disposal of the question by the imperial parliament that he called on hon members to mark his words that if the question were reopened former fierce agitation would be resumed that so much did he dread the renewal of agitation that he had in every instance and in toto discountenanced such a course and that he therefore pressed upon both aides of the house to forbearrenvmg the questionlet him cite another opinion delivered at the same time in the same place again mr price in  ia the same houseo of aseembly declared that the settlement under lord sydenbam bad been considered final that peace had succeeded the long and fierce confict and tho country was settling down in the hope that agitation on that subject was at an end and that although threefourths of the people believed that the ar rangement was made on injustice and partiality they quietly submitted as the only means of restoring peace to the land that proportionate to that hope vould be the grief and ex citement produced by the reopening of the questionyet the mr price who in  delivered this opinion was precisely the gentleman under whoso auspices agitation had recommenced in canada for the purpose of destroying the settlement which so recently be bad declared to be final hear hear a third member of the colonial legisla ture mr cameron said on the samo occasiont that he was one of those who acquiesced in tho settle ment and for the sake of peace wished never to hear it again and that he warned the house to let the act of the imperial government take its course let the land be sold and the different churchea get the proceeds in strictaccordance theretothe question so discussed in the colonial legislature was referred to a committee of the house and the redort of that committee was to this effect that the excitement which eo unhappily existed on the subject for eo many years was at length set at rest by the imperial statute d and th victoria chap  that it was intended to be a final settlement of the question that net withatauding the inequality of the divlsion it was acceqted by the inhabitants of the province as such and tlb at no change or deviation from the system then existing sbould be unctioned by the legislaturehe would ask then was it wise was it deeent to ask the imperil parliament to set aside a settlemen which the imperixl parliament had solemnly made wich the cana dianu parliament and the canadian peopih had solemnly accepted  hear bear what were mdn to trust to ifif ever a settlement was solemnly made if ever a gusrantee was solemnly entered into if ever a duty was impoied nyon parliament that eettlementwas made that guarantee was entered

gentlemans justifi cation on the part of tbe government for withdrawing the third clause of the bill  he himself said tho right hon gentlemanwas a party in  with his noble friend the member for the city of london to the arrangements which then took place on this sulbject aud he really must say that it appeared to him that nothing could be more distinct than the provislios of that act which amounted both in spirit and in letter to a compact between this country and that colony it was not merely a compatt by construction but a compact of the most distint kindif then this was a c mpact distinctly imposing an obliga tion upon this country it must
