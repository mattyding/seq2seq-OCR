becclemstical courtsthe following resolutions have been agreed to by the committee on ecclesiastical courts and have been ordered to be submitted to tho society for promoting the amend ment of the law lthatthopreaentjurisdictionof the ecclesiastical courts so far as testamontary mattets are concerned is universally admitted to be unsatisfactory and requires extensive re form that this reform should consist of a transfer of their present jurisdiction in testamentary matters to a court clothed with jurisdiction as well over wills of real as of per sonal estate  that to create a new court for the purpose would be unadvisable if any existing court can be found to which such enlarged jurisdiction may be iproperly intrasted and to which complete powers can be given  that the existing courts of common law and county courts not having an equitable jurisdiction or power of dealing with trustees or with equitable matters arising in the construction of wills should not as at present consti tuted be intrusted with such enlarged jurisdiction  that the existing courts of equity not having any power of empannolling a jury or of conclusively deciding issues of fact are under a similar disqualification  that in order to do complete justice in testamentary matters it is necessary that the court to wbich they are intrusted should possess the ful and conjoined powers of a court of law and of a court of equity  that no thorough or satisfactory settlement of the questions pending with respect to the testamentary jurisdic tion of the eccleeiastical courts can be come to except by its being exercised by a court of conjoined law and equity having jurisdiction over wills of real and personal estate  that it is the bounden duty of the government of this country to provide such a court for the proper adjudi cation of all testamentary matters and of this society to promote its establishment by every meaus in its power that the most desirablemeans of effecting this appears to be the union of the present law aud equity commissions and inviting their immediate attention to this important question  that the above resolutions be taken as tho basis of the first report of this committee
