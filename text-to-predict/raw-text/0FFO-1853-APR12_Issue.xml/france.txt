the state op the contlyentfa portion of the following appeared in our second edition of yesterdayrancembom oub own comespondentral unday april y  pmfew incidonts have given rise to more premature conclusions and misstatements than the mission of prince menschikoff to constantinople the osten tation amounting to arrogance which eharacter ized his first entry into the capital of the sultan and the persons by whom he was accompanied not being the usual attendants of a peaceful or conciliating embassy whose object was a friendly arrangement of all matters in dispute were in a great measure the cause of the exaggerated accounts that have been circulated since the very first day of his presence that an unwonted display of force has been made and with a view to intimidation there is little doubt but there is reason to believe that up to a compa ratively recent date nothing positive respecting the nature and extent of the demands of russia has been ascertained i have this day seen letters of the th ult from constantinople which i am disposed to believe proceedcfrom an excellent source if the in formation they contain be trustworthy it would ap pear that up to that date no official communication had been made by the russian envoy to the turkish government and if anything was known of the real designs of russia such knowledge was ac quired from occasional expressions hints or insinua tions dropped in the course of conversation rather than from any direct or formal communications from prince mensehikoff the expression of the writer of the letter i allude to is to the effect that the de signs of russia continue still to be enveloped in mysteryit is true that a change has been observed in the demeanour of the ambassador who though he appears in no hurry to break silence has assumed a less haughty tone than in the beginning the statements in the french and german papers for some days past have been erroneous and contradictory it has been an nounced that the affair between russia and turkey was definitively arrnged this is not the case a defnitive arrangement could not be come to on what in point of fact has not as yet been commenced and cannot be commenced in the absence of the re presentatives of the powers for the porte regards the question between itself and russia as one in whichit is not the onlypartyinterested the letters i refer to say that there is very little doubt that prince menschikoff was sent to constantinople with the preconcerted design of remaining a con siderable time inthateity his mission though extra ordinary was not intended to be of brief duration such in fact is characteristic of russian policy nothing is ever done in a hurry there is no coutp de tete nothing like sudden impulse  and if the bearing of the new mission was of the haughty and somewhat theatrical kind reported it was all the result of cal culation long before planned it has been also stated that the demand of prince menschikoff for personal interviews with the sultan only had been anted the letters i have seen deny that it had been so up to the date mentionedthe thand a doubt was expreesed that it would be granted it is clear however that the alarm occasioned in the heginning by this affair has subsided a good deaal no immediate act of hostility is now dreaded the presence of the english and french ministers was however anxiously desired but it seems to be the opinion that the matter in dispute will be the sub ject of a negotiation which it is evidently the inten tion of russia to lengthen to the utmost i may add that the writer of the letter in question speaks of an improvement in the revenues of the ottoman empirefrom  to  per cent i think as compared with last yearamong the nominations in this days fmoiniteur of prefects is that of m de coetlogon from the sub prefecture of the cantal to the prefecture of the ain in place of m aladineze who is transferred to the central administrationof the home office mdoe coetlogon is the brother of the two gentlemen of the same name who are to be tried before the cor xectional police court in the affair of the foreign correspondentst he papers announce the death in the prison of clichy of the count de eompesch nephew of the last grand master of the knights of maltait is still doubted whether blanqui has really been captured on his escape fromelleisle his relations here maintain that he is safe on board an american vessel while the provincial papers state thathe as well as his companion casavan are ragain in custodythe court of cassation yesterday on appeal an nulled the sentence of the tfibanal of correctional police of douai of a fine of f on the count de thieffries for sending through the postoffice the declaration of the count de chambord relative to the vote for the empire the court of cassation as decided that the proceeding of the count de thiefries was not an infringement of the law
