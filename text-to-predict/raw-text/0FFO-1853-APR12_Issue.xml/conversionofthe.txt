conversion op the ptbititc flrflrfrom the bconomistthe difficulties which beset the chancellor of the exche quer in these days when he looks round in order to sea how he can lighten the burdens of the country in relation to our enormous national debt and to enable the public to partici pate in the advantages of the greater abundance of capital which it is manifest this country possesses are not confinei to the huge amount of stock upon which he must operate if he attempts a conversion to a lower rate of interest in the ordinary way but he is embarrassed in a stiu greater and mnore formidable degree by the fact that as the law now stands the stockholder is entitled to  months notice before any such operation can be effected a very little reflection will convince any one that that condition alone were there no other would prove for an indefinite period of time an in surmountable obstacle whea can wo expect to see a person placed in the high position of a chancellor of the exchequer who shall possess the inconsiderate daring or rashness to hazard for a whole year the chance of being called upon to pay off a snam of five hundred millions w hen we remember the state in which the money market was in the early part and middle of  when the interest of money was as low and the price of consols as high as they had been for many years and that within a year the cur rent rate of interest had risen to  per cent and the pric of the three per cents had fallen considerably below  wo have some idea of the extreme danger which a chancellor of the exchequer must iacur in such aa operation as wehave saggested that sudden chanze was caused chiefly by a bad harvestaggravated no doubc by exatensive soeecuation but unfortunlately great as that risk is it is not the only one which would result in a similar consecuence to bad harvests we have to add the risk of foreign wars of internal oommotions and of commercial convulsions row many men do not hesitate to entertain a confident opmnion of what is likely to happen during the next  months and so far as ordinary business trausactions go to actupon it but when a minister undertakes an operation which ink volves the chance of being obliged on one day to fiad  of money all will agree that the contingent events of a whole twelvemonth involve in the bet of times hazard which no statesman of ordinary prudence would encounter that condition therefore on which thepresent debt is held is of itself an absolute barrier against any attempt in any conceivable time for a conversion of the present three per cents in the ordinary waybut it was impossible that a minister having in view the interests of the public and seeing the disadvantage under i which the public debt was thus placed in the great capital market should rest satified without making some effort to obtain in another way for the country advantages which he was precluded from securing in the ordinary mode orcon version the proposals made bv the chancellor of the exchegier last night had this for their object in the first place air gladstone proposes to redeem and pay off the whole of the stock belonging to the south sea company amountingnearlyto  the proprietorsof this stock have four alternatives they may obtain in lieu of evory  a new stock bearing  per cent guaranteed against reduction till   years at the rate of  s for every such  stock whihis equalto an interest of  iss d per cent fixed for that penod or they may receive a new  per cent stock guaran teed also till  at  for each  of such stock equal to  s per cent or they may receive exchequerbonds bearing i per cent for a period not exceeding  years and j per ceut for a further period till   years in all which shall be payable to bearer and to which connons for the halfyearly interest shall be attached also payable to bearer or lastly they may if they reject any of the above three plaus receive the amount of their stock in cash at parso far this operation is compulsory on the present holdera of this stock but so limited an oderation would do nothing either to test the actual powerof the government in the money market or to lay a sufficient foundation fop great future operations the chancellor of the exchequer therefote proposes to extend the same offeri to the holderg of all three per cent stocksthe first withoutt any limit to the amount the second and third to be each in the mean time limited to thirty millions of stockthere can be no doutbt that it is agreat convenience to the public to have a choice of different descriptions of stock it suits the convenience of some to receive e smaller present payment on tho condition of a larger future stock others it suits to receive a larger present payment sacrificing a portion of their fuiture stock and to others again it is a great advautage for special purposes to possess a stock easily transferable from haud to hand and like exchequer bills that are especiauy adapted for tempo rary investments thoadvantage of thusvaiyingthustocksisn wlich the public debt is held is that somewhat better terms may be secured for all from the convenience of all being consulted this is effectually done by the proposition of the chancellor of the exchequer and esdecially it is likely that the exchequer bonds will be resortedl to as a most favourite stock they will be even more convenient in some respects than exchequer bills the interest being payable by the presentation of coupons which will accompany the bonds they may be held in any part of the country or anywhere abroad and without the necessity of ever parting with the bonds themselves or the employqm snent of any agent the holder will only have to cut off tha coupons or halfyear interest receipts and pay them wher ever he is into his bankers who will regard them as note payable at sight at the bank of england theseadvantages we are convinced will create a great demand for this speies of stock and at the rate of interest now provided we be lieve they will soon bear a considerable premium ospeciallas the amount is confined to only  we thiu it highly probable that the demand for these bonds will era long lead to a further issue and on torms more advantageous to the governmentbut perhaps the most importaut part of these proposali is that by which mr gladstone has for the first time laid the foundation for a permanent and irredeemable stock paying  per cont the great advantage which it is to accomplish this object as the foundation of future opera tions is the only ground on which the conversion of tho present stock into one of a higher capital  couli possibly be justified there is no principle in relation tothethe creation of a pubec debt which we regard as more un sound or improvident aa that which for the sake of securidg s preweut apparent low rate of interest creates an obliga tion nominaly higher than the amount actuady borrowed ax a rle in makiug loans it would obviously be always rnore profitable rather to psy a high rate of interest and to cseate alow amount of debt becauso if the value of money beomes lese theie is always the option of converting stock to a lower rate of interest but there is no means of reducing the amaount of the debt for the pteaent ohject however l to the limited amount of  the operation is one with regard to which the advantages greatly overbalance the objections
