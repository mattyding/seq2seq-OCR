prussiaif from ou own coibrspondetbetlin april the chambers resumed their labours last tuesday the th inst after the despatch of various matters of routine and the consideration of various petitions of more or less interest one was brought more spe cifically under the notice of the first chamber emanating from a reporter for the public press of the jewish persuasion in which he complained that the baron senfft von pilsach in a former debate on the admissibility of jews to sit on juries had imputed to them intentional per jury and the finding of verdicts thoy knew to be false and therefore prayed that the house acting in the conciliatory spirit it had hitherto manifested on all suchs topics would disavow any participation in the sentiments of the hon member the com mittee to whom this petition had been referred proposed that the house should pass to the order of the day on the ground that no member could be called to account for words spoken in that house which was here not attempted herr senfft von pilsach however explained that he had affirmed the jews in taking the oath of a juror take no oath at all one at least not binding on them and therefore could c the expressions had at the time drawn down on the speaker a reproof from the president and the house therefore adopted the proposal of the commission to pass to the order of the dayat the time of the debates on the new communal laws i drew  our attention to the circumstance that accordingto one of its clauses jews are disabled from holding any communal office the enact ment being confessedly at direct variance with article  of the constitution as well as with va rious other laws passed at various times in prussia in other states of germany and by the bundl this has called forth a number of protestations reclama tions and petitions on the part of the jews in ber lin in stargard in soldin and in crefeld they have the letter of the law on their side but i ima gine they will obtain nothing by their motion for the spirit of the conservative portion of the com munity is against them in schwerin the elders of a congregation have not only received an unsatisfac tory answer to their remonstrances but it seems almost as if they were likely to get into difficulties with the government for having taken upon them selves to speak in the name of the aggregate com munityin my last i mentioned that the late tactics of the revolutionary party here had been to gain entrance to the various associations of me ianics and the working classes sick clubs and such like and avail themselves of the liberty of associa tion for harmless or praiseworthy purposes to further their own destructive aims in a very extensive sick club gesmndhetspflegeverein which had absorbed into itself most of the previously in dependent and perfectly irreproachable sick clubs of the various trades and which has just been brought to a compulsory close by the president of police in consequence of the late detections the secretary was a kaufmaann levy and the physician was the jewish dr falkenthal at whose house in moabitz einkels prison costume was found the names of various other physicians of the body betray their hebrew origin as unmistakeably as tnie antecedents of various other prominent mem bers betray the revolationary and communistic tendencies of the institution it is of little avail to object that some of these individuals with hebrew names may have been baptized and so have become christians accordingtolaw only thereisnomore dangerous member of the community than the indi vidual whom sidney smith so aptly likened to the flyleaf between the old and the new testa ment no longer a jew and not yet a christianin the sitting of the second chamber on the same day th the ministerpresident laid before the house for confirmation the steuerverein treaty with hanover september  and made known that on the previous day the treaties reconstituting the zollverein in conjunction with the steuerverein and the commercial treaty between prussia and austria had been reciprocally signed sealed and delivered by all the states which are parties to themin the course of the debates a member put at the service of the house  copies of a pamphlet just published here by mr solly english lecturer at the university on the subject of the english law of inheritance and his example wasfollowed by another member who equally desired to draw the attention of the house to a lecture lately delivered here by professor gneist on the  nobility and gentry of england this latter contains as distinct points the origin and present power of both bodies and their influence on the state and the people i men tion these two incidents the better to give you an idea how high the moral influence of englands institu tions and principles is in prussia a rational form of anglomania possesses the whole nation and inthe treatment of every subject of internal de velopment it is always made a question what did england in similar cireumatances do  and in foreign affairs always what will england dolast monday when the different representatives of the various contracting states of the zollverein steuerverein and austria were assembled it was found at the last moment that the representative of the electorate of hesse was unprovided with instructions to sign there were also some little difficulties to be got over with hanover the electric telegraph however conveyed notice to both governments and on the arrival of the answers by the same speedy means the execution of the deeds took place at  oclock at night the representative of frankfortonthemain however was confined to his bed dangerously ill and his signature was not obtained till the fol lowing day when all the parties concorned cele brated the auspicious close of their labours by dining together at krollsaccording to the statisticalreport of the receipts of the zollverein for the yearthetotalnetincome amounted to

calling upon her to take effective measures against the political refugees met with no support in consequence of the late explanation offered by lordwestmorelandat vienna and as it would seem now certain of the va luable and timely information latelysent to berlin on the subject of the late purchases of arms in england by the german democrats instead of the above motion beidg put and carried

got rid of by their unlawful possessors for fear of a housesearching bringing them into toubleall news from the east hs for a long tirao p ut isounded so warlike that it may perhaps be a re lief to you to hear something of a more pacific character the sultan lately took occasion to ex press to the prussian minister at the porte herr von wildenbruch his desire to show his good friend and ally the king of prussia some mark of his esteem and regard the minister knowing the re ligious feelings of his august master suggested that nothing would be more welcome to him than the concession of a burialplace for christians and accordingly under date of th march the turkish minister for foreiga affairs notified to the ambassador that the sultan had for this purpose presented the king with a portion of land about  square feet near the barracks at pera on the left sideof the road leading tobujukdere it is a singular coincidence that the mission of prince menschikoff from which the greeks in a certain sense expect their deliverance from turkish thraldom should occur just in the th year from the conquest of the city by the turksthe year whicb according to an old greek prophecy is to see the greek cross displayed on the dome of the mosque of st sopbia considering that this latter was originally built for the greek ritur and has just been restored by the architect of the russian em bassy fossati the prophecy does not seem im possible of fulfilment might sot the sultan give up this mosque to the greek church as the price of their renouncing all claims on the roly shrines in favour of the latin church and so get out of his difficulty with france  within the last few days a young prussian lieutenant of artillery has published the result of his observations during a lengthened stay in constanti nople and the result is to strip from the readers eyes any remnants of delusion there might be on the sub ject of the turkish power itisentitled zizstand der ziirkei von hubert vonboemn its motto is a turkish prophecy that  ismaels people shau rule  years in stamboul corresponding with the greek prophecy i mentioned abovevarious papers have reprinted a report spread abroad in switzerland that the representatives of the great powers in london had consented to the king of prussias at length retaking possession of neuf chatel by force of arms i have not thought it worth mentioning before since it never met with credence nor is there anything in the present conjuncture of affairs vwhich should in duce the king of prussia to avail himself of the supposed consent the possession of neuf cbtel it istrue concerns the king and the royal family personally and as a matter of feeling but is a matter of such perfect indifference to the state that no ministry since march  has been found willing to take up the matter in only one year since it belonged to prussia did neufohtel ever pay the expenses of its own adminis tration and when that happened his late majesty refused to accept the trifling surplus there remained and said the neufchutelans migght make him a watch for the amount which was done there have been favourable moments for retaking posses sion of neufehatel by military force before the arrangement was made in london may   but they were not seized for instance in  after prussian arms had put down the insurrec tion in baden and the insurgents had escaped in hordes into switzerland prussia might have pro ceeded summarily to occupy basle and require the expulsion of the rebels and the cession of neufchatel to its legitimate prince there was no power who would then have protested against the proceeding escept perhaps france and she would gladly have taken possession of geneva as security against basles remaining ultimately in prussian hands after the d of december there is good reason to believe that the then president of the french republic made overtures to prussia that the latter should take pos session of neufchatel and the former of geneva and something more on neither of these two oc casions did prussia avail herself of the opportunity and it requires no great discernment to feel certain that the present king of prussia will never allow human blood to be shed for the gratification of a personal feeling of outraged dignity as neaf chatel now stands incorporated in the swiss con federation it cannot as long as the present compact stands acknowledge the sovereignty of the kiing of prussia as prince of neufehatel if france and austria were to urge on the assertion of the prussian kings claim it would be for the purpose of bringing about the destruction of the swiss confederation in its present form and helping themselves to the portions most convenient to their own territories and purposes the possession of neufchatel in the present antiroyalist state of feeling would also be no source of satisfac tion perhaps a sudden change would take place here if there were any near prospect of the king coming to his rights again there is no power so capable of bringing this about by amicable means so devoid of selfinterest in the matter and yet so interested in preventing the en croachments of france and austria on the neutral territory of switzerland as englanditalym mazzini is preparing a vindication of his con duct of which an extract has already appeared in the genoa journal italia e popolo the writer repels among other charges that of improvidence and boasts that none of his numerous emissaries wero arrested that the police failed to seize any of his written instructions that those taken from an individual named partesotti who was concealed in a garret at paris were not genuine and that partesotti pretended to be a mazzinian agent for the purpose of selling himself to austria for a
