educationthe earl of matmesbury requested their lordships indulgence while he addressed them in an irregular manner upon a conversation which took place on friday night ia the other house of parliament and which had led to con siderable misapprehension the conversation referred to the examination of the attachs for the diplomatic service it was stated by his noble friend the member for lynn lord stanley who was undersecretary of state for foreign affairs that the late government had a plan pre pared for a bette examination of candidates for attach ships than at present existed so far his noblo friend had spoken accurately and had not been misunderstood but his noble friend continued by giving to the other house a plan which he had himself formed relative to the diplomatic body generally including the ambassadors and ministers and laid hb thought it imwortant that diplomacy should not be considered a distinct profession bat that it should be open to any gentleman whom the secretary of stato for foreign affairs might think proper to appoint to these high offices several members of the diplomatic body now in this country had written to him tho earl of malmesbury expressing their disapprobation and regret that any such plan should be seriously contemplated by any government he therefore thought it fair to all to state publicly in answer to those gentlemen who had written to him and to others that such a plan was never under the consideration of the late government and that they never intended with reference to the constitution of the diplomatic body as a profession to alter the present system his noble friend appeared to think that the system he had advocated would be attended with greater economy and greater efficiency in the public service he however thought his noble friend mistaken and that far from being more economical the expense would bo greater it was competent at present for the secretary of state to appoint any gentleman to an em bassy or mission who had not been regularly formed and trained for the diplomatic service and if there were at taches not entitled to promotion and if the ministeronly at a foreign capital were likely to be changed it would be a premium upon jobbing and the minister of the day who ever he might be would be pestered with applications for these high places and the system would lead to some of those abuses which peculiarly belonged to the forms of con stitutional government whether the scheme in question however were wise or unwise it was entirely that of his noble friend who had probably been misunderstood and misrepresented when it was stated that any such plan had originated in the executive of the late government or that they had any idea of carrying it into effectcanterbury electionthe earl of aberdeen said he had to ask their lord sbips to conenr with the house of commons in an address to her majesty praying her majesty to appoint a commis sion to inquire into the corrupt practices which prevailed at the last election for the city of canterbury he trusted their lordsbips would have no cifficulty in givingtheirassent to this address as well as to others of a similar description and those which he feared might yet be brought before them their lordehips had always declared a willingness to cooperate with the otler house in endeavouring to diminish and check by every means in their power those corrupt practices which previiled at the last election he believedthe time had now fuly come when something must be done on this subject for f the present practices should continue a serious blow woal be struek at the very prin ciple of the representative sytem of this country efear hear he knew there were lersons who were accustomei to treat these proceedings ad practices with comparative indifference and who thouht they were so regarded by others but he thought such sereons very greatly maistaken in his opinion the people of this country looked with in creasing distrust upon the fequency and growth of these malpractices at elections and even the lowest of the people those who were deprived ofbe franchisewere indignant at the manner in which it wai abused by those above them he had been told that this evi had not increased and that it had existed to an equal exteit in former times it might be so though he greatly douked it but if that were the case what did it prove it might prove that the prac tiees of former times were wole than we had imagined them to be but did not iimnissh the wrong of that which their lordships now saw passing before their eyes he should not think it his duty to enter into any particulars of the evidencetaken before the com mittee of the house of commons on the canterbury election which was already upon thdr lordships table perhaps it would have been better if thb had left all these preliminary parts of the proceeding to tha house of com mons hear hear if indeed this were evidence on which to feund a legislative proceeding then it might be necessary to go minutely into the whole case and see how far it bore out any act which they might be called upon to las  but as it was he looked upon this as merely laying tho ground for inquiry alone and unless there was some reason for re fusing their assent to some inquiry into the exteat and am ront of bribery in this city he thought they would at once agree to further inquiry and reserve to themselveb the power of dealing with any measure which that inquiry might give rise to he had been told but hb could scarceiy suppose it probable that an objection might be taken to the course which he proposed to their lordships to take arising from the terms of the report of the committee of the house of commons as it did not embody the precise terms of the act of last year providing for the better inquiry into the existence of corrupt practices at elections the committee reported that a system of corruption prevailed at the last election and at revious elections for the city of cantor bury tlhe worsi of the act required that it should be stated that bribery extensively prevailed andthehouse of commons naturally taking the common sense view of the case thought that when bribery was systematic and gene ral it was  extensive hear hear and they had there fore adopted the words of the act in the address sent up to their lordships in which it was alleged that bribery had extensively prevailed in the city of canterbary he should regret if such an objection so purely technicaland one which had been raised but not sustained in the house of commonsshould be raised by any of their lord ships for such an opposition if successful would very seri ously endanger the belief in the sincerity of their lordships in cooperating effectually with the other house for the suppression of corrupt practices at elections it could not be urged as anobjection which at all had any application to the spirit of the proceedings that had been adopted and it could only serve to place that house in the eyes of the public in a position in which he should ho very sorry to see t hfe would move that their lordships agree in the ad dress of the house of commons to her majesty prying her meajestyto appoint a commission to inquire into the corrupt practices which had prevailed at elections for tho city of canterburylord lyndhurst begged to call their lordships at tention to the irregularity of the course adopted he trusted he should not be misconstrued in the observations he was about to make for no one was more strongly con vinced of the necessity of putting an end to that system of bribery which had so long prevailed at elections hear no one was more concerned at the existence of the prac tices brought to light by recent disclosures than himself but his experience in courts of justice had led him to the conclusion that the strong feelings excited in the public mind led to bad laws and to a misconstruction of the law and it was necessary for their lordahips to exercise caution that they were not misled by their feelings to strain the law by misconstruction if such a caution were necessary upon ordinary occasions it was peculiarly necessary when what their lordshipa were about to do tonight would be a prece dent for future occasions and when the bill under which the commission would issuo was of the most penal character againstthe parties their lordship woulld allow him to referto the address which thoy were called upon to support he was desired to address her majesty informing her that a committee of the house of commons had reported that corrupt practices had extensively prevailed at the last election and at previous elections for the city of canter bury he was to represent that such a report existed now he ound that no such report had ever been made and he was called upon to state that to her majesty which in terms he considered to be an untruth his noble friend hadstated and he believed the same argument was stated also in the other house of parlia ment that the terms made use of in the resolution were equivalent to those in the address now he apprehended that their lordships had no power or authority to draw any such conclusion it was the duty ofthe committee to draw a conclusion from the evidence their lordships had no power to look at that evidence for the purpose of alterin the report the committee were the only parties to draw that conclusion and parliament was boundby theirrepor let their lordships try the case by this testinstead of stating that which was really not the fact let them put upon the face of this address the report in the very terms in which it had been rendered by the committee and then he would ask his noble and learned friend upon the wool sack whether there was any legal authority uuder such circumatances for saying that this commission ought to issue ifa commission were issued what would be the consequence why that the validity of the acts of that commission might be questioned if the matter were brought before a court of law he apprehended therefore that they ought not to present an address to her majesty stating that which vws in terms incorrect drawieg a con clusion which they had no right to draw and which if put upon the face of this address would not support the com mision which it was now sought to issue but further than this he did not consider that what had bean renorted by the committee was equivalent to what was stated uponthe face of this addresw in this address it was stated that the committee had reported that corrupt practices hadoxtensively prevailed at thb last election for the city of canterbury these he thought were the wordt of the address tho committee had found that a system of corruption had prevailed at the last election and at provious elections a generally now take these clauses sepanztely the committee had found that a system of corruption bs means of coloured tickets prevailed it the last election bu t did a system of corruption import neoes sarily that corrupitu was exteneively carried on what was the meaning of the term  system p it meant partioe acting in codncrt for a particular object tb sybvw pightbe extensive but it might also be limnited when you said an extensive system of oorruption the word  exten  sive was notmere surplusage you could not say that it had no meaning and in like manner a sa tem of corraption did not import any extent of corruption in adverting to these circumstancee therefore the word  extensive became of the most important character unless an exten sive systom of corruption prevailed their lordships could not proceed forthepurposeofpunishing the population orthe elec tors butthen his noblefriend referred to the word general  a system of corruption by means of coloured tickets pre vailed at the last election and at previous elections gene rallv now that word general hy a misappreheasion of its meaning had been made uae of iu the other honse in order to make it appear that an exteasive system of corrup tion had prevailed bat the word general there did not mean extensivo it meant that corruption was usual at foimer elections and it did not support the statement in the addrees which his noble friend had put now it had been their objecta constitutioral and parliamentary object to provent as far as possible the flouse of commons and this house from exerciting any judgment whateverin the care of elections wbich ought to be decided by tha nation and why  because all such queations were in general do cided upon party motives and as party questions that was tho ground upon which the grenville act was passed and now here they were laying doswn precedents which might be very mischievous ou future occasions giving the houso of commons the power of saying thatas the com mittee had not found that which was necessary to sup port the isuing of the commission they would put a construction upon the report of the committee which would briag it within the meaning of the act of parliament now he warned their lordehips against the consequence of that proceeding his experience of courts of justice led him to this conclusion in cases that came before courts of justice occasional departures from the strict law and from the strict meaning of tho act of parliament sometimes took place for the purpose of giving effect to previous decisions a pre cedent was thue established when questions of a similar mature came on afterwards a further deviation took place and soon until the courts wern struck by the extent of the departure from the law overruled all these decisions and went back to the strict terms of the law and the letter of the act that showed the danger of departing from the strict letter of the law and establishidg precedents which might lead to such conclusions as those he had stated the noble earl had said that they ought not to read the evidence laklen before the committee undoubtedly their lordships had nothing to do with the evidence notbing could be more clear than that it was the committee that ought to have drawn the conclution they ought to have reported in the very words of the act of parliament but as they had not done to their lordships could not by codstruction supply the defiiency but there was a remedy for this the com mittee appointed to inquire into the validity of the election had pronomnced its decision butthe same committee might be reappointed theymightinquireagain whether any corrop tion had prevailed at this electiou and they might report notwithstandirg the report they had already made in the very words required by the act of parliament that would be a simple and easy remedy for the blunder which had been committed and he called noon their lordships most strongly not to depart from the strict rule laid down by the act however anxious they might be to repress an evil whitlthey au deplored which was so disgraceful to the country and in any measure for the prevention of which he would heartily concnr there had been an irregularity but their lordships ought not to proceed upon that irregularity andht not to state to the crown an untreth as they were called upon to state by the proposed addressthe lord chaeencellor would regret if their lord ehips suffered themselves to be convinced even by the great authority of the noble and learned lord that they ought not to adopt the resolution he should entirely concur with the noble and learned lord that if they were really making themeelves parties to such a proceeding as the statement of an untruth to her majesty their lordships would be doing that which would be disgraceful to themselves aud which must inevitably entail a serious asd mischievous effect but it was because he was persuaded they were stating nothing but the truth that he trusted their lordships would have no difficulty whatever in accoding to this address he ad initted it was to be regretted that the words of this resoln tion were not literally those of the act of parliament he trusted that the act would be followed in the reports of future committees but if his noble and learned friend meant to say that nothing could warrant their lordships in stating to her majesty that there had been a resolution of a committee declaring that corrupt practices had extensively prevailed at the last election for canterbury although those were not the ipiisimca verb of the report he differed altogether from that opinion suppose it had been said that at the last three elections ths of the electors had been bribed would not that warrant their lord ships in stating that corruption had extensively prevailed  nobtody could doubt whei he put that extreme care that their lordships would have been warranted in declaring this ard therefore the question was not whether the com mittee had used the very words mentioned in the address but whether they had reported that which necessarily meant the same thing hear hear it might be strictly true that their lordahips had no right to look at the evidence but if they did they would find that corruption was sid to be universal in the city of canterbury what were the words of the committees resolution they were  that a system of corruption by means of colour tickets prevailed at the last election and at previous elections for the city of canterbury generally ifas not that at least as strong as the expression that corrupt practices had ex tensively prevailed if their lordships were to look at this resolution with grammatical nicety he asked his noble and learned friend to define what he meant by extensively prevailed the word extensively was popularly taken to mean to a great extent but it did not necessarily mean that and if they analyzed the words the statement that a system of corruption had prevailed generally was far more cogent and stringent than saying that the system had extensively prevaled the noble and learned lord had ex pressed an opinion from which he the lord chancellor did not diferthat according to the mnaxim of lawyers some times hard cases made bad law  it was wrong to meet a particular case by a departure from the latter of the law buthe did not think they were at all incurring this respon sibility in the present instance after all what they were about to do was mot to inflict a hardship or to inflict anything else it was merely to lav the foundation for an inquiry the result of which would be that persons giving onsd mde evidence in the course of that inquiry would be indemnified for what they said all that was asked was that this house should interpret that which had been re ported so as to address her majesty in the terms of the act of parliament and he was persuaded there was no one in dividual out of that house who would not think they were perfectly warranted in so doing he trusted therefore their lordships would concur in the proposed addresslord st leonardssaid their lordships had no power to join in an address which might lead to inquiry in the form of a commission unless that address was founded upon the act of parliament the only and the simple question was therefore to consider whether their lordships werejustified or not by the act of parliament in agreeing to the  address and this was a simple question of law it was im possible to misunderstand the plain terms of the act which were that wherever the two houses ahould by an address to the crown represent to the crown that the committee of the other house had reported that corrupt practices had or that there was reason to believe that they had extensively prevailed in an election a commission of inquiry shouldbe di rectedtoissue the actofparliament did notsaythat wherever it was declared by the report of a select committee of the house of commons that corrupt practices had extensively prevailed a commission should issue but it enacted that after the select committee had reported both houses were to join in an address representing that fact to the crown and until this had been done they could not stir or move in the matter there was this singularity in the present case that the select committee had not adopted the plain words of the act of parliament and that the house of commons when the report got back to them had not in the address adopted the equally plain words used by the committee the act of parliament the house of commons and the select committee were therefore all at variance if the report of the select committee wete equivaleit to the words of the act why was notthe real factmanfolly stated as those who originated the address were bound to state it the act of parliament bound their lordships down to express terms it was in the nature of an indictment and in order that party feelings might not be brought into action in the caee the select committee was constituted a tribunal in itself did anybody doubt that the act of parliament was not before this committee and that there was not eome reason for their not adopting its langusge when he looked to the constitution of the committee he found upon it a very experienced lawyer and although he had not spoken to any person upon the sub ject ho did not at this moment himself believe under the circumstances that any lawyer would have drawn up this report and signed it without au express intention to avoid acopting the language of the act of parliament in notfollovwng thelanguage of theirresolution in thepresent address their lordshiips would not he representing correctly that which the committee had reported and if they were once to permit themselves to wander from the actual report of the committees themselvesif they wero to sub stitute one kind of language for anotherif they were to represent to the crown that the words of the act of parlia ment themselves had been made use of by the committee that would be stating what was incorrect if they once took upon themselves to substitute other words for those used by select committees where were they to stop the committee having the act of parliament before them had reported that a system of corruption by means of coloured tickets prevailed at the last election and then what flollowedon behalf of the sitting members and at previous elections for the city of canterbury gene rlly this could only be taken to mean that the impressionon the part of the committee was that the corruption was partial and confned to the sitting mem bers at the last election and that it was general and not confined to the sittidg member bult that both parties were equally guilty at previous elections the noble earl in submitting the present motion to the house had opened a good caso brt likoemany other persons in a similarpoiition he had no ovidence to support it the point was that the committee had reported that at the last election the sithtig members alone were guilty of this system of corruption and that at former elections beth parties united inthis way but did that mean that there had beenan extensive system prevailing there was not a word in the report about its being extensive and with the act of parliament before them could the committee have left out those worls undless they had intended to report that the ydtem had not been extensives could therlordships then joi in an adiress tothecrownwithoutstatingwhat the reportactually declared

report that corrupt practices had extensively prevailed they might he able to torture the words of the repart into that meaning and thereupon apply to their lordships to join them in an address to the crown let them remember that if they agreed to thia address they were not carrying into effect the report of the select committee but that which they believed to ba equivalent to the words of that report he humbly en treated them not only for the sake of the house bat for the sake of the administration of justicerecollecting that they were acting on no power of their own but on a power given

not he appre hended have a dissentient voice raised against it this was not a question of proceeding at all but of the form in which the proceeding should take placelord campbell said their lordships were now in a very graveposition the other house of parliament had passed an addresa to the crown in wbich tbey asked their lordships to join and to represent to her majesty that a select committee had reported that  corrupt practices had extenaively prevailed at that and at previons elections for the borough of canterbury their lordshipawerenowcalled on to join in that address and they were hesitating as to whether or not the house of commons had not in effact represented an untrutb hear hear that was a very serious imputation on the other house of parliament he found however that it was not per incurium they had passed that resolution bat that it was after discusrion and deliberation that the hoase had come to the solemn determination that the select committee had made such a report to them and were their lordahips now prepared to say after they had held a conference with the other house that they had said that which was a falsehood hear hear if that was the truth he would not howver reluctantly shi ink from de claring it to be so but was it untrue in fact  instead of saying the house of commons had stated what was false he after the beat consideration he could give it was of opi nion they had not affirmed anything which wasnotperfectly correctand true notwithstanding his great respect for his noble and learned friends opposite he must say he did not think any lawyer in westminsrterhall wonld put on the act of parliament and on the address the construction thev had contended for it had been held that if wndc clearly equi valent to the words in the requisition of the legislature were substituted they should be considered efficient sup pose the word in the report bad been that corrupt practices had  universally prevailed would not that justify the issnug of an address though it was a departure from the form ra of the act again suppose the committee re ported eaat there were  electors in canterbury and that  of them had been bribed would not that be in effect a report that corrupt practices had extensively prevailed f hear hear he thought it was not indispensably neces sary that the same words should be used but that they should be equivalent to those in the act the statute re ferred not only to one election but to any election for the words were at any election or elections lord st leonards was understood to say that the act only referred to the election or elections against which the petition was presented he dissented from his noble and learned friend he was of opinion that according to the act it would bo enough if the report showed extensive bribery had prevailed at any previous election for canterbury the seventh resolution of the commnittee stated that a evstem of bribery had prevailed at that and at previous elections at canterbury generally instead of saying to the house of commons that they had told a falsehood he thought they should agree with them in asking the crown to issue a commission he regretted indeed that the committee had not used the words of the act and he hoped that on any future occasion the committees of the house would take care to follow the form prescribed for them but their neglect to do so was no reason why their lordships should not conecr in the address he believed both houses were equally desirous such corrupt practices should cease and that their earnest wish was to give effect to this salutary act of parliament hear hearlordredesdaleagreed withthenoble and learnedlord that it was unfortnuate the select committee had not stated expressly that bribery and corrupt practices had extensively drevailed at the election and he also hoped like the noble and learned lord that select committees would not fall into the same error in fature he believed however the way to secure this and to prevent ady evil arising from an unjust and oppressive majority was to insist on the words of the report being the words of the act of parliament as that was the only protection that could be afforded against such a tyranny the present question was of great imaortance inasmuch as it was the first occasion on which tbe point would be decided if they laid it downa that the majority of the other house could determine what meaning the report of a select committee should bear they would open a door to very grave injustice when a committee reported that corrupt practices had extensively prevailed their lordships knew they wished for an inquiry but when they did not use themit was to be supposed the committee did not desire an inquiry and the botough was saved from the tyranny of a majosity they were therefore not only protecting those who required protection from such tyranny but saving that house from the difficulty of such questions sont to them in times of great exeitement and high political feeling if they required those words always to be in the report they would never be asked to agree to an address to the crown unless the committee of the other house was of opi nion that the bribery was of a kind and character which should induce them to submit the case to the tribunal in tended to adjudicate on it but if they determined that the other house could come to the conclusion of what was the meaning of the words in the report they would have cases in which there would befar greater difficulty and doubts and when this precedent would be brought against them by not assentiag to this motion they did not prevent inquiry because the honse of commons could refer the subject to the same members of committee to report on itthe duke of newcastle had listened with astonish ment to the speech of his noble friend recollecting the part he had taken when the act was before their lordabips he then warned the house against the danger of placing im plicit reliance on reports of the committees of the other house and claimed a right on behalf of their lordships to inquire into the circumstances of the case and to take their full share of consideringthem but now they were told by the noble lord that they were not to look to the evidence at al but were to take the ipsissimna erea of the committee and that unless certain words were used in that report aud adopted by the house their lords
