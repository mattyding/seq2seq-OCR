volution in irelandsuch as but a few years ago could scarcely have entered into the imagination of the wvildest theorist but there is no choice in the matter the exodus is the allengrossing topic of

have so to do but i can assure you that our population in this province is going in as full volume though perhaps from the comparative silence of the local journals you and others may be inclined to

moneyare keeping pace with andesus taining the movement so that nothing seems likely to be wanting to perfect the revolution nows in pro gress in relation to this branch of the question ithe imericn ehamider has the following remarkablestatem ent we understand that there was romitted to ireland last year through one irish bank the provincial bank of ire land by parties in america to enable their friends to emigrate thither no less a sum than  moreover this amount was remitted in sums under  and averaging  sjust one might say the price of a passage over but we understand the truth to be that in some instances the same party has made three or four romittancesa fact wihich proves howv eager they are to help their friends over theoocean and how eagerly they avail themselves of the means to help these whom they leave behind never waiting beyond the time when circumstances enabled them to earn a remittance before they make it we shall not at present dilate upon this subject farther than to say that the statis tics we have set down and which may be relied upon as authentic show that one million and a half at least has reached ireland through all the banks and other channels for the purpose of promoting emigration thus vw see how the emigration is maintained and herein we have an assur ance of its continuance so strong as to forbid we should either overestimate its importance or calcnlate on its ces sationscarcely less remarkable are the circumstances nairated in the subjoined extract from the waeer ford mail each post brings us fresh indications of the genuine irish character in the remittances which hzve been trans mitted to this country from thoes who have emigrated either to america or australia whether to repay the sums given to enable them to arrive at one or otber of those lands of promise as remembrances of love and daty or as means for those whom they haveleft behisd in the workhonse to follow their example the reports of the several boards of guardiane throughout the country our own included sufficiently at test this latter fact while the pubhe press filly recosds the other instances referred to in this county the sauns re ceived have been as numerous as they were unexpected and walcome to the recipients and many an aged mothers or lathers heart has been made to sidg with joy and many a cold hearth has been enlightened by the timely offering of filial affection some time back we notieed the receipt by a poor woman in villierstown from her son who had emi grated to australia of the sum of  within these few days she has had another ioz from the same source and another poor woman at dromore got two checks for  each in the villierstown postoffice and  were received by mr christopher usher of camphire from a man who had lived on that gentlemans estate in trast for his two children to have them sent out to him to america  scarcely a week elapses gays a respected correapondent vriting from villierstown  that four or five individuals in this locality do not receive money orders to afford them an opportunity of leaving for america a course which is invariably and strenuously recommended by the senders the consequent drain upon otur labouring rural population is such as might be expected in the townland of woodhouse we are in formed not a single day labourer is to be found in the townland of aglish there are but two in villierstown there are are nine but those are to take their departure in a few days for the far west whole families are preparing to emigrate to america and the tide of selfexpatriation in  promises to flow as full considering the population that is left as in any preceding year a poor miner from the neighbourhood of bonmahon emigrated some two years ago to america where finding himself realising a fortune he paid the passage money of his wife and children whom he left in this country he also sent her about eight weeks since  to enable them to go out she accord ingly went and in a few days after her arrival there sent homes  to buy clothes for the littue ragged playmuates of her children this she said was a proof of her remembrance of the friends at home tflatoxsthe nenagh guardian fully confirms the state ment m the nation respecting the vote of censure passed by the priests of tipperary upon the two cotnty representatives messrs francis scully and james sadleir and further  it is confidently re ported that the two roman catholic prelates in north tipperary drsslattery and vaughan have expressed their approval of the movement set on foot by the clergy under their

disapdointment at the change of political opinion which has taken place in the minds of some of the members re turned to parliament at such tremendous sacrifices chiefly by the tenant farmers of ireland on the solemn engage ment and express stipulation that they were to hold them selves independent of and in opposition to any and every government which would not make tenantright a cabinet question and that although those members have not yet given any adverse voto upon the questions to which they were pledged there is much reason to apprehend that they will be found at the hour of trial ranged with the enemies ind opponents of the cause or at least very apa thetic advocates by reason of their connexion with and dependence upon the government that we are narrowly watching the conduct of the members so triumphantly returned by this great county of clare at the last elec tion at such incalculable sacrifices but on the faith of public and solemn engagements that in the event of their receding from those principles and professions and either by vote speecb writing or acceptance of offico under any government not pledged to tonantright giving reason tobe leve that they are not properly tenantright representatives we hereby pledge ourselves upon our part and upon the part of our faithful people to demand from them the imme diate surrender of the trust confided to them back into the hands of tho brave constituencies that they may again testify their undying devotion to the cause by tho return of members who shall more truly represent their feelings and opinionsa

by a mr mcormack of dublin this was the famous lot which was twice sold by the court and repu diated by the purchasers when being set up a third time  mr mcormack became the proprietor wandering overhis newly aequired territory he found indications of copper  and without going into details it appear that there are at prewent mr mcormaek a mr ryan and an english mining company engaged in the

inheritance with all its  mines mine rals upperand under woods hawking and fishing royalties and it would appear that so thought the mining company of london but sir richard a odonnell looking on atten tively until the speculation was well afloat walked in just to intimate that it was quite true his ancestors had leased the land to the mlougblin family but it was equaly certain that they had
