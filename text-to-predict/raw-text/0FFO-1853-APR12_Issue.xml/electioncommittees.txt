election jommittzzs    atbiioneldu u immaewe mea again yesterday andmr montague smith prooeeded to sum up the cme for the petitioners contending that in law therohad produced all the evidenco they could be expectea to bring forward in order to prove that mr keogh haa not the requisite pro perty qualification the lerned connel disclaimed any other than strictly legal grounds for the cours which had been taken snd said that the committee had simply to de cidea dry point of law which he was saure they would do impartialy the law might be objectionable and it might be a subject of regret thait led to the exclusion of an able and talented member of parliament bat while it was so it ought to be obeyed and perhaps its justice could not be better tested than in the person of the solicitorgeneral fur ireandmr huddleston in the absence of mr james then opened the case on behalf of mr keogh he contended that nothing whatever had been proved relevant to the inquiry actually before the committee but notwithstanding the barrenness of the case presented on the other side it was dne to mr keogh not to take any captious objections but boldly to meet the statements made by his opponents and without hesitation to lay all the facts before the com mittee mr keogh had made tho required declarations of his qualification to three justices of the peace who were also members of parliament and who were ready to produce the documents if called upon to do so again his oppo nents had not adopted the usal course of calling on him to produce his deeds they had indeed served him with a peakers warrant for the purpose hut they had not ven tured to call him as a witness thoagh they took the snpre cedented step of arresting him for a fictitious debt and though they insiuated that no such deeds esisted as were mentioned by him in his declaration these documentswould be produced and wouid show that mr keogh wasi amply qualified the total amount of the judgaent debts proved appeared to be  s lld but this sum he would ishow was at the outset in reality not more than  os d that previous to the late election it had been reduced to  s d and that under romillys act not one of the judgments brought forwarrd by the peti tioners had been registered as an ucaumbrance on the rent charge of  which mr lkevgh had included in his decla ration of qualificationmr keogh was then called and saia that the judgment bonds proved on the other side represented altogether a sum of  s lld but most of these were for double the amount actuauy due which was originally  he went through them scriatim ehowing that the greater number of them had been satisfied before the late elec tion took place and that his opdonents musat have been aware of the fact while bringing them forward not one judgment in  was entered as satisfied upon the record bacause doing ao involved expense and he should not have entered any of those against him but for the pre sent inquiry the petitioners knew that one juagmentbond especially held by colonel smith for  had been i settled before the last election for during the election drlsmpriere a barrister of the inner temple who had acted as managing
