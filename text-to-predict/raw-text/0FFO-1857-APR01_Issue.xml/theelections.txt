theelectionsrotitwatrthe offical declaration of the poll was rade yesterday at the townhall st xargaretiahill some thousands of persons assembled buit owing to the exoelentarrangements of the high bailiff who was efficivntly supported by super intendent branford of the if division of police everything passed off quietly and no discomfort was experienoed by any onethe hygy baiff staed that the result of the poling bad been carefully examined and he declared the choioe of the electors to have fallen upon sir c napier and mr john locke the numbers being fornapier       locke       pellatt      sir a nia then presented himuelf and was received with hearty applause he expressed hic simere thanks for the honour which bad been conferreapon him by his election for the second time as mneir for southwark at the last election attempts bad beenmade by an unworthy ang to crush him but the people of southwark wee determined that he should not be crushed and by voting for him on that occasion they had exhibited at once theirhatred of oppression and their love of fair play cheersa now again after time hsd been afforded them for reflec tion they came forward and maintained their choice and reelected him member for southiwark be trusted that he should justify that choice and that he should do his duty in parliarment to their satisfaction and to his ow honour cheers they all knew well enough that the duties of a member of parliament were by no means light in fact they were exoessively severe many members prided them selves upon being present at every divisicn but divisions often took place upon trivial questions and he was inclined to look rather at the quality than the quantity of the votes which a member gave cheers it was imposslble for a man to be at every division he must take his rest oc casionally and he must have his dinner sometimes but speaking for himself he believed tat he had not been absent upon any divsion of the slightest importance exoept that on the ballot w hen he bad been shut out of the hous as he had previously explained cheers he laud nov to make a statement wshich he thought would astonish them not a little and that wa that commisioner yeh was a greater reormer than any of them cheers and a laugh yeh had made the leading men in this country dissolve parliament and it was notorious that until the dissolution not one of them had thought a word about reform he trusted now not only that we should have locke kings motion carried but that there would be an end to the rotten borough systemthat we should have a large extenbion of the suffge and the ballot to protect it he thought indeed that parliamentary reform might be looked upon as achieved because although long sleeping the question had now been revived and he believed that there would be each a pressure upon the minister as would make the mea sure irresistible cheers he quite agreed with lord john russell in the propriety of reducing the duties upon tea and sugarthe luxuries as well as the necessaries of worldng men he was also in favour of a diminution of the public expenditure but he would not so reduce it as to cripple the defences of the state or to leave this great country at the mercy of any other nation cheers frsnce was now our ally but the french were an ambitious and a vainsas well as a gallaut people he remembered vwith satisfac tion the share which they had taken with him in the baltic and the enste cordinenever disturboedbetwveen admiral duchesne and himself but he could not forget that while we were a free nation in france there existed only the apology for freedom and that an alliance between people so dissimilar in their habits might be broken in a day he was therefore in favour of maintaining our defenoes in an effi cientstate cheers mr tierney had said give mea full exchequer and a wellranned navy and i will defy the world he quite concurred in that sentiment and he would never advocate a recurrence to that miserable economy wbich would expose us to the attack of more ambitious na tions than ourselves tne titnes in a very humorous article had referred to a neighbouring mnember as having re sisted the blandishments of the court and even the offer of a title now it was not likely that he sir charles napier would ever be offered a title but he had resisted one blandishment and that was the offer of a gc b he had refused it because he thought it was adecorationwhich would confer no distinction upon him and in order to mark his contempt of those who offend it the gallant admiral added that of course he did not mean this expression to apply to the sovereign the fountain of honour for whom he proposed three cheers as the good queen the good wife and the good maotherthe proposition met with so hearty a response as to establish the loyalty of the southwarkians beyond disputemr locee said that if sir charles napier were grateful for the honour which had been conferred upon him how much more must he mr locke be who in comparison with that gallant admiralwas an untried man he had had no doubt from the commencement that his views were in perfect coincidence with their own and it was most gra tifying for him to find that he possessed their entire con dence and that he should have an opportunity while eliminating their sentiments of giving utterance to those o fiaous which he had himself long cherished cheers his gallant colleague had referred to france and it was somewhat remarkable that one of the most distinguished writers of the present daydumas had been on the spot during the whole of their public proceedings in order that he might ascertain how english popular elections were conducted m dumas had commumeated his ideas to the parisian journal la prasse and they were to be found full of interest and instraction translated in some of the london newspapers of that morn ing mir locke then went through the principal points of his address and vindicated the cause of the lawyers referring to tierney w brougham and d w harvey as lawyers whom the borough had at different times returned as their representatives he repeated the expression of his perfect independence and declared that going now to the house of commons for the first time he should forget all party cries and that he should consider himself as the representative of every man in the borough who had any right to assert or any claim to urge cheersmr pellatt next presented himself and although there was evidently a strong feeling against him on the part of the crowd the frank manner in which he extended his hand to the successful candidates conciliated some of his more demonstrative opponents they were too generous i e was sure he said not to give a fair hearing to a defeated candidate he respected the constituency of southwark he respected their choice upon this occason and he bowed with complacency and submission to the elec tion which had just taken place he had however always thought that one commercial representative was essential to southwark and having been five years in their service iaving spent much labour time and money in their cause having originated many useful measures in parliament having been constant in his attendance having been always accessible to his constituents and having vidicated on all occasions the great cause of civil and religiors liberty he had hoped that he an old servant would not have been dis missed to make way for a new and untried man cheers and uproar ehe vindicated his vote on the chinese ques tion declaring it to be a crowning act of humanity in which he gloried he quoted from m m chevalier a grateful testimony to the religious feeling of the british people trusted that the english sabbath would always be preserved intact and expressed a hope in conclusion that the cry of pellatt and locke would never again be heard in antaponisu hut that they would be  locked in a bond of christian union and national patriotism for the bene fit of their common country cheesson the motion of sir c nsrrxa seconded by mr locke and supported by ivr pellatt a vote of thanks most eminently due was passed to the high bailiffmr prrrchard acknowledged in becoming terms the compliment he expressed the gratification which he had experienced in presiding over such an intelligent body of the inhabitants of southwaar he thanked theni for the order which they had preserved and stated that the manner in which the electors had exercised their suffrage coupled with the extraordinary supporb which had been afforded them by the nonelectors supplied to him the strongest reasons which it was possible to adduce in favour of a great extension of the fraichisethe proceedings then terminatedlambeththe official declaration ofthe numbers was made yester day

mr williams duly elected to represent the borough of lambeth in parliamentmr rorpicll addressed the crowd tendering to the electors his warmest tbanks for the manner in which they had supported him on this great occasion and had placed him in the proud position of their representative by a larger majority than had ever been given to any one member in this country cheers this was a glorious triumphthe triumph of liberty and truth over the modern stem of timeserving and hypocrisy ioh and cheers he was not unduly puffed up by bis position he gloried in it it was true but it occasioned him grave considerations he was fully aware of the tremendous responsibility now devolving upon him and this reflection cast an air of gravity and of religious feeling over his mind which he boped would never forsake him hear hearthe next parliament would be an historical parliament subjects would be brought before that house of the greatest importance to them and to futurity both in regard to our foreign relations and to domestic politics he need not say that he would give his earnest attention to these matters ed that he would devote himself to their interestsandtothoseof his country cheers andnow he would allude to a subject not quite so agreeable this election up to a certain period was conducted in a munnerreflecting credit upon every one concerned il yester day however for the first

to meeng his constituents every year inorder to render them an account of his stew ardship and trusted that the aimighty would help him to be true to them and to represent their interests faithfully loud cheersmr w willanis was proud of the honourof addresing the electors of lambeth for the third time as his constitu ents he owed the position which he now occupied to the exertions of independent electors and not to the efforts of paid or hired canvassers in all parts of the borough friends of his had come forward to support him becluse they felt that in so doing they were supporting the great caunse of economy and reform hie himslf was only a humble though energetc instrument in earring out these important national objects but what he was more proud of than even the honour of representing this borough wps that the electors had sent him to the house of commons free and independent that they had not placed their member in the disgrul position of being tied to the car of a minister tobdaedraggeadtbrough any corruption which that muinister chose to approve cheers xe could only say that he would act as hehad hitherto actedfor their good and the good of his country and that do other consideration should ever influence him in any vote he should give astheir renre sentative he hoped he should have opportunities of sup porting lord palmerstonas government but the noble lord would only obtain that sapport if he brought forward good measures hear hear lord palmerston had promised a great deal and it would be the duty of the next parliament to endeavour to make him per formn his promise his hon colleague had just referred to certain proceedings which had taken place at this elec tion it had been his mr williass most anxious desire to conduct the eection in a manner perfectly free from any illfeeling whatever toward any candidate and he had never said a word against his late colleague who on this oocasion was his great opponent on the other side how ever they had done all they possibly could to pick a hole in his politcal conduct though they could bring nothing for ward but vulgar ribaldry which he could perfectly well afdford to laught at cheers he thanked the electors imostgratefully for the high honour they had conerred upon him and promised tnat not one of those who hadvon him his vote should either be ashamed or should repent of having done so cheersmz wilkdson was received with hisses and partial cheering he said they had had the satisfaction of turning him out and therefore they might as well hear him for a few minutes rx roupell had alluded to the notice which he had been advised to give and had described this as an insult to the constitueney lr boupell however had equally insulted the constituency by serving him with a precisely simil r notice laughter and cheers he mr wilkinson had been defeated and the cause of that defeat he believed to be twofold first of all there had been a coalition against him  ho no and cheers then as they knew there had been a very large expen diture of money and again attempts had been made not without sucoess to prejudice the minds of the working classes against him calumnies had been uttered respecting him many of which were untrue ad statements of facts had been made to which an imroper colouring had been give these things had ashe said prejudiced against him the minds of the worldng classes with regard to whom he was conscious that he had never done anything adverse to their interests and that he had devoted much time and at tention to the study of their condition and of their wants bear hear he did not envy the position of either of the successful candidates it would have been his desire to be elected by the unbought suffrages of the electors if he had not those unbought auffrageshe was contented to be without them nor again would he submit to the humiia tion or indignity of being brought in upon the skirts of another candidate cries of how about harvey then  and much interruption the electors had thought fit to return an untried man who certainly promised very fairly though in another sense he psoomised too much a laugh and they had taught him mr wil kinson one lesson which he was sorry to learn they had shalken his faith in large constituencies because they had proclaimed to the world that among such constituencies the man with the longest purse was sure to win the battle no and confusion mr roupell might turn out to be a priae and might serve themfathfuuyand diligently as hebelievedlhenhself had done but if this were so and at theend of the netparliament a richer man came forwardno matter who the electors would turn mr roupell out if he had served them ever so faithfully  no no  this would be the consequence whenever constituencies forgot long tried services and fastened their faith upon nevw favourites without sufficient regard to what they had done or what they were likely to perform he mr wilkinson had never given a vote in his life which he did not believe to be for the good of the working classes he anc they might differ as to the mode of benefiting them for example they often asled for acts of parliament to remedy their condition which would really do them more harm than good andthen he had felt bound to vote against such measures in conclusion he hoped the electors would not be disappointed in the new member they had chosen and trusted that that gentleman would fulfil their highest expectationsthe proceedings closed with three cheers for the queen and a vote of thanks to the returning officerberkshrrefrom

lot of many men to have served the same constitlency for  years in succes sion cheers he had sat for that county in  parlia ments and he hoped that in that time he had not mads many enemies  no no  nor lost any friends hear he ventured to hope so from the numerous marks of favoar and approbation which had been bestowed upon him and also fromn finding that the descendants of old friends who had passed away followed in the footsteps of their ancestors and gave him their support ee had so often expressed his political views on that spot that it might perhaps bethought that he had now said enough but he would not shrink frown declaring what had been his conduct with regard to a ques tion which had for some time greatly occupied the mind of the publiche meant the china question he was not about to apologize for his votes be cause he believed that they had been in general accordance with the opinions of his constitu ents rear with regard to the chi question it had been said that no constituency oughttopetheirconfi dence in any one who had by his vote on that question been directly or indirectly the cause of the present stae of affairs and that the vote was an attempt to displace the present government nor he could only say that when he gave his vote upon the motion he did so with no desire to see lord pdlmerston removed from office the term infam ous coalition had been applied to the nieeting in the same lobby of persons who did not usually act together now he had most certainly joined in no coalition the motion had been brought forward by mr cobden the nun of all others in the house of conmmons he wlas the leastlikely to follovr and it was opposed by scarcely any menmber of eminence in the house with the exception of those gen tlemen comnected with the government and no less than  members who usuoally snpportedthe government voted against them on that occasion the decision was arrived at on the merits of the case solely and for his own part he had voted as he had done because he was tisfied that sir j bowring had gone beyond his instructions pdndtdnanded a far greater reparation than was necessary under the cir cumstances of the case evea admitting that the chinese had insulted the british flagand no man would stand more upon the honour of the british flag than himselfthe punishment had far exceeded the offence the reprisals which were madeat first ought to have been quite suticient to satisfy the authorities abroad until they received instruc tii ns from home and if they had waited for those instruc tions he did not believe that they would have found them selves called upon to batter down forts and bomnbard a uty in order to punish an offence of the nature of that wbich had been committ ed the fact of the government having since done that which if they had done before the motion would have been withdrawn appeared to him tbe a complete justification for every gentleman who had voted against hehm the motion was a censure upon sir j bowriag and if the government ehose to take a vote of censure upon one of their tsapzoys as a vote of censure pon themsyves he was not responsoefor their doing so hlcould only add that he
