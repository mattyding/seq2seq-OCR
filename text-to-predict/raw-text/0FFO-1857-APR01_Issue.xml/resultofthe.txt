result of the eleconswe congmtulatd ourselves and the electors of the united kingdom generillys on the results of the last few days these results hav shown beyond all doubtfirst that the people of this country are determned to support the government which owes its existence to their approval in the pursuance oft measures necessary for their honour and welfare and tss suppress all factious cavilling and all opposition for opposi tions sake to those who are antrusted forthe time beingwitl the destinies of england and secondlv that they are na less determined to exact from the miniser of itheir choices the prompt execution of the reforms on which they have set their heart the fact that so far as can b judg from the elections hitherto held lord pulmerstorsbe largely indebted for his majority in the next parliament to the more decided reformers is sufficienfi to allay any apprehension which may have been excited by the sneer in which the leader of the oppo sition indulged concerning the tory chief of a rlicai cabinet this being the case we cannot see any reason why every exertion should not be made to secure for the premier as large a majority as can be obtained with x view to the more rapid and efficient despatch of publiz business we do not see that any credit should be given to those who opdose and harass a ministry simply as such it is very well to talk about the necessity that the house of commons should exercise an effective control over the ad ministration of the national affairs this is quite true but it is equally true that it is not the business of the house to carrv on the queens government but to see that it is carried on upon those principles which are pro fessed by the ministry and have been sanctioned by the country it is also true that to pass a vote of censure uupom the conduct of one administration wlan there is no possi bility of replacng it by another is simply absurd and we cannot but rejoice at the numerous defeats sustained by those who induced the house of comnons thus to stultify itself and more especially by those members whose political career has been apparently directed to no other end than that of making all government whatever an extreme diffi culty if not an impossibility we should be sorry indeed to see the independence of the house of commons compromised hy servile complaisance to any minister whatever but this is a danger whicka is too remote for practical consideration the great point to be borne in mind is that unless a ministrj cam command an efficient working majority izrthe house of com mons the business of the nation cannot be properly done it is to be hoped accordingly that the results of the remain ing elections will confirm the augury to be drawn franz those which have already taken place and will reverse for lord palmerston the well known phrase describing the fate of a weak ministry it is unable to carry good measures it is compeled to carry badmanchear guardian o yesterdaybelgim and ewnrithe commercial pro tectionists of belgium have ado pted a comical way of ex pressing their detestation of england and free trade in aprocession which passed through the streets of tournay at the mid lont festival last week the english nation was personified by a huge bigbellied figure a sort of gargantua the great with vast open jaws devouring all sorts of foodt in most unconscionable quantities while a number of otherigures representingthe other nationsof the world stood by starving the car of perde awion was drawn through the town with much vulgar and vociferous derision conveying lord mangefort as te representative of our country was nicknamed who was made every quater of an hnur to stop and swallow a heap of victuals bread meat poultry an rabbits butter and cheese and other commodities of which an englishman like the native of any other coultry desires to consume as much as he wants after exhibiting this spectacle in front of the houses of several leading advocates of free trade the mob proceeded to the river escaut and with cries of a neau les anaais i they predpiatec their awkward plaything into the water the eatables however which lord mangefort had left were put by till next day when they were distributed among thei workpeople of a flax mill the owners of which establish ment are said to have paid the expenses of the

its former state of utter prostration the class of small far mers aided by english money have rapidly acquired that modest competence which is the general characteristic of our agriculturists  while
