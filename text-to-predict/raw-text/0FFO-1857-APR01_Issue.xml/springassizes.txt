the prosecution when ahis lordseip intesfered and said he was clearlyof opinion that the prisoner could not be indicted under the statute of the th and th of george iv cap  the prisoner was clrly a partner in point of law and to that extent an owner of the property and as such not indictable under that actmr jamvs then suggested whether the prisoner might not be liable under the section of the jointstock com panies act which rendered liable shareholders of joint stock banks who had being officers of the company emn bezzled the property of the companyhis lordsbp however saidi am clearly of opinion that the jointstock companies act gives no authority for this indictment in the case of jointstock banks there is certainly a special enactment as to embezzlement c that arose from a breach of contract but in this case no such provision applied to the prisoner nor could he be found guilty of an unlawful act in destroying property of which he was himself partowner had this company been regis cered under the late act the th and th of victoria the defence as to partownership ould have fallen to the ground and in due time all companies would come under the recent a ct the prisoner must be

day with the trial of a cause arising out of some bank tuptoy proceedim in its character wholly uninterestingkr baron martin sat for the trial of prisoners in the early part of the day and then tried common jury causes mr bliss qc sitting in the magistrates room for the trial of prisonerscrown couartbefore mr baron maxr samuel bevington and wiliam cornett were indicted for forgerymr brett prosecuted and mr simon defended the pri sofiersfrom the statement of the learned counsel it appeared hat the prisoners had forged the mark of a person named mmulen to a note of the liverpool adelphi loan com pany for  the facts of the case having been clearly provedmr simon upon the part of the prisoners endeavoured to show that they had received some sort of authority from mmullen which went to negative the felonious intent but his lordstnp stopped the case stating that he con sidered the intent to defraud clearly provedthe jury thereupon by direction of his lordship found both prisoners guilty and in passing sentencethe learned judge saidthe evidence against you has satisfied my mind beyond au doubt that you are both guilty of the crime of forgery and you are probably aware that formerly the law of this country made such an offence punishable with death and hundreds of persons have been executed in past times for this very offence but of late years the legislature has taken a more humane view and very materially reduced thespunishment but i wish you and all persons to know that it isa most dangerous thing to write axnother mans name waithout his distinct authority and the judï¿½s have determined to punisht all perssis who are found so offending with great severity i have conferred with mr justice crompton and he entirely coincides withmke in thinking that the intent is clearly proven by thne very act of writing the name or mark of another person where a man does it knowing well what he is about if it were not so business could never be carried on especially banldng business i regard it as a double fraud you defraud firsb the man of womn you borrow the money and you defraud the man whose name and credit are imperiued by your aot i have con sidered the matter very much in this instance i am quite satisfied of your legal guilt but there may be some con sideration for you as to your moral guilt the distinction in this offence between legal and moral guilt may be exem plified by the instance of legal malice as ilustrated in the difference between murder and manslaughter and as you have been in prison some time i shall sentence you each to three months imprisonment and hard labouris lordssip on passing sentence today upon various prisoners fouad guilty of garotte robberies saidi am de termined to do my utmost to put down this system of highway robbery which i am sorry to find very much upon the increise in manchester and liverpool it is per fectly monstrous that persons should be liable to be violently assaulted in the way they are and halfstrangled and robbed i repeat it must and shall be put a stop to and if the punishment i am about to give you proves insufficent depend upon it that the judge who comes here in the summer will make the punishment of this offence much heavier people passing through the street are entitled to the protection of the law and have a right to go about their lawful business in safety either by day or night his lordship then sentenced  drisoners to various terms of penal servitude from four to six years he added he was glad to find a diminution in the number of burglary cases
