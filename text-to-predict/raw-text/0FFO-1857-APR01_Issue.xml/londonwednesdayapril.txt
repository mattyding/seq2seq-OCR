londozn wednesday april  the elections have already totally changed the whole face of the political heavens we are no longer as we were a fortnight ago as regards either this chinese question or a dozen others of much older and nearer interest people do not now ask who will be in the new parliament but exclaim what a parliament there will be out of doors the expurgation not only of vicious but even of some meritorious elements proceeds almost too rapidly when the house of commons meets it will be with the serious consciousness that a great number of its most active and able spirits are discontented exiles moving heaven and earth and ready to go lower still to obtain readmission it will be in the case of the celestial empire besieged by  outer barbarians or foreign devils as the vagrant sympathies of some will entitle them to be called outside of the house agitating haranguing witing plotting combining and all but coalescing will be conden bnaoht m gibsxn mil and w j fox

for codmx or m gibson and no conden to faand up lis own purge has operated too effectively by half for he has turned the house out of doors like the old lady in the nursery rhymehe has sold his bed and now lies upon straw in the house we should think the result will be a little more calmness and decency of discussion and a little less of that peculiar style of oratory which has recently been imported from  the bright region of the setting  sun into the british house of commons even mr gladstoe mnay practise the propriety which he may not perhaps feel whern he sees that he has thundered his house down on his own head there is just a hope that in the comparative tran quillity of the new house some youthful members hitherto crushed stunned and tonguetied may find courage and opportunity to make themselves heard now at least is their time and the sooner they apply themselves to rescue the house from the tyranny of rant the easier will they find itbut as we have observed there will now be a parliament out of doors there will be two oppo sitions who will no doubt be quite as ready to nmerge little differences as on a recent occasion the country will be brought back to the state of things before the reform act that almost for gotten antediluvian era when it was said that parliament must be reformed for the talent out of the house was too strong for the talent within we may be sure there wil be a prodigious cry for a new reform bill it stands to reason there must be one can that system be a good one it will be asked under which cobden has had to give up the west riding and be thrown out of huddersfield  would the balot have returned two respectable manufacturers for man chester  would any of the other casualties have occurred with a large electoral district household suffrage and vote by ballot would not mralr pellatt wilkinson sir w clay and a dozen other men of the people have been returned at tho head of the poll of course there wil now be a cry for reform as incessant and loud as the storm at the gates and walls of a beleaguered city the excluded will not be satisfied with a moderate measure and the longer they have to wait the less easy wil they be to please there are indeed some considerations to suggest a little breathingtime in the first place we have a good many other things to do besides polishing up an old constitution and in the second place as a new reform act of a serious character must be followed immediately by a dissolution it is well to consider whether we are ripe yet for another general election if then we notice what we have little doubt will be the chief cry of the new parliament in or out of doors it is in order that our public men may pre pare their minds for a strong measure before very long there is no need in these days that anybody should connimt himself against reform happily there are no ironheaded lord chancellors of twenty years standing no thirdclass statesmen who sur vive only as traditions of an antirevqlutionary war no famous old dukewith only two notions of politics obstinate resistance and final retreat there is no reason why everybody should not hold himself entirely free unfettered and uncompronised on this question and considering the changes which public opinion is likely to undergo in the controversy it is better everybody should beware of committing himself many a reputation was wrecked through want of this caution at the last re form bill many a good man was lost to the state and what perhaps is a more serious evil than either many a conscientious man first learnt to stifle the dictates of private judgment in the frenzy and hubbub of a political faction fightif there must be a pause of a year or two before the measure be brought into form it ought to gain instead of losing by the delay we want a com prehensive measure and one which will set the subject at rest for many years as for the partial and onesided proposals which have been brought forward of late and the rejec tion of which has been much insisted on during the election controversies it is to be observed that the most prominent of them mr locexz ihgs motion has nothing to do with the very important elections of last week they were town not county elections and decided by  not even  householders nor is it really pro bable that vote by ballot or equal electoral dis itricts would have affected such elections as those of manchester huddersfield southwark the tower hamlets lambeth and other large constituencies disappointed candidates will ever be ready to believe that with a fairer field and less favour they must have been more successful but there are considerations always at work which no electoral system can obviate in the present instance it is evident that some of the disappointed eandidates nmst have sadly underrated the force of those feelings which go under the general name of patriotism was it reasonably to be expected that the population should rise to advocate the right of a fellow like yen to pull down the british flag flying over a peaceful vessel engaged in british trade and carry away the crew for the purpose of beheading an old man who was said to be the father of a pirate englishmen must be very much altered since we formed our first and freshest impressions of them if any ingenuity whatever can persuade them not only into allowing ths but even into an enthusiasm for it and its author his defenders and abettors no parliamentary reform would have made any difference here no imaginable apparatus no scale of suffrage no equality of divisions nothing whatever short of driving the voters up to the hustings and making them vote for messrs cobden and gladstone on penalty of death would have affected the result it is the old english heart and the simple english nature which have done the work here from all kinds of constituencies great and small popular and close there has been the same result for our part we never desired or even imagined that an appeal would be made to the people on such a question to us it seemsthe height of absurdity that any men profess ing to be statesmen should force such an appeal upon the minister he had no choice however but to accept it in behalf of the people ancl confi dent as we were as to the result we were satisfied the appeal had been made that satisfaction increases every day andl england may now be congratulated on a parliament elected not upon any measure or political difference but simply on an appeal to the natural feelings and common sense of the people
