melansoly casson monday evening an in quest was held by mr j lister coroner at the great northern railway station doncaster on the body of a single woman named eliza bolton who had died early in the morning of the same day under the following ciroum stances the deceased arrived at doncaster from rother ham on sunday morning in the evening she went to the station for the purpose of returning to the latter place and sat down on a bench on a platform she complained to one of the porters that she was tired and cold and he invited her into one of the waitingrooms where however there was no fire almost immediately afterwards he heard a cry of distress and on going to the waitingroom in com pany with another porter he found the poor woman laid on the hearthrug and evidently in great agony it was soon apparent that she was in labour and female assistance was procured mrs hallister of the refreshment rooms rendering very prompt and timely aid until the arrival of an experienced nurse and a medical man the child was however born before the two latter coutld get to the station sand the woman was removed as carefully as possible to the workhouse additional medical assistance was then obtained but the deceased began to sink rapidly and after an interval of delirium in which she frequently repeated the name of her mother she expired shortly after  oclock on monday morning it appears that the unfor tunate young woman formerly lived in doncaster and had there a sweetheart by whom she was basely deserted it is not known how or where she spent her time on sunday but from her wearied and cold state on returming to the station at night she would scem to have had no place of shelter the jury returned a verdict of died from col lapse after confinement and highly commended the promptitude and humanity show n by mrs ldiaallister and the railwvay officialsrassrvo sunxggn vessels at sebastopolthe apparatus now in process of construction in this country to be used in raising sunken vessels in the sebastopol harbour is larger and more complete than any heretofore emloyed for a similar purpose the work will be done from immense caissons of wooden floats supporting eight engines of horse power each of which drives a double action pump connecting with enormous hydraulic rams these rams weigh  lb apiece and have a lift inpower of  tons they consist of nothing but a cylinder and piston to the latter of which a chain is attached which is also fastened to the sunken vessels when the piston has been driven up to the cylinder head by the pressure of the condensed water the chain is kept at that point the piston is run out again and so by suc cessive hitches the work is done four rams can be brought to bear on one vessel at a time gear work may also be attached to the engines so as to derive from each of them an additional lifting power of  tons four engines and the same number of rams operating together wil therefore supply an aggregate power of  tens wvhich ie more than is reqired to raise the largest ship in the harbour of the  sunken vessels only  are equal in size to the u s frigate pennsylvania weighing in water some  tons and the rest will average  tons the chains now being forged at pittsville are much larger than those spoken of bythe english papers as making for the steam ships adriatic and great eastern being  yards in length weighing  lb to the link and capable of su taining a strain of  tons the iron sheaths throuah which the chains will pass and which will be placed on the timber docks to be sent out from philadelphia on the th inst will weigh each  tons the submarine operations will bh performed by the aid of gowans diving bell a con trivance never yet exhibited in thiscountry and his armour which was used with success in the raising of the u s steamer missouri in the recent extrication of a safe from the sunken boat atlantic in lake erie and on several other occasions mr gowan expects to get up at least forty of the vessels whole the rest he will blow to pieces the russian government contraeting to furnish the powder as the greatest depth of water is only  feet and the surface is smooth as a mill pond for the greater part of the year mr gowan will be able to prosecute his labour to great advantage and hopes to complete the job within two years he receives for his pay one half of the value of all the ships raised as appraised by an officer of the government and himself the larger vessels cost some  dollars each and were only a year old when snnk so that it will be seen that mr gowan has a chance to make a snug little profit on lis contract the expense of the entire oatfit is not far from  dollars three vessels will be employed in transporting men implements c to the scene o action the first will sail early in may the secord about the middle of the month and the third at the close of it mr gowan will take out ninety men eon sisting of divers engineers caulkers ship and house car
