not the swiss plenipq tentiary not being yet prepared with a categorical answer to the propositions of m de hatzfeldt colonel barmann the resident swiss minister had an interview today with count walewaki the distance between what prussia proposes and what switzerland demandseven on the hypothesis that the conditions mentioned in the indgpendance and other belgian papers are correct is sufficiently wide for an approach to be made without large concessions on one side or the other if not on both but i have reason to believe that the real propositions are not such as have been stated and that they are in point of fact much harder if the swiss be dissatisfied on account of the delay that has taken place and the nonfulfilment of the promises and hopes held out to thenu months ago they will very probably be much more so in a few days hence when the real conditions on which the king of prussia agrees to renounce his sovereignty are known in the meantime the representatives of france and england are doing their best to smooth the way to an arrangementit is said that the intervention of the british and french governments for the arrangement of the existing differences

even at an advanced price it is expected that the spring trade will become more active in the course of the next  days accounts from the manufacturing districts state that business is still dull at rouen and mulhouse but that at roubaix st quentin rheims and aniens appear ances are more promising the new stuffs com posed of wool with a mixture of cotton are more sought than the manufactures of rouen letters from lyons state that orders have been re ceived there for rich silks velvets embroidered shawls and figured waistcoats of which there is a great variety of patterns and for which the lyons manufacturers are unrivalled satin articles likewise which had long been ne glected are now coming into favour since raw silk has become so dear the lyons manufacturers confine themselves to the preparation of expensive stuffs from which alone they can derive any profit there is a remarkable fall in the price of leather to be remarked in this market and the stock of that article is increasing this decline in price is attri buted to the substitution of moleskin for the common hide the war and navydepartanents have given large orders for articles to be made of moleskin the railway companies likewise have adopted it it has been ascertained that for strength and durability it is equal to calfskin and is from  to  per cent cheaper it is expected that the opening of the bordeaux and cette

defence of the policy of austria towards sardinia and a brief summary of it must be given as the paper in question is in comexzion with the foreignoffice the post begins by observing that the sardinians in this empire will require no other protection than that which is accorded by the imnpe ral government to au foreigners as the difference between austria and sardinia is a political and not a national one austria has no dislike to the vigorous and gifted race that lives to the west of lombardy her quarrel is with the sardinian government which has long disloy ally and perfidiously endeavoured to undermine untemiwihlen the neighbouring states in true pharisaic spirit the vienna writer spsaks of the be haviour of the press of this country the austrian papers we are told never soiled besutdete the ho nour and reputation of the sardinian army nor offended the dignity of king victor emmanuel although they felt no sympathy for that monarch the right of eingland and france to interfere between austria and sardinia is denied every great power being able to juldge for itself what line of conduct is most conformable to its interests and dignity the enemies of austria affirm that sar dinia acquired a claim to the friendship of the western powers by the services which she rendered them in the crimea but they find it convenient to forget that the concentration of austrian troops in gallicia and the bukovina forced russia to keep a whole army ready for action in the kingdom of polandas theforegoing is an arpartestatementit isrequi site to make one or two remarks on it the austrian press is not so unoffending as it would fain endeavour to appear and it would not be difficult to find fierce and even coarse attacks on the king of sardinia on the emperor of the french and oxn the late emperor of russia in numbers of austri papers which have appeared during the last few years in an article which i well recollect although it was published long ago it was said that his majesty victor emmanuel was more like a mountebank than like a monarch by occupying the danubian princi palities and by concentrating an army on the polish frontier austria rendered excellent service to her allies but in june  she suddenly placed the d and th armies on a peace footing and byso doing enabled the russian government to send the grenadier corps to the crimeaintelligence has been received from venioe which entirely confirms a rumour of which slight mention w as made in my letter of yesterday at halfpast  on the d inst the archduke governorgeneral arrived at venice where he was coolly received one reason why but few pesons were assembled to receive his imperial eighness was that the higher classes at venice were at dinner when he arrived and another that the d was the anniversary of the battle of novara early in the morning of the th there was little or no wind and consequently the austrian standard which is at the top of the immense mast that is planted in the place of st mark hung listlessly down but as the sum got higher the wind freshened and the flag began to wave majestically to and fro gradually a crowd assembles in the place of st mark and stares with might and main at something which is fluttering just above the imperial standard what is the object that attracts such attention and induces the venetian badauds to bid defiance to rain and wind it is the italian tricolour which has been attached to the uapper part of the austrian standard during the night when the authorities arrived on the spot and orders were given to lower the flag they could not be im mediately executed because the halliards had been removed during the night between the d and th three tricolours were hoisted one was on the place of st mark another on the flagstaff which is in the arsenal and a third was affixed to the top of a sentrybox there are persons who suspect the police or the military authori ties of having hoisted the revolutionary flag in order to serve some particular purpose but those who best know the italians are least inclined to doubt that they were the authors of the paltry insult which was offered to the austrian standard there was the usual official illuniination of the place of st mark in the evening of the d in a fortnight or three weeks the archduke ferdinand maximilian will remove from venice to milan it is very generally stated that the austrian govern ment has resolved to defer the construction of the railroad between milan and the austrian frontier near novara but it is difficult to believe that the rulers over  of souls can intend to take such a petty revenge austria justly conuiders her self one of the first of european powers but unfor tunately for her own reputation she somietimes acts as if she were one of

frontier there have been several cabinet councils held here lately and it is believed hun garian matters have been discussed at more than one of them a person who is capable of giving correct information on such a delicate subject as sures me that the emperor has declared that no  principiel changes can be made in the organiza tion of hungary in a word the unity of the empire will bo strictly maintained but everything will be done to improve the administration of the different crqwn lands and to satisfy the legiti mate wishes of the inhabitants the crlit bank has established a branch bank at pesth and will advance money at  per cent on the produce of the soilsince his return here the emperor has expressed his resolve to enlarge the inner cityprussiafrom our own coauxornuinberlinw maroe the commission appointed in each house of the diet here has already brought up its report on the sound dues treaty and both of them unani mously recommend the house to adopt it for ratification this will doubtless take place to morrow as the subject is already on the lhst of the business for that day prussia will pay her quota in  halfyearly payments of lf thalers each lgl retainiing to herself the rioht at any future time it may be convenient to pay up the remaining instalments in advance the first pay ments will amount with interest on the outstanding balance to about  thalers each small as this halfyearly sum is compared to the advantagesgained for prussia by the abolition of the sound dues the revenues of the state will not be burdened by an addition of more than threefifths of it or about  thalers yearly inasmuch as the state has always been in the habit of allowing its own subjects a drawback of  per cent to be deducted from all import duties in the baltic ports as a sort of palliation of the burden of the sound dues and has also paid on salt alone of which it has the monopoly on an average of the lat  years  thalers ayear for sound dues these two suns of  duty on salt and  drawback on import duties must therefore be first deducted from the  thalers before one can appreciate the extra burden which the redemption of the sound dues imposes on the revenue and that too only for  yearsi mentioned some time back that this ministrywas left in a mainority on the subject of the pro posed new law of divorce the day after our own ministers found themselves in a similar position on the chinese affair the prussian ministry however had another defeat on friday when one of its most important financial projectsthat for a new duty on all houses and build ingswas rejected by the large majority of against  this defeat by no means finds an equi valent in a success it gained yesterday viz in passing its bill for raisng the duty on salt from  thalera per cask of  cwt to  thalers at which it for merly stood for not only was the favourable ma jority in this latter case very small viz only  while tbe adverse majority inthe other case was  but also the increase of the duty on salt is very unpopular here the debates in the two houmes of the diet have gained considerably in interest of late for those who take any interest at all in prassiafrom the circumstane that the necessity of remedying two evils the ineffectiveness of the army and the wretched pay of the civil officias has driven the government to seek for increae revenue by the introduction of new taxes and thus stirred the houses and the nation out of their political apathy which they gloss over in general with the ptrns latable euphemism of gmthlichkeiit tns
