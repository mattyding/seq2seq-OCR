 thb conlfrbenobom our speciax cobresponde npera dec lord salisbury has been here eight days but it is too early as yet to report progress we receive evey assurance as to the conciliatory disposition evinced by all the personages on whom tbe settle mnent of the present difficulty in a great measure depends but the difficulty atiu looms bafore us almost insurmountable let it be understood that the success of the conference must be the result of two separate and perfectly distinct operations in the first place it is necessary that the rapresen tatives of the six european powers should agree on the demands which they are to urge in their joint name llpon the sublime porte in the second place they must devise tho means by which the ac ceptance of those dmands by the porte may be determined ther can be little doubt as to the justice anl even moderation of the proposals of which her majestys government gave the first hint and which th cabinet of st petersburg promnptly and almost too eagerly endorsed englaud and russia are equally bound to see that the condition of the christians of bosnia hierze govina and bulgaria is improved by substan tial reforms unless these reforms be granted and placed by the conference under a very solid euro pean guarantee russia will act alone upon her own responsibilities  or in other words she will at tempt to obtain those reforms by rmight of arras england seems less disposed to go the samelengths she will try all that negotiation can achive that failing she will further considersupposing that russia england anid the other powers vere agreed as to thie liberties and guaran tees to be obtained in favour of tho three northern provinces they might still be met by the govern mentof the porte withl the objectionsfirst thatany interference on their pirt in any matter concerning the internal affairs of the ottomran empire would be a violation of the paris treaty of   seconid that the liberties the powers would demand on be half of those three provinces are contained in and exceeded by the nsw reforms and institutions with which all the provinces of the empire will presently be endowed  and third that any attempt on the part of the powers to take up the cause of the chris tianswouldrousea violentoutburst of angry passions amonig the mussulmans of wvhich it miglht be imr possible fur the governmeni t foresee the conse quencesall these arguments are spcious and illusory bnt they hava their strength in the dogged obsti nacy of the turks and still more in the encou ragement the turks find in some of the self constituted interpreters of public opinion in europe the very tirst nileasnire by which one might hope to give order and tranquillity to the bosnian and bulgarian districts wvould be a general and strict disarmament of the population yet wvhat says one of the most influential journals in france   whio knows but the mere aniounce ment of a disarmament of the mussulman popula tion night not in itself provoke a niussacre like those we have so lately deplored f  the mussulmans the same paper continues set great store by their weapons and evea supposing that the porte should consout to take them from their hands they  would doubtless rise against a measure which in their conceit would be degra dationtheir firgt wrath naturally being directed against their christian fellowsulbjects it is this kind of reasoning which tends to per petuate the viciouxs circle in wlhich the question has been at all times involved tie turkish uovern ment declares its perfect willingness to do justice to all the creeds and nationalities within tire otto man empire tire midhat constitutioni is based on the equal rights and duties of men all the privi leges and admantages hitherto claimed by the turks as the coniquerinig and dominant race as the military caste are to be abolished aird the government is to be based on a representative system springing from some sort of universal sutfrage ylt the first step towards tiro establishment of this desirable state of things which is the removal of the veapons by which one class of citizens terrorizes the other can not be ventured ipoen lest forsootli it should lead to a wholesale slauiliteragain as the aisarmament of the population must needs be considered a preliminary measure towvards the introduction of tire necessary reforms and the goverunient of tire porte does not feel sufficiently strong to efiect thie disarmament it might not seem inexpedielnt that the european powers should take this arduous and dangerous task upon themselves and tins they could do by their joint occupation of those provinces where the disarmanmenit has to bo cairied out  but here again we aro met with the assuranice that the appearance of a single foreign soldier across the ottoman fron tier would be the signal for thio massacre which the whole world so anxiously deprecates let us well weigh the chances of such contingency however there have been several frightful massacres in trrkeyone at scio another at jeddah a tliird at damascus and last not least the recent one in bulgaria  anid in no case bave the murderers been impelled either by the pressuro of foreign powers or the dread of a foreign invasion the feroeity of mulssutlman fanaticism has simply broken out upon a slight provocation of the unarmed and defeuceless christians one might very much qtuestion whether the fear of a foreign occupation and the prospct of a severe retaliation might not rather damp and cool than inflame the murderers passions in the recent case of bul garia it would not be difficult to prove that the men inauthority whose duty it should have been to prevent the massacres have not only insti gated but actually prepared them long before hand but at alt events one might try what could be done towards keeping the people quiet by holding the governmont responsible for their good behavioura certain class of politicians has a notion that any attempt to bring the turk to reason would further the ends of those powers or say of that power which has long been com passing the downfall of turkey with a view to its own aggranidisement lot aniy imaginable joint occupation of any part of turkey be contrived these politioians say russia and russia alone wvill ultimnatelv be the gainer by it only let the rus sians establish themselves in bulgaria the above quoted frencl journal reasons only let thenr become masters of european turkey arid one can affirm without in tie least impugning the honesty of their intentions that they will never withdraw from it  all this nma be perfectly true i shormld myself think it extremely probable but it will be well perhaps to look also at the alternative supposing either that in obedience to the turkish threats of christian massacres or out of jealous apprehensions of russian ambition the five european powers should so far shrink either from actingwith russia or from otherwise exercising the necessary pressure on turkey as to break up the conference witlhout ary practical results one of two things must happen either russia woulrd attempt to make goodl her boast about enforcing her will on turkey singlehanided and then there would be war between russia and turkey with the option on tir part of england and the other powers of upholding turkey against russia and thus vir turuy making themselves partakers of all turkeys iniquities  or russia might be afraid of committing herself to a struggle of which she could not calcu late the magnitude and thenr turley left to herselr unable and unwilling to mend her ways would hasten to her destruction by a continuation andaggravation of that misrule which has plunged her into her present difficulties she would be hounded on in her inadness by those samne russian intrigues and led from bad to worse by that same ruissisir ascendencyjivhich has bewildered and led astray the counoils of the porte ever since the wvestern powers withdrew their countenance from the east after the fruitless sacrifices by wbich they endea voured to save turkey first by fighting her battles then by pointing out the way to her regenerationlook at the subject as one may it is impossible not to see in the present stats of things the conse quence of the situation created by the rmprovidence of the paais conference of  or not to feel the necessity of correcting tho errors of that epoch by the conference of  twenty yeas ago russia was prostrate and the victorious western powers trusting that the punishment thenad inflicted would never ba forgotten ancthat turkey had no longer anytfrom her northern neighbours shrank from the task of cleansiiig the augaen stables of ottoman misrule and accepted prouises of which they little cared to exact the f ment the consequence was that from that time to the downfau of abdul azizsgovernment russia had all the play to herself andx the disorders of the ottoman empire and the suf ferings of its christian subjects raised so loud an outcry in europe as to necessitate ithe convocation of a conference in constantinople should the con ference of  separate without achieving any more than was accomplished by the conferencs of  russia would soon again have the mastery of the position she would either immediatelyhave hier own will with tnrkey by might of arms or bide ber time and glide into her late underhand ascend ancy encompassing turkey within that subtle net of intrigue against which neither her own cunning nor the diplomatic skiu of her wetern allies would be able to defend herwhat is it then thtat the conference proposes to do or wbat will site have the power to achieve it certainly cannot undertake to g to war with russia for turkevs sake  it must therefore if turkey will not listen to reason leave her to her own de vices allowing her to settle her affairs with russia as she beat can inless it seem a b tter policy t go hand in hanid with russia combining with that power to wrrest reasonable concessions from the porte and insisting on such tangible gua rantees as may amount to a positive security that the promieed refirms will not again turn out sheer delusionsall england seems to place so implicit a con fidence in lord salisburys ability that there can ba hirdly a doubt as to the curse to which he will give the preference the real contest nowadays lies ibetween the six powers and turkey and it doesnot seem likely that all europe will be deterred from a policy which seems just and reasonable by such weapons as turkey could alone employ in the  uneqnal strugglethose wholesale massacres of christians with whic the abovementioned french l jonrnal seems to threatzn us
