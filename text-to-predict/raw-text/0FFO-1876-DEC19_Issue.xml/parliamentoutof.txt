parlia aibint out of sessionon thursday afternoon tho duke of richmond and gordon mot his tenants by invitation at tho assembly roomschichestor on his grace taking the additional title of duke of gordona shorttimeeincehis tenantairesolved to mark the ocrasion by presenting him with a testimonial of their estoem it was decided to present him with a portrait of himself ant sir francis grant was intrusted with the work mr t s cogan the oltest tenant on the estate presented the portrait in the name of the subscribers the duke of richmond in reply saidfrom my earliest childhood i was taught by my father that ono of the most paramount duties i had to fulfil in my passage through life was to keepon intimate and affec tionato terms with my tonauts luheers he inculcated in me the principles that if i should be spared to preside over a tenantry and to enjoy a property such as that which i have the privilege of enjoying there were imaportant duties connected with that lasition aud that imight oither ba a means of doing inalculable benetit to the tenantry and thcsi connected with them or productive of the greatest xmischief to them and all with wlhom they had to do rear i have endeavoured to carry out those doctrinesand i think i may venture to point to this niagniticent pictur as evidence that i have in some degree realized his hopes and aspirations it has never been to me a diflioult task tokeep on good terms and intimate relations with my temnts hut rather a work of love looking at tho matter selfishly i think a man must be guilty of something very little abort of insanity if be does not maintain such relations with his tenants because and though it has been said very often it is none the less truetho interests of landlord and tenant are identical cheers whatever tends to the prosperity of the tenantry most tond to the prosperity of the landlord  and if the i tenatry are no in a thriving and good condition then tho landlord must sooner or laterand it is quito right he shoutldsuffer for a state of things which he possibly by a neglect of his own duties bias brought upon thexi i rejoice therefore to think that we are met today as members of one family becauso i look upon the relations which exist between you and me as being that of members related by the ties of bloodes miembers of one family cheers i can assure yon that every thing which tends at all to your happiness and to your cmitort also tends to my happiness and my comufort and i should be one of the most miserable men alive if i felt that any act or deed of mine did anvthing to injure or put you or yours in a position in which you ought not to be cheers with regard to the manner in which i have endeavoured to manage the pro perty since i have had it i have followed a piece of ad vice which my father gave me many years ago and which lie always aoted up to lt was that if any farm un fortunately became vacant through circumstances over which neither of us had any control niever to advertise it it is perfectly true that by advertising farms in the news papers you way get a host of candidates for them it is also quite true you may ge a higher rent but at the same time it is inevitable if you take the man who will give tho highest price you get the worst tenant laughter therefore tie principle upon which i have always actod has ben to ave farms valued by a proper and com petent person and to offer them at a price which i believe in my conscience the tenant ought to be able to pay and i aoi entitled to receive i certainly never would put any farms up to any such competition as would iuduce persons to give a higher ront than they were able to do cheers lbut i am fortunate in this respectthat ivery seldom have any farms vacant i have often said that thero is nothing so distasteful to a landlord who really knows what is for his own benefit as a chunge of tenants in the first placethere are all sorts of things to be got over there are arrangements to be made with a man of whom you know nothing and with whose peculiarities you have to get acquainted and i uever yet knew any extensivo change or vacancy where the landlord was not called upon to liy out larger sumailhan if he continued with the former tenants on the old terms lear hear with regard to the subject of the tenure of farms i have many years held an opinion which i believe is shared by others that it is most advantageous that tenants should hold a lease this seems to iue to give the tetant that security which he has a right to oxpect and which is of great advantage both to him and to his landlord i believe a  or  years leasse to be a security to a tenant for his position and invest ment and that lie is benefited thereby cheers not many hours ago we had full opportunity of developing our ideas upon general topics but meeting a body composed exclusively of my own tenants i was desirous of sayingo these few words as to the manner in which we stand wvith regard to each other it is a source of great satisfaction to me that the manner in which i havo beld the property has been such as to induce you to come forward in this mag nificent and spontaneous manner and to give me one of the most valuable things you could have donenot valu able because it is my own picture bur becauso it will be handed down to my childrens children not only as a workc of art of this lth century but as a token of those affectionate terms of good feeling which exists beween me and the tenantry on the goodwood estate i sincerely trust f may never do anything in my connexion with you wehich will forfeit those good opinions whioh i feel have in duced you to come forward on this occasion andl can only repeat wbat i said when i commenced my observaionsnamely that this is one of the most gratifying occa sions on which i ever addressed a body of men feeling as i do that i havo won your good estiamation and that unless you sincerely and onetly believed that i had done my dut by you no power on earth would have induced you to do what you have loud applausespeaking at the annual meeting of the birmingham reformatory institution at saltley on saturday afternoon sir charles adderley said he believed some persons still thought that tho work of those institutions was not educa tion but a sort of prolonged prison treatment those w ho still took that view be could only say had not even in their minds taken in the first principles upon which these institutions were established they did not see that the object of those institutions in the first place was to remove the education of the great masses of the poorer children of this country from education in vice to education in morality and in usefulness to this country they did not see that the obect of the institution was on the part of the legisla ture and on the part of those who were wealthy and in fluential to rescue them from the crime and the iieglect of past timos and to discharge their duty with regard to their education the absence of which had been a loss and a peril to themsolves tthat institution at saltley was the second to rescue thoge of the children of this country from an edu cation in crime to an education in industry and after all that was the chief essential to any mans performing his p art in this life it vas the secret of every mans morality hear hear they all knew tbe old proverb that satifinds some mischief still for idle hands to do the second object with which reformatories were established would be more generally appreciated it was simply to relieve most of their citizens from the presence of these depredators of society and to make them into productive labourers he fancied that this would be taken as an essential point in the workirg of their scheme that instead of increasing their prison accommodationthey hadaddedto the workshops of the country solnething to contribute to the increase of the wealth and prosperity of the country nothing more had pleased him in the recent speeebos of mr cross at birmingham than when he said thbat there were too many peoplo in the prisons of this country hear hoar he believed that was perfectly true and that uf they would train up children to useful purposes the advantage would be to the country as wail  to the children tehese chil dren were an important obect in the question of the na tional education of the country because the national edu cation was not lile that of america which was a democratic education our national education now cost the treasury ï¿½ a year in imperial taxation he believed there muight be considerable danger in the exces sive zeal for national education which led out of that de mocratic principle because it led to the payment of the education of the children of parents who were quite ablo to pay for it at their own expenseemtmn m accwiscta serious accideht bap pened in the hunting field on saturday to the hon rt en s plunlett the senior member for avest glocestershirehile he was
