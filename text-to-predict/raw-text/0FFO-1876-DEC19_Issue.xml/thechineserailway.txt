hb hunes ia tazzwayropc od own corporznmnshanghi nov i sketched in my last letter the position of the woosung blailway and stated that mr mayers chinese secretary of ler britannio maljetys legation had been deputed by the british miister to go to nankin and endeavour to negotiate with the viceroy some arrangement under whioh the trains should recommence running i mentioned also that an official deputed by the tsungli yamen to aid in effecting a settlement and the taotai of shanghai had gone up to be presont at the conferencemr mayers reached nankin on the th ult in her majestys ship curlew nd was received by the viceroy with all due courtesy on the following morning as i predicted would be the case the wvhole question turned on securing for the railway a new lease of life his excellency wished to buy it up and efface it and voald have agreed to almost any terms of purchase but the same motive which inspired the enterprise required that every effort should be made to resist this extinction as i re marked last week the object of the promoters was to bring a railway under the eyes of the chinese and not at all to sell the plant at an immediate profit and retire nor was a proposal made by the chinese to remove the line to formosa at all more acceptable banished to that island it would have been as far from the eyes of the chinese people as though it had never been constructed there was no doubt it would have to be sold as i explained last week it was on that condition only that li llungchangs countenance was given to she scbeme he is intelligent enough to see the value of rail ways and to favour their introduction but he wishes tbem to be in the hands of chinese not european owners  and the position of the woosung railway is too assailable to make it pos sible to reject a compromise the idea of extinction then was dlclared inadmissible and the removal was objected to with equal earnestness it re mained to arrive at some understandine if possible for working the line and two years was hinted as a possible period the chinese hinted at six months and eventually halted firmly at a year the rate of purchase was discussed collaterally and it was eventually argreed that this should be fixed by arbitrators of whom two shouldbe chosen bythe british consul at shaughai and two by the taotai these then were the terms eventually agreed on subject to the approval of the british minriter and of the railway company the railway is to be sold to the chinese for a sum to be fixed hereafter but it is to continue working for a year in the hands of the present compainy and payment is to be made in four iistalnents torminating at tho end of the year with the object i presume of giving the officials a colourable pretext for leaving the manage ment in foreign hiand it remains of course with the directors or the shareholders of the company to accept or reject tlis proposal my impression is that they wvill do well to accept it if they persist in their desire to promote the introduction of railwvays in china the prospect of doing this is stiu suffi ciently uncertain the viceroy may elect to tear up the whole plaint when it comes into his posses sion but the chances are i think in favour of sur vival he may alter his views in the meantime he may die be removed or ba influenced by li hungchang and i am quite persuaded that no bztter terms ca n be obtained by anything short of dictation lt would no doubt be possible to sell the line outandout very profitably but then that is not the object assuming that the terms are ac cepted it will remain to dravw upregulations for the working of the line and pending this acceptance and the draughting of these regulations the re opening is of course delayedthe case of the man who was run over some time ago was also settled on the basis of a money corn peiisation which is likely however to prove purely nominal as the officials admiit that they do not know who he was wllere he came from or whether he has any relatives in the world in which case of course there can be no one to be compensated for his death it was well however to remove the matter from the list of disputes and there is a secondary advantage in the agreement to terms of compensation which the chinese do not perhaps quite see they liave always bitherto insisted on a hfe for a ife and thiiugh of course their request would be ineffectual if it were opposed to euglish law it may be convenient diplomatically to refer to this precedent in case of future accidents on the whole i think mir mayers is to be congra tulated on the mnnauer in which he has discharged his difficult missionthis last pending question having been now settled the vessels of the detached squadron have sailed from woosung on their way honie they started for rongkong on the morning of the st of october after a stay which was probably more prolonged than they anticipated but which has noloubt conduced vary greatly to the peaceful settle ment of affairsi have inore than once recontly rspoken of the dis turbed stato of the country and the imminent danger that rebellion would break out if the go vernment became involved in a foreign war an instance in point has just occurred in the province of chekeang and the details are sufficiontly curious to be worth relating they are given in a report from the high authorities of the provincopublished in the pekin azette early in august last rumours came to the ears of the officials in the dis trict of wenchow that some members of a secret society were plotting mischief and it was dis covered that a man named she hlungao was the centre of the movement he was surprised ar rested with several of his followers and has been since execated what is interesting is the account given in the oazeue of his professed tenets he was identified as an old and prominent member of the taeping rebellion and like the rebel emperor hung tsiufsuen ie seems to have originated a kind of bastard hristianity he was found says the report  to be getting about him a numuber of adherents under the guise of conducting religious services for the repose of their souls at the place where he was captured were found a number of seditious books containing incantations niagical writings and treasonable sentiments a wooden seal bearing the legend  heavens right way yellov silk badges with the words  guard the imperial embryo gold coins and sundry foreign weapons as  have said before it was ascertained that the man had taken part in the taeping rebellion  at which period the report says  he was on intimate terms with li shih nien one socalled prince of tho taeping move ment he subsequently joined the roman catnolio church but when the french missionary ku yia kang wa questioned on the subject he stated that although the prisoner had embraced the faith the articles found in his possession were not things used in the church and he requested that the law might be alloied to take its course the man was accordingly executedand the conspiracy is probably nipped in the bud it is not a little curious how ever to find one of the survivors of the teepings organizing a fresh movement on the same pseudo christian basis on vwhich that rebellion was ori ginally started
