l rest intelligencethe eastern questionriussiaby tzlwnmmlom our austriai couespont veina drm on a late occasion the czar in a conversation with one of the ambassadors remarked that russia was ready to renounce the occupation of the turkish provinces provided other gua ranteees can be found this remark has been officially communicated to the different courts and has likewise been officially circulated from st petersburg which would reem to indicate a wish on the part of the russian government that the remark of the czar should be widely known suoh an announcement on the eve of the discussion in the conference of the question of reforms and gua rantees is certainly rather assuring as it may re mnove up to a certain point the idea that russia has made up her mind to have the occupation under all chmstances tho question what other gua rantees russia may deem sufficient to make the oc cupation unnecessary remains an open one and russia may reject any other proposal of guarantee under the plea of its being insufficient but still by such an announcement frombigh quarters russia evidently means to reserve to herself the liberty of accepting eventually any other proposal which she may consider sufficient the announcement ro ceives additional importance by the accounts from russia which all concur in ropresenting the agita tion and warlike spirit as decidedly decreasing and this has no doubt greatly contributed to shape the policy of the russian government now as it had contributed a short time ago to impel it in the opposite direction the great difficulty of the present phase of the eastern question arises mainly from the circum stanco that it has ceased to be a purely political and diplomatic question and that at any rate in the countries most nearly concerned popular feeling has become mixed up with it sjmpathies and antipathies religious audnationalhave been roused on both sides which must be taken into considera tion by every government however absolute its power may be nay the more unlimited the power of the government the greater seems the danger of its being under the influence of such popular feelings for in the absence of any legitimate organ such as e pppular assembly to express these feelings it cannot gauge their real strength and with the uneasiness which an absolute government always feels even at the most harmless manifestation of popular feeling it is more likely to overrate the importance of them possibly had russia been a country with repreeentative institutions she mightand this is the opinion of many wellin formed peoplehave found that the agitation and warlike spirit were not so deeply rooted and that the bulk of the higher and commercial classes as weeu as the mass of people though no doubt sym pathizing with their coreligionists in turkey had but little inclination to go to war for them but even if tbe warlike enthusiasm was as strong as the russian government seems to have supposed the more conciliatory attitude assumed by russia of late may be taken as a tolerably sure sign that the government itself has come to the conviction that it is no longer quite so strong as it has been the chief cause in bringing about this result was no doubt the fact that even in this early stage of pre paration people began to realize in some measure the sacrifices likely to be entailed by the war ovur a consderable portion and that the most important of european russia all normal conditions of life have been disturbed and that just at the worst mo mentnamely during the season for the export trade andthedisturbance is not merely momentary for in the uncertainty of what may happen even the boldest exporters have little inclination to makc ar rangements for next spring the stores necessary for the army offer but small compensation for the provinces mostly affected by this are likewise those of the military contingent which has been mobilized so that they feel the effects of mobiliza tion doublythen came the tales brought back by the volun teers from servia many of whom were reserve men and had to take their places in their respective re ginents and these accountswere caloulated to damp rather than to raise the warlike enthusiasm in addition to all this came the little and great miseries almost inseparable from transport at this time of the year over long distances cold railway carriages insufficient clothing bad provisions or often none the government itself seems to have made some by no means pleasant discoveries during the mobilization in more than one depot where so many thousands of pairs of boots and quantities of clothing ought to have been stored not onehalf the quantity was found so that the want had to be supplied from another place cansing considerable extra expense which had not been reckoned upon it was no doubt tbis which led to the establishment of a special commission of control immediately after the arrival of the grand duke at kisehinew warned by crimean experiences it was thought wiser to establish a commission of control before the war began than a commission of inquiry after the war had endedin face of the extensive preparations made by turkey an impression has likewise been gain ing ground that the forces mobilized would scarcely be sufficient for the task and that somo further mobilization might become necessary and already the mobilization of two more corps darmeis talked of which are to be furniahed by the military districts of moscow and st petersburg and which would form a sort of reserve there have bean indeed measures taken for the organiza tion of a sort of general levy of reserves in the southern provinces but this force besides re quiring a good deal of time for its organiza tion could after all not be employed for active operations while giving full credit to the czar and his government for those pacific intentions which they have always professed it may still bo supposed that the sobering down of the popular mind in russiahas enabledthegovermnent to follow out more thoroughly these pacific inten tions while the difficulties in the way of an eventual oeoupation of bulgaria by force and the little encouragement which such a design finds anywhere have contributed to persuade russia that there might be some other sort of guarantee besides an occupation
