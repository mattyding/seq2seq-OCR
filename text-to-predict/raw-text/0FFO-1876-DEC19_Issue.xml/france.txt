the emnpire they have been held at versailles and without uniforms the visits to the presidents of the senate and chamber will still be paid at versailles that being the constitutional seat of governmentprinceiiohenlohe the german kmbassador starts tomorrow for bavaria to pass christmas with his family the princess not having yet returned to paris the prince will be back on the st to attend the official receptionyou were informed in my letter of friday that the german govornment had officially intimated its refusal to take part in the paris universal exhi bition of  and i added that german firms had resolved to exhibit in any circumstances and there was a fear of france acceding to their applica tion for space this fear has happily disappeared and the french goverument must be congratu lated on the prudence of its conduct m tessereno de bort minister of commerce has just addressed a circular to the agents of the french government with tho view of its being brought within the cognizance of those interested reminding them that in conformity with article  of the re gulations for the exhibition no one can take part in it except through the medium of general com missioners nominated by each government annthat consequently there can be no isolated exhibi tion of any nation this circular which is in perfect harmony with tlhe regulations will cut short the difficulty which might have been foreseen had france encouraged the idea of certain german manufacturers who wished to present them selves at the exhibition in spite of the reso lution adopted by their government appli catiolls of this kind having been already re ceived it was determined to take prompt steps before their number augmented the defection of germany moreover which is deplored by all moderate men in that country will not cripple the dimensions of the exhibition for most of the ex hibiting states have applied for greater space than that originally allotted them and in view of the abstention of germany this augmentation will pro bably be concededunless for the sake of symmetry of construction it is agreed to retain the building devoted to germany and devote it to various sup plementary objects for which room could not other wise have been found it is however possible that the french ministerial circular will produce a manifestation of public opinion in germany com pelling the government to reconsider its decision still this is a mere supposition and all those who havebesn rejoicing at the improvedrelations between france and germany will sincerely regret that this rare opportunity of further strengthening them on the peaceful field of industry has been neglectedm jtules simon it is announced will not issue a circular to the prefects but will send for them in dividually to give them verbal instructions this moreover has been the custom since m beules circular became public and cost him his portfolio and his life there is no idea at this moment of any administrative changesthe newspapers are discussing a curious incident which occurred in connexion with m jules simons declaration the prefect of the rhone placarded this speech strangely altered m simon had said  iam profoundly republican and profoundly oon servative the placard only said  i am pro foundly conservative m jules simon had said  my studies have led me to become the sincere friend of liberty of conscience and to profess a great respect for religion the placard said  i am the sincere friend of liberty and i profess a great respect for religion the minister having called for an explanation was informed that the omission was a telegraphic error which had been corrected it is rather strange however that the telegraph made a blunder in this particular sense and iu two different
