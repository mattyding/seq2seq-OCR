amb braotkn ex itsm jroy an occasional coyspojmrst pftersburg dec ilas the commencement of the conferenle drawsnearer there appeara to be a lull in the political and i military excitement which for so long kept the publio mind in a state of continual tension althougb the mobilization of the army haa been pushed forward at all possible speed and although we hear on all sides of divisions other than those which form part of the southern army being on the point of mobilization yet it is evident that athinking public is becoming daily more convinced of the folly of embarking in a war the results of which are so difficult to foresee at first of course i the very idea of the possibility of war was suffi cient to raise the spirits and expectations of so military a country as russia and a war against the turk with all its traditioual and historical sur roundings was naturally one which above all others found favour with the russian people a calmer judgment now appears to prevail and the war party is evidently retreating slowly but surely before their peaceful antagonists lt seems need less to repeat what evry one knows so well but what russia certainly forgot at the beginning of the passing war maniathat this empire is perhaps the coudtry of all others to which not only peac but a peace of long duration is a matter of absolute necessitv the state of her finances is notoriously bad her army though numerically great is iu a state of transition one might almost say infancy her navy is so impotent that it has not dared even to measure its strength with tbat of turkey  the interior communications of the empire are in a most lamentable condition  and lastly the vast resources of the country require the undisturbed development of years in theso circumstances unless the honour of the niation were at stake it is scarcely credible that any russian stat sman or patriot could do otherwis than pray for peace rlappily for europe the above facts seem lately to tave acted on the miind of the go vernment and the people and a reaction is apparent in russia towards that peace of vhich she stands so much in needthis reaction has shown itself to a very great ex tent during the last few days the bone of conten tionthe rock on which england and russia seemed about to splitwas a question of the occupa tion of turkish territory by russian troops a fortnioht ago all the leading journals of the capital looked upoui this occupation as a matter admitting of no possible doubt lt was said that russia having gone so far could not with honour retreat from tie position which she had taken up the occupation it was thonght might be temporary and the precodent of syria was quoted within the last few days however the same press which was so strong on the poin of occupation has begun to draw in its borns and the articles we now read in the golos indicate a more favourable solution of the eastern question the occupation of the turkish provinices by russian forces is now treated by that journal as problematical and it even goesso far as to state its wish that some other uarantees should he found that the gobosshould thus change its tone is a more signifirant i fact than one might at firat sight be inclined to suppose this newspaper as is wellknown here is the organ of the hlinistry of war and as such canies great weight in all military matters when therefore the articles which appeared daily in itscolumns pointed to the inevitable occupation ofi turkish soil it spoke as it werevith the authorityof the minister of wyar and its present attitudej must on that account be hailed with much satisfacl tion i do not mean by this to say that general avlautin the nvar miniskr at any moment desiredwar personally he is a man of peace whose one  object is the wetfare of the army confided to his charge be has many enemies in this country and the results which he has achieved during his tenure of office are said by many to fall far short of his in tentions his worst enemy would acknowledge hisuprightness and no one will doubt that his vwholel endeavour during the critical past has been to support the peaceful policy of his miajesty the emperor the public therefore could not but suppose when the jolos insisted upon occupation that the minister of war had been in the minority at the imperial councils and the altered tone now observable in the military organ cannot fail to have a most quieting effectanother seemingly good sign of maore peaceful views is the change which has lately come over the relations of the government with the public press in the earlier stages of the crisis it was remarkable that the most s iolent articles were daily published in the russian journals with impunity and the attacks on england and english statesmen both dead and living were often exceedingly bitter and in some cases even mean those who know how in such times as these official suggestions and orders are constantly issued to the russian press could not help thinking that the government were favourable to such unusual liberties and not un willing to see the excitement and bad feeling which they were ealculated to produce latterly how ever the censor has acted with much severity as the many punishments which have been adminis tered to the journals of the capital can testify today the new times has been suspended and the sale of the exchaenge gazette on the streets also has been stopped after these two newspapers there is not i think another journal of any poli tical importanoe which has not been recentliy either warned or suspended by the censorif yet another symptom of a quieter feeling be wanted i may mention the disappointlient which is felt with regard to the feast on friday last of the knights of st george this great fes tival was held as usual in the winter palace and the whole of the imperial family at tended it was fuuy expected by every one that the emperor would make another important speech on the occusion but his majesty said nothing beyond the usua compliments and the affair ap pears to have passed off witbout any political allu sions whatever must not omit to mention before closing this letter the discussion which has so much occupied the russian press with regard to fitting out privateers against british ships in view of a war with england this question as you are no doubt aware was raised by an article of professor martens in which ho treated the question ot privateer ing as affected by the declaration of paris in  this subject has been eagerly discussed american vessels itsi said are to be firnished with letters of marque and i understand that for this purpose public subscriptions have already been opened here and at moscow it becomes a question however whether american vessels could undertake such service in face of the united states foreign enlist ment act the majority of the russian press and that the most influential partobjects strongly to the abrogation of the declarationof paris and to the reestablishment of privateering the finnish press is also much opposed to it the lelsiwngfors dagblad has shown how much finland would suffer from such a war the whole length of its coast would be blockaded and its sea commerce with the rest of the world entirely cut off during the war of  finland suffered immensely and in case of another war between england and russia with the free employment of privateers her small mer chant fleet of about  sail would be completely ruined for no country least of all russia whose merchant fleet is so small could expect to cope with england in this respect why it asks should private property be respected on land in time of war and not on the high seas i from a moral point of view it would be strange to see privateer ing adopted by russia after the eflorts she has made to lessen the horrors of war on this aspect of the matter the ajobs very properly observes thatif inj the event of a war vith enignnd russia should withdraw from the declarationl of paris she would raise an unanimous cry against her all her generous projects for humaniing war would be looked upon as so nany acts of hypocrisy and the ill will and buspicion with
