italian arboitectuemr freeman has now collected and published in ono volume the various sketches of italian architecture which he ilas from time to tine contributed to the periodical literature of the day and which have for tho most part appeared in the saturday review sotne of them as he infurms us were written off at or near the places spoken of whilo others bear the mark of a more leisurely production the illustrations aro photographs from the autbors owvn penandink drawvings and serve no doubt as an assistance in following the text but nevertheless hardly lay claim to much intrinsic beauty with three exceptions the papers relate to the cities of northern central and southern italy  but air freeman proposes at soume futuro time to supplement the present collection by sketches from england france germany and as he says  above all frotu lalmatia among tho cities upon which he divells at the greatest leugth and with the most evident sympathy are verona and pisa ravenna ariminum and rome the tone of the majority of these essays may possibly we should fancy be somewhat too technical and professional for the ordinary layman but to all who take any interest in the great architectural monuments of italy and wvho know enough of arclhi tectural terminology to followv intellgently an arohaeologists deserptioni of them mr freemans comments will be valuable the thought will probably have occurred to many besidos ourselves vlhile travelling aniong the cities of the continent that f eora man who is desirousof seeing what is of the highest interist and of seeing it in some rational order and after somne intelligiblo method who is desirous in a word of understand ing what he sees the existing guidebooks praise worthy as they are in their microscopic industry and avidity for detail are hopelessly inadequate they enumerate no doubt the principal objects of interest and  asterisk them with more or less liberality they tell us how to get to them from our hotel and how much we shall presuuiably have to disburse to the oxpectant official who is in charge of them they tell us all about our passports and portinanteaus and hundreds of useful subjects of information but from tho point of view of tlio arts they leave us very muchl in the lurch wle have in our mind the interests of no one particular class of tjuiists but of that respectable minority who go abroad partly for a change partly for pleasuro generally and partly with an honest desire of ex tending their testhetic symnpathies cultivating their taste and enlarging tho narrowv limits of their knowledge precious time that is often irre parably lost in arranging a tour in what we earn too late to haye been an unintelligent order or in tiring the eye with a quick succession of siglhts vithout ever asking ourselves whether there is iny nietliod in the niad histo with which we rush about this town and that and mark the bulwarks and the palaces and whether when ire havo seen all the astorisked things botht iu blsldekor and in murray and spent all our spare money and spare time we shall really be one jot thewiser and the better in the sense of having i really understood and appreciated what we sai not withstanding all the toil that wre have undergone it is a humiliating reflection but it is never thaless odo to wlhich iiot a few of us perhaps can not pretend to have been strangars that pos sibly if after our sightseeing wo had been suddenly put through somo simple general questions as to tho various styles of arclitecture that characterized the principal buildings

as a tinkling cymbal in such times of dejection wve have fondly cherished a wish and a hopo that sorne day a conipact and sinple  guidebook or series of guidebooks would be written not on things in general and on nothing very partioularly but by somo one learned for examsple in airchitecturodescribing accordin to tho country or countries for vhich the volume was intended theonatuira and the

iachen revisited  thoroughly to got up any city or district ho writs  ill its historical relations is rathera lcng business we believa that in order to be thorouglhly master of any placo a fouriold process is needed the traveller should firstarm himself with a general knowlogu of tho history of the placo and of all that is to be seen in it he will then bo able to oxamine tho objects them selvos in an intelligeit way and to uaderstand their history and racanin thoe let him go home aindstudyall his niateriaus afresh by tho lightof the local jrnowledgo which he his thus gained the dillerence between reading the history of a place which we lhavo seen anid reading that of one which we have not seen is simply infinite   the difference between a living thing and a dead one wve feel at homo in tho place of which we are read ing  we feel as if tlo nien of whom we road wvero our prsonal acquaintance then lastly having dono this it is well to see tho plac a socond timo by the light of tho

frames upon the walls of our sitting roomsthe stylo of architecture with which lmr freemans pages are in a great measure con cernied is the socalled romanesque or iater roman which obtained over the
