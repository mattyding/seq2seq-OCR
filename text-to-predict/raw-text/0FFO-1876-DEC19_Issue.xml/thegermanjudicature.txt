the gebaan judicaturefrom ouw prussian courespondberlin dsc of the many important measures proposed during the last fewv years by the german government none is of greater consequence than the bi or rather the group of bills for the reform of the judicaturo judicial proceedings being differently conducted in the various states thoughi perfect in none the new bill offered one of those promising opportunities eagerly seized by the existing goverrament of strengthening unity while promoting reform as in many precoding cases it was clear that if the liberals could be satisfied by the propositions made the tninor governments what with the pressure of public opinion und the demands of the chancellerie would be forced toyield accordingly a few years ago the preliminary consent of parlia ment was obtuined and a coommission appointed for preparing tho necessary draughts long and labjrious was the process after the lapse of many months the dranghts were submitted to the federul council and being published immediately became a fertile theme of discussion both for the supreme administrative authority and the public at large innumerable were the articles written by the editors of all shades innumerable thio discussions held by political and lawyers societies and clubs tiiis practice of prelimintry siftinig having recently been adopted in tho case of tuany othor bills and always with marked success it was hoped that whent the whioli natioii so to say had been formed into a parliament to deliberate upon the great re form sonie good result iuust ensue at last every thing was ready and lhe measure submitted to the reichstag this occurred a year ago when con forming to the accurate habits of tho country the lleichstag appointed a special comnnmitteo to sit daring the session and recess and prepare the bills tor tho last stag lirom the magnitude of the wvork and the technucal details involved it was nnderstood thatthedecisions of thecommitteewould be tinial and that the house though reserving its constitutional privilege would practically bo guided by the votes ok the smaller and more select body government reco mizsd the judiciousness of the proceeding and by constant intercourse with tho permanent committee endeavoured tn facilitate their task  so that wvhen the ileport of the com mittee wvas laid upon tho tablo a fewr weeks ago everybody hoped to see the momentous improve ment realized without loss of timebut these expectations proved too sanguine it soon became apparent that difiiultics which had arisen in an earlier stage of the work were more serious thai had been anticipated a tolerable agreement indeed had boee effectd between go vernient and conmittee upon the many moot questions connected with the or anization of the courts the appointment of the judges and the new rules for conductinv judicial proceedings but there were other tan mcre legal details to be con siderod and it was upon these grver questions that government and parliament found it difficult to come to an understanding those acquainted with the spirit in wlici the newv administrative arrangements for prussia were conceived by the barlin governmentarrangements eventually ratified in a different form by parliamentcan easily imagino tlo nature of tho dilferenc though making some modeoato colcesions to the indepen dent bias of tlhe ago government did not thi kl lit to endorse tho more important denmands of tvo liberal party it is true wvat they offiered was some thing wrorthl having yet it wvas not all the liberals were determined to have nor all the nation thought they had a righlt to claim in a word government refused sundry weighty guarantees of the public liberties whlich the peoplo were anxious to obtwin through the now lawsleaving minor matters out of tho question the controversy turns upon the following points parliament insists upon having press offences tried before a jury instead of professional judges it cannot bn denied that the prussian govern ment and those other members of tho federal council opposed to the plait have somnething to say on their side the jury in tho present critical juncturo is probably an institution of questionable efficiency in the case of xiltramontaiio editors re siding ia ultramontane districts  and though tlhe pliticoreligious quarrel has fortunately abated of late there is no telling how seon it many revive still as tho decisions of learned judges have failed to give uniform satisfaction in times of political excitement where liberal editors and politicians wvere concerned the public are pretty generally in favour of trying the jury aiter the experience they have had of the courts this partiality for jurymenl in political offences is not a little increased by the three outliern statos atually cnjoing the privilego now demanded for theo whole country if it is urged bavaria wilrtembarg and baden liave maiiaged to keep the press in order by means of popular verdicts thero can bo no reason why prussia and the north generally wvhich insist upon retaining a less liberal institution for themselves and extending it to thu south the other points of the controversy are equally grave now as before the public prosecutor though a mere administra tive officer at the beck and call of the cabinet is to possoss tho exclusive privilege of lodging a criminal charge now as beforr iio government employs is to be sued for abuis of power unless the question wvlhetlher such abuse has been com mnitted is answered in the alfirmative by a special court to which tho matter niust be referred before proceedings can be takeii now as before editors and all persons connected vith newspapers shall be liable to be subpmenacd if they refuse to give evi dence as to the authors of articles which have ap peared in their papers now as beforo the go vernment shall have the right to appointassistant judges in the lower courts to act only for a tinie subject to recall or reappointment to an inferior position as the case may be now as before the public prosecutor and court shall be entitled to order the seizure by the post office autlorities not only of a single letter suspected of containing criminal matter but of all letters in the hand writing of certain suspected persons the mere perusal of this catalogue will suffice to show the politics of tho governmnent who refuse and of the large majority in and out of parliament who de mandif i tell you that in an assembly containing about  mombers no more than  have voted for the government and that the government still refuses to be guided by the vote of the house you will admit that whatever tho liberties of modern germany may be constitutional government in the sense attributed to the term in england is not one of them ihe course pursued by the govern ment is the moro striking as the house thus treated has supported the general policy of the go vernment for a period of three years end some times in trying circumstances the only com fort is that the institutions which allow govern ment to ignore the decisions of the house render it feasible and indeed customary for the house to disoblige government whenever they think it indispensable to do so in the present instance if the pruissian inrfluenco in the federal council is not exercised on behalf of the liberal cause the prussian government will have to dispense with the equalization of the judicature which would have formed so strong and solid a band round the loose members of the germuan body politic if the chancellor thinks it too venturesonme to place the press under popular control aiid to leave it for the courts alone to decide wvhether a crimo is to be prosecuted or not he will have to abandon the hope of a supreme tribunal for all germany and a uni form administration of justice in prussia and the minor states an ulterior consequence will bethat the coming elections will be more clearly liberal thsn mght otherwvise have been the casethere is no one who doubts that for the people to secure the enactment of the coveted measures is at the worst a question of a few years looking back at the strides liberty has made during the last  years in this country it is evident that public opinion sus tained by the cultuta and independence of a fast developing race and coupled with the necessities of unity and foreign politics will be potent enough to obtain the reasonable demands thatarelikelytounite a majority in their favour until then the people seem quite content to wait existingarrangements even where they are wrong in princple upon the whole work too well to create any violent discoi tent it is for this reason that the government can afford to brave public opinion  it is for the same reason too that people and parliament think they can take matters coolly though parliamont is seriouslydisappointeda the feeling awakened is onsiderably mitigated by the reflection that its dversaries are engaged in an impossible anta gonismn
