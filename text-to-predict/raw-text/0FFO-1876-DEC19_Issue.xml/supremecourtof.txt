given tbat on tuesday liszt the hearing of appeals from tho exchequer division whll commenceisurchlell v claha curious question here aroseraised as so many otber knotty questions have been by tho blunder of a clerk in copying more than  years ago lo  a leaso was to be grnted for t years tho period for which other leases of tho samae property were granted but by the blunder of a clerk the lessor executed a lease for fii years though tbo rent was to be paid for  years and in tbo lessees counterpart it was i years it was suggested that the    looked as if it bad been altered from i but the case was argued on the supposition of a clerical error the question nov arose bctweer assignec for value v hich of tbese terms sbouid stand and wbotber it vas to be taken as a lease for  yatrs or k if the lesse was for  years i it would  fall in in   if it was for  years it would not fau in until tbree years later the origina lessee had assigned the lease m  the lessor badassigned his reversion ten years later and the assignee i of the reversion in  claimed the premises on the ground that the lease had fallen in which the tonant the assiguee of the lease denied and hence this action a divisional court of the common pleas vivision con stituted of ilir justice brett and mr justice archibald held in favour of the tenant the defendant that the lease must be waken to bo for the longer period as the lessor had oxecuted a lease for that period and tho counterpart not being executed by tho lessor but only by the lessee was a mero copy except as to his covenants the land lord the plaintitf appealed from that judgmentmr benjamin qc and r graham of the chancery bar were for the tenant lr finlay and hmr ennedy were for the landlord who appealedthe argument for the tenant was that au that was material on the point was the granting part of the lease which was for tho longor period and that the insertion in orhor parts of tho shorter period must be taken to be the mero errers of a clerk he argument on the other side was that this was assuming the whole question that the error wae in the insertion ol the shorter period whereas it plainly appeared that it was in the inertiou of the longer period in one part only at variance with the rest of the deed aod tha counterpartthe lord cnief barton said he thought it must be ad mitted that if the matter stood on the lease alonethc part executed by the lessorit must bo taken to be a lense for  years  but if the court were at liberty to look at the counterpart executed by the lessee aud to construe the two parts together the construction might be differont from what it would be if the lease were taken aloneupon this the counsel for the landlord argued that the court might and ought to look at the counterpart as ac cording to ancient authorities lease and counterpart were to be taken as parts of one lease  and on the other side it was urged that the counterpart executed by the lessee would be held by the lessor ard tho lessee would uotknow of wvhat figures were inserted in it but he would gol by the part he hehl exeuted by the lessor to this it was replied that even on tho face of tho lease itself as executed by the lessor there wvs svideutly an error forrent vwas received only for the shorter periodthe lord ciiief usrce said it was evident there was mistake  it appeared on the face of the decd the onlyquestion was wbat the mistake vas in inserting the  years or the  years and how it was to bo decided where the mistake wasit was argued by the counsel for the tenant that there was nothig on the face of his lease to shov vwhich vay tho error w as to which the court assented and hero aroso the diffccultyon what materials could it be decided or ascertained where the mistake was it was however further contended by the counsel for the tenant that as ho wats an assignee of the lease as granted by the lessor it could not now be disputed as aigainbt himlord justice atprlelt pointed out that in the part executed by the lessoe the tenuro being only for  years the covenant was only to pay rent for that period andlord justice bramwell pointed out that if the land lord sued on the covenants for rent or repairs it would be the part executed by the lessee on which lie could sue  and could he sue upon the covenants for rent or nonrepair after tho st year of the lease to this it was answvered that the landlord might call for the production of his own grant in the leaso he hid executedlordjustico basixwmilthen the lessees liabilities would be altered ard affected by a document quite different from that which he lhad executed to this it wvas replied that the leaseo had the original lease in his possession as executed bylthe lessorthat l for tho longer periodand he could hardly suppose that ho wais to pay rent for  years when he had the premsic for  and moreover the two parts were to be taken in law as one leaselord justice btamwmlwould the lessee be liable for rent aud nonrepairs for the  years though ho has only executed a covonant for  year it was answered that he would as he had taken a leaso for  years and the covenants must be talen to adply to the period for which he had takon the lease n this question as to tho extent of the term it was insisted that at all events as between assignces the lease executed by the lessor only could be looked at and to this the court so far assented that they intinmated that the other leases could not be looked at but only the lease and counter parttowards the close of the argument two new points were statedone that if there was a mistake it was a case for rectification by a court of error and that now tho court could direct it to be rectified  and the other that tie original lease which required to be registered in idddlessx had been registered as a lease for  years on the latter point fresh argument broke out on the part ofthb tenant it was suggested that the lessor might have redistered the lease  on the parc of the landlord it was urged that he had purchased the reversion on the faith of the registry which was a registry of a lease for  years then arose a doubt among the members of the court how far they could attend to this fact as it was not in the case before them and then the tenant stated that the assign ment to him was registered in  and registered as an assignment of a lease of  years  so that thus the original blunder of the clerk had been repeated and multiplied in subsequent transactions and the caso was thus rendered more and more complicatedthe court hero conferred together for some time and thenthe lord cmef justice said they were of opinion that they could not look at the regstry although said his lordship emphatically  it might th row a hiare of light on tho history of the transaction and explain how the   came to be altered to   in reply on the part of the landlord it was urged that he had purchased tho reversion on tho faith of tho counterpart held by the lessor and executed by the lessee and upon which the roversion would  fall in at the ena of the  yearsie in and it was insisted that as this was land in amiddlesex and tho lease required to he registered tho tenant had no interest beyond that which was re gistered for the registration aec required registry to com plete the title  and as thim would be decisive of the case if it was not in the case as stated surely the court would allow it to be introduced and would not decide the case in the dark it was urged therefore that the court should allow the case to be amended by insertiug the fact that the memorial on which the lease was registered dosenbed it as a lease for  yearsthe counsel for the tenant resisted the suggestlon assert ing that until lately the registrar would only take tho memorial from the grantor or lessor  so that after all the memorial was only the statement of the lessor himself and could not decide the disputeto this it was replied that a lease under the registry act would be void if noet registered so that the lessee would registerlord j ustice bram well observed that purchasers would desire to know what leases wore outstanding as tbey would necessarily affect the value of the property and that was the object of tho registry acts it would bo very desirable therefore that the court should know tho facts as to the registry for they might be very materil and might be dc cisive of the easethe lord cns jusmcg said he entirely concurred in that view then he said we shall know the real facts and escape the risk of deciding the case iu tho dark on soms tecbnical rule of construction in opposition to the real truth and justice of the casetho lord omar baron askod whether the statute re quired that the memorial should stato the term tthe registry act  anne was referred to but it did not appear to be explicit on the point the lord camref justice said if the case were sent back to bo restated ea this point the practice of thr oofice could be aeortained and statodthe counsel for the tenant urged that it would involve an inquiry into the practice of the office nearly a century ugo all wno wero then alivo having long ago eben dead and buried butlord justice ax rr observod that there might be notes or entries in the office as to tho registries effectedlord justice bram iell observed that the statute diia not requiro that tbe term should bo stated endlord justice tlariilarr observed that if so clearly the lease would be good although the term was not stated in the registry  for the notice of the lease on the registry would be enough to set a purchaser on his guard and put him upon inquiry into the leaselordu uiiestce lrammtlllthen if that be so there is nothing material in the registry on the present questionthe lord ciief baroxif it should appear that the memorial in fact was registered as a lease for  years and if it is to bh assumed that as the registry is for the benefit of the lessee the lessee knew of this it might operate as an estoppel against him though how it could affect the con struction of the lease is another questionthe counsel for the landlord on the whole it being un certain what the memorisl would state said bo was con tent to have the case decided on the ground of construction apart from the registration  and he urged that his cliont the landlord could not suo the tenant for nonrepair of thepremises us he had only covonanted for  years whichhad elapsedtho lord chi justicedos it not after allr come to thisthat tbere being on the faco of tho lease a mistake we must look at both parts in order to ascertain its real effect iat the close of the arguments which occupied almost to the end of the sitting after a short confereanc between the judgesthe lord c oir justicr proceeded to say that the case had been so fully argued that he felt no difliculty though tbe court might not be unanimous in givirig hisa opinion that the judgment of the court below mnst be roversed iand he wasable to come to that conclusion without disregarding an of the ca cn obad no inordinat regard for them it was cear that there had beetn clerical error in the lease and the question was whether the counterpart could not be looked at to nee wbat tho error wm he agreed that if the question arose only on the leaso itself executed by the lessor it must be taken that the granting part operated mud that the lease was for tho longor period and he also aredd that if it was a tuere differenco letween lease and counter part the leaso anutt prevail but her there was a palpable error on the face of the leate itself nd the counterpart was looked at only to seo what the error ws this did not contradict any canon of construction while it was in accordance with common eonse and reason there was cloarly an error on the faco of the lease and there was not only an error hut an inconsistoncy whereas the counter part was consistent with itself and witl somo parts of tho lease and tho error in the leaso was correctod by tho counterpart in law they were said to bo two parts of the sarm deod and therefor it s just the ratno as correcting an error in the lease by roference to some other part of the lease itself which was in the strictest view or tbe law allwabl mhero was no reason why tbo counterpart shoutld not bn resorted to in order to ascertain the error aud when it was so resorted to it mado the caso clear beyond all doubttho error was in writming  years in one part of the lease instad of  tho result was that the judgtment of the commous llos vwas wrong and must bo reversedthe c ourt however wero divided andthe lord cluef buorn gave judgment to tho opposite effect bo had not be said any doubt that tho intention of the parties was that tiae lease sliould be for  years but the established rules of construction must be adbered to oo of which was that if the counterpart differed from the lease the lease miust provail the authorities had establisbed that rule and thero was not a single authority to tho contrary then again thore wvas another rule or canon of construction equally well established that the granting part of a deed must prevail if a subsequent part of it differed from it and so clear was this that it had been admitted that if it turned on the lcase it must be taken to be a leaso for j years then if the lease was clear how could the counterpart prevail against it  n doubt a mistake irotto lart of the lease mignt be corrected by another part of it but then the questiou was what was tho mistake t the mistako was thisthat whereas a lease for  years was plainly grantod then in a subse quent part it was referred to as one for  years  so that it must be taken that this was the mistake and not the other part and the proper way to corroct tho mistake would bo to chango the latter part not the former to correct the lese by the counterpart would bo to make tho counterpart prevail against the leaso which would be contrmry to the clearest rules of law and the clearest canons of construction hie regretted that he should differ from his learned brethren but he rejizd that their judg ment would prevail as it would no doubt be in accord anco with justico between tho partieslord justice bramtwell said he concurred with the lord chief justice and for the same rcasonslord justice astpiilltr also concurred with the lord chief justice ho thought that the deed could not now be corrected by the court as the parties were purchasers for valuo and the court therefore must decide on the effect of the lease and as to that ho agreed with the lord chief justice the real question he thought was as to tho constructilon of tho deedl leaso and couuterpart were in law parts of one deed and originally they wore so in fact being on tho same parchment both therefore must he looked at and then it was manifest what the mistake had been no doubt if the lease stood alona tho grant ing part would prevail  but the lease was to be correctea by the counterpart which was clear and consistent and was intauded to be an exact copy of the leaso and was so except that in ono part of the leaso  was clanged to  it was clear the error was ih the lease for the figures differed and it vas clear that the crror was in the figure  for the counterpart throughout vas  dl this view he thought quito in accordance vith the authorities as it was mith reason and with justice lio thought there fore that tho judgment must be reversedthe result is that the judgment of the common piles division is roversed by three judges the foutth agreeing vith it so that

workmen nd the character of the working classeswalicxns v tie lonidon and nortthwvetezn ralway comtpanythis which was a case of considerable magnitude was one of thoso cases which ariso out of the great contracts vhich are constantly being entered into for the execution of extensive works such as railways docks or public buildings it aroso out of tho provisions always inserted in such contracts requiring the works to be executed to the satisfaction of the engineer or survoyor and ar the rato requied by him and giving tho employers certain powers in case of default and it illustrated in a very striking and remarkable way the tiifliculties placed in the vway of con tractors and ot er employers of labour by theo dinsspation and dispesition to ideness widely prevalent among thei working men ior it will be seen that the difficulties of the contractors aud a disastrous litigation arising out of these diticultics wero ascribed by thom in a great degree to this cause tho caso had arisen out of a contract bv llelsrs walkor with tho railway company in  for the forma tion of a deck at garston near liverpool in april lstho messrs valkor tendered for the construction of the works for the

limited or if from any cause whatever not arising from the fault of the company they should be prevented from or delayed in the completion of the works the coni pany might take the works out of their hands and employ other contractors to completo tho works tho contractors were from time to time to mahke such alterations in tho works as the engineer might think necoesary  the works were to be executed to the satisfaction of the enigineer who however reserved to himself the right to make any alterations ho might tlink fit during thle progress of tho works hut no claim vas to bo made by tho contractors for such alterations the work being measured and paid for at tho contract prices the decision of the engineer with respect to the amount state and condition of the works executed and also in respect of any question that might arise concerning the construction of the contract or the execution of the works or any other uiatter or thing relating to the same was to be final and binding on thc contractors and the company without appeal shoalti the ergineer be at any timo dissatisfied with the nature or mode of proceeding with or at the race of progress of the works lie was to have power

with the works and complete them with tio requisite expodition should tho contractors fail to proccod in the execution of the wotrks at the rato of progress required by tho engineer the contract was at tho option of the company to be con sidered void as far as related to the works remaining to bo done and all sums due immediately after the signing of the contract the contrators received possession of part of the ground required for the works and early in juno  they commenced operations down to january  however they had not been put into possession of tho whole of the ground required for the works the con tractors proceeded with the works but in november  they wvrote to the company this letter  we find ourselves in so bad a position with regard to the garston contract that we are inder the nocessity of asking the company either to release us from it or to afford us assistance in completing it since wo entered upon tho contract nearly all materials we use have advanced in prico
