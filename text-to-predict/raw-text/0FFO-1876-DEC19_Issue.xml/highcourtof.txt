have been undter no liability whdtever to her unless the liability of the original members of the firm had been ischarged the payment of interest by these two gentlemen couild not be cinaidered as in any sense a payment on behalf of tie representatives of the deceased partnersi and the proof inl the bankruptcy was sufficient to amiount to an acceptance of the new liability even although the
