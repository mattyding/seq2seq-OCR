the svximurm tolls ee said these terminal services necessitated work in the traders privato sidings and his company had informed the traders that unless these charges were paid the ork in the private sidingsshanting service and such like work would not ba done the charges had been made for shunting for many years as to the cost of running upon some of tho sidings it was a question whether tho com pany would not even be better off by not doing the work than in doing the work at the charge made snd if tho company were not warranted in making a charge for this shuueisg ho should advise the company not to accept a siding only wvhere the company could  hook on and hook off as it was the shunting work took up more time for the engines than the actual running and this shunting greatly blockled the line thus stopping tho traffioto and from conoshs quayin crossexamination by mr mlixtyre qc the witness said that there had beon no justifiable complaints of the working of tho line except in  when tho company had insufficient locomotive power as to the company receiving  many complaints it was true that many letters came in fact one of tho traders used to write man letters every

denied too all knowledge of any reduction of the rates when the alessrs vatkinson bought from the bucldev company the siiing on their property and said that if a penny was takecn off the charge for carriagerc in consequence it waas not wvithin his knowvledge as to  fly shunting by which someo of the traders wvasted to get their goods he said some of tho men voul practire it against rule and tie rule was madtie because there wore acelenuts caused by itiu reexamination by mr iitrler qc the witness said that his compauy would not whatever the decision was in this case do any work on the sidings without pay ment if the sidings were altered so as to permit tho traffie to boe hooked oa and off thnt was all the company re quired otherwise the company must charge for sorvicemr henshaw the general manager of the brecon and merthyr railway a line which had a heavy traffic and sharp gradients said the charge of d a ton per mile on the wvrexham mold and buckley was a very moderare rate for so heavy a line as the bucldoy ann so short a line then too the sidings on tho buceicy were so constructed as to mako the process of dealing with the traffi most expensive to that company on his own line whore his men had to perform special services on sidings extra special rateos were chargedin answer to mr bvitnynn the witness said his own company charged ad per ton for traffic  but then lie added there wvas a mninimnvm charge of four miles and hoiaid a small line like the buckloy which was only about five miles long to connahs quay could not havo a large amount in the irhiole  thorefore the d
