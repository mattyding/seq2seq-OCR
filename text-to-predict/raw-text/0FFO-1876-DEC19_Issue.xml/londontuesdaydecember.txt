londof tuesday decemjbsr  our calcutta correspondent gives the text of a etition to the queex voted by a lahobredan omrnittee upon the affairs of turkey and he idds that not in calcutta alone are the indian mahomedans active committ es having ben tormned in patna lucknov lahore peshawur bombay hyderabad and elsawlhere the calcutta petition is rather a lengthy document which de clares in the moost absolute terms on all the questions it issue between the fortm andl its adversaries the sultans rule is blamneless or nearly bo  the misgovernmentw with which the porte is chatged is entirely cwing to the continual agitation kept up in the interests of neighbouring states by foreign incendiaries  the  alleged cruelties  in bulgaria were due to such persons and reprobation should fall on them rather than on the turkish sol diery moreover the exaggerated character of the original reports furnished to the world by irrespon sible and prejudiced persons has been exposed by her majestys ambassador lord beaconsfields government is greatly praised and the petitioners have learnt with regret that various attempts are being made by some of heb majfstys subjects to overthrow the present ministry it is prayed that the quxeen will not in consequence of the bugges tions of any of her subjects from hostility wlhether to the presnt ministry or towards the moslem faith alter the traditional policy of england or allow any power to encroach upon the sovereign rights of the sublim portoe or dismember the ottoman empire in contravention of and against the express stipulations of the treaty of pnris by which the territorial integrity of turkey and her existence as a european power were solemnly and definitely guaranteedthe framers of the petition have evidently the most accurate acquaintance with the argtuments and representations of the ministerialist speakers in england and this coupled with the style and dic tion of the document suggests something less purely and spontaneously moslem than might be desired but we know that a political feeling may beartificlallyproducedand notwithstandingcometo prevail very powerfully and to produce important eftbets we have no doubt that it is possible to fill a certuin part of the mussulman community in india with the idea that there is a connexion between their religious and worldly interests and the main tenance of turkish rule and moreover that great britain is pledged by some traditional policy or by some eternally incumbent duty to support the sultan before we estimate the strength or valua of such a movement it is worth while to consider the oipinions that have beait tiven con cerning the mussulmans of india in relation to their historical position and their actual sympa thies in the present petition the queen is re quested to oppose the dismemberment of tho ottoman empire in consideration among other things  of the fact that his sacred majesty the  sultan of turkey is tho recogniized religious  head of some  of your majestys  subjects a similar opinion pervades a letter from an indian miussullman which we published a few days since  it is not soi much political or politicoroligious sympathy  which indian moslenm feel towards their khalif za religious sympatlhy pure and simple then as a fact he states that  in the friday prayer of the sunnis ths sultua is spoken  of with the utmost reverence while tho bless ing of god is asked on his descendants it will occur to tle readers of sir geoage capnaells  handy book on the eastern ques  tion  that opinions very adverse to these are ex pressed by that experienced indian administrator sir gxomao cxpsnel says that there is no moro solidarity among mlahomedans than among christians the notion that we must adapt our turkish policy to the prejudices of our alahomedan subjects in india he declares ts have had its origin in england  from us the  idea has been caught up by some of the english speaking and reading mahomedans in india and by the turks themselves the turks assert that the whole mahomedan world wiu assist them if they aro hard pressed  i do assert in the most unqualified malner says sir georoe  that the idea of any direct religious connexion between the sultan of tuxxey and the indian mahome  dasnthat he is or ever has been in any sense whatever the religious head of any one of themis absolutely and entirely untrue it would  be quite as correct to say that the emperor of russir a is the religious bead of the english and french christians this is not the place for a historical disquisition but it does not need any great research to come to the conclusion that sir georgs casrpbell is in the right the religious authority of the turkish sultan has never been known as a tenet of islam  in many countries it would bare been rejected with indignation eveu the honoraryprimacy among hmabomedan rulers which is now attributed to him is quite of modern origin and is the result of now conditions in the mahomedan world the head of the mahomedans of india was the great mogul whose house informer days equalled in power and splendour that of the turkish sultars their grandeur did not diasappear even with the loss of substantial authority  down to quite the other day says sir geooge cbanell  the mlogul emperor was  in form at least the supreme reler of all maho  medan states in india and the fountain of authority honours titles and everything else wo being the mayors of his palace to suppose that he and his mahomedan subjects owed any religious allegiance to the sultan of turkey is a downright absurdity as a matter of fact i  again asert that there never has been any such connexion and that every indian mahomedahmknows this to be the caseyet it is undoubtedly the fact that the maho medans througbout the wotld having been brought into closer relations with each other through the com pleteness and rapidity of modern communications sre attaining to a certain sentiment of unity and that this sentiment sugests a ieneral deferenceto the ruler of constantinople the strongest feel ing of the mahomedan of our days js one ofprehension at the power and aggressiveness of christendom the followers of the propher everywhere perceive that the formidable euro peans who unito overwhelming military force and untold wealth with the mastery of every art and science must advance to the subjuga tion of the mahomedans unless these combine to save each other from ruin the consequence is seen in the ready obedience which the sultan rc ceives from every mahornedan province of his em pire a rebellious pasha could hardly venture to raise his head in the present day he would probably be despatebed by those of his own household in the barbarous khanates of central asia in the depths of the afri can continent veneration for the sultan as the visible representative of mahomedan unity is preached it will be easily understood that from this to the recognition of a religious head ship is a very easy step if the sultan is not a khalif he is in a fair way of being made one by the growing homage of his fellowmoslems we see a political and religious authority in the making whv should it not be in india as it has been else where  the great mogul was once the head of the mahomedans  but the great mogul i no more and the sultan of the turks has taken his place in the prayers of the faithful we would not therefore pretend to argue that because historically or canonically the sultan has no authority over the indian mahomedans he will therefore never have any it would be still bolder to set limits to the sympathy which the chief mahomedan soveroigf might excite in the minds of fellow believers who have the opportunity of learning what are the threats directed against him though we are inclined to think that there is something unreal and artificial in the present iiovement we do not wish to deny either the possi bility of a sympathy in india with the turks or the right of the indian blahomedans to express that sympathy they have as much right to be turkophiles as if they lived in middlesex but the promoters of these meetings must not ex pect any special success as mahoinedans in moving the british peodle or induencing tho policy of the british empire what is to be done in europe will not be done through hostility to islam and the work cannot be aban doned in deference to moslem remonstrances the gencral peace is threatened and the world may be suddenly convulsed because a mahomedan govern ment and a ruling class cannot be made to respect tlle primary rights of human society if the chris tians on the bank of the danube were governed as are the  mahomedans in bengal we should hear nothing of insurrections however numerous might be the foreign promoters of dis affection the christian subjects of the sultan are treated as europe for its own safety can no longer auow them to be treated if this illused supremacy is not of the essence of mahoniedan rule but merely a tyranny of the turks as a parti cular race the indians have no religious interest in defending it if in their hearts they believe that such a domination should endure they cannot expect to be listened to by other british subjects ve do nothing against the sultan or his creed or his followers  every moslem will be as free socially politically and theologically as he is now or as hp ever was but the turks must not be permitted to govern others as no mlahomedan is governed in any province of india from madras to the punjab
