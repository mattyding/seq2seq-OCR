i the lipiart collectioymthe sale of the very remarhable collection of old engrvings formed during thb lat  years by herr von liphart a distinguished germanconnoisscur of dorpat but lately a resident of florence which has just been con duioted at leipsic in tho hotel stadt dresden was an event of the highest interest to the world of print collectors herr von iphart began to study the subject so far hack as  when ho laid the foundation of his large collection which in its completu stato numbered nearly  ex amnples by purchasing many fin prits at a ale in leipsic through herr boern r the auctioneer who has now directed the final disposal of his cabinet he after wards continued his pursmit at bonn gaining much from his acquaitance with such experts as herr weber and pro fessor wvolf tho groet student ofjiistorical portrait engrav ings and spent many yesrs in russia adding greatly to the treasures of his portfolios eventunlly in  obtaining a most choice selection from tho collection belonging to herr lveber sold after hbis death in later years his great ex perience and tine tasto enabled him to take advantago of every sale of importance in perfecting the different series of the works of the masters until at length ho had brought together not only a vast ollection of the haghest geneml excellence but in some respects quito unrivalled in the completeness of certain sets of engravings and the perfect condition of somo unique specirnens of theso may be mentioned for example the set of the three engrved designs of wonderful interlaced work attributed to leonardo da vinci by vasari copied in woodcut by albert direr of which the british museum possesses only one and which are we believe unique as a aet the series of albert durors work was one of the finest ever formed consisting of  prints among which wcro the extremely rar  restkranke with tho latin verses by dr ulsensins the adam and eve in the first state and the first edition of his three great books die grosso passion  die apocalypso and  das marionloben which however had unfortunately beon taken out of the oldoriginal binding to havo the prints cleaned others almost equally rare will bo noticed as wo go through the details of the catalogue the examples of martin schon ganer and lucna cranach were also numerous and in fins condition rembrandt was a favourito mras ter with herr liphart who tolerated none but the choicest spocimens andj the whole of the  examples were of almost uniform beauty the collection of vandyck portraits many etched by his owu hand was another moet interesting feature in the sale but only thoso who have been go fortunate as toobtain tho catalogue which is a most elaborate work of  pages with several ad mirable illustrations of the principal examples can form any just idea of the extraordinary variety and complete ness of the collectionthe sale which began on the th alt and continued for soveral days was attended by rll the principal dealers of the continent holding commissions from most of the groat public museums and though it does not appear that any specially instructed agent of tho british museum was present yet as many of the most important examples havo been brought to london by mr thibaudeau and some by mr mcay of the old house of colnaghi and co it may be hoped that tho national codection may still ob tain the advantage of filling up somie of its vacant pilcesmost of tho purchases mado by the english agents were for the fitzwilliam mluseum of cambridgo the authorities of the university having dovoted a sum

of the objects of autique greek and phm nician glass discovered by general cesnola this acquisition of rare engravings will bo viewed with great satisfaction as evincing the determination of the
