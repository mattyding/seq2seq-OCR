motion lwhich had just been read nvere asufficient so prevent any inisconeeption of hiis ob ject ant i motives in troubling the court with a proposition of this nature as hoswever ise understood that considerable misconceptin prevailed withi regard to his intention lie begged leave to state what he did not propose to do by his motionl he did not mean to propose that any positive tnea sure should be decided on in that court or by the govern nsent abroad with reference to this question his motion as it stood ouly assumed the shape of a recommendatiot front the court of proprietors to the court of directors re questing of the latter if they thought fit to call on the government abroad to turn their attention to this sub ject in the next place it was not his object to med dle sn any manner wvith the image worship of india by any coercive measure he would not hurt a hair of the head of a single idol worshippermuch less would he pro pose to pull down their temples it was not the abolition of temple worship that he caued for but the abrogation of temnple tributethat tribute which was now collected from a polluted and immoral source lc trusted that he had nowr said enough to show that he did not mean to go forward with a wild and quixotic fecling against the prevailing rcligion of india but that his object wasto prevent thecompanyby le vying a tax on the pilgrims from encouraging or appear ing to encourage a systein of idolatry the hon proprietor then proceeded te read a vast number of extracts from the works of the abbe dubois mr wvard and others descrip tive of the horribly obscene rites with which idol worship was attended after having adverted to the bloody and licentious system of idol worship in general the hon proprietor adverted in detail to the proceedings which occur at juggernaut gya allahabad and trichinopoly the expense incurretl at jug gernaut ir one year and to defray whfch a tax was levied  amounted to  for table expenses the charge was l dress  servants wages including the hire of prostittes of whom there were  il the college  according to a computation which lie isad niade founded on official documents it appeared that in the course of  yearsthe pilgrimtax collected at juggernaut gysa allaabsdtrichinopoly and one or two places of minor note amounted in round nunbers to  millon sterling the hon proprietor then argued briefly in refutation of such objections as he conceived might or would beadvanced against sipro position and concluded by making his motionalr casitutoiers supported the proposition in his opi nion the arguments of his hon friend could not be refutedalr birtwie admitted that horrible cruelties were perpe trated at juggernaut allahabad and gya  but howvever the system might be deplored it would be as futile to attempt to put an end toit by force as it was for theirancestors in past ages to carry warfare into the holy land for the parpose of exterminating the infidels interference witb the religionof tbe natives oughttn bestrietly avoided fornothing wasmorelikely toshakethebritishpowerin indiattnansuchinterference they oughtnotto rorgettliesanginasryinsurrectionatvelloreiniaog when an illtimed interference with caste occasioned theloss of so many lives they ought always to bear in mind that the safety of their mpire was intrusted to a large nativc army and notbing should be done which was calculated to create discontent amongst tbat body the onlysmodein which ido latry could be eradicated in india was bythe extension of knowledge and information and it ought to be generally known that for the purpose of diffusing instruction through out india the company annually expended not less thats  they ought to proceed cautiouslyin removing those obectionable practices anti le was happy to hear from the lon mover that he did not recommend the adoption of harsh and severe measures to put thetm dowvnlr titant could say from experience that the imposi tion of a tax on these pilgrims was exceedingly injurious to theircharacter as christians havingbeenofficially employ ed in the revenue department in the province where jugger naut wias situated he found it imposible believing as he did in the truths of the christian religion to coisferm to the regu lations wlhich the british govcrnment had laid down with re spect to the superstitious wvorship at that temple and he had caused itto be stated to the government that he rvoald not interfere in the manner that might be expected he knew every thing connected with the system in consequence of bting secretary to the bontd of revenue in that pro vince and he found it impossible to obey the regti lations laid down the british government had in faet removedl the rajab of purneab who was hereditary high xriest of juggernaut for the purpose lie might say of intro ducing a high priest of their own he would boldly say that as a christian people they ought to wash their hands completely of this concem he thought it fonrled a very strong reason to induce the court to tae up this question that some years ago the executve holy drew up some verv proper resolutions which wereintended to he sent to india declaratory of their determination not to have their treasurypolluted by money derived frorn such abominations  but the gotcrnment at home forbade the sending out of any such de claration it vas impbrtant at that moment when various questionsrelative to india were discussed that the proprietors should boldly express their opinion and be hoped tiat orders would be issued towithdraw that degree ofinterference on the part of the company with itis temple worshipwvhich atpresent prevailedhe meant the imposition of a tax upon pilgrimsmlr lovndxes was of opinion that they ought not to in terfcrc with the religion of the people of india lyhten they talked of idolatry the ought to look at home there was as much idolatry iu tbie city of london as there was in any part of the world let them revert to the year g  did they not see all the merchants of london worshipping the golden godgeneral tuortwos regretted that questions of this sort were broughtbefore the court these discussions could do no good but might produce a great deal of evil the hon l prop ietor had told thent that he did not mean to interfere witli the hindoo religion and yethis whole speech was one continued attack on that elgion the hon proprietor liad taken up considerably more than twro hours to tell them what  lhy that wvhich they perfectly well knew before ie hadintroduced a vast number of statements many of which he believed to be mere fables or at least very highly coloured narratives itwould in his opinion be a certain mode of increasing idolatry instead of repressing it if they were to repeal this
