les amis dle verite it con sisted of secret clubs bound upon the principle of freema sonry to secrecy and conjoint support but having the poltical object of hurling the bourbons from the thronc this society was principallycomposed of young inen full of enthu siasmandwhilethe impulsewcasuponthemripeforanychange these four sutfcrers had the general fate of conspiratorstbey vrere betrayed by spies of the police though not abandoned to their fate without a struggle by their friends which a parisian autbor of the day preserved in the form of a ro mancethe only safe medium of recording such an event under the government which commanded the catastrophe the facts stripped of the literary colouring were shortly theseat eight oclock on tle evening of the t of september  about  or  young nmen arrived in paris from rvochelle by separate cnveyanscs and assembled as if by acddent in a house ih rue danjoudauphiue they were a mixed group composed of men of lettcrs medical students painters and mostly of the liberal professions but on the nights of their arrival exchanged no conversation which ws likrel to attract the attention of strangers their object was if possible to save their fiiends from the scaffold on which they were doomed to suffer on the fol lowing day many expedients had been prepared and altered as further liglits fell upon the parties but the ablest dispositions for the purpose were made by colonels fabvier since known by his services in grecece and dentzel these were however foiled by the betrayal of an humbler asso ciate the gaoler was to have released the prisoner for lo francs the societywas toopoor to raise the money in time but it is said a great painter tbough tos late had offered to make upthe deficit corruption bymoneyhaving failed more byac cident than design the society determinedby forceto attempt the rescue of the prisoners from tlhe gendarmes on the route from the bicetre to the place de grevc but when the hour of action came and these young men hnd determined to save their friends er perisfl with them relying on imparting a powerful impulse to the crowd which asseimrble on such occasions it was ascertained that the streets were lined with soldiers and that the goternment liad made such s demonstration of military force as musr baffle any efiort to caue a rescue it was in vain tbat these devoted persons scattered themselves among the crowd and endeavour ed to excite a commotion the pouce were too vigilant and the power of tbe crown too strong some crics of pardon were heard and answcred by two of the prisoners by the ex clamation of  vive ia librtd the cistain fell upon this drama wben the heads of the four sufferers roued from the scaffoldas thcrc remain fagnients of this as well as of every other political sodety whicl has
