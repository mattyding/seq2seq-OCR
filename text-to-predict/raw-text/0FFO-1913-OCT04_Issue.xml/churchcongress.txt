church congressproblems of property and  rural lifeutnited imeetntg withnonconformistsfbiom our special coriesponpextssouthampton ocr there could be no better example of the close touch which the present congress has kept with living questions than the nature of the subjects which occupied its closing sessions this morning a comprehensive survey was taken of the diverse problems suggested by the phrase  rural betterment as regards the evening subject  the ethics of property when it is mentioned that the selected speakers iacluded lord hugh cecil professor h s holland mir philip snowden mp and a prominent member of the church socialist league it will be obvious that the debate was not lacking either in instruction or varietythe first topic was chosen as being specially appropriate in a diocese which is predominantly agricultural at first sight it might appear that such a subject is rather remote from the interests which the church congress specially represents but this was far from being the case in the matter of cooperation for example mr charles bathurst mp who is a governor of the agricultural organization society declared thit its future development in this country depends upon the village clergy the farmer he said is often distrustful of co operation or at least indifferent the parish priest in his position of peculiar influence may help him with counsel and guidance which may well prove his economic salvation lord salis bury presented the case for the use of state credit for the building of cottages in par ticular he pleaded for an atmosphere of common sense in standards of construction where matters of hygiene and comfort are concemedsome singular reflections must have been in the minds of any who had not realized the catholic spirit of this congress as they listened to the dobate toniht here were four un compromising colleetvists presenting the ethics of the socialist gospel in undiluted form and being heard not with toleration merely but with a lively sympathy at least as far as con cerned their aims and ideals it was a striking sign to quote a phrase of mr snowdens speech of  the reawakening of the social con sciousnees of the church some evidences of dissent were occasionally apparent as when the rev conrad noel a member of the clhurch socialist league asked his hearers to condemn all incomeproducing properties as theft or a disgraceful kind of almsgiving and also after some passagos in mr snowdens remarks but as a whole the arguments were heard with respect and attentionthe only note of opposition from the platform was in a characteristic and enter taining speech from lord hugh cecil at the close of the meeting there was a series of interruptions from all parts of the hall by women some of whom tried tco drown the presidents voice by their remarls their object in the confusion that followed was not clear but from the nention of womens rights it was evident that they were suffragists the demonstration caused a deep feeling of resentment seeing that the congress has this week provided the women with a unique opportunity of pleading their causea meeting which was really outside the officia programme of the congress but which was as significant and remarkableas any of its proceedings was held in the congress ha this afternoon it was an interdenominational meet ing whose origin was due to the world mission ary congress held in edinburgh three years ago and its purpose was to express the essential unity of all christian effort in the battle for the realization of moral and civilizing ideals in addition to three wellknown bishops of the church of england the speakers included leading figures in the methodist congregational anid presbyterian denominations and if the roman catholics were not officiauy repre sented it was only because the meeting was deemed by their church to be too closely associated with the church congress and there were several roman catholics on the platformrural bettermentthe congress devoted the last day of its proceedings to the subject of the kingdom zof god and the social order taling as the first division of it the problem of  rural better montmr christopher turnor read the opening paperhe said that agriculture now employed  fewer persons than it did  years ago and he urged that this state of things must be rectified we must recreate conditions favourable to the cultivation of arable land we must reconstruct village life and thereby produce greater inducement in a rural en vironment for the exercise of the highest intellectual as well as physical capacity think how the questions of destitution overcrowding in towns deterioration of physique would be affected if the land vwere culti vated as intensively as in denmark i it would mean another  men finding occupation on the jand and the output of another  millions worth of home grown foodstuff they could take it from him and here all agriculturists who had studied the question agreedour land could be made to produce vastly more than it did at present more wheat more milk more meat more vegetables how could this be done  first they must create conditions favourable to agriculture as a whole education must be made more practical there must be facilities for land pur chase housing reform a systemn of agricultural co operation and credit the development of small holding colonies and instruction for small holdersanother necessary reform to which he wisshed to direct special attention was the reconstruction of rural life any one acquainted wvith the present conditions of life in an ordinary englsh village knew how unsatisfac tory and unorganized they were howvever much a man might savc there were no opportunities for employing his savings in the village itself and a labourer could not be blamed if ho decided that so far ns hle was able he would send his children away to save them from the blindalley existence wlich he had ed himself they must begin to think of the small farmer and even more of the labourer every cottage must be sanitary and have oneeighth to one quarter o�an acre of garden there must be a village hail and an active parish meeting he would like to sea the church enterin more fully into the life of the rural community than it did at present ho would like to see the clergy if he might speak plainly less academic and more versed in country life understand ing more tho labourers point of view and able to give practical assistance in a schermes of rural betterment the roman catholic priests in belgiuim gave them a great example of what a church could do to develop country life and he believed it should be possible for our clergv to do as muchthe housing problemlord salisbury dealt with the problem of rural housing which he described as very sirnple to state but very difficult to solvehe said they could not up to now rely upon building a good cottage for less than � six per cent on the outlay if the cost of repairs was included was the least that must be charged for rent if the cottage was to bo a commercial pro position six per cent on � meant a rent of  a year that was of just under s d a wreek to this must be added rates bringing thb total weekly outgoing to about s a week but the current cottage rent in many parts of england was s or �s  a week and in sonme places less there fore to meet an expenditure of ncarly s a week the onvner only got about half the yalue of the cottage two conclusions followed  it wvas clear that cottages could only be built on these conditions at a dead loss  it was not surprising that there was a dearth of good cotcages some people thought that everything that was wrong in the coutttrywide was due to the rapacity of the squire let them get rid of that notion he had not been too hard on the contrary he had been too soft the cottages were probably never built to pay certainly good cottages had not in fact psid for generations and now that the old cottages became not good enough and the newcottages not numerous enough the squire though willing that the old unecononic system should continue in respect of esisting cottages was neither willing nor able to extend it and to multiply the building of cottages at a dead loss and if the squire was not willing they might be sure no one else was for he was the only man who was ever fool enough with hiseyes open to invest money at a loss there was accordingly a deadlockof two possible remedies one was to transfer the necessary loss to the shoulders of the longsuffering taxpayer it might come to that but there were two formidable objections first it was the final abandonment of building cottages by private enter prise secondly there seemed to be no limit to the amount of the public burden so to be undertaken the other possible remedy was to accommodate the conditions of labourers and of cottage building to economic laws so that the difficulty might disappear in other words to prevent cottage property being necessarily a dead loss in the first place in parts of the country where the labourer was underpaid he might be paid a better wage but no conceivable rise of wages which would not cripple the agri cultural industry would suffice to enable him to pay a higher rent therefore the remedy would be to reduce expense by means first of cheaper credit provided by the use of the state credit secondly by cooperation among landowvners and thirdly by cheapening cottage constructionhere an atmosphere of common sense was most important it was downright lunacy to say that they must not use wood for building in the country because in towns wooden buildingc might icad to disastrous fires or to say that all rooms must be ft high when these small rooms if the window was shut was like the black hole of cal cutta whether they were ft or ft high while if the window was open they were in any case all right overcrowding it was true was unhealthy but except damp there was generallv nothing else in housing which mattered to the health of the occu piers there must be comfort but above all they must cut their coat according to their cloth neither baths nor parlours were the saving of souls these things required effort the effort of churchmen among others it needed no exertion to demand public money or to gush about the comforts of the poor but to check uneconomic impulses and to give personal attention to organization and to petty details of construction was laborious lt was however the better wayfarm labourers wagesmr c roden buxton made a plea for the point of view of the agricultural labourer wvhich he considered the most important of allhe said that on the average the ordinary labourers wages as the latest board of trade figures showed were s d a weekand this covered all extras they were arrived at after taking into consideration harvest work various allowances free cottages where there were such and everything else he had lived much among agricultural labourers families he had by the way learned a good deal more in the bar parlour of the village publichouse over a mug of beer than was covered by the allseeing eye of the board of tradeand he asserted that if life was to be lived in such conditions as would give them mere physical efliciency and nothing more they must have something like sf d a week an alarming figure they would say it was but it was no use disguising itfor nothing lesswould do and if the labourer had to pay a commercial rent for his cottage it must be more to the farmer that seemed an overwhelming burden and to the labourer some thing beyond the dreams of avarice but in point of fact it was an incredibly mean figure they had the authority of the report of the committee of con vocation on the moral witness oflthe church that the adequate remuneration of the labourer should be the first charge on every industr that meant a readjustment of the profits of industry and that meant treading on somebody elses toes at any rate their object could only be achieved by some kind of interference from outside it must cause controversy therefore but was not this a great opportunity for the church to do something to put itself openly and avowedly on the side of the agri cultural labourer agricultural cooperationmr charles bathurst mp contributed a paper on agricultuiral cooperationhle said that if the squires of england large and small were to set the example by giving all the labourers in their emplovment � a week the problem would be more than haif solved though wages had increased in many parts of england the rise in the cost of living had made the agricultural labourer proportionately nearer to destitution than he was ten years ago there was an uncertainty with regardto the futuro which had tended to checl the develop ment of agriculture one reason for lack of pro gress was want of initiative want of business know edge incapacity for independent action and the inability of wives and daughters owing to their train ing to assist in the successful conduct of the industry cooperation was essential to the success of the in dustry england had been the last important country to apply cooperation to farming but there was no country in which in so short a time so much work had been done cooperation was the only effective substitute for capital and was the onlv thing which could prevent the small farmer from being crushed out of existence by his foreign competitors and by the large farmers cooperative credit was as important as cooperative purchase distribution and sale for it was lack of access to capital rather than lack of access to land which was the obstacle to agricultural progress it might be asked how this subject came tq be discussed at the church congress the reason was that the development of cooperation depended mainly in this country upon the village clergy it was upon the activities of the clergyand of the ministers of other christian denominations that the salvation not only of souls but of britains greatest industry dependededucation in the countrymr arthur chapman chairman of the surrey county council read the last paper which dealt with rural educationr e said it was doubtful whether education had been an unmixed blessing to those who lived in rural areas there was a general feeling among farmers that it would have been better if all the money spent on education had been used in manuring the land laughter surely there must be something wrong in a system of education which after so many years was held responsible for making country children discontented with their lot in life and in efficient for performing their work in life it was not eiducation that was to blame but the mould into which in the past they had tried to cast it they must bring the curriculum into touch with rural environ iment teaching such subjects as gardening carpenter ingcookeryor laundry work in the elementary schools in the secondary schools the foundation must be laid for scientific education in rural indnstry and there must be continuation schools for agricultural students attendance at which sooner or later must be made compulsory as it is in germanymiss constacn cocmre hon treasurer of the rural rousing association said that much better sanitary inspection was resulting in an improvement in rural housing she believed that the housing act of  should be allowed a few more years in practice before they said that it was inadequate vilage clergy could do much to improve ecisting conditions by facing them courage ously if they did not do so they would stultify their work in other directionssm sydney oivimn said it ought to be recognized more and more that agriculture must be the pro fession of a great number in this country and that it was worth while to make it attractive he thought one method of achieving that object would be by forming smal local agricultural societies analogous to gardeners societies in which men could meet together discussing their work stimulating one another and getting rid of the suspicion and the lack of confidence which so greatly divided agri culturists re found while living in jamaica that these local societies spread rapidly out of the movement grew naturally the cooperative societies and the credit bankschristianity and moderncivilizationthe noncongress meeting in the coliseurm in the afternoon attracted one of the largest gatherings of the week the president of the congress was in the chair and the subject for consideration was  christianity and the civili zation of our timne regarded as allied and alien forcesthe chairm said that no such meeting had ever been held before on the occasion of a church congress but he had felt that a special responsibility was laid upon him to undertake something of the kind the world missionary conference in edinburgh three years ago had opened a door which he hoped would never be closed for no proposal was discussed on which christian bodies differed that might seem to be needlessly negative but he believed that it was right the union which they talked of so much and for which they prayed constantly was a complex thing the various christian churches were united and dis united but while much was heard about their dis union very little was heard about their union that was an unreal untrue and unhappy state of things there was one danger about meeting together as theywere doing the very nearness with which they were  drawn together and their cordiality might lead themi to belittle their principles more than they should do but there were dangers on every sido of the path of right conduct the platform which they saw before them was not fully representative of the christian religion they had not among the speakers though they had present representatives of the roman catholic church which a distinguished anglican representative of missions had told him the other day did rather more than  per cent of the mission work of the world it had been his earnest desire that some distinguished representative of the roman catholic church should have been one of their speakers but the authorities of that church had thought it was not advisable the way in which the negotiations had been conducted had not worsened their relations and he had it on the highest authority that it was not impossible for the church of rome to take part in such a meeting though it had not been thought advisable at a meeting so closely connected with the church congress that it might be taken to be part of itthe lnrest of todaybishop boydcarpenter said that civilization and christianity had been alien forces times without number and he could not say that either was always righthe could not say that civilization was right when it persecuted the early christians and he could not say christianity was right at the time of the inquisition while these two forces were often found in hostile camps it sometimes happened that civiliza tion rose up and rebuked the christianity of the time in the very name andon the very principles which christianity had put forward in that civilized world often when christianity and civilization had appeared as alien forces it had not been good for either it was necessary and essential that these two forces should be allies civilization was the power which was making men mnore fitted for the citizenship of life and as such it could never be looked upon as hostile to christianity there was general dissatisfaction and unrest in the world today and they should try to understand that dissatis faction one man might say with a great deal of truth that there never was a time when people so scamped their work when they so enjoyed pleasure sometimes iuicit pleasure and wheni they were so determined to get as much as possible and to give as little as possible all classes of people might be attacked many people were admitted into high social circles not because of their character but because they might give a  tip did not that desire for a useful  tip  show the same spirit which made a man scamp his work and demand higher wages it was the desire to get something for nothing and it was found in all classesbut the dissatisfaction was not found wholly among those who were given over to greed it was found among those who wished to give to their brothers the best opportunities of life the conditions of today not only entailed upon many surroundings which were shameful in a christian land but also made the expansion of their souls impossible owing to the oveiwhelaing cares of the world there was a gigantic power of christian force in the world which was now being used uneconomicallv if they could get rid of some of their absurd ideas and use economically the christian force in the world they would be able to effect a state of things which wouldv represent to waiting and expeetant heathenism sueh a manifestation of the power of christ as might mean the rebirth of the worldthe negation of godthe rev dr d s cairns professor of dogmaties and apologeties in the united free church college aberdeen followedhle said that civilization in its divine intention was a great revelation of god and setting it in that light he asked them to review their discussions of the last week they began with the problem of the sexes he had had it recently brought home to him by the study of a vast mass of evidence from mioslem lands how our whole idea of the fatherhood of god was the product of the christian family thev could not possiblv preach the fatherhood of god to a moslem andience without creating the gravest mis apprehension owing to the vicious teaching of islam about the relation of the sexes the congress passed on to discuss the christian relations between the races when the relations between the races were nonchristian the whole vision of god was darkened alike for heathen and christian the government of the congo was nothing less than the defiant negation of the very existence and character of god and such a thing could not go on without the whole temper of christianity being affected the same was true when they came to think of the great international crime of militarism the militarism of europe arose from the fact that in their hearts men had already defied god he did not say there was not a vital necessity for christian people to defend themselves but the order of things in which we were all caught up was not of god but of heli when civilization came back to the divine order he could imagine how god would reveal himself to man and how man would come to know man as never beforethat day they were dealing with the question of poverty was not the slum the negation of god  it was the whole sin of society that was mirrored in the slumthe rapacity of the rich as well as the intemperance of the poor the slum was the cancer that indicated the diseased organism the difficulties presented by these questions must have struck them all but he had rejoiced to see that the spirit which had permeated those who discussed them was that with god all thingos were possiblea warning from dr forsythdr forsyth principal of hackney theological college hlampstead said that the greatest issue and interest on earth was the kingship of god it was the final goal ol all historychristianity and civilization were two quite distinct things at points they were even antagonistic civilization indeed developed a religion but what christianity had in charge was a salvationa salva tion even from the religion of civilization the church represented social christianitv it was the greatest society on earth because it wvas the supreme trustee for man of the final kingdom of god the church was neither alien nor allied to natural society it was not one of humanitys assets nor one of the worlds great powers it was a supernatural society the first business of the church was not to act on man but upon god worship rather than help was the first work of the church the society which was the first concern of christianity was the church as the direct product of the gospel the church had in charge the one thing needfulnot ideals certainly not precepts but power from on high as there could not be neutrality and there must be contact there was much need and room for compromise in the relations between church and society if the church realized her holy resources she had also the power to enter compromise so as to control it a holy church must not exploit society but moralize it but moral power was of slow growth there was a constant temptation to all the churches to go faster than the moral conditions of their gospel allowed they were tempted to put their capital into extension and place too little to reserve this was bad business and worst of all for a church the church of all societies lived upon its reserves it must sit as mary to serve as martha it was todays sanctity that was tomorrows salvation from certain great social services the church had had more or less to retire but only to concentrate on the spring that fed them allthe world would yet make a greater demand on the church than it had ever done before the enormous growth of a material and social civilization was creating a vast inward hunger and perhaps preparing for society a huge moral crisisnot to say a tragedy humanity cherished an ever more passion ate belief in itself its own civilization and its own success it had never had such reason and vet even now it was seized in its slack hours and black griefs with a dread sense of its hollow iinterior it was compelled sometimes to think calamity was notalways to be overcome by indomitableness ofspirit death came and after death a judgment which had its prelude in the very midst of life there came home the sense of a world intractable to our success and inflexible to its wealth if these things touched us now a time was coming when they would overwhelm us and then to which of our saints should we turn  it was then that society would be driven from its passionate belief in itself to the patient company of those who cherished a belief still more passionate in its saviour and the cnurch must never expand now at the cost of losing the power to stay and minister then we had certainly to go to the world today and to evangelize it with all our might but not at any and every price not faster than the soul could go or grace allow civilization bv many voices put the church upon its trial but it was really civiliza tion that was on its trial before the church pilate still summoned christ but he sentenced the judge of all the earth it was the sublimest ironv in human affairs but over all the affairs and the irony still creative still loving and stiu saving was the infinite pity the endless mercy and the eternal grace of the holy city and the kingdom which could not be moveda plea for decisionthe bishop of oxford said he was going to take civilization in one of its aspects as meaning progress and to ask what was or ought to be the relation of christianity towards the pro gressive movementlooking out into the world with a faith in god he must see in it a divine purpose of progress but that purpose of progress was thwarted and baffled by human selfishness wifulness and sin but though thwarted it was not overthrown their attitude and duty then was in st pauls words to be guided by discrimination  they were to look good and evilin the face and to discriminate they must test all hins ut heymus chose the church confroted wth thee movmentswhich were claimed toe pogrssiehadto akeupits nind eiter thatthey were good on the whole and to be fought with or that they were bad on the whole and therefore to be fought agnst the attitude which the churchman had no right to acquiesce in was the attitude of never making up his mind at all at one time the church made a nustake in identifying itself with the zeifgeisf the divine movement was centralizationmonarchy government the church accepted it magnificently but it overdid it it forgot everything that was meant by  my kingdom is not of this world but he did not think the church was in danger today of reckless selfidentification with progressive move ments laughter nor did he think they were in danger of reckless resistance to current movements the great danger they were in was of seeing a great deal of good and a great deal of bad in everythng and therefore takng no partand therefore in the total result not counting at all cheershe would apply that to two of the great movements ofthedaythe labou movement and the womens movement cheers he was quite sure that there was a great deal that was evil in both those movements laughter and cheers but also and much more he was quite sure that at the hottom they repre sented the movemnent of god the movement of the divine purpose in the world cheers his point was that if they were forced to discriminate to decide they would largely come to that conclusion but he would rather see people decide wrongly than not decide at all but when they had decided they must make their decision evident they must come out they must take sides they must understand then and only then had they the slightest chance of making profitable criticism or being able to defeat that which was the element of peril and even indeed the threatening of disaster in these great movements but the attitude which he was sure the church was in eminent peril of allowing itself to maintain was an attitude which by never taking one side or the other remained for ever ineffective and its criticisms un listened to because they proceeded from those to whom they were felt as they were uncommitted to cost little or nothingthe rev j scott lidgett also addressed the meetingthe ethics of propertyviews of professor hollandat the closing session this evening the con gress discussed  the ethics of propertyprofessor h s holland dealt in the opening paper with the effect on the individual of collective ownershipproeessoa hollaxd said that property in some shape or degree was one of the primal conditions of personal development yet by some sheer inward necessity of its own it had wiped out more and more the multitude of small owners so that now the active working population was merely wageearning this class had no secure footing of their own beyond their days wage no resistant power no reserve while the millions of casual labourers were but creatures of the day with no certainty of work no independ ence or choice or hope thus it had come to pass that a society like ours which appealed so strenuouslv to the moral influence of ownership nevertheless denied the possibilities of ownership to the great mass of its members their problem then was how to extend ownership so that no qualified citizen should be without it how could this be done  wfell something had already been achieved the wage earners had gathered together the vast funds of their trade unions and with these resources in reserve they could recapture much of the moral force which pro perty carried with it they gained stability they could look ahead tlhey could press a policy they had a recognized place in the world of affairs and could make good their claim on existencethrough all the volume of factory legislation the nation as an integral whole exerted the right of ownership the entire body collectively exercised its right of ownership through the legislature couective ownership i here then was a force in which ownership might be conterminous with citizen ship and any citizen might have the ethical value of a man of property but could collective owner sbip have the same moral effect as private ownership  would it evoke with anything like the same force the full ethical cognition of personality  now this was a crucial question and the answer entirely depended o
