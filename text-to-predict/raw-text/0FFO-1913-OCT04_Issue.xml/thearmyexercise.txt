the army exercise military aeronauticsthe three armsby ouj ilitarcy correspondentiimilitary aeronautics have not been a pleasant subject to discuss of late so great have been the exaggerations which have been indulged in by practically all parties in recent disputes wvhen september comes round however the royal flying corps shows us what it can do what it can find out and what it can report and by this test it must and can be judgedwve did not indeed notice  aeroplanes at the army exercise but we observed about a quarter of this historic number and we saw them out practically au day and in most weathers wfe also saw the army airships and the elaborate machinery required to sustain the activity of the flying corps in the field most of the air craft were allotted to the white force and it is well worth while to investigate whether the information which they brought in was trustworthy and wvhether it was obtained under conditions bearing a fair resemblance to those of warsep teamer  on the first day of the operations the air ship delta was first in the field rose at  am reconnoitred as far south as imarlow and despite the mist located a column two miles long marching along the road from hemel hempstead to dunstable at  am she discovered a column six miles long marching northwest on the road amershamaylesbury and reported the tail at amersham and the advanced guard at stoke mandeville the first report was partially correct and afforded grounds for further investigation of the move ment of the brown nd army the second report described accurately the march of the st army and thus at an early hour the white com mander was in a position to know the facts of most importance concerning his enemys situation while he was still some marches dis tantthe mist prevented the aeroplanes from rising tiul  am they reconnoitred and reported clear several important centres and observed hostile cavalry east of bucking ham later they reported that the heads of two hostile columns had reached fenny strat ford and winslow respectively thus the reports of the delta were confirmed and the position of the brown main columns ascertained bux the cavalry division under allenby appears in the main to have eluded observation both by airships and planessome incidents of interest occurred this day when near great mlissenden the delta was attacked by a be biplane and a bleriot mono plane in a stiff breeze the aeroplanes rose to the same height as the airship and closed upon her it was supposed that in such conditions the airship crew with their steadier platform could have driven the aeroplanes away this day also aeroplane  fell when descend ing the machine was wrecked and the pilot and observer were injured on the other handno  brown aeroplane was compelled by engine trouble to land at staverton and was capturedsitmmibea at i am on the rd the delta reported a column estimated at one division on the winslowbuckinglham road and at  re ported the head of a main body at stony strat ford an aeroplane reconnaissance at a pm disclosed the presence of the head of a colunm at park hall and the tail at stony stratford thus though little detail seems to have been given the general direction of the enemys march and his progress along the roads which were being used by the st and nd armies were reported with sufficient precision to enable the white commander to take timely measuressepteiben by this day the hostile armies were in touch and much information came in from troops however at  am the wlhite commander was informed by his aircraft that a brown cavalry brigade was near culworth that the head of the nd brown army was near blakesley and that the heads of two columns believed to be the st brown army were at wappenhain and syresham thus once more the position of the enemys main columns and the progress of his march were accurately reported and at an early hour the identifi cation of the cavalry at culworth was useful as it showed the white commander that the hostile cavalry would probably be found in the western flank of the theatre on the follow ing daybefore nightfall the white aeroplanes located the bivouacs of brownnamely cavalry south of byfield st army woodford halse and to the southward nd army blakesley advanced guard preston capes the delta confirmed this information after dark a useful days workseptember on this day the only success of the white aircraft was the discovery in the morning of hostile columns nearing charwelton through out the morning the aeroplanes disported themselves round sharmans hill but there is recorded no attempt to locate the hostile artillery positions the position of the general reserve and the probable direction of the main attackuse o aisrratwe have such slight war experience to go upon since aircraft became of serious use to armies that none of us can form more than provisional ideas of what will happen when rival aircraft meet in the air but we know this much and have known it for some time namely that failing defeat in the air or by fire from below modem aircraft will at all times except in continuous bad weather enable a comrnander to learn with very fair accuracy the positions and the direction of march of hostile columns while these are several days march away from him our flying corps can now be reported competent to supplv this information urnder the above conditions and it has consequently justified its existence and its costwere these successes obtained under con ditions bearing a fair resemblance to those of war and how should be apportioned credit between airships and aeroplanes  so far as the writer could judge the tendency was to fly a little too low lower than would be the case in war and both airships and aeroplanes the former in particularwould have often been tuder fire and perhaps hit the mists and the weather conditions account to some extent for the low flights at the same tine great difficulty was experienced in differentiating between friendly and hostile aeroplanes some friendly planes were fired at by their own side and some hostile craft passed by lnscathed some means must be found for identifying friendly craft or the return of these craft to their landaut places will be more dangerous than thereconnaissance of the enemy the writer saw no such flying feats in the mlidlands as those recently executed by captain long roft in ireland and it is possible that whilewe have many good pilots the firttfiighters are still rare we are also still without ade quate means for attacking aircraft by gunfire and one could not regard the fire of howitzers against the aircraft as serious it is important that the carriage of our future field gun should permit of fire approximating to the vertical as in the case of thedeport gun and we appear to need practice by infantry using combined sights against kites representing aeroplanes in order to fix our ideas upon the subject of rifles versms aeroplanesso far as airships and aeroplanes are con cerned the honours for obtaining informa tion were fairly divided and do not appear to justify tho  threatened elimina tion of the airship from our war material the delta was usually out first and home last she brought early accurate and valuable information the airship alone can work in the mists and fogs so prevalent in our islands and she alone can at present travel safely by night and report bivouacs and railway movements it would not be a good reply to the policy of other great powers were we to put all our money into aeroplanes and to neglect the dirigible even if we all agree that the aeroplane has the greater future in front of herthe work of the aircraft on september  was disappointing white should have inown quite early that the advance of the rd divi sion was premature and unsupported should have been told of the exact positions of the massed nd and th divisions and should i in the light of this inforrnation have been able subject to the limitations imposed upon him to make effective reply to the brown dis positions which were far from brilliant the positions of the brown concealed guns should have been reported as well as the march of the cavalry division there is no evidence that this information was obtained and though white was able to a large extent to realize the brown faults he would have been more assured of them had the exact positions of the brown reserves been reported to hiim on all this side of aircraft work there is still much to be done and wo must hope that next year we shall have made more progrees in the tactical use of aero planes upon the battlefieldit is also nearly time for us to endeavour to represent in some manner the inevitable contests between the flving men in the air and for the umpires to allot the prioritv if not the monopoly of information to the side which is either strongest in the air or maikes such good dispositions that its success against rival flyers is on the cards that there will be im mense difficulties in laying down rules on such a subject goes without saying but it is quite certain that there will be a fight in the air in war and that the bestprepared and most resolute side will win if this be so then we are not doing much good by allowing each side to scout in the air at its leisure and to profit by its aircraft regardless of dispositions and relative strengthe with sir lwilliam robertson at the head of the training directorate and brigadiergeneral henderson in charge of inilitary aeronautics we must expect next year considerable progress in all that concerns the use of aircraft in warthe tmreis aitrsthough there is much to be said concerning the staff work at the army exercise the actual work of the three arms and the engineers con sidered separately provoked few criticisms two infantry divisions came in for criticism but as will be shown in another article this criticism wvas undeserved the cavalry division was admirably handled through out the tactical work the fighting mounted and on foot the service of security and information the condition of men and horses the march discipline on the whole and the cooperation of horse artillery and machine guns showed up in a most favourable light both majorgeneral allenbys leading and the excellent training of regiments and brigades the division fought throughout for the army and not for its own hand and its cooperation on the left of the nd division on september  was a model of what such work should be goughs mounted troops with the wlhite force also did well and the cyclists worked in closely with them and performed valuable services so far as the yeomanry were concerned their keenness behaviour and discipline were exem plary but once out of their leaders hands they showed little aptitude for reporting and in the fight they sometimes failed from want of experience on the other hand they were good at the approach marches and their successes notably those of colonel wiliamss north midland mounted brigade at canons ashby and lower shuckburgh show us what can be done by yeomanry capably ledthe field artillery with the divisions came up to the high standard which we expect from the royal reegiment brigades and batteries though weak were in excellent order men and teams a joy to see and the march discipline as always second to none the artillery were forward in action reconnoitred well and early their positions occupied them by welldefiladed marches not easy to observe from the enemys positions and afforded throughout the most admirable support to the infantry one must make an exception of the occupation of the charwelton position by the artillery of the st division on september  a movement which incurred much criticism from competent lookerson the bold handling of the howitzers has become a feature of our tactics and there were many examples of it on september  as for the heavy batteries these were also good and efficient wlhile their distribution and use in any army under sir john frenchs orders always repay studythe infantry were in many cases weak in numbers they were however in excellent order marched strongly and well and preserved under trying conditions their customary light heartedness and indifferenco to exposure and fatigue their outposts wore usuauy well placed and protected sufficiently the troops in rear in action the brigades now manceuvre and shake themselves out in any direction very easily and quickly they negotiate the ob stacles in a close country with the greatest ease and the manner in which the th and th brigades advanced after the capture of ilellidon straight across country and through the fences without hustling for the gaps was a notable improvement upon the practice durinlg themanceuvres in the aylesbury country in  at the same time in some other brigades supporting lines lay out for long under close artillery fire in the centre of grass fields where they were very conspicuous and failedsometimes to make use of all available cover in their approach the firing lines upon occasion were led with more dash than judgment and the need to allow time for building up strong firing lines before the assault was wholly neglected in the attack on sharmans hiu by the rd brigade the value of dash and initiative in war and the great merits of our admirable regimental officers forbid a critic to do more than note these faults which would be all too quickly cured by bullets in war as for the four divisions the writer thought that they were all well led and well covered by tactical advanced guards which were cleverly handled though deficient in protective cavalryit cannot be until the manceuvre report comes out that the work of the engineers can be fully appreciated notably in regard to the signal service but a few remarks are necessary upon the siting and profile of trenches by white on sharmans hill these trenches for the greater part were on the forward slopes of the hill in full view of the formidable brown artillery they were theoretically ft deep and had some slight overhead cover but would have been knocked to bits by artillery in a very short time the best forward position for tienchesnamely along the hedges at the foot of the hillwas entirely neglected and the use of dummy trenches to attract the hostile fire was apparently not considered no trenches were actually dug and the weak staff with white forbids any serious criticism of his arrangements but the inspector of royal engineers might have something to say upon bothsiting and profile of the trenches preparedt for wthte at this important point of his defensive line
