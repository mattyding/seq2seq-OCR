political depression innew zealandtask of the oppositionfrom oltr own correspondlntwellington auc parliament has now been sitting for seven weeks and as is not unusual at the beginning of a session has managed to talk a gieat deal without saying very much the debate on the addressinreply was one of the dullest on record and that on the financial state ment whichl opened two days ago promises to be duller stilla principal cause of this depression is the disorganization of the opposition the party is still hopelessly divided having apparently learnt nothing during the recess except the impossibility of following any of the numerous aspirants to the place vacated by sir joseph wvard nearly  months ago whose rivalry divided the party into as many mutualy hostile sections last session thus by a process of exhaustion the choice of the opposi tion has reverted to sir joseph wardhimself who has been enjoying a wellearned holiday in london while the quest for a successor has proceeded his return to the dominion a fortnight ago was welcomed with a display of enthusiasm which cannot have failed to impress those who still hesitate to accedt his leadership but it is understood that the party in the house is not yet unanimous in the desire to reinstate their former leader and he is wisely declining to show any eager ness for a position which is likely to be pressed upon him with a growing insistence as the impossibility of any other escape from an intolerable situation becomes increasingly mani festedopposriion tacticsthough united and decisive action is there fore still an impossibility for the opposition the position of the partv has improved in at least two respects since last session in the first placeits internal feuds are not so bitter as they were when the succession to the leader ship seemed a more open question and the dissensions caused by the formation and the defeat of the mackenzie govermnienit found repeated public expression on the floor of the house secondly the lapse of a year has enabled the government to make mistakes and to make enemies and has thus provided the different sections of the opposition with common ground from whlich they have occa sionally been able to deliver a joint attack with some heart in it but the lack of leader ship has prevented the party from making the most of these advantages and the net result has not been very impressivethe difficulties caused by the stringency of the money market and the uneasiness and discontent  created in the civil service by the regime of the public service board whieh came into full operation on april  repre sent the most valuable of the recently acquired assets of the opposition if one may take the debates of the present session as a guide as to the first of these points it would be as reasonable to suppose that sir joseph ward could have averted the balkan war as that he could have prevented the worldwide rise in the rates of interest from operating in new zealand for not a few however of the opposition critics and presumably for large numbers of their constituents it suffices to point out that sir joseph ward provided the settlers witli cheap money and that under his successor the renewal of their loans on the same favourable terms has been difficult or imnpossi ble in this case ministers are plainly not to blame for what is laid to their charge in the second case they are even entitled to credit for the unrest at present prevailing in the civil service is the inevitable outcome ot the purge that is necessary for its healththe govemniuents programmethe opposition has also been able to make capital out of certain administrative blunders real or imaginary of the government and its delay in the execution of its promised pro gramme of reforms there is of course no logical inconsistency in attacking ministers for abusing their control of the civil service and at the same time opposing their attempt to substitute a nonpartisan control but the measure of truth that there is in the opposi tions charges can only make any independent observer the more grateful to the government for the extent to which they have abandoned the patronage so dear to some of their pre decessors in favour of an independent business management there is more substance in the complaint that the pace of reform is slow mr allens financial statement which was delivered on the th inst is as sound and clear and businesslike as that of last year but it does not go so far towards justifying the claim of ministers to be the leaders of a reform partyone of the great reforms promised last year has been already realized by the passing of the public service act  but the effect of the commissioners management cannot yet be accurately gauged the reform of the legis lative council which was blocked by the coun cil itself last year is again being very roughly handled by that body and the opposition offered to the measure by one of the five new councillors who were supposed to be appointed for the purpose of passing it has not deepened the impression of the govermuents earnestness in the matter a considerable instalment of the most difficult and farreaching reform of all the abolition of the roads and bridges votes on the public works estimates by devolution to an improved system of local government was definitely promised last session but no bill was introduced and no hope is held out that the promise will be redeemed during the present session a land bill which will carry the freehold policy of the government to its full limit and will not receive much opposition is perhaps the most important of the new measures promised the problem of a substi tute for the second ballot has also to be faced but though the government is believed to be contemplating the grouping of the present singlemember districts and the application of the proportional system no definite statement has yet been made on the subjectnaval policythe governments promised announcement with regard to naval policy still hangs fire but a very broad hint is given by mr allen in his financial statement after a brief refer ence to his conferences with the admiralty and the committee of ixkperial defence the para graph dealing withl naval policy  proceeds as followssome important details remained to be considered and these owing to my departure for new zealand became matters of corrcspondence so soon as these details are settled the government will submit to parliament a policy which will recognize to the full the necessity for one control for imperial purposes will throw upon the new zealand parliameit a more direct responsibility for naval defence and will give the people of this dominion a more definite interest in defence matters and afford them a better opportunity for servicethere is still much to be disclosed but this brief reference goes far enough to dissipate the fear that mr allens aspirations towards a forward move would be completely thwarted by the timidity of his colleagues the premiers statement two months ago that it might be impossible to do anything definite till after the next imperial conferonce was a plain intimation that he contemplated tho possibility cfï¿½ sheving his colleagues proposals indefinitely and a subsequent mention of negotiations with the admniralty was  interpreted in a similar sense but mr allens reference to these negotiations is not regarded as a dilatory pleaespecialuy as he commits the government at the same time to something dofinite aiid hopefulair ailxnqs three pomtsthe three principles wbieli he enunciates are well qualified to reconcile what many peoplo suppose to be the conflicting demands of imperial and local patriotism the policy of the govermnent will safoguard tho singeness of control for imperial purposesbut it will also clothe our parliament wiitlh a  more direct responsibility for naval defence and give our peoplo  a more definite interest in defence matters and  a better opportunity for ser vice taken in connexion with the ministers previous declarations on tlho subject this must surely mean the diversion to the pacific of at any rate a part of our present subsidy and the undertaldng by the dominion of the direct control of one or more of the ships in these waters speculation is accordingly rife as to the meaiing of the announcement that the philomel is leaving hongkong for new zealand but notliing in mvlr allens speeches has yet justified the expectation of anything more than a training ship
