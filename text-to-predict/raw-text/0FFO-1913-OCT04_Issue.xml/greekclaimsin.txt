predecessor reshid bey it is considered possible that an agreement may well be reached on the outstanding points at issue between the two govermments and indeed it is known that such an agreement was reached in principle before reshid bey left athens the real difficulty lies in the revival of the turkish claims upon the islands our con stantinople correspondent has failed to detect any signs of an ottoman demobilization and general savoff wlio is displaying con siderable activity among the diplomatists of stambul and therapia is believed to be nego tiating a turcobulgarian military convention

salonika and hellenic macedonia in virtue of the recent grecoservian agreement on their way to monastir but news from the albanian march is scanty montenlegro appears how ever to be feeling the pressure of the insurrec tioln and further military measures are an nounced from cettigne servia in giving assurances that her campaign would be one purely of repression in servian and not one of

left constantinople this afternoon to join ghalib bey kemali in athens for the purpose of resuming the suspended negotiations with the greek government as hrant bey is known to be of a less con ciliafory natture than was his predecessor reshid bey the outcome of  the negotiations does not inspire optimism in diplomatic circles it is believed that an agreement may be reached on the points left outstanding between the two governments vhen the treaty of london was signed but the question of the aegean islands as being nominally in the hands of the powers is not to be officially discussed so that even if an agreement be signed which may recon cile the conflicting views with regard to the questions of nationality muftisrevkaf the rights of communities the amount of indemnity to be paid by turkey for the prisoners of war it is feared that normal relations are not likely to be restored while the possession of chios mytilene andthe other islands is still a matter of contentiongeneral

by the servian prime minister m pashitch to representatives of the press indicate that as a result of his con versation today with count berchtold with whom he afterwards took luncheon the servian prime minister takes a favourable view of the future relations between servia and the dual monarchy the declaration made yesterday by m spalaikovitchthe former servian minister in sofia who is acting minister for foreign affairs in belgrade to the austrohungarian charg daffaires that servia had no intention of taking possession of any albanian territory and was firmly resolved to respect the decisions of the ambassadors in london formed the best possible prelude to the meeting between the two ministers today the feeling of good will towards servia which l pashitch believes to exist here leads him to hope that the points of difference between the two states will be overcome all political questions he stated to a representative of the tagblatt are solved while on the economic questions he believes an understanding will be reached which will do justice to the interests of both parties with regard to albania he said that servias wishes coincided with those expressed here namely that the decisions of the london conference be carried out in their entirety nothing is further from servias intentions than to defy europe for servia he added the only question was the establish inent in agreement with the international commission of delimitation of a proper strategic frontier he could not however agree with the view expressed here that the albanian provisional government was innocent of au share in the revoltfrom cettigne it is reported that further troops have been ordered to hold themselves in readiness and that no montenegrin liable for military service is permitted to leave
