cotton thrade crisisbolton operatives and theamialgamationrepresentative meetingdemfandedthe threatened lockout in the cotton trade continuos to be the cause ot considerable anxiety which is not rolioved by an inmportant decision arrived at yesterday by the bolton spinners council they have askedfor a special meeting of the amalgamation representatives to be convcned to consider the quostion of roversing the docision of the executive in determining the strike at the beehive mill the local association is to meet on thursday next to consider the question of paying strike allowance until such time as tho amalgamation meeting is convened which it is expected will not be called together for some daysfrom oub corresponderntmaanchiester oct the threat by the employers of a general lockout in the cottonspinning trade should the  spinners at the beehive mill bolton wlho struck work on august  as a protest against the conduct of their overlooker not return to work continues to be discussed with anxiety throughout lancashire the question has now arisen whether in view of the fact that the ovorlooker has been pilloried before the whole country and that everybody knows that his conduct irhether right or wrong has beon the cause of the trouble the workmen ouglht not to return to work in the hope that there will be no further cause of complaint myiembers of tho executive council of the opera tive spinuners amalgamation appear to thinkl that they shonld whilst members of the bolton operative spinners council evidently hold the contrary opinion the men concerned resolved unanimously today to adhero to their former decision not to resume work under the samo contract as that which existed before they went on strike the total strike pay received by the men today amounted to s for each spinner with an extra s for each of his children under the age of  not working this is more than thio usual allowance an extra s per week having been voted some time ago by the bolton operatives association the side piecers and crosspiecers also receive jos a week and the littlopiecers s per week strike allowance the strike pay from the amalgama tion ceases this weekmr w marsland secretary of the operative spinners amalgamation informed me this morning that ho thought the men at the beehive mill should go back to work and that thoy ought not to have come out at all he continuedi guito appr vq of the action the men took in the tirst instance in my opinion when they failed to get their grievance remedied locally they were justified in tendering notices but where i disagree with them is in not accepting our advice to remain at work in view of the assturance we received from the employers federation i think they ought to have been prepared to give the employers suggestion a trial at any rate i amn confident we gave the men the best possible advice in the circumstances i now repeat that advice and shall continue repeating it if it came to the vorst and it turned out our advice was not good the men would always be at liberty to revert to the position they are now taking upthe resolution adopted by the committee of the employers federation on august  and referred to by mir marsland in the above statement was in the following termsthat this comhititee having read the statements made by both the overlooker and the men filnd it difficult to get at the exact truth as they are coatta dictory we however believe that the overlooker hais at times lost his temper and used language whichi he should not have used we undertake to inform the firm that while proper discipline should be observed the men must be treated with proper respect and threats and abusive language must not be used if they expect the support of the federa tionmvlr marsland also told me that he did not think the employers in threatening a lock out were anxious to curtail production in view of the state of trade he addedhe had an idea that on the question of alleged bad spinning the employers were waiting for a favourable opportunity from their point of view to order a general lockout he hoped the members of the beehive mill would re turn to work on monday they ought to test the assurance given by the employers his experience of the case was that where there had boen trouble and such assurance had been foithcoming things had afterwards run smoothly amalgamation pay would cease this week and if the bolton associa tion continue to give it they must be departing from custom though they would not be breaking any rule of the amalgamationlondon painters strikearbitrators
