larkinism iia rival to home ruleprom ocr special correspondedutblin oct mr larldn as representative of a new force in irish politics has become a favourite theme of the prophets  larldnism  has given fresh interest to the suboject of home rule not until ir larkin had displayed his powets over large sections of the working classes in the town did natiohalist dublin wake up to thb fact that in the course of a few months accord ing to mr redmonds promise an irish parlia ment would again sit in college green at least the nationalists of dublin were previously disinclined to speculate as to the use to which ireland would put the gift of selfgovernment and as to the numnber character and status of the parties which would meet in the legislative assembly of the nation peilhaps ulster baffled the prophets one had to wait and see if ulster were bluffing until one kcnew if irish unionists intended to boycott home rule not a sketch even of the future could be made but the possible presence of mr larkin in the national assembly at the head of a labouir if not of a socialist party has given as it were a sudden reality to the prospects of an irish parliament there are those oldfashioned inationealists who invoke the shades of bushe and plunketto reopen grattans iiotse for the oratory of mr larkin seems to bo in tho nattire of an anticlimax it appears after a little reflection that too much has been made of the theme a labour party of the towns in an irish parliament must necessarily be of minute proportions granted that the working classes of dublin have lately displayed a sur prising capacity for independent action whence else in irelancd will come the recruits for socialism  sectarian feeling prohibits a union of the workers in belfast it will take a long time to persuade the agricultural labourers of ireland to join with the urban proletariat in promoting the  social revolution the as sociation of his name and movement with defiance of the church must itself be enough to mako mr larkin an ineffectual figure in rural districts mir larkin has had it is true a limited success around duiblin in setting the labourers in opposition to the farmers but county dublin is not ireland and it is lilkolv that the ideas of the cooperative movement rather than those of  larkinism will be acceptable to the irish countryside the pro blemof the relation of the agricultural labourer to his employer has already engaged the atten tion of sir horace plunketts organizationwhich continually insists on the right of the labourer to a voice in the establishinent andi affairs of the cooperative contnonwealthho rvule and lairknismwe are presently opening an irish parlia ment and ridding ourselves of english rulein the meantime we bring over eniglishmen to settle our internal disputes the moral that is clrawn from this reflection must be a source of anxiety to the nationalist politicians an irishamerican writes to the press to say he understood that all ireland needed was home rule the question is he adds what good is home rule to ireland when dublin the capital of ireland cannot handle a paltry strike of  men without calling on england to send sir george askwith to head a board ofinquiry the uneducated are thinking much the same thought in another way the fact is that home rule and  larkinism  have become for the time being rival notions and it is easy to see how this has occurred home rule had hitherto been associated by the very poor with a condition of material prosperitybut mr larkin promises nothing from home irule he has attacked mr john redmondi angrily in his nwspaper he has accused the irish mps of subserviency to the castle it is recalled that mr w m murphy chair man of the tramwvay company is an esxmp who in the days of the  split  was the strongest of antiparnellites afterwards he became a healyite critic of the reunited nationalist party but today mr murphys press and the official nationalist press are at one in con demning larkinisr the clerical weeklies bitterly oppose the strike mr larkin presents these facts to his followers in order to show that the same forces which destroyedparneil are now at work to destroy  labouralthough it is over  years since parnell died the old resentment still burns in par nellite dublin and it is clever tactics on mr larkins part to draw an analogy between his own situation and that of the famous irish leader at his latter end parnells tempera mental conservatism and lis dislike of violence are needless to remark conveniently forgotten the position of the parliamentary pabtyit is true that mr larkin and his friends call themselves nationalist  they believe in the principle of home rule but not in the men who according to present appearances will dominate in an irish parliament their fol lowers miss the distinction go among the disaffected workers of dublin and you will find that they are considering alternatives who should they back mr rechnond or mr larkin or as they naively put it the liberal or the labour man  ilome rule they think is certain and may do them some good it means in their minds radical government and legisla tion akin to that which the present govern ment supplies on the other hand liberals as recent events have shown are capable of using the police against disorder and this tells against mr redmond were mir larkin to win a far wider vista would open out nationalists will say that discussion of this kind arises out of pure misunderstanding the irish party as such has nothing wlhatever to do with the dispute between capital and labour in dublin its business is to win home rule and it comprises within its ranks men of all shades of political opinion tho significant thing is that such discussion takes place the irish party has demanded that for the sake of unity all problems whicll might make for differences of opinion between nationalist irishmen should be avoided until the time comet wlhen an irish parliament sits once it foughlt for tenant rights now that the owner ship of irish land is a settled question it has no programme not even an agrarian one the period of waiting for home rule has boen too long already tho nationalist farmers of ireland have disobeyed the injunctions of theparty m accepting the cooperative move menta movemeat to which the nationalist traaers of the country towns aro opposod and now mr larkin comes along to tell the nationalist working classes that it is not the orangeman who is the enemy but the nationalist capitalists and the nfationalist middle classesthe oldfashioned nationalist whose senti ment is separatist is profoundly shocked by many of the aspects of larkinism and he agrees with the consetvatives who hold that the dublin workers are being used as a tool by english socialists nothing in his eyes could be more lowering  o irish pride than thespectacle witnessed on the quays last saturdaythe arrival of the food ship from englandthe sinn feiners hitherto bitter opponents of the irish parliamentary party now appeal tothat party to intervene in theo dispute recog nizing in it the  one organized force in ireland capable of commanding obedience they ap prove of the proposal for  a conciliation board before which all questions affecting the condi tions of labour should be brought before strikes are considered but who can guaranteo that thedecisions of the board will carry authority  the irish party answers sinn fein the idea that the english ltransport union should act as guarantors is not to be toleratedhibeirnimans ad tehe tbnspoht unoxowthe relations between mir larldins organiza tion and the ancient order of hibernians aro not calculated to encourage tho peacemakers mr larkin seems to have fallen foul of mdr devlin in belfast and a campaign of vitupera tion and foul language unparalleled in the annals of irish politics is now proceeding between the two bodies mr larkint objection to the ancient order is not unliko mir wffilliam obriens the nation he says includes every creed and no organization can be sectarian and national at tho same time the order is middle class  a stoppingstone for the small shopkeeper and the aspiring politicians its motto  faith and fatherland is inter preted  faith in our ability to secure all the jobs in the fatherland the order replies by calling mr larkin atheist and anarchist it is interesting to find that the hibernians so dreaded in belfast as a secret sectarian society designed for plunder and the extermination of protestants should in dublin be appealing for the support of the respectable and law abiding among the worlking classes if a worker in dublin denounces the transport union you may at once suspect they say that he is an hibernian it is a sordid subject  but when one recalls the important part which mir devlin and his organization have played in recent irish politics it is no longer possible to believe that the irish party is viewing the present position in dublin with complete equanimity it is right however to pay a tribute to the admirable temper in which many supporters of that party have approached the consideration of the actual disastrous crisis which immediately threatens the health and happiness of dublin no ono can mistake for instance the fairamindedness with which professor kettlea nationalist whose party loyalty is unquestionedhas set forth the grievances of both sides in letters which finally blame chiefly not the employers of labour nor the employed but the professional and educated classes who have looked on indiffer ently at the struggle without maling an attempt to create a central public opinion it is another colinexion but i should refer too in conclusion to the valuable sermons on solidarity which the irish homeread an organ of the cooperative movement has latelv preached taking the crisis for text and showing that the settlement of labour troubles is the concern of the whole nation and not merely that of the towns in certain aspects larkinismn looks like a brief madrness in others as it has been the aim of these articles to show like a portent of change in the structure of the public life and thought of ireland
