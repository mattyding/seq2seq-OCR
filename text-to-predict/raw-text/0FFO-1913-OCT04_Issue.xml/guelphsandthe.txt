imperial and foreignintelligenceguelphs and the throneof brunswickrenewal of the controversyfro ox own correspondent  berlin ocr since the betrothal in february and the marriago in may of prince ernest augustus of cumberland and princess victoria louise of prussia it has been thought certain that some how or other a way would be found for the young prince to ascend the throne of brtunswick with sufficient guarantees of loyalty to the emperor but wvithout an undue strain upon the principles cherished by the duke of cumber land and upon guelph sentiment on june  the n orthgermqn gazette at the end of an article denying that the royal marriage could have any influence upon the future of therovince of hanover  assumed  that the federal council would this autumn consider whether there are still any objections to prince ernest augustus ascending the throne of brunswick on june  the same journal published the contents of a letter written to the imperial chancellor by prince ernest augustus before his marriage this letter said that if the federal councils decisions of  and  were repealed the duke of cumiborland would hand over to prince ernest augustus his rights to the government of the duchy of brunswick and as evidonce of the change in the situation prince ernest augustus observed that he had become a prussian officer and had taken the oath of loyaltythie guelph statement of the casesince then there has been desultory discus sion of the subjecton the one side guelph denials of there being any  renunciation and on the other assurances which have recently become more confident that all would be well the federal council is beginning its sittings today but it is evident that the pre liminary negotiations have not been eom pleted and the past few days have indeed produced only a flood of extraordinary guelph publicationsthe most extraordinary is a communication to a rather unimportant south germanjournal the frankfurter nachrichtin it says that before the betrothal of prince ernest augustus with the emperors daughter an explicit renunciation of his rights to hahover was demanded shortly before the engagement was announced there was a conference at karlsruhe renunciation was again proposed to prince ernest augustus whereupon he rose and said for me and my house honour comes first and love afterwards he then left the room but was brought back by the emperors son prince augustus william the engagement was celebrated and published without the question of renunciation being cleared up it being obviously believed on the prussian side that the duke of cumber land would yield to argument there was a meeting at homburg at which the imperial chancellor was present the duke maintained his point of view the marriagee of his son had nothing to do with politics his son could marry princess victoria louiso even if he did not mount the throne of brunswick but a renunciation of hanover had never been made either by him or by his son the vwhole conduct of the business on the prussian side was  obscture on the guelph side it was supposed that all constitutional difficulties had been disposed of and that there was no further obstacle to prince ernest augustus ascending the throne of brunswick fv ithout declaring a renunciation of hanoverletter to the imperial chancellorthen came the publication of the letter from prince ernest augustus to the imperial chancellor the letter had been written at the instance of the imperial chancellor who hoped by means of it to soothe public opinion the duke of cumberland and prince ernest augustus had made it perfectly plain that the letter did not constitute renuciation and the imperial chancellor shared this point of view when therefore the prussian semiofficial press interpreted the letter as a practical renun ciation the guelphs were offended and the duke of cumberland told the guelph leaders that  he reckoned more than ever upon their loyalty and the continuatiqn of their vigorous sup port the guelph proclamations were made with the full sympathy of the duke who how ever after a time recommended the guelph leaders to adopt milder measures as the guelph point of view had now been madt clear and it was necessary to build a golden bridge for the imperial chancellor so thpi he might find a majority for the rescission of the federal couneils previous decisionsthe aceuracy of all these details can hardly be tested but there is reason to suppose that the begimning and end of the story are accurate enough it is said that at the karlsruhe meeting princess victoria lotuse engaged herself to prince ernest augustus and told her parents that she had done soas regards the present situation it is evident that the imperial chancellor is in a situation of great difficulty in a hastilycompiled com mnunique which appears in the berlin lokalan zeiger tonight it is observed that there bas recently been a sturprising tendency in the german press to adopt the guelph point of view that the letter of prineo ernest augustus does not constitute a renunciation of hanover and to demand a definite settlement of the ques tion in the federal council this change in the attitude of the nonguelph press is to be ascribed to the guelph agitation hitherto it seemed quite improbable that the duke of cumberland identified himself with the point of view of the guelph party and it was sup posed that in gmunden as in berlin the letter to the imperial chancellor was regarded ag a renunciation weeks have passed however without any sign from gmunden and so the question arises whether there has been a change of view there also and whether  the results already achieved  are again to be put in ques tion it is  no secret  that in german official quarters the letter of prince ernest augustus was regarded as an adequate basis for a settle ment of the brunswick question and the ques tion now is only whether a further examination of these assurances has been rendered necessary by the guelph declarationsin other words the german government invites the duke of cumberland to make the next move but the invitation must have been issued with rather faint hope of its being accepted
