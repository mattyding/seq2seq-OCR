miigrat birds in auttmnscentes on te southern pathby the early days of october bird life is swiftly changing into its winter phase and even in the calnest and brightest noons there are only a few stragglers left from the summer hosts to make belief that the equinox is not yet past wninter darlness creeps down from the north the gales of autumn roar up from the heart of the atlantic and the english landscape isinflamed by rain and frost into its final riotl of colour before the grey days of silenceand sleep the birds slip southward followving the path of the sun now the great flocks of swallows and martins that were conspicuous in england in september have to be sought far south following the zone of early autumn weather as it sinks slowly from the channel to the mediterranean in september the swallow flocks were massed among the somerset orchards in october they wheel above the yellowing vineyards of italy the circling flocks form the same aerial scene though in so different a harvest setting and manv of the birds from th soft plains of the axe and parret may linger a fortnight later among the richer landscapes of the italian lales both on their southward and their northwvard way swallows move by easy stages though they cover such great distances as long as any region of europe harbours the sunny wveather and abundant insect life of early autumn they are in no haste to flee into the south though a fewl hours of steady flight would carry them from central europe to the african shore they linger until summer is wholly exhausted before they cross the imediterraneantne swallows flaonteven in the course of the desultory and heavyfooted wanderings which replace in man the light and punctual movements of birds the passing of the hosts of swallows can be traced in illuminating glimpses during the weeks from august to october unlike most migratory birds swallows travel by day light though often very early in the morning and it is not necessary to keep vigil in light houses to witness their passage as is the case with the swarms which migrate by night swallows serve as the visible type of all our suinmer birds on migration as they lead them in activity on the wing there are landmarks on their path across europe which are critical points in their long adventure of flight and facilitate their observation by human eyes in the earlier stages of their journey they con gregate along the lines of english river valleys partly following the easiest gaps to the south and partly drawn by the insect food which teems most abundantly in watery and sheltered places the thames valley at oxford is a great gateway from the muidlands to the south and troops of svallows abound in late august and september about tho towns and villages of the southwardflowing streams which cut the chalk of the sussex and hampshire downs thence it is only a short journev to the chief points at which they cross the channel the next stage must be made in one flight they caunot rest or hunt for food in the middle of the sea as they do in inland villages they seem to be conscious that the crossing is an enterprise of special moment and face it with a trace of restless excitement they often follow the coast either eastward or westward till they reach some wellmarked head land from which to make their spring across the waters one favourite point of departure is the angle of dungeness and the bay between its long shingly point and the folkestone hills on sunny forenoons before the end of august little troops of swallows and housemartins can be watched skimming down the shore in easy yet purposeful flight and xanishing beyond the lines of froth on the strand on such calm days they have a fair crossing and show little hesitation or concern they sert forth only two or three together and skim straight across the marshes and off to sea on dark and rainy mornings their passage is more anxious and perplexed soon after dawn large flocks of swallows and martins can be seen wheeling high overhead apparently unwilling to leave the land and uncertain whether to follow the coast line to east or west eventually as the morning grows lighter somne depart from dungeness while others pass eastward to the narrowest part of the channel befdre committing themselves to the seaalpsxe bird passesthe next great obstacle in their gouthward journey is the alps thouglh they can pass so easily over immense distances of land and sea the flight of birds is soon checked wshen they seek to rise the zone of temperate air in which all vegetation and animal life is nurtured is very narrow clinging to the earth in a convex film which even at the equator is only a few miles deep the coping of the alpine wall outtops it and pierces into the upper layer of cold and there are only a few points in this mountain barrier crossing the centre of southern europe where delicate birds can pass without the risk of perishing one of the most im portant passes for birds as well as for men is the great st bernard wllich is a high gap leading from the valley of the rhone in switzer land to the southern slopes of the alps about aosta in early autumn great flocks of swallows and martins are constantly seen wheeling over the vineyards and maize gardens and green irrigated meadows that surroumd aosta and sit thickly packed on wires and cornices in the narrow streets of the old roman towln they collect in multitudes far greater than could be bred by all the valleys in this part of the alps and are constantly reinforced by other parties arriving down the breach in the hills that leads from the pass to the north once beyond that dangerous height where sleet and snow often beat tempestuously in september the path lies fairly open to the south the green subalpine hills and apenrine crests offer no such barrier reachmig to the upper frosts and are breached at more numerous points lhe swallows linger among the october vine yards and pass slowly on until the time comes when they must cross the second sea beyond which lies the depth of africa here we lose sight of them as they pass on into the hot sunshine of the southlem november the recent discovery in natal of a swallow marked in staffordshire sugests that many of our english birds may pass far south of the equator but we do not know their annual landmarks or the signs on that distant roadarrival of noxtnrim budsthe southward movement is not confined to tho delicate insecteating species nor does it by any means always cause a diminution of interest in the bird life to be observed itthe autumn months before the swallows and martins have left their breedingplaces and long before their trooping into great flocks warns us that they are drifting south the brilliant grey wagtail returns to flash his yellow tail by the lowland streams where he sojourns during autumn and winter in brilliance of colour and active grace he more than fills the place of the true yellow wagtail or cowbird which is a scarce and more local species and a summer visitor which vanishes with the swallows before the end of august we have seen the beach near dunge ness at sunrise sprinkled with migrating yellow wagtailstheir breasts doubly gilded owith the level rays streaming across the sea and glistening on the dewy shingle but the first grey wagtails arrive still earhler in the thames side meadows end at ally time during the autumn they may appear on the foreshore of the river in london itself before the last flock of swallows crosses the straits of doverlthe snowy gannet comes down from his handful of breedingplaces in the north to enrich the life of the seas off english coasts all throuigh the winter from september onwards thisbeautiful seafowl can often be seen between the french and english coasts it is conspieuous from its large size and pure white wings which ofstilh it from the grey or brown plumage otadult or immature gulls at close quaters the white wings are seen to be tipped with black and this also aids its identification the gannet or solan goose belongs to a totally distinct family from the gulls and is allied to the corrnorants but it is far more active upon the wing and catehes its pirey of fish by diving headlong into the sea the dive oi the gannet is one of the most striling feats of any seafowl it striles the water with a splash and a gleam of spouting spray its beak is large straight and pointed like a pike and is a totally different weapon from the ribbed and hooked beaks of the gulls although the gannet appears so powerful a bird it cannot hold its own against the masterful tribe of gulls it is shy and vild while the gulls are bold and confident and in spite of its greater size the gannet is often pushed aside by the lighter birds as they struggle for some dead floating fish with which both vary their living diet when they find an opportunityunlike gulls gannets keep well out to sea throughout the winter and do not haunt estuaries and fishing pofts or hunt for flot sam in the shallows along the shore they belong to a group of birds of more purely mari time habits than the gulls and seem to welcome the end of the nestingseason when they are tied no longer to a single spot of land though only a seawashed crag auturnm sets free with them on the seas round our coasts a multitude of guillemots razorbills and pufrins irregular hordes of little auks from the far north and flocks of scoters anid other rarer seaducks none of these birds comes willingly near land in favourable weather and though they are sometimes found inland after a gale few are found on land alive in comparison with the number of dead bodies often cast up on the shore the greatest mortality happens among little aulk razorbills ancd guillemots when long continued stormy weather drives the fish from their usual stations in the shallower water and deprives the birds of food then they perish more from hunger than from the storm they are sometimes cast up by hundreds on the northeast coast each a mere wisp of bone and feathers in seasons when no exceptionally heavy swell drives the fish into the deeps they gain their living happily from the winter sea these are the true halcyons or birds of ocean and only the absence in english seas of the fabled halcyon calmn drives them for the brief breedingseason to the shore
