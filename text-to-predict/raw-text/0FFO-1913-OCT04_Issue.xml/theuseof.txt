the use of ciinematographyint physiologysome recent applicationsprofessor stirling yesterday in the medical school of the university of manchester gave a special demonstration to medical practitioners and students on some recent applications of cinematography to physiologyprofessing himself to be a convinced bliever in the value of cinematography in the teaching of physio logy the lecturer presented first a series of films to illustrate the movements of microscopic animals by a method known as  darkground illumination and to show the protoplasmic movements of amoeba and of some animalcules whieh are propelled by means of ciliary motion the same method was adopted to show the movements of the white cells of the blood of the carp the circulating movements of the protoplasmic granules and chlorophyll granules within certain water plants were projected on the screen the actual growth of the protoplasm of slime ftngi at the circumference of the organism as well as the remarkable reversible movements in the proto plasm itself could be seen by the whole audience the astonishing corkscrewlike movements of the organisms knowrn as spirochaetes which are the cause of many diseases in some lower animals and in the fowl and even in man himself were next shown the circulation of the blood in a small crustacean was also demonstratedthe latest advance in cinematography which is known as  ultracinematography was illustrated in this method the successive phases of movement are slowed dowvn impressions of a movement such as walking running or the flight of a bird are taken at the rate of  images per second and these images were projected in the ordinary mannerie at the rate of  per second interesting films of a man walking running jumping and throwing a stone ns well as the flight of a pigeon were showvn by this method so that the audience could analyse with ease the successive movements of the human limbs in locomotion as well as the graceful movements of a pigeon flving freely in the open air the beating of the heart in the open chest of an animal at its normal rate and during asphyxia was projectedthe movements being slowed from tento times their normal speed so that the succes sive stages of these movements could be analysed by the unaided eyeit is now well known that living embryonic tissues after being cut from the living body can be culti vated in appropriate aseptic media for many days after removal from the body the study of sur viving cecised tissues in vilro has been speciallyresecuted in america by harrison burrows carrel arnbert and others and in prance more especially by levaditi and comandon the lecturer showed a small fragment of a spleen removed from a develop ing chick which was placed in a sterilized culture medium and kept at deg c the tissue lives for many days and the audience could see the growtth of the tissue itself as well as the leucocytes emigrating from the piece of spleen and moving freelyin the surrounding medium a fragment of the embryonic heart of a chick showed the actual outgrowth in a radiate manner of elongated protoplasmic cells into the surrounding medium more than this some of the cells ceased to elongate retract become globular and before the eyes of the audience were seen to divide into two new independent cells as a matter of fact from such a minute fragment of the heart the field of the microscope is filled with fusiform cells in about eight hours connective tissue cells removed from the body have been seen to be grow ing after  days while minute fragments of the heart will continue to beat many days after removal from the bodythree illustrated lectures will be given at the royal society of medicine  wimpolestreet w upon subjects connected with the history of medi cine the first by professor morris jastrow of the university of pennsylvania on  babylonian medi cine at  pm on friday october  the second by professor elliot smith on  the contributions of ancient egypt to the history of medicine at  pm on thursday october  and the third by pro fessor richard caton on  health temples of ancient greece and the work carried on in them at  pm on wednesday december  all persons interested will be admitted on presentation of their visiting cards
