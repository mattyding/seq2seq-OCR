president wilsonstriumphtariff bill signeda blow to protectedintereststhe american people have at last succeeded in defeating the  interasts  and securing a tariff framed in accordance with their own wishes the underwood bill passed through its final stages in congress yesterday and was signed by president wvilson last night for years past american politics have been dominated by the tariff question tho demand for a drastic revision of tho duties originally imposed to protect industries not at that tino sufficiently developed to face foreign competition has long been widespread and intense other presidents before hmr wilson had attempted to give effect to it but all such attempts had been foiled by the political influence of the groups of manufacturers whose interests were at stakewhen president wvilson came into office he had to undertake a task which many felt wotild be beyond his strength he hs suc ceeded and his success is greeted vith enthu siasm in the united states otur washington corxrespondent wlho a few days ao explained the benring of the tariff on british trade comnments today on the causes which have enabled the president to achieve his success and the tasks wlhich still confront himcontrary to all precedent the tariff in tho shape in which it has become law is more in accordance with popular wishes than when it was first presented to congress on april  equally contrary to precedent its passage through congress has been comparatively easy that at the last election the demand for revision had been stronger than ever was doubtless the main factor in this result but otur washing ton correspondent has shown in his telegrams and articles that it would scarcely have been achieved but for the determination the ability and the adroitness of the new presidentfrom ouir onwn correspondentwashington ome before this appears in print the underwood tariff billwill be law the senate finally dis posed of the measure last night the house ofrepresentatives accepted this afternoon the few small eleventhhour alterations which the senate had made and at  oclock this evening the president will sign the completed documentthus the democrats have fulfilled the most important pledge in their platform stripped of the verbiage begotten by tradition and political exigencies the pledge was to turn extreme protection into moderate protection no reasonable thinker ever imagined that tariff reform could offhand be carried further any attempt at genuine cobdenism would have been political suicide the party would in all probability have been split by the pull of out raged local interests and business woould cer tainly have been dislocated it was indeed doubtful when the underwood bill was intro duced whether the rates it proposed would stanid debate so far has always bred pro tectionism the last democratic reform measure the wilsongornan bill emerged from the senate in shape a compromise with the abuses of protection and free trade so neatly dovetailed that president cleveland let it become law witlhout his signaturethe president as party leaderit is president wilsons triumph that the underwood law as enacted will provide for lower duties than the underwood bill as intro duced on al hands he is being congratulated as the most successful party leader since the civil war it is noted that for the first tirme protected interests have been beaten and thata president has been found bold enough and a adroit enough to secure a measure of real fiscal reform president wilson is praised for having succeeded in a task which presidents cleveland and taft bungled and president roosevelt sliirled  this law cries the new york world  was written on behalf of the people the lvorlds exclamnation is being repeated with cotntless variations and to read that section of the liberal press which has no particular axe to grind one might imagine that president wivilson was leading the country to a millennium where wicked corporations will cease from troubling and the masses will pay wholesale pricesitndoubtedly the president and his brilliant lieutenant mr underwood deserve the full measure of their triumplh but foreigners slhould be chary of accepting at its face value the present outburst of optimistic acclamation so far the president has been playing a winning game he found his party dazed by unaccus tomed power and hence unusually lamblike he found the opposition disorganized and ultra protectionism practically nonexistent he was garnering the crop sown by mr roosevelts propaganda and mr tafts political short comings agitation and subsequent disap pointment had made the reduction of the tariff a practically uncontroversial popular demandbut now the spadevwork of the administration will begin currency reform triust legislation conservation the panama tolls controversy all are questions on whiclh the democrats are divided and in which the country is not deeply interested one sees that in the case of cur rency reform the president remains firm in his determination to get the glass bill enacted this session the bill has passed the house of representatives but in the senate many of those democrats who have espoused the cause of the underwood bil most warmly oppose immediate action and are rather restive at the presidents efforts to dragoon them it is doubtful whether unsupported by any real volume of public sentiment the president will get his way and if he fails his prestige may suffer considerably convincingly brilliant as m r wilsons tactics have so far been it remains to be seen whether he can fight an uphill battle and perhaps whether lilke mr roosevelt he can thrive upon what to the ordinary man would be discomfiturepossibile political resultsin one way at any rate the administration will be helped though as i pointed out in a recent message the new rafes are likely tobenefit foreign merchants there is no real expectation that if left to themselves they will hurt the administration either by directpolitical reaction or through reaction uponi business the business outlook as already recorded is distinctly reassuring while iï¿½ the agrarians have been hot against freer trading in food commodities the best opinion is that thbfarmer will contintue to get practically the i present prices for his products and that his dis i content will evaporate the onlv fear is that if pricesthus fail to fall the masses may fcli that the democrats have deceived them in their platform  butthe collective memory of the coutr y is shot in cases of thisn kihdt and u lless other things happen to discreditthe administration the opposition vvill pro bably be rash to count upon any such discon tent probably a number of democratic con gressmen will next year be made the scape goats of sectional selfishness but all will be well with the party as a whlole if the president can sturmount the difficulties that await him in the easy confident manner in wvhich he has availed himself of his opportunity with the tariff it will be some weeks however before the salient ecarnomic and political features of the underwood law come into perspectivein the meantime the chief thing to notice i that the united states are at last weaned from extreme protection that the democratic party under a leader of unisual capacity have for the first time since the civil war done somo thing really constructive and that president wilson will begin the critical period of his administration wvith the prestige of what the coruntry regards as a most brilliant achievement
