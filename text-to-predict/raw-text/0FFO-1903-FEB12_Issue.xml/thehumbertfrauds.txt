the athibert f ji the humbert fadsi from olja own corlondertpais fm iiparisians and in particular a section of the french bar bad awaited with keen interest and even in some instances a certain anxiety the flsb public appearance of the iotorius mme hlumbert and her husband at one o the paris policecourts she was brought up on a charge of malicious prosecution at the instance of m cattani a banker whose impatience was the imediate cause of her flight and the collapse of all her great schemes it vill be remembered that it was an action for usury whith she brought against hi cattaui presumably as a means of keeping him at bay that aronsed the curiosity of the french court respecting the alleged crawford securities supposed to be contained in her fanious safe without waiting for the close of the present preliminary inquiry in the main aetion which threatens to drag on indefinitely with compara tively slight results m cattaui insisted upon the hearing of his own case there was con siderable difference of opinion in legal circles as to vwhether the court rould consider it expedient or proper to hear this case before the result of the prosecution of the rumbert family for fraud had established the existenec or nonexistence of the muchdebated crawford inheritance indeed it is stated that numerous wagers were made as to the deeisiox of the court on this pointtodays hearing has done more to gratify the curiosity of the public thanu many seepties were disposed to anticipate it has furthermore justified the apprehensions excited in certain quarters where it was foreseen that mme hiumbert would talke advantage of the publicity afforded her to draw a red herring across the track of her pursuers in the form of teling insinuations or even invented revela tions out of which adventurous politicians and journalists might be tempted to make political capital it remains to be seen whether the accusatioes made by herself and her husband to day wil fall on fruitful soil but her bold attempt to enlist party passion on her side is fresh evidence of her versatility and skiulthe courtroom today was a veritable crush the crowd indeed was so closely packed that when the defendants were ushered to their places it became almost impossible to open a passage through the stuffy little room imme humbert seemed quite calm and sure of herself giving her age   perhaps but i am not sure with an assurance a little out of keep ing with the vagueness of the informartionm cattaui was then requested to formulate his plaint but his statement rapidly degenerated into a running series of questions and replies between him and the judge he affirmed that he bad never exacted more than  per cent from the humberts but his somewhat technical ex planations vere of a sudden interrupted by mme hianbert who burst forth  gentlemen i am much pained by what has taken place by the harm that i have done my friends and all the persons who have been in relations with us the thought makes me cry day and night but it ought to be well known that cattaui is the cause of everything he is responsible for our fall and for all our sufferings but for him we might restore our situation for il np asien dirrdparable quand on tit honnitement but god will judge cattani and punish him as he deserves yes godwhereupon mime hubert with extraordinary volubility explained her relations with m cattaui affirming that he ually lent money at  per cent interest sometimes even going up to  or  per cent m cattaui protested but mme humbert was not to be suppressed  i have had to do with a good many usurers she said  but never have i known one like him he was implacable i have never seen anything like it the audience burst into a laugh and mme huinbert eneouraged gave the reins to her temperament and was off at a wild gallop as followsi am telling the truth yes the whole trulth at leugth wearied and exhausted and finding him absolutely lacking in any sort of con sideration i was driven to prosecute him realizing that such people have no sense of honour from the moment when m leydet began his preliminary inquiry m cattaus sole thought was to remove his account books particularly those containing his transac i tions with us when i ascertained that these books were about to be despatched to cairo i told my brother romain to go immediately and inform the suge dinstruction wee were informed that it was m fernand crmieux ensenator for the department of the gard who had advised m cattaui to put those documenfs in a place of safety as a matter of fact we lad been put into communication with the fatherinlaw of m crmieux by m cattani a domiciliary visit was ordered and when cattaai heard of it he three times sent us a messenger and forwhat purpose  to beg of us to withdraw our plaint ah he then became very accommodating he aceepted all our conditions i sent romain to him he was shown in immediately and the two came back to me together on seeing me cattaui rushed forward and tried to seize my hand and kiss it he was pale very pale and quite off his head he pleaded with me in the nameof his wife and his daughter i was touched by his supplieations and went to see m lgydet to whom i related what had taken place i told him what was expeeted of me and that in return he would give me back the loof or f worth of securities which ke had avalisdes that he would advance me a milion and would pay au the eosts the magistrat replied  youhave nothing more to do with this man he is in the hands of justice besides who can guarantee that he will not deceive you again  he promised us to return those securities but he has xnot done so on leaving mi lydet undertook that cattaul should not be arrested but he stated that the prolecution must take its course it did take its course and cattani kept none of his promises and has had a nonsuit in his favour ah icoutezrni bien m cattaul i would far rather at the present moment be confined in a dungeon cell than be occupying your placethere followed a passage at arms between minehumbert and mi cattaui and during this duel  she found means of implicating mi valic the minister of justice who vas mi cattaujs counselin the former action brought againstby her  i shall not say anything more today the big trial will come on soon and then i shall speak of m vali i shall teu him what his fees were as for the other persons enough has beenx said for the momenthm frdrichumbertsdeposition was a violent attack on m crdmieux and a fresh effort to implicate xo van  ah il cattaui knows what can be got out of political venality said m humbert but every one in the audience recalled that the speaker had been arrested in madrid by the very mhinister vhom he thus sought to com promise the presiding judge of aburse checked hil munbert but ho beganuafh and the judge then had absolutely to stop bini he took another and more roundabout way of rpach ing his goal this time affirming that the govern menthad
