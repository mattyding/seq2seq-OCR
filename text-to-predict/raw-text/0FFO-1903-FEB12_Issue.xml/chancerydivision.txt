qatharine grahaim the tenant for life named inx the last gift died on april h  under these circum stances the first questioni ariseswhat estatet did erlizabeth and william grahiam take inx the houses respectively devised to them tnam ofopinion that they tookc estates tail the general rule of constructioni is wvell settled and is tliustnted in fearne con rem attvage  butwe are to xemember howvever that although a devise over after a dyig wrout hirsg is inlenemlvoldyt this tide is not without exceptions fot t tht person to whom the ijimitation over is made he a relation of and capable of being collateral heir to the firs devisee in that case the fhmt devisee takes oziy an estate tail because the ilimitationi over to tho tollatoral hieir plainly denotes that only lineal heirs could have been intended but it is arguecd that the rule is confined to the ease where the object of theo gift over is or maay be the collateral heirb and that in the present case it is obviously impossih e that the children of a brother who survives his sister or of a sister who survives herbrother can ever be heirs to the predecessor but the rule is mierely anirle of constructioli not a rule of law and has been estabdlished to give effect to the intentioxn for reasons aplicable to the present case thus in inottingha v jennings   fw  at p  iord hiolt says  i agree if the devise over had been to a stranger it had been void end b had talken a fee simple  hut in the present cae the word heirs can import liotbing more thant issue  for bow could he pjossibly dlie without heir living the other brother  lathiepreseitt case i ask tho same qluestionhowv could either elizabeth or nvilliami die without enx heir if the other surrived  but the gift over assunmes the existence of the onle at the death ot the other end the title of the heirs of the survivor is contingent on evidence of survivorship of their ancestor if it is absurd to suppose that thetestator meant heirs general in a gift to a and his heirs becanse he has given the property over in the event of failure of heirs geitersl to ae rson who may be such heir generaliti equaly absurdto suppose thaithemesantheirs generai whenth gift over to a stranger is sands to depend on the existence of one who is or may be heir generalstatnd after the total failure oheirs general in my opinion the rule as stated in fearne may be amplified thus if the person to whotm the limitation over is made be capable of being collateral heir to the first devisee or ifth evenit on which the gift over is made necessarily depends on the existenico of a collateral heir of the first devises on such isst devises deaththe flrstdeviseetaileonldy anestato tail the nextquestioniswaat is the mian ing of the words the survivors heir or heirs  i do not feel at liberty tozalter the menning of the wvords and to rend them as if they were  heirs of the body it is axgued that the testalor has throughout this doctmient used the word heirs vwhen he meant heirs of the body hut ths is by force of the several gifts over under the rule of construction to which i have already referrd in this case i have no gift ever and the word i heiri is not a flexible word like ilssue  wvhich was the word inx be birkrs   ch  the gift was conitingenlt onx the death of the survivor during the lifetime of the tenant for life for neno est hores invenltus and if the teusnt for life had died first the gift would hazve failed for want of al particular estate to bupport it but in the event that has happened it has taken effect end i can find nothing to justify me in altering the plain meanini of the words the alternative phrase iheir or heirsis too narrowv a foundation to buildi en argumenft upon mlr russell relied upon ismipson v ashworth  beav  hut in my opinion the reasoning on which lord langdales decison is based has naplicaio to the present case the will there cotie lvrgfs to sons and daughters and their heiswhcbvrteo the rtie aboveraentioned ware heldtbegfsital and then there was a gift over of a dagtrctaies share  to my sons and daughtersthtavhershe end share alike lord langdale hel that the testator intended the same quanutity of estate to go over whicht he hiad given in the first instancethat is be inferred from the fac that all the original gifts were to the sons and daughtexs in tailwas intention tha th share of a daughter given over in the event of her death w vithout lawful heirs wvas given for a simiilarestate but ihave no such indication of intention in this case the heirs of the survivor are not objects of eny prior gift in order to make lord lanagdales decision apply the gift here shoiild have been to the survivor his or her heirs or heirinstead of to the heirs or heir of the survivorbefore mni jusracs bucnasvin ths acion asmnended the
