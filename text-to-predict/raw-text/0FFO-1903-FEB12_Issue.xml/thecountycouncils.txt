provide the floating balance necessary to carry on the administration of the actload wsnloux chairman of the east biding county council said there was a strong feeling not only in his own county but in a great maany other agricultural counties that it wvould be extremely unfair to place the cost of bringing in this now leducation act upon th shouaders of te ratepayers in his opinion this charge should be taken from the ratepayers and placed on the shoulders of the taxpayersmr e loabhousei mp vicechairman of the somer set coanty council said there would be equal opposition to the levying of an excessive rate in the first year acil to borrowing by the county councils ln either case they would alanrm tho ratepayers and give a very bad start to the now education system  and there would hb a danger that in many counties the elementary schools and csptcially thoso schools which had not hitherto had any aid from the rates nvould be starved the deputation would like to have some authoritative opinion as to whther it wzas in the power of the local authorities to levy a rate in anticipation of the ap pointed daylord clifford of chiodleigi representing thedevon county councilsaid that all the grants due for the year should be put into one lump stun and a certain portion of that lump sum paid to the local anthorities quarterly on an estimate of what would be the

vibart dixon deputy clerk to the ivest riding county council also spokemr long said this matter really affected the board of education more closely than it did the local govern ment board sir w anson would tell them what the board of education proposed to do the municipal cor portions brought this question before him somne time ago and he admitted ten that the difficulty existed that it was a serious difficulty and that it had been created by the action of the government in changing the administration of edacation therefore the responsi bility rested upon them of linding some way out of the impsese in which the local authorities found themselves mr hobhouse had asked whether in the opinion of the local government board a localauthority could levy a rate in anticipation of the appointed day ie wvas advised that it would be legal so to dosir w anson said he could only deal with that which concerned the education department the question of a loan and advances for dealing with the difficulties of the local authorities could only be dealt with by the president of the local government board be under stood that a desire had been expressed bv some of the speakors that a new system should be started bywvhichpaymentsshould be made up to dateforthe present year and in advance for the next year that would be a matter to be dealt with by the chancellor of theexchequer and he was afraid it could not be brought into effect during the current year he understood that tho difficulty had mainly arisen in respect of the voluntary schools that the local authorities would start vwith no money in hand because w hat accrued up to the appointed day woulc go to tho managers of the voluntary schools then there was the general difficulty that no money was paid to any school until the end of the school year therefore the local authorities had to find the money for current expenses and there was no money coming in until sometime after theso current expenses had fallen due and had to be met the board of education could only deal with the money which parliament had granted them for the current year and he would tell them what the board could do to assist the local authorities in this present diffaculty oa the appointed day or soon after so much of the now ds aid grant as would be due during the ensuing financial year could be paid at once if the appointed day was late the managers of the voluntary schools would take so much of the old aid grant as was du o p to that date and the new local aithority would take what wvould fall due between that date and the end of the financial year that the board thought ought to be a vory substantial assistance to the local authorities at any rate during the flrst months of their work the next thing the board could do was this tvbere there was much of the school year to run after the appointed day theboardwotldbeabletopaythe amnnal grant quarterly andnotvwait until the end of the school year they could thus assist the local authorities bh payin tho aid grant in advance and by a quartorly payment ot so mueh of the annual grant as was due after the appointed day and up to the tnd of the school searsir j hibaertis it to be payment in advancesin w ansox said the grant wvould be paid quarterly instead of at the end of the year thefee grantwould also be paid quartorly and he hoped that would be a financial assistanoe to the local authority there might be a gap between the end of tho school year and the begirming of the new financial year vhen tho now finaaiicial year began they might be ablo to make some arrangement for the further assistanco of tho local authorities all ho could say on that occasion was that the practice of paying the annual grants quarterly instead of at the end of the school year was one which they could adopt and should bo heady to adopt for tho convenience of the local authoritiesmr lnoe siid he would try to supplement the wvork of the board of education by a somewhat similar opera tion ho thought the local government board could expedite by two or threo months the payment of the grants to the viarious county councils out of the local taxation account that ought to assist the local authorities in reducing the immediate deficit some calculations had beaenmado of the effect of these pay ments in eacb particular district in some cases they would almost entirely meet tho difficulty but in others there would still remain some gap to bo filled up how that gap ought to be filled up was a matter they must consider it might be done by over draftsvwhich would be sanctioned by the board or in two or three other ways he could not allow the ques tion of the distribttion of the cost of education between the imperial exchequer and the local exchequer to be ro openedany demand of that kind had on that occasion been supported on very slender ground because it was per fectly clear that this debtwhich would be incurred by bringitg this att into operationwas one which woud disappear in the coukso of time tie was giad to hear from the representatives of the county councils as he heard from the representatives of the boroughs that there was lnt one desire in the minds of the great maority of them and that wvas to give effect to tho act to the best of their ability sand make it a saccess if thoy possibly coulds wv anson explained that practically the whole of the new aid grant could be paid within a few days of the appointed day and if any local authority obtained more of the four shillings than they were entitied to the amount could be adjusted in the ensuing yearsir j ijabbart in thankidng mr long said he still thought it would be better if possibleto borrowa certain sum of money and allocate it to the diflerentauthorities ho asked whether
