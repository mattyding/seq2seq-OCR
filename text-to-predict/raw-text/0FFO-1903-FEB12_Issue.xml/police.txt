clmrge of conspiracy but as the case proceeded there would be specific charges of obtaining money bv false pretences and one or moro of the prrsoners vould be charged unler the debtors act with obtaining creditranc the nscheme which was the subjectmatter of t charge had been in vogue since november last year and was similar to that which formed the osubjct of a charge against another company a few weeks ago the parker pen company sent out circulars to a number of persons offering them home employment at a remunera tion of l a week for three months and s a week for expenses a condition precedent to the appointment was that the applicant should peurbase one of their los d pens the employment consisted of writing ten letters a day to friends or acquaintances informing them that they could obtain similar employment on application the company reserved to themselves the right to cancel the agreement at the end of threo weeks if insufflicient business resulted dealing with one

explaining that by the terms of the agreement the salary was to begin at the openng of the second week and was not payable until the end of that week a very care ful examination of the agreement showed that that was correct but tho wording wms very confusing and at first sight it appeared that the salary would be paid from the first week no more money was ever sent to this correspondent but when ho next applied for his remune ration he received a circular letter informing him that owing to information which had reached the company concerning unscrupulous correspondents in future persons would be paid at the rate of  for overy six pens which were sold as a result of the letters which they sent out the correspondent did not continue writing his letters and although he had expended s d on the pen and s in postage the only money he received back was the s the evidenco of three persons who had become corre spondenta for the company and not received their cmoney having been taken the
