latest intelligencemr chamberlains tourpeeiung in cape colonyllom o wlq colixspondetgrahamstown feb no change could be more complete than that which meets mr chamberlain in nrriving at grahamstown straight firm bloemfontein instead of a dubch centre which had collected for the occasion not only thosenwho somewhat sullenly profess loyalty but the more irreconcilable element as well the colonial secretary iluds hiim self in the midst of an essentially british com inanity in cape colony eloquent with suppressed indignation at the straits to which they consider that the loyal section of the population has been reducedthe feeling cannot be better ilustrated than by the address presented by the inhabitants of the town and signed by the member of the legis lative council and others this memorial to the government and especially to mr chamberlain expresses thanks for the energy and frmness with which the imperial government undertook the defence of the cape and natal referenceis made to the good services renderel by lord milner to his fram administration during thewar and his wise benevolence shown inthe reorganiza tion of the new colonies ihe petitioners consider that it would be a great calamity if his labours in the task of resettlement were interrnpted they are of opinion however that there is cause for grave apprehension with regard to the future peace of the country conciliation which might be a right policy in the case of an outbreak caused by real grievances canot be applicable awith regard to the recent rebellion which there was not a shadow of grievances to palliate but which arcse from a long cherished design to establish an independent dutch republic of south africa that clesign continues the address has by no means been abandoned whatever professions may be made to the contrary the machinery political and ecclesiastical for its promotion r emains intaet and its promoters are emboldened by past impurity for this reason the suspension ot the constitutioa is urged as a remedy refer ence is thea made to the course of the last political session and the defection of the ministry to the bond the loyalists it is declared look forward with dismay to the continuance of bond domination the remedy is not easy to specify but in the petitioners opinion it can ultimately be found in federation this must come from without and it is suggested should be embodied nla o perwssive haperial a ct finally it is urged that the cape should not enter federation as a whole but divided into two or three provinces attention being drawn to the sharp distinction of race eustoms and sentiment existing between the eastern and western provincesthat the british or loyal section of the colony have every reason to be dissatisifed with the present state of affairs is obvious but it is doubt ful whether mr chamberlain vill be able to hold out to the petitioners a hope that their requests will be granted the separation of the eastern province always remains a politieal possibility and wiu never be lost sight of and it is well that mr chamberlain should realize how strong is the feeling here in its favour but until the resources of his statesmanship have been exhausted in the effort to bring the dutch of the cape into line the colonial secretary is not lilely to entertain seriously the question of secessionlatrathe main points of interest in bmr chamberlains speech at the banquet given this evening at grahamstown were his references to the bond and his pointed remarks concezning the financial obligpations of the colony one thing is patent to all said mr chanberlain  after a century of british rule there is still a considerable section of the populationwhich is entirely unsympathetic this unfortunate and unhappy state of afairs he said is due to a propaganda which may have beenno doubt has beenhonestly conducted but with mischievous results and mistaken objects this object has been to exalt racial differences with the result that it has put the dutch and british inl opposition to one another which is quite unnecessaryno one will doubt that in these few words mr chamberlain accurately gauged the past history andpresent objects of the bond in spite of the reorganization which it is supposed to have under gone that reorganization however one fears was only undertaken in order to facilitate the extension of its propaganda into the new colonies mr chamberlain in thus declaring his opinion of the bond before reaching its stropghold at graaf rzeinet and paarl ought to have cleared the way to a considerable extent for an understanding between himself and the dutch in cape colony before he leaves africathough hiting at the possibility of a financial contribution towards the war from the cape the colonial secretary did notgo further than to point to the present prosperity of the colony the cape being in fact the only selfgoverning colony whieht as a colony has profited by the war individuals might have suffered but the budget of the colony could show an enormous surplus he did not forget the capes contribu tion to the nsvy but reminded the colony that its � was not sufcient to keep a cruiser in commission for sin onths and that the annual cost of the south african squadron was �with these words mr chamberlain left the matter to recur to the subjeet one may suppose at a later opportunity wve know what is the colonial secretarys cherished ambition whether he will realize it before he leaves the cape remains to be seen but this much is certain when liperial federation is an aecomplished fact and regular contributions to the upkeep of the empire are made by the various colonies the oreditof the idea will restwith mir chamberlain and his visit to soxth africa wi have materially hastenedits constunmationgrahamstown fam lidin has speech at the banquet tonight lmr chamberlain referringto the racial differences in the colony said that they were  hindering the prosperity of the country and destroying opportu tmitses possessedby hardlyany o counxtryte face of the earth he continued my object is to secure in this colony as i would desire to secure it in every colony where there is more than one white race a fusion of the races to make the two peoples into one nation withsimniar objects and aspirations and not to exaggerate differences whichafter allare moredifterteces of sentiment than of material importance ail my lifetime i have found that many things have a curious habit of coming out very much as i expected i have a sanguine conyietion that we are assured of the loyalty of the new colonies there may be still difficulties to overcome and room for consideration on both sides any assumption of superiority by the british element would be fatal to that good feeling which we desire to see established but i do not believe that in the minds of the british there is any idea of claiming such a superiority as equals we invite our new fellow subjects to share in the woik of government and as equals we believe they are prepared to enter this community of action i i am right i desire to impress it upon this colony that you ate everyday losing your position if yo u do ot follow themovement which is certail to take plce in the rest of south afric i am spealdug w itbtaj regard to race wvhen i say you i mean the whole of the inhabitants of the colonyare you going to be the only colony which is divided against itself  are you while uion is wityoun gapand in my p pinon is certain to be obtained in the new coloniesinstea of follow ing theirgood example to

tha nifrn e tto which we all belong comprisig a popalation of  million people an area of  pnilau square mils and a large ptoportion of the cultivable area of the world it isiota jftatter to boast of because there is always pre�ent to me the enormous responsibility of us all we have a mission of work in the world we are not given this empire for nothing and if we do not discharge that miission the empire will fall to pieces like the great empires of the past and be forgotten or remembered only for its mistakes    we cannot escape the responsibility of empire last year xglaids normal expenditume not for the varr but for the defence of the empire was � the war cost something like � towards whichb a contribution is being made by the transvaal which is well able to bear it we vill bear it but there is a limit to this i say not to you alonei hope my words will reach all the slfgoverning colonies thatwhile they are beginning to appreciate the privileges of the empire and its obligations they are not doing all they ought i am speaking in a colony which the other daywit the greatest apparent willingness and cordiality voted  a year towards the naval expenses of the united kingdom which amounted to � laughter we have have not looked the gift horse in the month we adiiiirethe patriotism which agreed to that vote and aceept it as an acknowledgment of the obliga tion  i am not going to criticize though when i saw a statemaent in one of the south african papersthat the cruiser good hope was our cruiser  i could not help remembering that � a year would not pay for that cruiser even for six months of the year laughter the ost of the south african squadron specially devoted to the protection of south african interests is � per annum i know that wvhere there are many interests ones first duty is at home patriotism begins in small things until it takes in large notions of responsibility i shall be told this is all very well but the dutch will repn diate an interest in the obligations of empire i doubt very much if that is true because my hope for the future is based on the expectation and belief that the dutch will become one people with us and wyill feel the same  pride in the empire which will be theirs also we say then put aside the past you must feel that any aspiration for a separate dutch nationality is absurd and ridiculouls put it aside if you ever entertained it we will forget provided that in the future you look forward with us to the same objects and have the same ambitions and aspira tions among the deputations received by mr cham berlain today was one from tfle dutch section of the kings subjects in the districts of albany alexandria adelaide and fort beaufort stating that they anticipated with confidence the most beneficial results from mr qhamberlains visit they thanked him for preserving the constitution and said they would endeavour to justify his good opinion of them they asked for the liberation of political prisoners they could not claim as their right that these should be released but felt that cleilency exercised on their behalf would not be aisplaced but wouldbe appreciated they re ferred to the attitude of a portion of the progres sive press which they said misrepresented factspmom our own corspondentport elizabete fxb mr and mrs chamberlain accompanied by the governor of cape colony arrived at port eliza beth at  ocloek this afternoon and were received at the station by the mayor and a numerous com pany ineluding representatives of walmer cradockand ulitenhage after introduetions had been made the party drove at once to the feather market large crowds lined the streets and the utmost enthusiasm prevailed as the colonial secretary passed the feather market a large arched building was throniged from end to end and must have contained nearly  peoplemr chamberlains appearance on the platform was greeted with terrifc cheering renewed again and again and it was only with difficulty that silence was restored in a few words the mayor welcomed mr and mrs chamberlain to the town ind the clerk then read an address addresses vere also presented from birmingham men the loyal womens guild the inhabitants of cradock and ultenhage the good templars of eastern south africa the indian community at the cape and the coloured people oo cradock mrs chamberlain vwas then presented with an album of views two bouquets of slowers and a bunch of ostrich feathersmr chamberlain in his speech went straight to the point although he may not have said enough to please the extremists among the audience he left no room for doubt that he was keenly alive to the present situation things he said were not altogether satisfactory but the cape was a selfgoverning colony and the remedy was in the peoples hands rather than in his they would have to work out their own salvation he was prepared to recommend a spirit of conciliation but there were things which he could not concede things which he would no askothers to give above all mr cham berlain gave it clearly to be understood in this part of his speech which appealedmost to his audience that he was not going to be led away by spurious pretensions on the part of any sections of the population if the dutch of the cape were prepared to followtheexample of their fellowcountrymen in the new colonies and loyally accept the situation he was ready to trust them but this would not be the case if at one moment they expressed a desire for reconciliation and the next spoke of loyalty as a crime and talked of forgiving those who had been loyal to their king and country again as regards the rebels who might bave been misled if they were now ready to accept the situation ready to say  there shall now be a new chapter of peice and reconciliation opened in south africa they would find the british ready to meet them halfway but there must be no question of persecuting or boycotting those who had been true to their sovereignmr chamberlain is confrontedwith the hardest part of his mission in cape colony taough his presence may do much to remove misunderstand ings it is to be feared that his visit will be too brief to clear away the animosities which still exist at least amoug one section of the peopleport elizabiiem fb ilspeaking here today mr chamberlain in referting to the war said  the issue has been tried out ald decided and it has been accepted as final in the new colonies of the king nothing has been to me more satisfaetory in my visit than the temper and spirit of those wvho so lately were our enemies and wlki now believe are in process of becoming our fast friends
