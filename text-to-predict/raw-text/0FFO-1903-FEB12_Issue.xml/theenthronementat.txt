council and a number of privileged persons to each of these were offered bunches of lilies of the valley which in accordance with a tradition of recent origin are regarded as the canterbury flowers it was halfpast  when the sound of the music of the volunteer band without made it elear that the moment of real interest had approached and in a few minutes the proceedings had begun in the mayors seat

webome persolly as their foremost fellowcitizen oaly afew years ago he the mtayor enjoyed the samprivilege of welcoming the late arclh bishop and even at that momet his mind travelled back to the day when dr temple ade his first official entry into the city th most cordial relations had for manyears existed between the ecclesitical and mumicipil elements i their community but by taking up hs residence among them and by his noble conception of the dulties and responsibiliti of citizenship dr temple exorcised a social inflne of inestimble value in further promoting those feeligs of mutual good wil ad sympathy it was in that sipirit of felowcitizenshi that the metropollalcal city of englandwelcoaed dr davidsonthe recorder then read the fohowing address from the citizens may it please

seal this ilth day oflbruary c gsoacx czastt mayorthen the mayor handed the address whieh had a cover of purple velvet to the archbishopto this the archbishop made that which it may perhaps be permissible to call an appropriate and humorous reply addressing those who listened sas mr mayor and fellowcitizens of win chester a mistake wheich wvas greeted with laughter and for which his grace nmade a neat apologyhe saidit was certainlyin noconvntionalwy that he fromisis heart thanked them for the totally unexpected warmth of welcome vwith which they had greeted him on his arrival that dayunexpected not that he had any doubt what canterbury felt on a day like that but because one had scarcely looked for so erlthusiastic so long extended aud so emphatic an expression of what they felt should be the welcome to one who had come to take up the task which had in the providence of god been laid upon him hie doubted whether they adequately recognised how much it meant as a fact in the worlds liuethat that kind feeling should be happening there that day it was a very big thing albig factor in the life of the english people whom they now felt to be the central people in the worlds life it was an important fat that itshould berecog nized as one of the duties of the represeatativmof civic authority to welcome him on whom was laid the responsibility for tho moral and the religious good not only of the citizens of our great country but also of those who lie far afield it seemed to therm obvious and a matter of course that something of the kind should be done but of course it was not obvious when theythought of it a very short journey from canterbury a short passage across the straits of dover would bring them to one conntry after another not in one land alone whore this kind o ceremonywould be practically an imcossi biity his grace thus proceededit is well forito romember what england owes to long traditions which subsisted from the early days and have remained unbroken umtil today and which have rung so somud ea arswer liko the strolm of a bel of the purest metal on an occasion like this when ve are calued upon to do something vhich belongs to us both our workisin common and we are recognizing day by day what it means that those on whom these respobilities lie should discharge them togethor and have that cordial friendship which is charactoristic of our english life today t is of good omen for the future that we should ee such a sight as the streets of canterbury presanted this afternoon lit is of good orn for the future and i thank god for the accomplished fact it is in harbmwith the best traditions of english life long ago ady think there must be in tbir roomthosewhoremember how my great and revered predecessor archbisho benson usedito dwell uwrn the link betweenthe civiolid the ecclesiastical sides of english life how that the first charter granted to tb city of london in the days of william the conqueror was addressed not only to the bishop but also to they port reeve the wordin as far as i can remember ran thus i luism theking to william the bishops and to gosfrith the port reeverace and benedictiui that kind of linking togother jsgong on stillw aitd i trust for many years to come it will remain in a tts entirety if i may smy what to me is the most strikiisg and stimulating factor n the sortof sight that we hae seen tonight and the ceremonythat we are going through now and that we have to go through in a yet more solemn way tomorrow itisxthe anote of exprocuincy which rings through itthe high

as i maintain that the citizens of curgreat cities and those who lend and guide them exeact very much of those set in high places inour nwionnal church and look for much at their hands mav w not feel that we of the national churchand outsidbtwe rational chrurchtoo to whom is entrusted in somespecial way the religious and moral welfare of the people of england have a right to try to help those who
