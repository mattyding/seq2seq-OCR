the special edbucation committee may consider expedient after the scheme has been con sidered by the board of education a brief account of the scheme was given in tlte times of february  admiral brand said that the special committee was not in any way the future educational authority of the county and therefore they could not for one moment prophesy what the future educational policy of the county would bebut they hoped and believed it would be largely influenced by the educational expert whom they asked the council to coopt on the committee since the formation of the council no duty of anything like such magnitude had been undertaken by it they had up to now simply carried out some of the duties of quarter sessions and had had little odds and ends given to them  hut now they had to deal not onlvwith the � or b they had hitherto dealt with through the technical committee but with a sum of not less than � per annum of eoiuse a lasge proportion of that was covered by government grants but it meant that the committee would be a large spending body he hoped they would be very careful before they added to their work for the education question would now tax their energies and capabilities to a great extent the mayor of briglhton alderman buckwell seoonded the resolanion and it was adopted unanimously flintshiro count council in common with the carnarvon and one or two
