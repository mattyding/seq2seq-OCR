the nw wadmiraljty schemfrom a naval engines point of viewy a prrmqpser vvnfwt y every engineer worthy of the name naturally looks upon his profession as second to none in importance in the present day nowhere perhaps is such egotism more pardonable than in the navy where the engineer feels that on engineering depends not only the mere propulsion of the ship but alsq gunnery torpgdo electricity and practically everything else where  materiel  is eon cerned  for the same broad principles under lie allnamely the application of the mechanical laws of nature to the matter in hand and the utilization of the  materiel  provided by nature to the same end theengineer in his egotism calls this engineering that lord selborne and the present board of adraialty should have decided officially to recognize that such is the case must be a matfter of personal congratulation to every engineer fficer in the navy the broadmindedad decidedmannerin which the altered conditions of our naval service are treated under the new admiralty seheme seems finally to set at rest the vexed question of the status of engineering in the navy and gives to it that place which the engineer thinks it meritswhen some time ago the board decided that in the future gunnery and torpedo lieu tenants were to be held responsible for the care of the mountings and machinery of the weapons over which they had charge engineers though fully agreeing with the principle viewed the change with grave distrust were the gunery and torpedo lieutenants competent to take tbhe responsible charge of these delicate and in tricate pieces of mechanism  the engineer feeling that the five or six years spent over his technical education had been none too long to make him competent to cope with the pro blems involved somewhat naturally questioned the competence of other officers who had re eeived practically no such engineering training the uew scheme electualay settles the ques tion the gunnery and torpedo lieutenants will be competent for theywill be trained engineers but there must be no makebelieve this engineering training must be thorough in the hands of the present board lies the suc cess or failure of their own plan the inception of the whole  scheme  is so thorongh that one cannot but feel assured tlat in detail it vvill be equally thorough the line between triumphant success and hopeless failure is but very narrow and the key to that succesz is thoroughness without this thoroughness matters wil be worse even than at present the oficer must be able to direct his men even in the smallest detail and to do this he must know that detail himself a thorough engineering training is a groundworlk on which each and all of the several branches of specialist knowledge raay be quickly built up the mathetnatical knowledge incidental to this engineering training is also necessary for a real mastery of navigationwith regard to the management of menhas the recent history of the modern navy tended to show that the engineroom department of our ships has been mismanaged  is the dis cipline of the engine room much inferior to that of the deck  the general experience tends to prove that this is not the ease every selfrespecting engineer officer tries to administer his departmenta very considerable one numericauy in these days of high powers and high speedsvith the least recourse possible to the  powers  of the executive for very obvious reasons  but he does this by the arrogation of an authoritynot given by the kings regulations a stoker  in the commanders report  means the greater part of a forenoon wasted to the chief or senior engineer who can ill afford the time yet the work of the department goes on fairly sntisfaetorily and the  defalters list  does not contain an undue percentage of engineroom ratings this result has been achieved by omcers who have had no training in the control of men as the averaeo assistant engineer of the present day has never given an order in his life until put in charge of a  wateh  in the engine room in his iirst ship it mnst be remembered that these officers have been and are still vworking in the most dis advantageous one might almost say the most impossible circumstances they have had no real power they could not enforce an order they were not ex eeutive officers acnd yet records prove that it has been done what can the logical mind deduce but that the engineering training in some way helped to bring about this result by cansing the mirnd un consciously to look for the wvhy and wherefore which must be understood before any real grasp of the matter can be obtainedan analytical habit of mind in fact  this in any walk in life is a valuable asset so how can the time devoted to its attainment be looked upon as vsasted even supposing that as some may urge engineering is tunnecessary for the nonspecialist executive offieer or the marine that the system of common entry and com munity of instruction wll overcome many of the disabilities of the present arangement cannot for one moment be doubted though the wisdom of the policy of making the system of nomina tion universal may be open to question even at the early age at which the cadet will enter many boys will have already showi marled aptitude for engineering but such boys may be debarred from becoming nayal officers by the impossibility of obtaining a nomination good results may confidently be expected from the new system of training the four years course at osborne will teach the boy theuse of tools and the rudiments of engineering that part of the two following yeaxs at sea which will be spent in the engine room will teach him to apply this knowledge and his intelligent inquiries into the problems of engineering will be to a great extent answered by the further com se at eeyham the few special men selected for a further course of college study from whom vill be drawn our future engineersinchief and their advisers should have absolutely the highest possible training the world can give owing to the altered conditions of life in the navy of the prbsent day the early acquirement of the  seahabit of such vital importance in the days of masuts anl yards now sinks into com parative insignimicance and the substitution of shore instruction for seatraining in the earlier stages becomes a matter of relative unimportance from that point of view the board wll of course when the time comes offer suitable inducements to ensure that a suffieientnumber of the best sublieutenants shall choose the engineering branch of the servicethe provisions of the scheme for the transition period are obviously necessary and suitable but one is tempted to ask will parents allow their sons to enter as engineer cadetswith the prospect of belonging to a moraibund branch of the service what will be the ultimate fate of the engineer cadet who enters during this transition period will he become a lieutenant e or will he remain an engineer lieutenant  with regard to the present engineer officer it would be premature to attempt to critieize a scheme the details of vwich are not yeb known but engineers trust that these details will considerably modify the scheme ts it now stands onisundry points notably the sentence  but no changes will be macle in their uniform or in the regulations which define their duties or in the provisions of the naval discipline act it seems a somewhat barren honour to be styled engineer lieutenant or engineer rearadmiral wearting the stripes of those ranks but ininns the  curl and still vithout the officiallyreegnized power of directly enforcing an order in his own department the carl  may be a small matter but tbrough  training and familiarity it is looked upon by the man on board ship as the outward visible sign of authority the authority itself however is by no means a small mattbr the naval engineer has long felt that such officially recognized authority is absolutely
