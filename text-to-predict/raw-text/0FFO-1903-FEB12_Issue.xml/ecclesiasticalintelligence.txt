adds  the bishop of london wrote to say that he would come down to the dinner in the hall of st johns college tho difficulty presonted itself that he must of course be asked to make a principal speech and he was regarded as a hardheaded and hardhearted intellectual machine admirable in its proper place but not quite in its proper place wvhere gentune sympathy and real warmth were the notes which it was desired to strike the bishops speech was a revelation sympathetic beyond any other of the several important speeches delivered on that occasion with a de warmth that mastered the control of the muscles of the speakers throat it left an ineffaceable impression of a heart as greatas the great mind the writer then refers to another most marked feature of the late archbishops characterhis

state in the columns of the tima the claims of the brisbaino cathedral building fund on the generosity of membors of the church of england  at the request of the synod of the diocese comprising among the lay members some of the best men of business in south queensland the bishop felt it his duty to come to england rather more than a year ago to plead the cause of this fund with his usual energy and selfdenial he laboured regardless of fatigue at the task imposed upon him throughout  until early in becember he was struck down by a most severe illness from the effects of which he is only now slowly recovering to a considerable extent the collection of funds hasbeen thus hindered just at the moment when the bishop had hoped to have been able to make a largo additioa to the sum already received lthe erection of brisbane cathedral designed by the late lir j l pearson ra to be a simple unadorned but spacious building invested with the dignity produced by just proportion is rot a luxury but a necessity the building erected in  the year of the foundation of the see which is now used as a cathedral must be demolished next december as its site has then to be surrendered in exchange for one in every way more advantageous to the offective working of so large a diocese as that of brisbane its areais  square miles a strong contre of worship and work is of tal importance even under existing circum stancesa practical demonstration of its value has been given by the ministrations and evangelistic activity of the cathedzal staff but the present cathedral is too limited to hold the congregations on any great oeeasion and for important services it has been foumd necessary to hire a large concert hall though even there the accom modation has proved to be inadequate for tho number of worshippers and to bring the spiritual forces of the church of england which in queensland numbers  per cent at least of tho population to bear upon the national life of a young and fast growing state particularly in the capital city of  inhabitants is from overy point of viow a work of the highest moment his majesty the king has contributed  guineas to the fund of which he has

saints from lord lninngton formerly governor of queensland aliberal donation has been recoived it may be added that the building is intended as a memorial to queen victoria to be an expression of thankfulness for the blessings of her reign it is proposed at present to erect the choir and transepts accommodatng about  worsbippers at a cost of � leaving the nave and towers to be com pleted in future years in this undertaking the co operation of churchmen at home maybe reasonably claimed on many grounds between the old country and queensland commercial relationship is close many thousands of square miles of queensland country are hold by british shrreholders of london financial institu tions while many thousands of unpropertied emigrants have at the expense of the queensland oovernment been taken from theso shores up to the present time four fifths of the contributions amounting in all to about � have been given by persons connected with queensland but the recent drought unexamnled in its severity in the annals of the colony has ciuminated in losses which for the present must prevent the most willing helpers from attempting anything boyond the maintenance of the existing church organization an additional sum of � is needed out of vhich the bishop is most anxious speedily to raise at least � for without that sum building operations cannot be com menced and the purpose of his
