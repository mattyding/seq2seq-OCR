position within musket shot of the shoreand ber anchoring and grounding were the signal for the firing of the first shot from the fort it was not however until the second shot had been fired from the battery that the brig replied and then the conflict began in earnest th gons of the battery and of the brig answered to each other in quick succession while a smart mausketry fire was kept up cn the brig by the smallarm patty who lined the wall overlooking barnpool this fire was replied to by the riflemen stationed in the brige tops it was not long before the liberty took up her posie tion and joined in the fray and then the sealark was seen coming up behind the other two to her anchorage the firing waxed hotterandhotter the de fenders of the earthworks appeared to feel that if the third brig took up her position their case was hopeless accord ingly they redoubled their exertions to prevent her doing so all efforts in this direction were however vain the sealark dropped an ancbor and

leading boats of the column bad hardly effected a landidg when the battery again began firing and the boats had to retire in confusion the lads who had landed just managedto save themselve the brigs then again opened fire and after some more vigorous exchange of compliments a section wvsdesipatched to attack the left flank of the battery this artifice drew the whole strength of the defenco in that direction and while the conflict was raging there with the utmost vehemence the main body of the boats was enabled to effect a landingon the right flanlc and under cover of the wal to drive the defenders from their guns and finally to chase them up oer the hill the flag was then hauled downu from the battery amid the cheers of the lads on boardthe brigs who fillet the rigging and manned the yards their cheers were redoubled when the flag of the assailants was hoisted a march past followed itsas agreed on all hands that the boys worked anduirably thronghout and that the brigs were handled
