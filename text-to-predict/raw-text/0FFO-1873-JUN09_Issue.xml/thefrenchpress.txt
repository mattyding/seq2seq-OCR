 thb frevoli pbesfruom out own convboxndmqtiparis junz irritability is the privilege of defeat and we need not wonder if the tone of that part of the paris press which gupported the thiers administrtion some times betrays bitterness at its ejoetion from office and still more so at the means by which its overthrow was accomplished if this be both intelligible and excusable the same cannot be said of the scurrilous abuse in which a certain section of the press of the coalition indulges towards the expeued holders of office and towards all whom it is pleased to consider their friends and supporters it is only the older among us who remember when such ribald prints as the satirist and the age were tolerated in england it is long since they ceased to exist killed by the right feeling and improved taste of the british ptublic a combination of those papers with the worst specimens of the american pressjournals seldom or never imported into englandwould give a product very similar to somo of the french papers of the present hour which revel in indecency and slander and find it impossible to credit others with highier motives than the base incentives by which they themselves are actuated it is almost an honour to be abused by such journals ani it would be a degradation to receive their praise if the present government to which there seems now that the effervescence of the conflict has subsided every disposition to show fair play gets discredit it will not be from the attacks of those who may differ from its political views while respecting the personal character of its members but from the outpourilngs of vulgar spite and jealousy which daily disgrace the columns of certain papers that profess to give it their support and even claim to express its senti ments it would be doing them too much honour to name them and i shall not afford them that gra tificationthe principal provincial organ of the legitimists the lyons dentrazisation which has at times been honoured by communications from the great chief of that party the comte de chambord himself yes terday published an article signed by the comte de sarcu in answer to the qaestion often asled by conservatives when reproached with leaving the government to bear the whole burden of the struggle instead of aiding it with all their might in the present contest between society as it exists and the destructive influences which seek to undermine it  what can we do  is their reply  de sarcus undertakesto tell them considerin the noral atmospliere of the time in france he ihinks it useless to exhort the conservative party to show  that objective virile and positive energy met with ia so high a degree in the anglosaxon race tlhere every man has so proud an opinion of his own personality and such a respect for the law that how ever high the social position of an englishman who sees the law in any vray attacked by a member however low of the mob which we should translate in french as la canaile he does not hesitate to put himself forward either in actsor words as the determined defender of legality and of outraged society of our french conservatives long accus tomed to trust for defence to government inter ference and nho when their purse their honour or their existence is assailed put their hands in their pockets and call for the police we will only ask a neigative kind of energy they are not to be urged to  god but only to abstain from evil in the first place they are never to buy a revolutionary paper as they now too frequently do and that section of the press will thereby be weakened and probably will decrease they are never to buy anything at the shops of those whom they know to belong by their opinions to the opposite party they are to reserve thleir money for their political coreligionists and do their utmost to starve out the enemywere such recommendationa as these met with in a professedly humorous journal they might seem dull drollery but they strike one as exceed ingly comical when gravely put forward in this rloyalist and clerical paper if the advice of the dgcentralisation were seriously acted upon it would lead to strange signs and inscriptions over french shopfronts were custom to be granted not to the dealers in the best wares but to those whose poli tical principles were tho purest the grocer would write over his shop epicier leiitirniste and the devout baker would decorate his door with the portrait of his patron saint wve should have orleanist tinmen and imperialist tailors and as the opposite party would naturally in self defence adopt the same system radical hatters would hang out the cap of liberty and communard butchers would slaughter their sheep at the sign of the massacre of the hostages however excellent the intentions of the decentralisation it is not by the puerile devices just alluded to that it will strengthen its party and serve its country but rather by sacri ficing antiquated aspirations which can never be realized to a spirit of truie patriotism anid to mode rate and conciliatory views it is to be feared that the prvjudices of tho most exaggerated section of the legitimists will seriously impede that absorption by the present government party of the more mode rate members of the left centrewhose cooperation is indispensable if tho de broie cabinet is to cease
