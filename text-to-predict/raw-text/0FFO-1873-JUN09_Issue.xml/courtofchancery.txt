registrar decided that tbe messrs peacock were bound by the composition from this decision they appealedr do gexqc and mr c browno were ior the ap pellants mr lloxburgh q and mr brough were for the debtorlord justieo mellisbl thought that the costs were a debt provanble in bankrnytcy by virtue of section  of the act lie thouzht also that it was a debt to which the provisions of section  as to composition applied and that the creditors could have voted in respect of tt at the meeting if necessary thc meeting might have been adjourned till the anmount of the debt had been ascertained by taxation but he thought that if the creditors were satished with the esti mnate made by the debtor of tho amount of their debt there was no reason vhv they should incur the perfectly useless expenso of taxing the costs and signing judgment they were entitled to wait and seowhotherthe composition upon the estimated amount of the debt was tendered to them in this case his lordship was perfectly satisfied that the debtor did not intend to tender the composition on that amount for he thought he need not do so till the creditors had come in and proved their debt his lordship thought that there was nothing in tho act or the rules requiring them to do this in the case of a composi tion but that the composition was to be ipsid on the amount of the debt inserted by the debtor n his state ment upon the footing of which the creditors voted at the meeting of course if a man had been inserted as a cre ditor by mistake when there was no debt due to him that could be set right but in this case there was no mistake this being so the case was governed by the decisions in  edwards v combe and  be hatton and the tender not havirg been made the creditors were remitted to their original rsghts and nvere entitled to the fall amount of their costs of the actionlord justice james conourredel papte bishopfl re tnwtfthis was an appeal from a decision of the chief judge in bankruptcy and it

liquidation appealedhir dogeqc and mlr john linklater argued for the appellant  mr fischer qc and mr wvinslow ap peared in support of the order of tho chief judgelord justice jaatsis said the chief judge thought that this case was not within section  and his lordship could not bring himself to entertain any doubt about it it was not within the words or the intenton of the legisla ture this was one of the commonest forms of a covenant in a marriage settlement and if the legislature had in tended to make it void they would have said so in plain terms the intention of the section was to prevent the settlement of property to be acquired at a futuro timelord justico mfllish was of the same opinion the section was aimed at such cases as a covenant to settle a particular estate when it should come to the person who entered into the covenant or a covenant to settle any money that might be left to him but it did not apply to an actual settlement of a mere debt the appeal must be dis
