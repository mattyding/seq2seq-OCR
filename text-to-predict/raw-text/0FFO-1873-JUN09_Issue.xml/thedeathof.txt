vf atzgmionou w coubbspondempais jm the death of ulrbano rattari is the event of the day and most of the parispaners find more or less to say about it  a sketch of his poeitical life will be more appropriately sent from rome than from paris but a few words respecting him may not be out of place here from one who has known him for many years and been in frequent intercourse with him at some of tha busier moments of his eventful career few mern have hal warmer friends or more bitter enemies but the latter were not all of his own making an unfortunat marriage was the bane of the last ten years of his life there aro certain things italian rancour never forgives and in that country little respect is shown to the private life of public men on his own accountrattazzl oughttohave had none but political enemies for personaly he was a most amiable man gentle and courteous to all with whora he was brought in contact ee was generaly liked by the foreign diplomatists accredited to the court of italy who became acquainted with him durig his brief periods of offic others wee prejudiced against him by the sstematically con temptuous and abusive strain in whichacertain set of political men in italy ever spoke of hiu readily accepting and propagating the most libelous inventions and circulating them through their organs in the press he had his weat nesses like most men and some of them were of a character peculiarly damacing to himselfl his natural good natuire often prevented his repelling the advances of persons who souaht him only for their own advantage and whose indifferent repute was to a certain extent reflected udon him while his own strict integrity has nover been impugned even by those who liked him least he has been accused of too readily believing that others were as honest as himself and of rejecting evidence of mal practices this is the most serious charge of the rind i have heard brought against him bnt such charges are easily made and the malignity of party and personal hatreds was ever on the alert for a pretoxt to defame him it is truly remarkedtoday in a paris paper that he was superior to his reputa tion superior also to evil fortune it washis usual fate to take office at critical moments and more than once he incurred the blame of others faults he has been inveighed against as the man of novara of aspromonte of mentana at one time cavour held him in high esteem and warm friendship and some will remember the emotion with which he dlolored the loss of his cooperation when rattazzi resigned the mnistry of the interior in consequence of theresults of the general elections in  cavoer wanted a stronger majority the clerical and conservativeparty was then formidable in piedmont rattazzi was accmsed of not having  managed the elections well fortunately there was a large nunberof second elections cavour took them in hand and  managed  them better the great man who laid the foundations of italian unity was not always scrapulous qui vent lafin veut les tnoysa was his maxim rattazzi had to go and was not consoled by the pathetic accents in which cavour spoke his funeral oration as lvnisterphysically zpeaking rattazzi was the frailest of the frailthin and pale and sicklylook ing he had altered little in the last ten years his personal appearance must be well known from the innumerable caricatures that have been published of himhis slender lean upright figure his small closelytrimmed moustache glasses stuck upon his nose his thumb and finger fre quently closed upon a pinch of snuff the usual expression of his face was grave and thoughtfal if at times there was a slight satirical curve about the mouth the expression of the eyes wa genial and kindly and he had a fmnk straight forward way of looking at one either from illluck or bad management he was apt to get into the wrong groove in politics and was driven toally himself with men of radical tendencies whereas his own were in reality much more conservative than many are likely to believe he was not in any respect a firstclass man and hadl he been so he would have been the only one in italy since cavours death but it may be doubted whether he did not combine many of the qualities of a statesman and a parliamentary leader in a higher degree than almost any italian public man he has left behind him he was only  years of age and he did not look so old but he was of weakly constitution and frequently ill during an illness he had this last winterhis medical men thought they discerned the symptoms of an in curable malady and the result has proved they were not mistaken
