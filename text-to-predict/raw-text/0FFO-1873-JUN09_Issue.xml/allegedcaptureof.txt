while these columns have been march ing the seistan border has been the scene of dis turbances and the result of both on uninformed opinion in centru asia is thus stated by a paid and unotficial newswriter in cabul aumost everv one is alarmetl at the rumonrs which arei afloat it is said that the persian troops are encamzped at seistan and merv shabjehan thlat the british are at peshawvur and  hikarpore and that tbe iussians alre advancnog on ihiva afganistan is in the centre so that ifanj one power marched against the another that country would not be safe the people fenerallv vish for

extension of the czanrs power hii asia m veninkof frankly admitted that these steppes wouldsoonenter within the limits of the rus san empire and mnake the mountains of khorassau their line of frontier lint he subsequently uses this signiticant language when describing the roate from asterabad at the foot of the caspian to hlerat  properly speaking thisgreat trade route lics beyond the limits of turcomania within those of persia but it is in a strategical sense the most important of all even with respect to the tnrcoman country alone which it flanks onl the south the distance between the two places he puts at  miles the route passinfrom asterabad through budjnur cw miles and kmeshed  miles equal to  stages through a populous country the occupation of khiva must result sooner or later in russia doing forthe law less iurcomans what she has accomplished for the khirgis and ultimately in making this route a new base or line of advance for further operations imless we neutralize persia as it stands just as we have done in the north of afghanistan even in shere alis lifetime the restless spirit of ihis son yakoob khan and the misrule of the persans all along the new seistan border will always make it diliciult to renmove excnses for in terference in the territory of herat and furrah wshich were such a source of trouble to oost miahomed togo no further back shere ai has just reason for the discontent which he does not care to conceal with the seistan boundary settlement arranged by sir f goldsmid and lord gran ville he has zot too little and persia too mnuch for the award i believe went on the prin ciole of giving persia all she had abstracted during a series or years ending on a certain date there is too no natural feature which forms the frontier line but even if shere ali swaauows his annoyance or consoles himself with the oxus lboundary on the north nothing is more probable than that ou his death herat and furrah wliu strike for that independence which has alwavs em barrassed tus during the last halfcentury ancd has been the cauise of more than one war a bad feeling between persia and afghanistan will weaken both and tempt the interference of russia lf it was inmportant for lord mayo to secure as he did the oxus frontier it is far more necessary for lord northbrook and the foreiogn office now with out delay to see that the ehorassan frontier of persia is so guaranteed as to run eastward and cover the wshoe country including merv fromn the atrek to the oxus at kogah seleh running just to the south of the th parallel of latitude in truth the afghan boundary should have been fixed not at kogah saleh but at kerki further down the oixus colonel lthuilier frs the surveyor ieneral of india has just published a useful map of the countries betwieen india and thecaspian sliow in the boundaries of rnssia persia ehiva the turlkomans and afghanistan up to marchhlast the atrek appears as the northern boundary of persia but the line to kogah saleh is made to bend to the eouthward so as to leave mero to the turkomans although that place has been so closely associated with the whole history of persia sassanian selju kian and more recentit turns out to be true even of british bnrmab where the capitation tax has rendered an annual coruputation of the people necessary that a regular and carefully conducted census shows the people to be more

before the iiiindoos who are  strong other races make up  of the whole  are male and  female the slight dif fcrence is doubtless due to tho number of temnporary male immigrants from india thanks to the labours of the american baptist miissionaries wih dr judion at their head the christian popu lation is comparatively very large and chiifly in the more recently annexed province of peguwhich has more christians or  than all the hindoos in the whole of burmab i mention these facts because of their curious political relation the inumber not only of our tubjects but of the christ ians would be greatly more but for the idea industriously spread by the king that the english mean to restore pegu to hiin this is officially re ported as the greatest qbstacle to the spread of christiauity karens
