conferencein  the report of the subcommitteewhich wts received stated that whatever might be the ultimate rsult of tlhs steps which would have to ba adopted with re fereace to the valuations the committee felt convinced that theirpublication would prove of inestimable value to the societyandwould be the means of inducing tho menbers to consider the best remedy to be adopted to place the society np aj a proper financial basis andi show it to be what it had lecaso ruquently designatedone ofethe best friendly socie ties in the kingdom che committee also called the atten tion of the meeting to the important question forming tho sabect of the sixth clause of the directors bepor they deeply sympathized with the position in which the insol vent districts and lodges are placed and were of oginion that when the more fortluate of the districts and lodges observed a loyal desire and an effort on the part of the in solvent branches to redeem their position by strictly ad lering to the financial rules of thelsociety the members of the unity generally would raly to their assistance and shoxw to the world that the society was not only a unity in name but in reality a union of mem bers amociated together for the mutual benefit and support of themselves and famies the committee urged that the mceting should pause before adopting that portion of the directors report having reference to a unity levy to forna a nucleus to be applied for the benefit of sach districts and lodges until the whole question had been discussed throughout the society the report was received and adopted after a fewsdight alterations in the evening tucre was a complimentary banquet at the burdon hotel sir frederick johnstone presided being supported by the borough members lr hambro and ir

ren der every assistance to the friendly societies billshen introduced into tho hfouseof commons on wed nesday the business of the committee was confined to dis cufsing that portion of the directors reportin reference to the means to be adopted for placing the order in a solvent condition the report stated that so far as the order was concerned the establishment of welldefined rules to re move deficiencies ws a responsibility cast lupon the annual miovable gommittee from which it could not escape if the mlanchester unity was to be saved from general dissolution or from bein reduced to isolated clubs the finaucial remedy was eo ar as the future was concerned but to remove the deficiencies in the very poorest districts was a task of no small maguitude branches absolutely without capital whose existence was of no value to their clembers must pass away or be placed in a workable state in such cases tho very smallest funeral benefit must at once bo adopted and a better rate of sick relief establishedas sistance only to be afforded by the unity to such branchesus have proved to have conformed to the regulations adopted by theannual movable committee with the object of piresenting to the world at no distant time the spectacle of a society of half a million of men basedlupon sound prnciples with the meains to redeem all tho promises reade and with the increased confidence thus gained to extend its usefulness the directors suggested as the method by which the manchester ulnity could he orought into a solvent condition the reduction of the funeral benefit in pour districts and lodges to the smallest nmount consistent with a decent interment theincrease of the sick benefit to at least a useful amonut and of the con tributions to such an amount as cant be fairly paid by the members the deficiency then ascertaiued to be gradualy extinguished from a fund to be raised by the authority of the annnal mlovable committee for that purpose  but that no lodgo or district should be entitled to assist ance until it had conformed to welldefined roles to be prescribed and sanctioned by the annual movable committee in providing the mneaes it could not be expected that districts which had acted upon a sys tm of selfdenial enforced in many instanucs with gret diiculty upon reluctant zand sometimes ungrnte lul or unreflecting memaberss would part vdth their surplus lsudly won to give to those w ho it might be wsere to be foiaud in districts where employmnent was readily obtaine d na hi jigily remunerated nor would it be wise to alttempt to dini nish a dcficiency by a ntere shifting oe canital froma etiit to west or fron north lo south the means must bepplied from the pockets of the members of their great uglnt thus increasing the w ealth of the society the ex priment might be tried by ordering a levy of is per tmumber to beraised bycharging to each membersaccount the srmall sum of d at the commencement of each year fortwo yuars tbis wouldraiseootl it mibhtbeaskedif they would ieclude the imporerished districts in this levy the answer vs thlat they would for it must not be forgotten that niaough a lodge might be poor itsmembers might be in far letter circumstances and possess larger meaus than the ruembers of the wealthier districts the directors neither rejected nor accepted the responsibility of ad vising the plan thus shadowed forth but the experi neunt of tvo years juuicious applicatioa of the funds thus raised would show the impression to be made upon e ficiencies by the combination of help and selfhelp a l according to the results obtained future annual iovablo cominittees might decide upon the further a plication of the same principle it might seem shullv inadequate to attack a delicieucy of upwards of one mllion sterling by a levy calculated to raise but oool lit the directors believed that the greater portion of the d iciency would he extinguished by lodges possessing a cosiderable capital voluntarily reducing their benefits or increasing their contributions snd that the assistance pro lpsed to be given could only be sought by the older loeiges tat were redaced to the condition disclosd
