defendant formal evidence was given as to the purchase and consumption on the premises of a cer tain quantity of spirits the question involved in the case and tho legal point to be decided will be seen in the magistrates deciston mr knox said the whole case turned on the constraction to be given to a certain portioa of the th section of the act which was tothis effect  tlhe grat of a new licence by a borough licensing committee shall not be valid unless it is confirme by the vhole bodly of borough justices who would if this act had not passed have been entitled to grant licences or by a majority of such body present at any meeting assembled for the pur pose of conhrmiag such licenaes the framters of the act by a defnition in the th section had given as an answver to the question  a new licence means a licene grunted at a general annual licensing meeting in respect of premises not theretofore licensedfor the sale of intoxicatin liquors now the th section would hel still further because in it would be found a statutory dcfinition of the wordis  intoxicatin liquor those words must be taken to sacan  spirics wine beer porter cider perry and sweets and any fermenated distilled or spirituous liquor whiclt cannos according to any law for the tibe heing in force bhlegally oldwithout a licenc from thecommissioners of inland livenur njov what were the facts of the case it was adfnitted that r codlia actually held on the th of muarc h s when the lcence vacs g rantel to him which formsed the sutject of this contention excise licences which included cider perry spirits arid foreig wines this heing so the three licensing maiis tratesoa the ofarch grantedhimalicence which uo doubt had a form of confirmation at the back of it mot filed up the question was did the licence require confir mation by the whole body of borough justiees if it did ur codlin mnst be convictedi if not no conviction could bh made following tho phun words of the statute be held that such confirmation was not necessary sir cod lini premises were licensed for the sate of intoxicating iquors therefore the licence granted him in march  could not be regarded as a new licence lie thonght this view was confirmed by noticing the distinction drawn ia the dealiutions between  a licence   a new licence  tho reneval of a licence the legislature must be talen to have meant something by the words a new licence and the construction ho put upon this was surely not incon sistent with the context be was quite aware that this view of the act was in opposition to the construction hitherto put
