a gardey party at sohinbburnleoir our austrian corrnzpondintvienna jux certainly far more than the burg the imperial palace in the town schiinbrnsn is the place at which to dispenso imperial hospitality the former built at various periods with additions and adaptations as necessity arose or money was in hand is a rambling structure with no end of intricate passages th chateau of schnbrunnison the contraryof one style and dates from a period the middle of last century when people taught by versailles and its many imitations all over europe knew well what a royal residence ought to be from the iron railings cuuning blacksmiths work such as you do not see in these days of castiron through which you pass into the roomy forecourt flanked on both sides by the apartments of the household officers and ser vans rooms the buildings rise up before you until they centre in an open staircase supported by a colonnade which leads up to the great gallery from which the apartments radiate off on both sides they occupy the entire ground floor of the main building so that only the two wings remain for living in the wholo suite was opened yesterday evening the great dining hall the reception hall and the ceremonial hall for what was to be the great fete in honour of the czars visit first a theatrical representation then an illumination of the gardens and fireworksfor once the weather was propitious after a maost enjoyably warm dayperhaps the pleasantest we have hada balmy mild evening followed witlh not a cloud visible in the skies the days work was over at  pmand everyone seemed to bo glad to idle in the streets and gaze a few moments at those who were lounging in their carriages towards schnbrunn to take part in the feto directly or in directly for besides those who haa received invi tations to the chateau a number of tickets had been issued for the gardens which were closed to the eneral public in the evening but not less interested and amused at the whole proceedings eeemed those who were altogether outside all along the road to schonubrunm most of all in front of the railings people were looking at those happy mortals the gentlemen in almost every huropean uniform end the ladies in every variety of toilette and look at them moreover without apparently a shadow of envy it was a thing rather puzzling to the greatest connoisseurs ofniforms to find out who was who but the vienna people are never at a ioss for such trifles and one or another soon found out that this man in the feathered hat was some wallachian prince and the other with the many crosses and broad red or blue riband across his shoulders some royal personage from portugal it was how ever a busy time for the guard at the entrance gate of the chateau and above all for the drummers so many were the imperial royal and other high nesses who were passing by and for every one of whom the guard was caued out once or twice ac cording to his rank the emperors having alone the honour of three calls they had dined in town nnd came like the rest to the feteso that the public could see the whole court passing by the emperor alexander had been rather unwell and had to give up his intention of going to the exhibition in the mnorning but he had sufficiently recovered to take part in the fetethe theatre as regards architecture is the weakest portion of the building where everythintg clse is in such good proportion rooms passaces staircases windows and doors the slightest imper faction must needs offend the eve to build a small theatre for about  people who are all to see and to hear so as really to look pretty is a probleum which probabiy never has been solved people seem nlways to look out of proportion to the size of the place in this casemoreover probably owing to the shape of the place allotted for the theatre there is too much depth for the width there being  rows cach onlv of  seats while the centre of the grand tier is occupied by the state box on both sides of which a gallery extends above are two boxes like pigeon holes and likewise a low gallery on both sides but the theatre which has tnot been used since  when his majesty of prussia was here has been cleaned up and looks quite fresh under the brilliant illumi nationwhich sheds not only light but heatoverall the ilaze the pit on au these occasions is allotted to the gentlemeowiththeexception of thehighestof theoffl cial and court hierarchywho linewith the ladies and the diplomatic corps the main gallery on both sides of the state box allotted to them the pieces performed by the actorm from the court theatre of the harz were two comedieslvhile those inside were oppressed by heat amid their splendour thosewho had been admitted to the gardens were enjoying the delicious coolness of the evening which enticed more than one truant who could get away from the theatre unobserved to ob tain a breath of fresh air few places more delight fuil than these gardens can be imagined with their thady alleys of elms and limes forming a leafy arch above on a fine summers evening as that of yester day certainly was the thickets right and left of them are favourite resorts of the nightingale thrush anrd every other kind of singing bird of these latitudes and they seemed also to be holding a fete of their own yesterday evening no wonder it was the first summer evening after a spring un usually ungenial and dismal lt was as if they wanted to emake up for lost time and relieve their harmonious throats of all the notes the chil and the rain had checkedthose of your readers who havebeen to schonbrunn may remember the large parterre which extends in the front of the chateau for about  yards and at the end of which is the basin surmounted by a group of neptune with his tritons while behind it rises an abrupt hill on the top of which is the  gloriettea light structure of arcadescommand ing a fine view all over vienna tbis had been chosen as the scene of the illumination there was indeed an idea of extending the illumination to the two alleys which run diagonally right and left one to the obelisk and the other to the menagerie where the parrothouse forms the end of the view but the idea was given up and attention was con centrated on the parterre facing the chateau right and left the parterre is bordered in the style of french gardens by a wall of elms about ft in height while the parterre is divided into four grass plots on each side each plot having a shrubbery in the centre and eight flovrbeds on the sides the idea followed in the illumination was evidently to bring out these horticultural features so alongside the leafy wall on both sides chinese paper lamps were hung marking the boundaries of the parterre while the shrubbery in the centre of each grassplot was surrounded by a pyramid of lamps and every flowerbdd was ornamented by three lamps the centre one rising above the others the effect was rather pretty than grand the mellow light of tho lamps mixing with the moonlight but you felt eomething was wanting and that something was the illumination of the grassplots if the outline ofthese had been marked by rows of lampsthe whole design of the parterre with the three roads and the transverse roads leading to the alleys right and left would have come outfar better as it was a sortofmysterious chiaroscuro reigned all over the place which harmonized perhaps better with the soft moonlight but which was not effecetive as an ilu mrinationsome  tickets had been issued to the gardens but the visitors scarcely filled the large parterre most of them seemed eager to take advantage of their privilege early ansd as they were for the most part smartlydressed people the effect in the early part of the evening before darkness set  was rather like that of a fete in your horticul tural gardens only on a larger scalea little before  pm the theatrical represen tation was over and al those who had assisted re rned to the state apartments overlooking the gardens on the terrace which extends before the central gallery and which as well as the stair case leading up to it from the gardens was orna mented with orange trees chairs were placed for royalty and velvet hangings on the balustrade the appearance of their majesties and the guests there was the sgnal for the show from the top of the chateau a ray of electric light was thrown on the gardenswhich was however scarcely sufficient to light up the whole space on the contrary by bring ing out single points it made the rest rather darker moresuccessful wasthe illuminationby electric light of the basin and the group of neptune above it which camo out really better than it is to be seen under any other circumstances thegroup like thostatues on both sides of tho leafy waul enciosingthe parterre are in the style of bironjtle favouite of the epoch when the ohateaa was built there is the same affectation about them which you see in all statuary of that period but in that eleotria light a very clever imitation of sft moonlight you forgot a imperfections and the group had an ideal appearance ae in a fairy picceit rather seemed at first that there was something incomplete about the illumination be yond the two rows of lamps behind the group of neptune you saw rows of lamps going up the hill belhind marking the zigzag roads which lead up to the lookout place the gloriette but the gloriette itself was shrouded in darkness all of a sudden however a number of blue lights were lighted in front of it showing that light structure of arcades in all its grace soon under every arcade a starlike light appeared bringing out still more prominently the architectural features of the building but the spectacle could not be enjoyed long for the blue lights had their usual  drawbacks the smoke which on that still night lay over the place shrouding one portion of it altogether in vain were blue and red lights thrown up  they had no power agamst the smoke and it was only when a bouquet of them shot up that their briliancy prevailed atainst the thick veil it was the finish one by one the blue lights turned to red and one after the other burnt out until the glorietto returned again into darkness the two military bands which had been placed in the gardens and bad contributed to enliven the sihow began to play the marches with which they usually end their performances the court and their visitors withdrew to supper the visitors in the gardens made their way to the side entrances to find their carriages and the garden fte of schon brunn was over
