middletozrthe prisoner in this case had deposited a sum of lls in tho post offlco savings bank ho held a warrant from the postmastergeneral entitling him to repayment of los from the post office at nottinghill a lotter of advice to this eiect had been sent to tho postmistress at that offlce the prisoner presentod the warrant for iol to he postmistresss clerk for payment tho clerk had immediately before re ceived from some other porson another warrautfor the pay ment to that person of  s lod and mistaking which of the two had presented tho latter warrant he laid the sum of  s lod on the counter before the prisoner who took ud the whole amount and walked away with it the postmistress subsequently discovered the mistake tho prisoner was appreheuded and tried en the charge of steal ing the l s lod and was convicted the conviction was appealed against on the ground that there was no lar ceny becausothe postmistresss clorkparted with the pro perty and intended to doso and because the prisoner did not obtain possessioa of the monev by any trick or fraud thery at the trial found that the prisoner took the money animofurandi and that ho knew the money to be tho property of the postmastergeneral when ha took it up from thecounter the question for the consdderation of the court was whether under the circamstances the prisoner was pro pory convicted of larceny the case was fully argued in last eiliary term before  of the judgeslord chief justice bovyn now read the jidgmen of the majority of that courtwhich was to the following effect the question for our consideration is whether the facts of the present ease bring it within the proper definition of larceny whiob according to the lawof england from tho timo of bracton downwards has been considered to be the wrongful or fraudulent taking and carryingaway of the per sonal goods of another from auy place without any colour of right with a felonious intent to convert them to the takers own use and make them his own property without the consent and against the will of the owner under the act for establishing the post office savingsbanks  vic cap  deposits are received at the post offices authorized by virtue of that act for tho purpose of beig remitted to the principal office tho postmastergeneral is to give an acknowledgment for soch deposits and all moneys ao depo sited with the postniastergeneral are forthwith to be paid over to the commissioners for the reduction of the national dcbt all sums withdrawn by the depositors are to be re paid out of those moneys through the office of the post mastergeneral the authority of the postmastergeneral for such repayment shall botransmittedtothedepositorwho is to be entitled to repayment at a post office withiu ten days it appears to us that the moneys received by the postmas ters at their respectivo offices by virtue of this act are the property of tho crown or of the postmastergeneral and that neither tho postmaster nor tho clerks at the post offices have any power or authority either general or special to partv with the property in or even the possession of the monoys so deposited or any part of them to any person except upon the special authority of the postniastergene ral under the circumstances of the present case we aro of opinion that neither the postmistress s clerk nor the post miatress herself had any power or authority to part with tho  os lod which the clerk had placed upon the counter and wvhich was taken up by the prisoner in this viewv the present case appears to be undistinguishable fromu other cases where obtaining articles ninmo furandi from the master of a post offico though he had intentionally delivered them over to the prisoner has been held to be larceny on tho principle that the post mnster had not the property in the articles or the power to part with the property in them his lordship then cited and commented upon the various cases bearimg upon the question aud confirmmg the above decision the judgment then went onthe sameprinciple has been acted upon in other cases where the person having merely the possession of goods without any poxvr to part with tho property in them has delivered them to the prisoner who has obtained them aimo furandi for instauce such ob taining of a parcel from a carriers servant by pretending to be the person to whom it was directed or obtaining goods through the mnisdeliverin of them by a carriers servant through mistake to a wrong person who appropriated them aaniso furandi were in liko manner held to amount to larceny in all these and other similar cases many of which aro collectedin bussd on crimes vol  pages  to  the proporty was considered to be taken without the conseut and against the wmll of the onwner though the possession avs parted with by the voluntary act of the sorvant to whom the property had been intrusted for a special purpose aud whore property is so taken by the prisoner imowingly with intent to deprive tho owner of it auld feloniously to appro priato it to himsolf he may in our opinion be properly convicted of larceny the case is very dlifferent where the goods are parted wvith by the owner himself ora porson baving aurhority to act for him and where such agent in tends to part wvith tho property in the goods forthem although the goods bo obtained by fraud or forgery or false pretences it is not a taking agaisst the will ot the owner vhich is necessary in order to constitute larccnv the judgment tben cited variouis cases in which thc taking of goods although it was not intended that the prisoners should obtain possession of them did not ainountto larcony and continued in the present case not only had tho post mistress or her clerlc no power to part wvith the property in this money to the prisoner but tho clerk in one sense never intended to part with the st los  to the person who only presented an order for sand he placed the money on the counter by mistake though at the time he by mistake intended that the prisoner should take itunp and by mistake entered the amount in the prisoners book vhen the money was lying upon the coanter the prisoner was aware tbat he was not enitled to it and that it could not be and was not really intended for him yet with fuu knowledgo on his part of this mistake ho toolk the money up and car ried it awayintending at tho time he took it to deprive the owner of au property in it and feloniously to appropriato it to his own use there wa thereforo as it seems to uei a wrongful and fraudulent taking and carrying away of the wholo of this money by the prisoner without any colour of right animo furandi and against the wil of the real owner and for these reasons and upon the authoritios before stated wo think tho prisoner is
