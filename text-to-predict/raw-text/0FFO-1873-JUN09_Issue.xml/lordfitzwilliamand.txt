should be compelled to join their union was held at the star inn lawivmab on saturflay morning mr george muscrmft presided and there were over  colliers presentmz j nortansell secretaryof the south yorkshire miners asociaou who was also prerent addressed the meetinro he said he felt somewhat anxious to say a few words in reply to the address of earl tzwiliamrdelivereil en thursday morning at wventworthhouse ll thought it wras very nfair indeed for any man and still more unfair for a nobleman to make charges against an association wbich was entirely innoccut in this mat ter itseemed to him from hisloriships addres that it was a very ingenius trick to place the odium of vauh ans letter upon ibe association as his lordshiplbad said it was in consequence of that letter teat he bat closed his col liery it was only fair to the public to say that the letter whieh wvas a verv indiscreet onewas written more than tbree weeks previous tothe stoppage of the colieryon the ath of mayand tbat they had not left their work in conse suenca of the man hargreaves not beinga mnemnber of the b nion they never got any instructiona ixomn their asocia tion tothreaten any man who did not payto the union the wish of the association had been quite against such conduct ever sine he bad known it nothing made a sslfish ie ratnt man more popuar wvith the opponents of rades unions than to be taken notice of for suchi a man was always something extraordinary when he was taken by the band by an earl ml xornannsclls principle had ever been to let such ruen as hargreaves alone when they had the assurance to work among unionists and to reap the benefits of the association without contributing to it it was beat to let such a nuan vwork peaceably adnd quietly among tbemi many men worked among them who would not contribute to the union and these mnen were the very first when any mishap befel thein to comne to the other muen for help they either came themselves or got their freuids to coue and the only thing to bring such men to their senses was to let them want and sufler in the hour of distres hrear har a nd loud appllause if their associationconld not live now with its  or  years experience and its  members without sending threatening letters to the employers it was not worth a rush the benefits held out by it were quite sufficient in themselves to bring every wellthinking man into it and ii itrequired intimidation to bring a msa in it would require intimuidation to keep him in he believed that the letter to which exception had been taken was not dictated by any of themembersofthe unionbut that it wasvaughats own acl nr nornnanseu had never thought ior a moment that the error ought to have been included in the apology wvhich the mnen had sent to the earl because it was a distinct under standing with them that the pit was not stopped on account of the nonuniouist becaune menhad foolishly played for two days they were locked out and tbe employernow raked up all this filth to hurl at them the speaker went oa to quote portions of his lordships speech in which he said the association were blamed for having instilled dis content into the minds of the men and he affirmued that since the year  not a single vne among thembaad beex asked to jdin the association they had joined entirely by their owu free will there had never heen ameeting any wlhereat which either he or r casey or any other autho vized officer of the association had ever said that  it they could get earl fitzwilliam under their thumb  the otberemployersavould follow they bad never said nor thought about such a thln on the contrary they had done all they possibly could not only with earl fitz williams men but the men all over the district to main tain peace and harmony between the employers andtbe em ploybd and how earl lrtzwilliam could reconcile that with the fact that  there had been  play days in  months he was at a loss to know it might have becn through being nmsiuformed but he was rather doubtful that that was lo he would say to earl fitawiuiamor the whole country and the goaernment if it liked that they were at liberty to appoint their own tribunal to hold an inqury at reassa brough or anywhere else and thev could examino every man and he would defy them to prove that a single word or act to cause the letter to be written or canse the pit to stand bad emanated from the assodiation he could bear a good deal at times but the charges made by earl fitzwilliamn applied to thou sands of people and it was right that they should be repu diated it was enough to cause somethinig ten thousand times worse than the stoppage of low ntubbin colliery on thethofhiay lnone of them wanted to intimidate tbeir fellowworhnen the association could get members with out that and for his own part he did not see what earl fitzwiliam had to grumble about if vaughan were wrong the earl could appeal to thelaw and give him threemonths imoprisonment and not blame every man who worked at the stubbin colliry for the act of one individual if they were to take earl fitzwilliams word for granted there was not a good mau among them they were all as bad as vaugban hislordship had wound up by saying that in apologizing they had played a manly parlt mr xormansell thoughtithey had done all that could be asked from them as englishmen and for his own part he was not going to ask them to do any more but they always knew their own business best and he was not supposed to interfere and he was not going to interfere it wa to be hoped his lordship would mrry out the latter part of his address but hemr lormansell did not see why he had to wait a day or twowhy they had to walt for his reply if he were satisfied bimselfwhy didhe not say like a noble man it is all over now i have told you imy mind and you may all go hack to your work wvithout any exactions just as you left it there it is for you  knowing what strikes were they must be careful not to enter into them in the fature but at tme same time they must not be cowards the dayswa arrived when no man need to go down an his knees and beg for employment they had been quite suflciently submissive to his lordship if he took them back well and good and if he did not then they could work for somebody else for his part fie would not put himself out any more about the matter if his lordship or mr hartop the manager sent for them to go to work again let them go to work but he wouldnot in his opinion stand any exctions hear bear e had dsaid plenty to them and sll he could say more was that they must behave themselves ple ly ad quietly and if there bwas a good chance for any of them he advised them to take it and go to work like men
