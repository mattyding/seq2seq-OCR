ibblrmom ou own corespondzntdublin june no plan of reform has yet been arranged by the progressive party in trinity collegebut the subject is under careful consideration and it is hoped some comprehensive programme will soon be drawn out and submitted for the approval of the senate the first object in view is to give some substantial proof of sincerity as to the admission of the catholics and protestant dissenters to high positions in the college in the ordinary course of things as already explained many years must elapse before any of the hitherto excluded classes could obtain a seat on the board in order toinspire confidence in the minds of roman catholic stadents and to induce them to enter the university it is necessary that the abolition of tests should be shown to be a real and not a merely sentimentalconcession tothe liberal spirit of the times it is suggested that one prac tical way of etecting this would be to found some additional tutor fellowships and at once nominate some roman catholic gentlemen of high scholastic attainments who in all probabilitywould have obtained fellowships long since if the tests had not been a bar to their admission it is of course objectionable in principlo that a fellowship should be given by nomination but it is only recom mended as an exceptional arrangement to start with in the nev career of the university and with the distinct understanding that in future candidates must pass an examination there aro a few eligible persons who miaht be admitted with advantage on their credentials but who could not fairly bo asked to compete with other candidates who have laid themselves out forthe contest foryearswhile roman catholics could not have been expected to engage in an arduous course of study nith the uncertain prospect that at some distant day they might be allowed to compete the fellowship exami nation which has been held this wmek af fords an illustratioa of the disadvantages under which dissenters laboured one of the candidates was mr purser who was declared last year to be entitled to a fellowship by his superior answering at the examination but as he could not conscien tiously submit to the test being a unitarian ho was not elected this year he has competed again with two other candidates who pressed him hard but it is expected he will be declared duly elected on mionday next if an examination were required for roman catholic candidates they would be unfairly pitted against candidates who have had long training and though had they started at the same period of life to read tho courses they would probably have won the highest distinction they might nowr be distanced by younger and fresher rivalsfour home rule candidates are spoken of for the vacancy created by the death of

the discussion of a subject which threatens to shake the venerable chirch to its foun dations it has been debated with an earnestness and solemnity befitting the occasion and the result was waited for withdeep anxiety  the great ques tion was whether stich an innovation as the intro duction of instrumental music into the public wor ship of presbyterians is to be allowed or to be put down with a strong hand it was pro posed to enact a special law to prohibit a practice which was beginning to creep in very slowly and timidly into some congregations for a short time it escaped notice but the keen vigilance of some rigid partisans detected the heresy and they denounced it with great warmlth in the cx tremenorth it is viewed with horror and alarm and mncasures were taken to stamp it out at the meeting of the assembly after protracted discussion thle matter was referred to a subcommittee who made a report the con troversy was then carried on with renewed fierce ness at a former sitting of the assembly and the issue remained doubtful for it was found on a divi sion that  voted for and  against it a motion was made that the report should be amended and the whole subject was debated anew at three meetings this week somne powerful argu ments were advanced on both sides one of the rev speakers rather ingeniously contended that the use of instruments was idolatrous in its tendencyas it interposed a material thing cognizable by the senses  between the worshipper and the object of worship he regarded the innovation as incon sistent with the westminster confession of faith and the teaching and practice of their  covenanted ancestors a rev professor ventured to offer an apology for the instrumentalists he bespolke a patient hearing by assuranees of his impar tiality which were convincing he said he did not feel a deep interest in the way in which the question would be decided for he did not believe the existenco of presbyterianism depended on the use or nonuse of instrumental music moreover he was not a judge of music and never could know one tune from another a in his youth he had been greatly tempted to join another church but he never regretted his choice and was far happier than if he were archbishop of canterbury he re ferred to the use of instrulmental music by the elders of the ancient church of irelandfor instance the harp of ekinan at tarsand by a great many presbyterian churches in the world and with respect to the primitive church ha accounted very satisfactorily for the nonuse of musical instru ments in it by the fact that the early christians had no houses to worship in andof course had no bar moniaems the great debate was brought to  close last night by the mloderatorwvho in the interests of peaceproposed a series of resolutions to theeffect that the assembly abstained from passing any lawv on the subject and agreed to give up instrumental music and address themselves with increased dili gence to improve the psalmody of the church wfhich it must be confessed is not very harmonious there are only eight harmoniums in the whole of the presbyterian church in lreland numbering  congregations but a taste for them is springinr up in many places the church has nowr escaped the peril of musicthe tenth report on the reformatory and indus trial schools of ireland under tho inspection of mr lentaigne cb has
