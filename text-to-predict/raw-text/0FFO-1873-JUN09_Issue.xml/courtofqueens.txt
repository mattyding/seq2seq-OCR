on wednesday prnuounced a decision which may go far towards improving the quality of the butter supplied to the community today dedded a case which wil in certain cases have tho effect of glving them loaves we full weight the appellautswho were bakerswere convicted under the th and tthwilli vcap sec which enacts that any bskcr vho shalsllbreadinanyother manner than by weight shall ie liable to certain penalties in that section is a proviso which excepts from the operation of the act bread sold under the denomination of rench or fancy beread which maybe sohl without being previously weighcd and the appellants contended that the bread sold by them came within the provise iby tho case stated by the jus tices it appeared that the only difference between the bread soldby the company and ordinary bread is that the carbonic acid gas is mechanically forced into the companys bread from without wbile in ordinary bread that gas is hymnically generated withtnthe leaï¿½ it slo appeared that the company makes only two kinds of bread one kind being baked in sqvuare tins from seconds four and the other kind being baked in cylindrical tins and made from tbe best lour it was for the sale of the latter idnd the company had been proceeded against and this wa itwa urged fancy breedmr day qc and mr finlay appeared for the appel lants mr john thompson for the respondentmr justice bloanusr thought that the conviction was right the meaning of the section was not what was usually sold as fancy bread at the time of the passing of the act but at the time when proceedings were takenr justice quasa concurred he did not think that be csuse an ordinary quartern loaf was baked separately and made to have crust all roand that it thereby became fancy bread within the meaning of the act he thought that fancy bread meant either rolls or bread of the same genus as rollsmr justice arbmald also thought that the conviction was right he did not think that a baker by cauing bread  fanev bread  could protect himself from the provisions of tho act and he thought that the bread described in the case was in no way french or fancy breadconviction affirmed with costs
