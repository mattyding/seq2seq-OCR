the tower subwaythe ingenious subway beneath the thames by which mr barlow has connected towerhill with tooleysbreet is now completed in all but minor detafls and wil be opened probably on monday next forpublic use experimental trips were com menced on monday last and on tuesday the repre sentatives of the press were invited to witness and participate in them the proceedings of monday are said to have been entirely successful but on tuesday some small mishaps occurred sufficient to suggest the necessity of improved methods ofignalling and to show that a short period of prac tics will be useful to the oflicials in chargethe construction of the subway has been ex plained in the tines on a former occasion and it is now only necessary to remind our readers that it consists of a narrow tunnel uniting two vertical shafts one of which is on towerhill and the other in vinestreet tooleystreet the tunnel is lined with iron tubing bolted together in short lengths by means of flanges projecting on the internal surface the placing and fixing of the portions of the tube were effected within a shield or bell which was constantly puslhed on before the advancing work and the conception has been seized upon by mr bateman as the basis of his wellknown suggestion for a submarine tube to carry a railway from england to france the thames tube is ft in clear internal diameter or ft sin between the flanges and it car ries a railway of ft in gauge on this railway runs an omnibus capable of convey ing  passengers the tube isabout a quarter oaf mile inlength and sinks from both ends towards the centre with a gradient of about i in  the omnibus is of ironlight but very strong and runs upon eight wheels it is connected with a rope of steel wire by means of a gripe that can be tightened orrelaxedat pleasureand at eachencd of the tunnel this wire runs over a drum vorked by a sta tionary engine the declivity of the tunnel is such that when once the omnibus is started it re quires only a smau amount of traction and the momentum acquired during its descent wiu carry it a long way up the opposite slope it is said that the strain on the rope will never exceed cwt ahd the rope used although very slenderin appearance is capable of bearing more than a ton the omnibus is provided with breaks so that its motion is completely under the control of the man in charge and at each end of the tunnel it is received by buffers or rather catches that are connected with very strong springs of vulcanized indiarubber the shafts at each eda of the tunnel are  feet in depth and are lined partly with brickwork and partly with iron tubing within these shafts there are lifts capable of carrying six passengers at once and these lifts are raised and lowered by the same engines that work the drums each lift has a counterpoise equal to its own weight and to that of three average passengers so that the weight of three passengers represents the maximum of wfork that will be demanded from the engine either for raising or lowering at the top of each lift is a very ingenious contrivance by which a breakage of the suspending chain wouldcloseiron claws upon the lateral guiding rails and would bring the machine to a standstil in the course of a few feet at collieries where the pniners are raised and lowered in a cage it sometimes happens that they are carried over the wheel at the top but the ascent of these lifts is checked by springs of steel and india rubber which the engine employed would not be strong enough to break the wheel over which the suspending chain runs is also dragged so to speak by revolving fans and too great rapidity of either ascent or descent seems to be rendered prac tically impossiblethe arrangements visible from the world above are almost ostentatious in their simplicity the upper opening of each shaft is covered by a tiny square building like a slightly exaggerated sentrybox at the door will stand an official provided with a book of tickets and a pouch for money as they pay passengers will enter the box and descend in the lift on reaching the bottom they find a space of a few feet betwveen the shaft and the buffers fitted up with benches as a waitingroom when the omnibus arrives and has disgorged its load those who are waiting will sten in and will start off immediately for the other end the descent of the shaft occa pies  seconds and the omnibus journey  se coud no tbmt o p boengo may winik into tho amrth at towerhill and emerge in vinestreet in a ninute and threequarters from the time of his dis appearance allowing forall ordinary causos of de tention such as missing the lift at the moment of its descent or being just too late for the omnibus the journey from point to point cannot occupy more than five minutes the lifts as they only carry half as many passengers as the omnibus will make twice as many journeys and it is in tended to give priority of ascent to firstclass pas sengerswho will pay d for that privilege second class passengers will pay idthe most extraordinary part of the whole under taking has been its cheapness the capital of the company amounts only to  andtheplant would provide for a traffic which would repay this capital in aw singlle year as in the little sentry boxes so below the cheapness is almost painfully eident there is an intrusive absence of decora tion the waitingplace is whitewasbed and the benches arepainted drab the omnibus is lined with american cloth and coloured of a dirty green over head thefrench entlemanwho lovedtotravelby thametropolitan railway on account of the beauti ful pictures with which the carriages and stations are decorated would find the subway barren we trust the directors will obtain some life and colour for the walls wve trust that they will also introduce gaslight instead of paraffine lamps which are liable to be blown out by the rush of air that precedes the carriage and which even when they aid the sight are apt to offend at least one other sensethe mischances that occurred are too trivial to be dwelt upon once the rope became hitched round a pulley and was broken by the trac tion from a fixed point once the omnibus was stopped while it was still a few feet from its desti nation and once it was suffered to run a few inches too far a day or two of practice will prevent any recurrence of such accidents and even if they occur they are of little consequence the worst that could happen would be that passengers might have to walk a short distance along the tunnel it canniot be questioned that mr barlows work will be a great boon to the inhabitants of the districts eastward of londonbridge and that it wi enormously facilitate intercourse between the north and south side of the river in that direction whether we regard the ingenuity and originality of the idea or the complete success which has attenaded its execution the new subway forms a sufficient basis for a reputation of which any engi neer might be justly proud
