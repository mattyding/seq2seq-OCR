francefrom our own co qpojnnï¿½ aris maxcf the idea of submitting the proposed changes in the constitution to a vote of the nation after the project of a enalus cansidtuum shall have passed the senate finds favour with mahiy deputies of the liberalimperialist party who indeed seem to think it originated with them rather than with those conservative senators who last week put it forth in their private conferences and in conversations with their friends it is singular that two sets of men of very opposite political creeds should advocate the same measure and the object of the senators is not clearly discernible unless their move indicates a change of tactics and a design to outbid their adver saries those members of the liberal party who ask for apebscite are not in want of reasons wherewith to support their proposal an appeal to the people they say would be a consecration of the liberal empire absolution for the coup detat or at least its condonation it would be in conformity with the spirit of the constitution and a severe blow to hos tile facqiqnf whether dynastic or republican when arguing thus they take it as a preestablished and certain fact that there would be a handsome majo rity n favour of the constitutional change in ques tion and of this there is probably little doubt in the presenttemper of the countryalthoughnot so stated thfe vote would be by implication for or against the emperor and his dynasty it is certain that napo leon ll is just now very popular in france still the majority would hardly be so great as on former occasionsas on the th of december wvhen he had threefourths of the suffiuges against cavaignac and the radical candidates or in the plebiscites for the  years presidency of the em pire but those of his friends and supporters who are in favour of the appeal to popular suffrage say that he might be certain of twothirds of the votes amply sufficient to evince the will of the nation and to consolidate his thronethe more so as these votes would comprise very much morethan that proportion of the property intelligence and respectability of the country the republicans and socialists would do their worst in opposition and would whip in their legions of blouses and the very lowest class of men possessing a vote but in the middle and higher classes of the population few indeed would be the votes insribed against the sovereign who while firm in the maintenance of order shows himself equally steady and determined in the fulfilment of his pledges to the people on the other hand it is argued that true wisdom consists in letting well alone that the emperor stands well with the nation and does not need a fresh manifestation of its acceptance of him as chief of the state that a plebiscite is a very great and grave act which oughlt to be reserved for the most extraordi nary contingencies and to be resorted to only when evidently indispensable the mlinisters are known to be little disposed to have recourse to it and it may be doubted whether the emperor fully recog nizes its necessitythe verdict of the high court of justice was received in paris withi some surprise and still mnore dissatisfaction the latter feeling i may positively assure youi extends to the very highest quarters the public conscience had settled what the princes punishment should have been a couple of years
