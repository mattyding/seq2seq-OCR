verdict at tours anl we shall saly nothing let the etigh court ns an excceptional tribunal be condemned but to brund an act of thc human conscience whioh is and ought to be inviolable is what we

verdict but fears it will pro duce a bad effect upon popular opinion the centre gauche is amazed at the verdict and cannot comprehend how the high jurors hare reconciled it with their consciences to de clare prince pierre bonaparte perfeetly innocent the prcsse is also confounded by the rerdict and asks whether if the case had been roversedt victor noir had killed princ pierre bonapartethe same judgment would have been given stil a jury is one of the forms of suffrage and its decisions must be accepted the gazette de frane finds the verdict inexplipable and remarks that if there was any

resting proceedings he was glad to learn that many people uot connected with tho hody ittended the services in the hammeramith church and he beleved that would happen more frequently were greater variety introduced into the services and were the mode of worship so altered as not to be left entirely to the discretion of the minister in scotland infiueutial people were alienated from the church of their fathers for want of this vatiety and it was an unhappy state of things when the squire of a parish went to one church and the mass of the people to another knox the founder of the scottish church used the liturgy of king edward and he the marquis did not see any reason why the example of the great scottish reformer should not dow be followed and a litnrgy intro duced into all
