theclaims ur ellort superintendent of the salvage association and who had inspected the house a day or two after the tire reported to them that upon the face of it and especially after looking at the dabris the claim was substantially unfounded or grossly exaggeratediie stated that from the nature of the ddgris it was utterly impossible there could have been anything like the quan titr or value of goods chargoed for there was a sum of  charged for chins glass c hut afterthe closest search not more thanuabuhel of dbs could be found as to the charge of  for lookingglasses  for each of three bedroom glasses and  for a parlour one it was impos sible he said that there could be such glasses some of the articles remained there was a sum of  los charged for a fender and set of fire irons not worth more than a few shillings so a table was left which was worth s there was an iron bedstead with the casters of two others and each would be worth about  so of the rest the kitchen was not consumed and the things in itput down at the sum of were not he said worth more than  these were specimens of the result of his inspection hlaying received such information the office disputed the claim and the present action was brought in the name of clpman for the benefit as the plaintiff sd of walker ln the course of the action interrogatories were administered to the plaintiff especially as to the mode in which he had acquired the goods these interrogatories were administered it is to be observed in february  and they were not answered at that time nor until nearly three years afterwards the action in the meantime slept as it was stayed untilthe inter rogatories were answered and it was notuntiljanuary last that they were answered and the action vas continued the explanation now given of this bv the plaintiff was that the attorney would not go on with the action until secured his costs in case of failure and it was one of the facts of the case that the plaintiff in june  was bankrupt in january last he answered the interrogatories and stated that he had purchased most of the articles at sales by auc tion and had had most of them for many years but that some of the books and prints were presents to him from a mr bennett who it is to be observed had in the interval two or three months previous to the answering died the company pursued inquiries by the aid of a detective and discovered the woman lemmes who had left the plntiff and was now a witness for the company along with the landlord and two or three girls who had been servants at the cottage it appeared that chapmian the plain tiff took the cottage in au iust  at a rent of  and that he had furnished it with the aid of the voung woman who lived with himby buying the necessary articles at sales or brokers shops these purchases were to smau amounts not exceeding about  and the brokers were called and produced their bookh and proved the amounts in june the young woman left him and as shestated took awray a greabpart of the thiugswith her they hav ing been purchased wits her money another young woman suc ceeded her who was a writness for the plaintiff and stated that she had lived with him as housekeeper the plaintiff had paid the first quarters rent but not the second and third and at the end of june when two quarters rent would be due the landlord with another person went to the hlouse in order to form an estimate of the value of the furniture with a view to a distress for the rent and arrived at the conclusion that its value would hardly be more than adequate to meet the arrears of rent and the expenses this evidence was strongly confirmed by the evidence of the servants and of lemmes who contradicted the parti culars of the claim in all material respects according to this evidence indeed the fev things in the house were of the poorest character and the pictures wero mere  prints  there were but a few books and these many of them odd ones or cheap railway lublications  and the plain tiff himself being asked if he ad the tvarerley jxoveh couldnot answer distinctly whether ho had them or not injune indeed the man was bankrupt and his effects in tooleystreet sold for less thin  in july he professed to have the furniture aud goods essisned to walker for advances to the amount of about  the insured value this walker was a witness for the plaintiff and professed to have been in the royal naand to have acquired about  in the crimea drinz his service there with the naval brigade under sir wiliam peel but being pressed on croeaexaminatioe to explain how he had been sbo fortunate as to accuman late such a large sum out of a sailors pay he confessed that he had materially added to his gains by occasional wind falls in theshapeof watchesandchains found upon theodies of those who had fauen in the war such was the person who said he had advanced the plaintiff  upon the insured goods after the assignment walker was sometimes at the cottage and was so on the evening of thelth of september when the fire occurred and ac cording to the evidence of the plaintiff he and his friend walker were the last persons in the house before the fire every one else having somehow or other left it they them selves ieft it they said witha fire burning in the parlour and a paraffin lamp burning in the kitchen this was between  and  oclock in the evening and at  at night th cottage was burnt down the action was promptly brought but as already mentioned the defendants in terrogateries wera not answered until quite recently the plaintiff when he did answer them stated on oth that he had purchased the greater part of the things at salesand had had rnost of them for years being now examined as awitness however he stated that he had bought them from mr bennett for a sum of between  and  and being asked to reconcile the two state ments ho said that mr bennett had bought at sales for him as already mentioned ir bennett died two or three months before the action after its long slumber was re vived but his confidential clerk was called and bis evi dence tended to confirm the truth of the plaintiffs first statement that he had given him a fewvarticles walker and the younu woman who had succeeded as  housekeeper stated that i the articles mentioned n the particlasar were on the premises at the time of the fire and were of the character and value described while on he other hand thefumiture dealers of whom in fact the plaintiff had purchased the furniture for the cottage being called gave a detailed account of the purchases by im and the woman which quite corresponded with the evidence given by the servant maids as to the character of the furniture such w as the substanee of the case the trial of which has occupied three daysmr cnramms and mr serjeant baravng addressed the jury at great length and with more thau their usual energy and ability on behalf of their respective clients the claimant and the company fuuy commenting on every fact in the caseit should be mentioned that mr chambers in the course of his reply made some severe comments on the couduct of the company in aisputing the claimthe lord c justice in commencing his summing up said that in consequence of these observations he felt it to be his duty to say that he considered that in insisting on a full and searching examination ito the case the company had onldischarged their duty to their shareholders and the public for this was a case eminently deserving such an iuvestigation as it certainly wfhatever the result presented circumstances of the gravest suspicion the question the jury had to determide was whether the claim ws honest or dihonest in effcct the issue was fraudor no fraud if the claim was not fmudualett the plaintiff was entitled to recover the fair value of the goods destroyed if the claim was fraudulent he was not entitled to recover at all that was one of the conditions of the policy aud the company had a right to insist upon it considering how they were exposed to fraud and how difficult it was to es tablh it it was their bounden duty to try to establish it in cases where they honestly believed that they were able to do so for as the premiums for insur ance wore calculated upon the average of losses aud profits the more companies were subjected to fraud and imposition and the more they had to pay in consequence of such frauds the higher the premiums they must be obliged to charge honest insurers iu considering the case it was necessary to start with certain first prin ciples it was not a question of accuracy or inaccuracy a mau might be honestly mistaken as to the quantity or value of goods on tbe premises at the time of a fire and if that were al then it was  a mere questouq of the true value of the goods destroyed for it was to be borne in mind that as a policy of insurance was only a contract of indemnity the insured could only recover to the extent of his real loss you must not con tinued the lord chief justice  ran away with theidea that a policy of insurance entitles the insured to recover noces sarilyto the amount represented by the premium paid a policy of insurance is essentially a coutract of indemnity if a man chooses to insure goods worth  at a premium which represents  he can only recover the real and actual value of the goods the law will not allow of gam bling in the form of insurance insurance companies are sub ject tofraud enoughasitisandif persons wero allowed to insure goods to a greater amount than the real value it is obvious that a door would be opened for fraud and wickedneas of the most abomainable kind therefore in all these oates the only questiolt even supposing tho clam tobe honest is what was the real and actual value of the goods destroyed  but beyond this if a man insures against fire and a fire breaks out and destroys his goods even although he did not cause the fire yet if he makes a fraudulent claim he must falm by that fraud and dishonesty vwhich he has attempted to perpetrate and cannot recover at all such being the law the ques tion was how it applied to the particular facts of the case there was oonflicting evidence upon which the jury had to determine if the plaintiffs evidence was to be believed then of course he was entitled to recover but if the evi dence for the defence carried conviction to their minds then he had no hesitation in declaring that a more scan dalous fraud was never attempted to be perpetrated the whola question was which of these conflicting sets of wit nesses were to be believed let the jury look at the list of articles claimed for and give it their closest attention and then compare it with the evidence of the witnesses in the case who were disinterested if the evidence of the young woman lemmes was to be believed the wholq case wva fraud froja beginning to end but if they should doubt whether her lrin was biased by the sense of injury and her resentment against tho man who had deserted and betrayed her then let them look at the other evidence iu the case and see how far her testimony was confirurad it wa in fact most strongly confirmed and as to the great quetion what was the value of the goods at the time of the fire there was independent evidence of the most striking character it was difficult to rupposo any motive for falseevidence on the part of the girls who had lived at the house as servants and their evidence fuly confirmed that of lemmes the lord chief justice bere wvent fuly into the evidence he observed that a sum of  was charged for a single bedroom in whiob according to their evi dence there was only au iron bedstead a pieco of glass leaning against the wall a deal table or wash stand no drawerm no carpet no curtains no fender or fireirons and bo in proportion in the other rooms the jury must use their own judgment about this evidence as to the nature of the claim the evidence for the defence was further confirmed by that of the landlord after commenting fully upon the evidence on this head the lord chief justice proceeded to say that if the company had good ground to believe that the claim was founded on fraud it was their duty not to compromise it but to resist it and expose the fraud it was idle to suggest that such an office as tho sun would get up false evidence there was not an office of hieer character in london andit could not for a moment be supposed that the directors or the highly respectable solicitors who had the honour of enjoying their confidence would condescend to such base practices merely to defeat an action or resist a claim let the jury look at the whole aspect and cora plexion of the case in order to judge of the probabilities one way or the other look for example at the story of the witness walker the plaintiffis friend and foreman who professed to have acquired  in the naval brigade in the crimea bevond his pay he said there vwas the plunder of the dead thus it was stated he had amassed this sum aud had advauced it to the plaintiff it was to be lamented that the glory of the naval brioade should be represented as tarnished by the plunder of the dead and possibly the dying so it was however aceording to the evidence of mr walker according to the evidence also both of walker and chapman the furniture of the cottage was to be handed over to valker as security for  then in june the plaintiff became bankruptnot a very creditable transaction if true but whether it was true or not was not very mnaterial the main question was whether the goods were there and whether they were of the value or anything like the value represented if not then there had been a gross and scandalous fraud  man could not be so grossly in error as to the furniture of the rooms in which hu lived in which he sat and took his meals and in which he slept if the story told by the witnesses for the defence was true there had been gross fraud and it was for the jury looking at the whole of the evidlence to say whether they believed it to be true or not if nuot trute then it would be their duty to find for the defendantsthe jury without any hesitation immediately found a verdict for the defendants the plaintiff his witness walker and his housekeeper had left the court before the chare was over
