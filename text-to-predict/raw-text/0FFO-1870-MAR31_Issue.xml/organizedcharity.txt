organid craitythe first annual meetingof the society for organizing charitable relief and repressing pendicity was held yes terday afternoon in williss rooms the earl of derby presided over a somewhat numerous gathering which in eluded the earl of llchflield the bi shop of winchester tho duke of grafton and sir charles trevelyan and among the many ladies present was mrs gladstonethe earl of derby in opening the proccedings said i suppose weshall au be agreed that the permanence and in creaso of pauperism in this country and especialy in lon don is a subject which calls for the serious attention of every one who values either the welfare of our population or the honour of our country the facts which we have to deal with are simple though the inferences which may be drawn from them vary indefinitely there is certainly no want of wealth in london  that is a proposition which does not require proof the mere land on which this me tropolis and its suburbs stand taking a square of ten miles each waynorth south east and west from st pauls has been estimated to represent a capital equal to the whole natioual debt there is no want of liberality in point of fact it has been proved over and over again that the amount of money given awvay in london is more than enough to feed and clothe comfortably every person in it who can by anystretch of the meaning of the words be termed a pauper or destitute it has been shovrn on evi deuce wghich so faras i know has never been disputed that excludng relief derived from rates something like five millions storling is given away in london yearly for charitable purposes of one kind or another and including rates the amount would be between seven and eight millions now at that rate we ought to be able to feed and clothe well at least  persons for the na tional income calculated at between  and  millions does not give an average of much more than  per head and of course if they are treated simply as paupers the cost will be very much lower yet what is the state of the case  pauperism as mr greg in one of his lately published and very able essays puts it increases more rapidly than either chariv or wealth in isss it includled f pe cent of the population of landon in s it in cluded  per cent not a week passes and scarcely a day that we dont hear of deaths from starvation yet the revenue has not fallen off the depression in trade no doubt severe in some employments and in some localities has not caused any large decrease i doubt if any either in imports or exports or in that consumptiou of popular articles of luxury such as beer tobacco spirits sugar or tea which is the surest measure of the degree of comfort enjoyed at any given time by the poorer classes that is briefly the state of things we have to deal with and it admits to my mind of only one explanation by want of organization by want of proper supervision and control by excessive laxityand absenceof discrimination between the deserving andtheundeservingwe are pauperisin gyearbyyear anincreasing numberof our people i dont now speaklof the operation of the poor law that is a great subject but it is beyond the scope of our present meeting i speak of private charity and especialy of that charity which is distributed through the medium of organized societies and the first thing wvhich i wish to point out is this that excessive laxity produces precisely the same effect as excessive severity in depriving those who really deserre assistance of their chanuc of getting it because where money is given away latishly and loosely there will always be a rush and scramble for it the most clamorous the most hardened those who have the least remains of shame or modesty about them will get the wholeand thoso who have retained their selfrespect will be left to starve but more than thisi firmly believe that by our lax and careless way of dealing with these mat ters wc are putting fnto the heads of a large number of the working classes the notion that it is all nonsense attempting howvever high their wages may be to lay by for the future if wrork is plenty they say they can live well if work fails it is tlle business of the rich to keep them rear hear i will onily refer in proof of what rsayto what has occurred at the esast end of london where it wvas affirmed and i believe truly that the rgular expect tiou of charitable assistance brought in vagrants and tramps froml all the country round and actually raised the rent of lodgings within the area where relief was ilistribute hear hear now we cant afford to go on in this way for ever the whole thing is a muddle and to set it straight it is not the use of our pockets so much as of our brains that is w anted the object is sim ple we want to sift the grain from the chaff to leave the vagrant the tramp the professional beggar the utterly and hopelesely shiftless and reckless person be his employ ment what it may to the stnugent rnles and tight discip line of the union and for such persons the rules ought to be stringent and the discipline strictly enforced while to thosewbo suffer by no fanlt of their own a large and gene rous indulgenee should be shown now it is not enough for that purpose to teach people that benevolence is one thing and beneficene another or to declaim vaguely aoainst indiscriminate giving until peoplecan feel sure that the deserv ing poor will and can obtain relief it is no use talking to them they wil give indiscriminately that is to say they wiu give though they know that the chances are ten to one that the applicants whom they help are impostors because they had rather not face that single chanco theother waythe chance that the person to whom they refuse relief may go home and starve and die it is vain to argue against a feeling like that it exists and always wiu exist if you wish men and women to do what they ought in not letting themselves be preyed upon by rogues you must supply them with an easv and tolerably handytest by which todistinguish between ï¿½heimpostorand the honest man it is idle to argue in a society like ours that every one ought to give personal care and attention to rue poor  greai iawyer a piysylcian in leauing practice a cabinet minister or an active member of parliament is of more use to the community by doing his own work and sticking to it than by taking on himself the functions of a relieving officer which he would probably discharge very badly hlear lear division of labour is the very cha racteristic of modern social life and it applies to charity as to everything else the duty therefore which confessedly requires to be performed and which in dividuals cannot conveniently perform is one which naturaly devolves on a society organized for the purpose now what is it that the society we are supporting today is intended to do  in the first place if properly supported it ought pretty nealrly to put an end to street beggin only lay it down as a rule to give in the streets no money but instead of money a ticket entitling the bearer to plain food if hungry and to an inquiry by competent agents into his antecedents and wantsonly make that practice universal and beggrs will vanish from yourstreet and roads elear beha in nine cases outof tenthe ticket wiu not be presented in the tenth case there is prima facie evidence of real wantand that case will be thoroughly inquires into but more than this is desired to use the words of the promoters it is desired that there should be in each poor law district of lon don a recognized centre of charitable operations to which all persons who may appear ro be deserving of assistance out of the funds of private benevolence may be referred in dependently of all denominational or other differences that full information should be afforded by all charitable agencies at work in a district to a common centre and that such agencies should not work independently of each other but under harmonious adjustment and with due recogni tion of the province of each  that all cases which belong properly to the poor law should be handed over to the guar dians and that only cases in which temporary aid is likelv to prove of permanent benefit to the recipient should be left to the operatioa of private charitvputting it briefly the object is that the numerous local charitiesof london should be made tocooperate not to com pete and that allof them should be brought into cooperation with the agents tlirough whom the poor lawis administered i will not in these opening remarks go more into details because these will be better supplied by such of my friends here resent as have taken an active part in founding this association  but i have no hesitation in saying that theprinciple of action proposed appeara to me sound that though an experimentand i am not here to contend that it is anything morei think it a hopeful one and that in my judgment it deserves at least to he fairly tested w ith what results we must leave it to the experience of the future to show cheersthe secretary reaa letters from the bishop of london and the lord mayor regretting they were unable to attend and also the councils report which was adopted on the motionof mr a mills seconded bv the rev f rowsell  but before its adoption mr verty a guardiau of the poor of marylebone expressed his doubts of the success of the societybecause there were too marynoblc lords and gen tlemen conunected with it his chief reason however for anticipating the faiulre of the society was that the associa tion for improving the wellings of the iadustrions poor presided over by lord radstock and the bishop of norwich had permitted a man and his wife and feur children to in habit a single room in one of their improved dwellings and in another at  manningstreet they had allowed within his experience an epilepti bis wifeand six children to herd ina back kitchen ft square and fi high still he admitted that if the benevolent could be quite sure that those who received tickets would be properly attended to the society would achieve a much desired endsirc tatevelvas moved the second resolution ap proving the societys plan and promising to extend its ma ciinery he treatedof the causes of the present destitu tion and dismissing the panic of  and the departure ofthe shipbuilding trada from the thames as inadequate he laid the distress at the door of london charity wlthout including promiscuous almegiving and donations through the clergy which could not be computed with accuracy he estimated the revenues of the poor lawguardiansand bane volent societies at upwards of  and this was only the available incomes because most societies only allowed the net produeo from subscriptions to a pear in their pub lished eccounts without letting the public into the secret of the enormous sums expended in collection one fruitful source of evil n promoting mendicants was our night refuges and free dormitories after indulging all day in theirtrade thieves and mendicants found a refuge in these places from the poor law officers and police and theirsuppression was urgently demanded  but he wished to distinguish between these refuges and those very useful homes for reforrmation and instraction by no means too abundantthe bishop of wichesstea saidi have endeavoured to mark the plan of the society and i believe it bas on the whole been very carefully constructed and gives a good hope that we shall by means of it accomplish a great workin avery necessary field of labour i do not anticipate we shall ever get people to give their money in our way and not in their ow  therefore our object should be to try to make their own vway of giving a good one and i think that is what the people really desire it is an exceedingly difficult task requiring much attention to individual caes tohelp in those cases where the poor law ought not to belp and to leave to the poor law thoso casesit is ittedto relieve it is not possible to do this without a knowledge of the feneral principle of giving which very few people engaged in other things can possibly possess this knowledge anderperience we hope to suppry so that a person wio gives ed the hih principlo of christian charity will give with tenfio d dleasmra what he is able to give whenhe knows that the asociation which helps him has not been created for the benefit of a wellpaid secretary and an efficient ktff of wellpaid clerks hear hear but that it economizes its machinery and does not waste its money power and if the second point is made clear that there is a bond fide power through this society of supplying to benevolent people a knowledge as to whether a case as deserving or not winch cannot be other wise obtained we shall get the relief we want and society will get the relief it wants hidsplaced charity is the greatest evil of the day it acts most mischievously even on the giver if he does not become by degrees a mere soft molluscous kind of giver without allow ing his conscience in the slightest degree to control his benevolence he will from finding how often hisecharity has been abused have a tendency to become hardhearted i myself have felt the hardhearted principle growing up within me at the recital of instances of misplaced charity and ve must all of uis on occasions be tempted to resolve we wil never give again this is the first great evil to re dress society made hardhearted by the discovery of the abuse of its charity is distinctly a society losing one of its brightest and most blessed elements cheers then not only does the present state of things have a bad effect on the giver but the result is calamitous to the deserving poor partly because the benevolent have been so often taken in and parly because for the most part the most deserving are the least calamitous hear hear but we may hope by tsour wvork to keep the heart of society ten der and the hand of real want fuer there is no charity like that of the man or woman in high positions giving themselves as well as their money all cha rity worthy the name must be done in the spirit of him who was the prince of all charity all who would be tralycharitable must be followers of hi w aho was sur roanded by the sick and the diseased by the poor and the miserable and the outcast they must feel themselves in personal union with him who did not even let the vices of tihe poor banish them from his blessed presence who like the sunbeam in the heavens streamed with his heavenly light through all the darkest vapours of the most polluted part of earth and yet remained unstained in the brightness of its own purity cheeras all christian charity muastbe of the same family each must give himself to the work not scattering the doubtful gifts of a poisoning beneficence but by learning to sympathize with the poor to know them thoroughly so that they can appreciate their wants and then in christs own spirit to give that which can help their bodiiy necessity while it bas given already the higher gift of sylnpathy rwiich raises them out of thelr corruption but it is notgiven to many to do this and therefore it is that it is desirable to have a system such as that we now propose which while it prevents misdirected charity will reac h te uncomplaining sufferer in the reality of his mnisery i believe this society is wvell constructed for this great wrork anrd it has therefore my hearty support cheersthe motion having been carrieddr bastay moved a resolution insistinz upon the neces sity of cooperation in the ï¿½rstplace they had to get rid of sham societies those which were mismanaged or refused to publish their accounts in an intelligible form and in the second place to get rid of the overlapping of one societv on the province of another this society he believed would do this because its machinery was very simple elstic and unpretentious  it would aim at the repres sion of street begging and establish a complete sys tem of intercommunication between charitable agencies and the poorlaw when this had been accomplished and accurate information had been obtained compulsor regis tration of charitable societies would ho asked of parliament and sham societies would naturally disappearviscount hon and the on and rtev gilbert talbot having supported the motion it was unanimausly adopteda vote of thanks was resented to the
