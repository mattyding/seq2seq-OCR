charlan then rose amid cheers to deliver the annual address he said that it was notwithont a remonstrance he had consented tq preside on the pre sent occasion inasmuch as he desired the duty should devolve upon his noble and learned friend the lore chancellor who was however prevented from under taking it by his multifarious avocations he must con gratulate the society on the fact that its last year had beeni a year of progress bnt he must suggest to the council the expediency of publishing an annual volume containing not only what he might cau its transactions but some account of the discussions which fouowed the readidg of the various papers at its meetings those tapers me might add exhibited great ability ande regrettel that they were not so generally known as they deserved to be he found on referring to the obser vations which he had made when ho inaugurated the zociety in  that several great and important sub jects of legal amendment and of the advance of legal science had been submitted by him for the considera tion of the society bat he was sorry to have to say that with very few exceptions all those subjects remained precisely in the same position in which they then stood it was indeed extraordinary tbat with all the virtues of our national character there should be found mixed up so much of inertia so much unwillingness to admit the imperfec tions of eome of our institutions and so much of timidity with regard to change or improvement it was unidoubtedly true that thias in this country sel dom underwent alteration unti after the lapse of bnany years some orerwhelming occurrence arose and we then legislated very often in a hurry and in the confusion of the momnent instead of malng our amendments the re salt of deliberate judfment having given expression to those preliminary remarks he would advert to the subjects which the government now preposed to lay beforecthe peoplecof englanzd and on which a learned body like that which he had the honour of addressing ought to be the guides of the public at large one of the chief topics which he had submitted to the consideration of the society in  was the paramount necessity of an alteration in our judicial institutions he had pointed out how the province of justice which ought to be one and eutire had been divided in england into two separate districts uncoonected with one another and bow necessarv it was that they should be united to gether so that justice might be administered from a single source and not from opposite and conflicting sources lie recolected very well havingmadeasimilarstatementsome years sgoand his suggestion wasthenlooked upon as a mere dreaan that ought not to be seriously attended to it had however won its way at last and was recognized in the report of the jadicature commissiona report emanating from persons of the highest possible au thority m respect of station intellect and judg mnentas indicating an improvement which was greatly demanded in our judicial institutions the bil intro duced by the government feeble and imperfect as it was also recognized the principle for which he had long contended and he should be exceedingly glad if the members of the juridical society would direct their at tention to the subject the government proposed to form the existing courts of justice into one great corp rate boodv al the courtsto be integral members of tat body and each court to he in itself selfsufcient and armed with powers to administer every description of juris diction but although that was the principle of the bil the court were to remain the same in nmame as nowr and it was evident therefore that the same courts which now admiaistered law would have the in clination to delegate to those courts which at present ad mninisteredequityauycasearisingbeforethemwshieh happened to be governed more particularly by the principles of equi table jurisdiction so that we should not in reality attain after all anything like a perfect blending of the adminis tration of law and equity novw he wished the society thoroughly to understand the conseqernces of the present separation of the two systems lt was impossible that the mind of the judge which was confined to one department should be so much enlarged and in strueted iu the prineiples of the admanistration of justice as the mind of a judze who was trained to adnins ter the duties which belonged to the whole province of jurisprudence was it not absurd too that the highest obligations of justice as in the familiar cases of guardians and trustees should be ignored hy one set of courts and that we should be compelled to resort to another set of courts to enforce the performance of the most plain and simple moral obligatious yet such were our institutions that the most flagrant description of injusticesuch as the corrupt exercise of nower over the mind of another in the case of persons occupying positions of confidence and trust was something unknown to our ordinary legal tribuhals and which they possessed no authority to punish or redress surely it was ridiculous to have such a division in the administration of justie and although the go vernment now proposed to give that jurisdiction to which he referred yet he was afraid the change would be of hittle use until we had men who were fitted by education to administer it for it was he was afraid but too true and true without reproach to any individualthat our courtshad been so separated from one anotber that the pactitioners and judges administering one form of justice idevw but little of the principles or mode of procedure by which those were guided who administered justice under a different system tne remedy for the difficulty which he had justpointedout lay as he had stated  years ago in a more enlarged system of legal education the system of educa tion for the law had he was sorry to say for a long time languished end was even now far from being in a flourish ing state hut until there was a system of education com prehending the whole province of justice it w ould be idle to expect that we should have men who would be perfectly familiar with the universal principles of its administration and capable of presidig overcourts which were to beat once courts o lrw and conurts of equity lord mtansfield for instance had left his mark on english law but whence did he derive that enlarged comprehension of justice and that extensive power of appl iug its principles by which he was distinguished eb hdin early youth received the chief part of his education in scotuand and had become familiar with the civil law drawing from that eource the principles which he afterwards applied with so much credit and utility to the improvement of our jurispruaence he trusted therefore that the society would agree with him as to the necessity of impressing on young men who were being brought up to the profession of the law how de sirable it was that they should study the lawv in a different mode from that of mere memoiter application and with other views than those of obtaining a proficiency in the ready citation of decided cases hear hear it was use less to shut our eves to the evils which existed and if we wished to take thae place in the jurisprudence of the world which this noble country was entitled to occupy we must elevate our knowrledge of jurisprudence as a science passing from that subject to the state of our lasv he re gretted to have to say that but little in the way of im provement had been effected in that respect during the last  years that little consisted in sonme expurgation of the statutebook and in some acknowledgments of the duty of making a digest with reference to the ultimate codification of the english law on the last point he had nothing to tell the society but what was a simple matter of vexation it as said of lord bacon that when he wanted to bribe james l into a condonation of his offences he promised bim as the best gift he could confer on his felowsubjects that in three years he would make a code of english law the promise was of course neglected and yet that great man believed that which he promised to be a thing which if done would be ample atonement for all those offences which were laid to his charge as the society was weu aware a commission had been isued two or three years ago for the purpose of inquiriog into the expediency of preparing a digest of the law that commission reported that it was a ting prac ticable athing most expedent ard calculated to be most useful to the community unfortunately they accompa nied that statement with others which had a backward ten dency and the matter remained now to his great regret in a position in which the whole work hadyet tobe begun and eerformed he was glad however to be able to add thate had heard the chancellor of the exchequer not long do state that he thought no public money could be better expended than ia teo production of a digest of the lawr and he trusted the work might with these enconragingwords to look to in time be aceomplished so far as the conditiou of our law was concerned we stood completely alone in the civilized world there was not a nation in europe that had not made in that respect greater progress the code civile of italy was admirable  far supe rior to the code na poleon and why was it le would ask that with au our knowledge and the treasures of our experience for  yeara embodied in reports we could not extract the gold out of the dust cast away all the dirt bv which it was encompassed and emhbody it in a code which would remain to our credit with out having the trouble to delve and dig for it in those massesof rubbish which were called reports  hear hear the reason why that was not done he was mable to tell hut that it ought to be done no man of commonaense entertained he believed the slightest doubt it was the duty of every lawgiver not only to enact good laws but to enact theminsucha manner thatthe knowledge of them might be accessible to all was the knowledge of our law thus accessible the people placed abundant confidence in the integrity of its administratioq and deservedly so it was that confidence that had preserved our system for generallg speaing the unfortunate man who found himself under the uecessity of going to law felt that he was aboot to commit himself to some horrid unknown region abound ing in snares and pitfalls into which he entered with fear and trembling and rejoiced if by any chance after years of suffering he was emancipated from that d esert and that state oe moudage rear hear and a iaugh why shouldsuch a state o things be p ermitted to continue as allslug gards said there were lions in the path but what were those lions  in answering that question he would urge on the society not to beled away by any mre idolatry of names for there were distinguished men who talked of the nonelasticity of a code ad the impossibility of deciding cases which might arise if the law were reduced to anything like definite rules he had mentioned a short time ago in the house of lords that when dining with the late lord lyndhurst about years ago there being present an ame ricant lawyer of considerable reputation and several other men eminent in the law and thc conversation happen ing to turn on the pecaliarity of our jurisdictiou lord lyndhurst whether ironically or not he could not say expressed an opinion to the effect tbat tho highest conceivable perfection in the administration of justice was to bave one court appointed to administer alltha inferior rules of law and another the superior rules of equity a laugb ile referred to that conversation merely to show that men should not permit their own free unfettered reason to be dragged at the chariot wheels of andy man however eminent hemight be in making theso obserations be as reiinded of the old story of agool roman catholic priestwbo being perfectly ignorantof latin had a brevinry in which the word atumpsimus was substituted for the word sump sinus the printer having made a blunder the good man having read the breviary for  years regularly somebody proposed to hint that the errorshould be corrected but be insisted that he would not give up his  alumpsimus mutaeo nqmine dz nobis fabulac narratur much the same thing might with perfect truth he said of the mode in which we dealt with subjects of legal reform  but it was something to have the admission made that reform was necessaryand he trusted that we should not be long in findt ing a remedy for the existing evils leaving that subject he would briefly advert to the law of primogenitue the government proposed to abglish that law they meant to provide in cases of intestacy foran equal distribution of real property which amounted in truth to a denial of the right of primogeniture now he was not at all timid as a re former but it was one thing to reformthe law as an instru ment of the judicial administration of justice and another tbing to alter the instutions of apeopie we could easily alter the administration of the law by making it more economical in point of procedure but it was a perilous thing to alter any portion of the insti tutions of thepeople at large our present system was de rived from the great feudal principle that the polity of the country was founded on the land and made to depend on the land the proposed change was quite a different thing from an amendment primogeniture for in stance led to the sending ou of the cadets of families into the world vhere they won for tbemselves under the pressure of necessity great names and great for tunes how much did not our empire in india owe to the exertions of young cadets especially scotch who had left their homes under the pressure of the institution ofwhich he wasspeaking itwasindeedaid that anyman might prevent the operation of the now law by making awill but it should be borne in mind that when theinheritanceeof the eldst son was once stamped bythe legislature as an institution which ought not to exist things would under the influence of public opinion come to assume a very different formso that the subject was one well deserving of careful attention hearhear the noble and learned lord in the next place touched on the promised measure of the government with respect to the transfer of land observing that abroad our system of uses and trusts was unknowvn ard that in stead of them recourse was had to simple contract and agreement wrhich he said was much more effectual and in finitely less cumbroua disrmissing that subject the noble and learned lord adverted to the relations between husband and wife especially with reference to the rights of the latter with respect to property observing that there was no doubt great room for improvement in such matters in this country we adhered entirely to the proposition that marriage was a legal transfer to the husband of the wifes eersonnl property as well a of the income derived fromer rea property that was however accompanied with the condition that the gift was made in order that the husband might maintain the wife was that a trust in the proper sense of the word or was it an ob ligation that ought to be made the condition of the gift so that when the trust was not performed the gift might be resumed and placed under regulations  in justice he thought it was so and probably to that extent most of those whom he had the honour to address would be willing to accept an alteration of the law he would how ever suggest to the members of the society that they should examine the different bills which might from timeto time be introduced into parliament on the subject and see how it was proposed to meet the difficulty as to how far the wife was to be made to contribute to the necessities of the family ie next came to the measure which the gs veriment had introduced on the subject of naturalization and neutrality he had striven for years during the govern ment of lord palmerston to procure the sanotion of the principle that aliens might be permitted to hold land in this country lord palmerston however held pecu liar views on the subject and he was unable to carry out his object the principle was now being acted upon and the issue would be he hoped the produc tion of the best results he begged in conclusion earnestly to direct the attention of the society to the various ques tions to which he had alluded because the expression of the opinions of such a body upon them was the best way to secure that they should he understood and thus a great benefit would by ita means be conferred upon the coramu nity cheerson the motion of sir p colquhomn seconded by mr naizpr higgis a vote of thanks was unanimously passed to the noble and learned lord at the close of his address and the proceedings terminated
