the ecumenical councilerh oub special correspondentromb maroh the council has been sitting three successive days and tomorrowthereistobenothing bu tthousualcere moniestodaymakesthefourthggiventothe amended schema on matters of faitb and consequently to what may bo called the second stage of discussion by thisatime the fathers ought to be rubbing off their angular points and the machine ought to work smoothly but the contrary is the case even the americanbishops begin to see that the best chance of getting home before july lies in the failure rather than the success of the council the new discus sion opened fair enough on fridav for there was little of it a lon report had to be read and pleas for absence received simor tizzani and the bishop of ivrea repeated the old objections to the schema and declared that it had not been really amended by the committee on faith in ascordanco with the opinions expressed in the former discus sion in fact that it was substantially the same we have the best possible authority for this the popes privileged journals which serve him with more zeal than tact have been loudly trumpeting to the world that the amended schema is quite as strong as ever only ingeniously cast in a new shape which looks like a chanae but is not one however these three speakers lifted the dis guise and found their old friend come back again by the time they had spoken the council had to rise and accompany ilis holiness in his usual lenten station on emerging from st peters the first thing tho french bishops and their sympa thizers heard was that they had been listen ing to latin speeches in the council hall while a mass was celebrated for the soul of montalembert a hundred yards down the street they had to pass the spot as they went home on tuesday something or other seems to have come to a head and various strangers who that day went for the first time to see the fathers leave the council reported loud and discordant sounds within for some time before the opening of the doors what was it has been the universal inquiry there are conflicting reports as to the names but by the better authority the speakers were strossmayer schwartzenberg and two other  opposing fathers who all spoke with what is called violence against the schema whether in its new or original form and that the two former were silenced over and over again here are you launching anathemas said schwartzen berg against those who deny the first articles of the christian faith nay against those who do not believe in a god at aul what is the use of it will they care about being called unholy when they dont think there is such a thing as holiness they will only accept the quarrel if the council must decree let it do so simply these decrees have longwinded doctrinal preambles which nobody wiu read and which wiu only commit us to language which we have not time to examine a council ought not to argue that is to descend into the common arena whom is the argument with if with us we dont dispute what is de creed if with the world it will take up the argument and leave the decree alone the council had better leave atheists to their own condemnationhowever he did not insist much on this objection and it seems to be expected that this part of the schema wil pass without much further alter ation he then passed to the decrees wbich con demn the tenets of protestantism and leave no hope of salvation to the holders this is not the time to hurl anathemas at all protest ants in a lump instead of winning them to the faith it will only drive them further away it will widen the gulf between them and the church many protestants are models of conduct and high feeling hiamanity recognizes their merits and feels its obligation to them it wiu take their side this is not a crisis for the revival and exaspe ration of old dissensions it is a time to pacify to recon cile and to show that unity is not quite beyond the hope of mendo angelis thought it his duty to call him to order he was wandering from the subject schwartzenberg attempted to continue his speech but found he had lost the thread of it and walked down from the pulpit in a state of irritation gin oulhiacjast promoted from grenoble to lyons was expected to speak as strongly as he did in january but his promotion appears to have had the usual effect on his style for he was calm and moderate in his opposition to the amended schema when he sat down strossmayer rose to take up the thread of schwartzenbergs speech this he said was not the th century when catholics and protest ants were at open war and when their words were in accordance with their deeds these outrageous anathemas will not win a single protestant will they win over this man he exclaimed naming him  or that man or that man or vill they even attach a stigma on these when they fail to win its useless you cannot send half the civilized world all in a mass to eternal reprobation by merely discharging so many words at them among those protestants there are many men of a pulre faith with deep and sound convictions unhappily they cannot agree with us in some doctrinal or canonical points but they are mirrors of probity and honour the proper business of a council in these days is conciliation and for that purpose the utmost delicacy and moderation aro re quiredhere capalti hardly restraining himself gently called strossmayer to order he resumed in the same strain capalti called to order again wth the same result a third time strossmayer was called to order and returned to the charge more vigor ously than ever capalti could restrain himself no more and peremptorily commanded silence strossmayer raised his voice and addressed capalti he would no longer endure to be called to order when he was speaking to the pur pose and he made a solemn protest against calls to order which were themselves out of order and infringements of the liberty of dis cussion all on strossmayers side including many americans rose to their feet and joined in his protest the other sidea crowd of italian and spanish bishopsdid the same and in themidst of the confusion there were even cries of  viva pio nono r vivano i cardinali legati i in the midst of the disturbance with some hope of calming it patrizzi a personage of great dignity rose and ut tered what some call his single speech in the council  you protest against us well we protest against you flowever there was an end of the sitting and the council rose strossmayer it seems has said a good deal more than is commonly lknown but of a sort to rankle in the roman breast whatever he now says is interpreted by what he has said before and he will hardly now have a chance of a quiet hearing on being once called to order with the question w was he not ashamed to use those words in a place where reposed tho princes of the apostles v he replied that it was the peculiar and awful sanctity of that placeo which inspired him to tell these truths and that he invoked the princes of the apostles who repose therest peter and st paulto testify to the loyalty of his sentiments and the truth of his wordsso much for these debates which all say promise to cbe more lively and outspoken than ever it is not easy for an outsider to understand even the announcements which are permitted to appear but if i am to take words in their natural sense the dogma of infalli bility is included in the matters now before the council as an amendment to the original schema france you have probably heard before this has asked to see beforehand the matters to beoproposedto the council and has received from the pope an indignant refusalmartch the ceremony today has been at the minerva that is the churchbuilton thesite of thetemple of that divinity it includes a grand procession from the vatican a service in the church and a distribution of dowries by the popes own hand to a consider able number of girls educated and portioned by a socioty which takes its name from the day  the church is the one most frequented by english members in the roman  obedience and not many years ago was restored at the cost of  english money unfortunately without an adequate result it is the only church here that can be caued gothio and how to apply that style to variously coloured marbles was a difficulty which has not been solved with much success in this instance as the edifice is only as large as a firstelaas london parish church it would scarcely hold a titho of the people wyho would wish to get in for everything to day is as at st peters the procession one could see without danger and it combines today a sin gular feature which it is scarcely possible for an englishman to anticipate without grotesquo asso ciations i have only to confess that i felt ashamed of them wyhen i saw the reality as i did on the blidge of st angelo the popes stato carriage all gold the six horses with grou a tapping tho pope bleasinall about him a second carriage with six horses a dozen other of municipal magnificence dragoonsand so forth are all as usual but the feature of this one day of the year is that a cardi nal bears a cros before the popes carriage riding a whito mule that is the programme what i saw was a dignified figur  in a flowing robe of light purple with a skullcap riding a ratherundersizedgraymulewithhis eyes tiedon the tall cross he bore upright before him and appa rently in devotion jalfadozen shining halberds surrounded him and the silver cross rose just above its satellites of steel all took off their hats to the crossand a few seconds after knelt to his holiness the day fortunately is brilliant the point of pressure has been the piazza before the church the onewithanobelisk on theback of an elephant idid not venture there the windows of the minerva hotelitmustbaveahundredlooking intothe piazza were to be occupied by the fathers of the council sol was told the day reminds me once more of the enormous amount of work expected from a pope and done diligently faithfully and cheerfully by this old man in his seventyeighth year yesterday he paid a long visit to the exhibition talking with the exhibitors and having his jokes with all about him he has to give interviews to all these seven hundred bishops and the enemy says to put a strong pressure on all who are recom mended to him for the application of the su preme torture a greab deal has been said abouthis visits to the aged and invalid bishops lodged and nursed in the canonical apartments attached to st peters nothing can be more touching than the attention but some of the objects of it have felt it oppressive they have had to make their last will and testament in favour of infallibility other bishops who have been dis posed or compelled by circumstances to adopt a neutral or a moderate line in the council havefound themselvessorely tried in a personal interview they find it vain to declare their devotion or their since rity his holiness tells them plainly they are not on his side  they are among his enemies they are damaging the good cause their loyalty is not sound it is enough that they have signed what they should not or not signed what they ought on the roman system there is nothing wonderful in this personal interference of the head of the church what i most marvel at is that it is all done by this old man and that it is done with a success which provokes the indignation of those who conceive their cause hurt by it even when pius ix does make a mis takeand certainly he made a very bad one in the case of miontalemberthe retrieves it not en tirely perhaps but with amazing promptitude and decision thus passes one more of the days on which there was to have been a public session and something declared to the world there never is an ordinary sitting now without applications for leave to return home twelve american bishops have gone off and all the rest would if they could with any decency they avow without the least reserve that they are utterly disgusted with the whole affair it is quite out of their line they can do nothing except say  amen to what is done they dont want the decrees but know that they must help to pass them they have always most faithfully and honestly assumed the pope to be in fallible and dont see the necessity of saying it in a more express and ostentatious manner and so provoking a quarrel with people they now get on well with as for the cardinals and pre lates really doing the work of the council the ame ricans admit that they are wonderful men in theo logy and in the canon law in books and in latin but call them children in business and in the affairs of the world they feel themselves humbled to be actingthepartof mutes and dummies when such per sons have the lead and most certainly will carry off all the honours and prizes anybody who made it his business to cultivate the acquaintance of either the american or the irish bishops could send you columns of such complaints but of course you would never learn much of the intentions or the strategy of an army from those who admit them selves to be common soldiers and no more i see it boasted by the by not only in the ultramontane papers but also in the liberal italian that all the ability all the learning all the eloquence of the coancil is in the italianls first then the spaniards and after them the french and germans whereas they boast the english irish and americans dont know what to do have nothing to say and are simply lost here it is the latin race they con clude that is the soul of the world
