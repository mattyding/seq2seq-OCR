asn indeed contended that the crown upon proper representa tions boing otade to jt was reaiy to forego its rights in suclh casoa bat even if that were literally tho fact it furnished no good reason why a law vrhich was a blot on our juraprudence sbould be allowed to continue he found that outof wl whidh had been forfeited to the crown lin  l nid been returned while out of suem of l forfeited in   had been re turned  and he would put it to the right hon gentleman the chanceuoo of the excheqier whether with all his zeal for the publio revenue it was desirablo for so small an isnensit that a right which operated very offen sively sbould be maintained when the subject was last before the house he had mentioned the caae of an iron master with alarge tradingconnezion against whom a ver dict of manslaughter had been returned by a coroners jury in consequence of a fatal accident having occurred through the carelessness of his superintendont in his absence that verdict was afterwards quashod and the gentleman in ques tion had since died his death it was said having been ac celerated by the shock which his constitution had received by his dread of the forfeiture of his property after the verdict he retired from his trading connexion because he would not subject his property to the peril of a risk which no care on his part might be able to prevent was it de sirable he would ask that in a great trading commu nity like ours such an impediment in tho way of commerce should be permitted to continue  in a house composed so largely of liberal members he be lieved a grievance of this magnitude need only to be men tioned to be abolished and he therefore with confidonce moved the second reading of the billmr  morgan supported the measure on the ground that the existing law was totauy unsuited to the require ments of the present day no doubt the biu touched upon a question of great magnitude  but on the principle that haif a loaf was better than no bread he would accept it with pleasure rather than wait for a comprehensive measuremr jessel heartily supported the bill for a variety of reasons amongthem wasthefact thatpracticallythelaw was not always enforced and that when it was enforced it came in the nature of a fine not regulated by the enormity of tho offence but by the amount of property the convict hap pened to possess remarking upon the old law under which the king took the felons lands for a year and a day on the plea of corruption of blood which disabled a mans heirs from succeeding him he remarked that this corrup tion of blood had been limited by an act of george iv to cases of treason and murder and it was now quite timo it was altogether done away with he also suggested the adoption of the practice in vogue in somae foreign countries of giving comnpensation to persons robbed out of the effects of the thief if he hadany instead of limiting therestoration to the actual stolen property or tho proceeds from it  and besides this he recommended that compensation should be given to a person on account of personal injuries roeoived at the hands of the felon the jury fixingtho amount and leaving it to the prosecutor to levy the amonnt on the felons goods but he thought provisions should be in serted in the bill forfeiting a government pension in the mcas of felony and rights of citizenship also so that no con vict could be returned to sit in parliament for the better consideration of these points herecommendedthat the bill be referred to a select committeemr bruce approved the measure and promised that the government would facilitate its progress he joined in the proposal to refer it to a select committee and thought the suggestions as regarded compensation contained in the government bill of  would form a good basis of operations on that head it was questionable whether pro visions preventing felons sitting in parliament would not unnecessarily encumbor the bill but he trusted that the clauses of the measure would be so concisely framed that as little as possible would be left to the discretion of minis ters of the crown in carrying out its provisionsthe bill was read a second time and ordered to be re ferred to a select committeeparty processions ireland billmr w johnston rose to move the second readirng of this bill the act it proposed to abolish was passed in  and admitted by all parties to have been emineaitly unsatisfactory in its working besides having been admi nistered with great partiality it was with peculiar plea sure that he was present at a meeting in belfast presided over by the duke of abercorn when the following resolu tion was come to  that inasmuch as the partyprocessions act has greatly exesperated party feeling and led to the disturbance of the public peace this meeting is strongly of opinion that a law which experience has proved to operate most unfairly against one particular section of the popuation and which has remained a dead letter in its operation as regbards other portions of the populatlon of ireland is unjust and should no longer be allowed to remain on the tatutebookin justice to the government he was bound to say their actions had condemned the statute for they had allowed it to remain a dead letter  and he submitted that acts so treated should not be allowed to remain on the statute boolc he could not join in the strictures passed on the go vernment for not putting the act in force and he strongly censured the action of grand juries in this respect if grand juries wrere to refrain from meddling in politics it would be more to their credit and thebonefit of the country he did not in bringing forward this bill seek to inter fere with any particular party he wished for equal rights to all and could not see why it should be penal to wear green in tipperary any more than to wear orange in ulster lear hear he regretted the absence of the hon member for tralee the odonoghue who lest year susthreass measure and observed  the maln obhoct of the act was no doubt to prevent the recarrence ox exhibitions which whenever they took place must necessarily wound the feelings of every catholict nmight be said do you then mean to give full scope to thoso who woula insult and annoy your catholic brethren his answer was that tho law had failed to accomplish the aim proposed that like all other penal laws it created and fosterea a spirit of resistance to authority and that while partially removing from public vier certain emblems much cherished by some it had given fresh vitality to feelings and passins which would only yield to influences far differ ent trom those that a penal law could bring to bearhe quite believed this and he would also trouble the house with an extract from a speech by tho fiirst lord of the treasury on the th of february when he saidthe fact is that the infasion both of english and of scottish blood has poured into the elementa whereof the irish character is composed a spirit of pridoe and of ready selfdefencethat sentiment which ha made england and scotland erer prompt to rise ia defence of what the people deliberately believe to hs their rightsthose words bad been readaud pondered overln ulster and had fostered the feeling they decribed lhear the only reason alleged by the chief secretary for the maintenance of theact lsst s ession was the fact that its repeal during the passage of the oihurchl bill would have been tantamount to gving the oranuemen a licence to make demonstrations outrage and bloodshed prevailed in canada while on act similar to this was on the statutebook for it encouraged those who ought to have lived in peace with each other to make attacks and rival demonstrations the act was re peaed unanimouslyand on the th of march the hibernian societies had their processions and on the anniversary of the battlo of the boyne the orangemencommemorated the triumph of liberty unless it was desired to drain ulster of its loyal inhabitants and to send them to a more froe and happy land he hoped the house would assent to the repeal of tis act in ulster it could not bh sid that thero was any tendency in these processions to disterb tho peace of ireland chief justice lawson in charging the grand jary at belfast on the th inst said it would be scarcely possible to find in any part of her pouiestyi dornininsa county and town having such a vast population and such varied industry in which a smaller amount of crime would be presented for the consideration of the judge of assize than that which is presented on the present occasion    i have also observed with great pleasure that there is on this calendar no case of riot in volving a party complexionno case of agrrian ontrage therefora these circamstauces istify me as i now do in congratulatlng you very siucerely on the state ia which you find this great countymr justice kecoh in charging tho grand jury at down patrick on the ist inst said of the cases to be dealt with they are al such crimes as miht be expected to arise in any portion of the empire and lsear a very favourable contrast indeed to the extent of your county and the large population within it this isa circumstance which i cannot avoidsayingcontrastsvery favourably with other portions of the kingdom and it is highly creditable in my humble opinion to the magistrato tho the resident gentry and to aul classes of the popution of the county of downthese were the words of two eminent judges of different creeds he did not maintain that orange demonstrations were a means of preserving the peace but certinly tvoso who took part in them were not participators in the outrages which disgraced iroland he must pays tribute to the good feeling vhich was springing up on the part of reman catholics who were desirous of living at peace

chief se cretary for ireland professing that he was not much iix love with this enactmont promised an inquiry to enable the government to decide whether it ought to be maintained and enforced more

in dabli was a catholio brigade comminanded by the bfarquis wollodey and  far freem thera being any joalous there was not a ioman catholo wvho did not roioioo iu the saccoxx of king williasand in the defeat of king jaues there was not a catholie who did not bold the character of the former in the greatest respect and treat the latter with the severest contempt the spirit of a great portion of the community was not to bo put down by any feoble enactment but the state might control that which it could not repress although the measure of last year was a message of peace to a certain portion of the people of ireland to the protestants and orangemen it was not peace but a sword protestaunt orangemen felt that thiey were betrayed and cast off by the parliament of england ard was it to be wondered at that they were somewhat luke warm in their attacbment to authority and that tbey had ceased to regard the union of tho two countries with the feelings they formerly did wo now had an opportunity of repairing that wrong and bo hoped the opportunity would not be allowed to pass those who cave tho govern ment warm support in psssiug the peace preservation bill were therepresentatives of the constituencies who asked the government to sasentto this measure and would it not be wise in the government to respond heartily and generously to the request mado for the repeal of this odious and penal enactmentmir coioiester fortesouei do not proposo to detain the houso at any length  but it will be convenient that i should state in a few words the view the govern meat take of the bill of my hon friend opposite i must say at once that the hon member regards prooessions and party demonstrations in uister much mora favourably than i do it is perfectly truo that ulster in many respects en joys an amount of peace and freedom from crime of which it is justly proud yet i cannot in any way connect that comparative peace with the practice of holding party pro cessions on the contrary ulster enjoys freedom from many kinds of crime not in consequence of bat in spite of these party demonstrations the effects of which are not con fined to mster itself but many of the worst results of which are felt at a distance an orange demonstration in ulster prodaces a green demonstration in cork and vice versd and that kind of seosaw of party domonstra tion goes on between north and south year after year thereforo i am not prepared to sing the praises of party processions in ulster or anywhere else and i nm not pre pared to accept the doctrine which my hon friend lays down very broadly and very candidly and fairly that every one is in this matter to be left by the law to do as he pleases my hon friends doctrine is let all whatever they may be have their processions so long as we have ours  and this is a simple and easy remedy but it is not what is at present consistent with tho peace and safety of ireland my hon friend complained of no inquliry having been made since last session anod he implied that there had been something liken violatioo of a rlede given by me but if he wll refer to what i said he wifi fnd i merely claimed for the government the liberty of making inquiry if it waro necessary either by means of a commission or througar the sources of information which they have at their command it cannot be said there has been no in quiry because thero has been an inquiry which thl go vernment directed and which though it embraced only oneparticular caso ws of importance and threw considerable tight upon this matteri mean the inquiry by commission into the derry riots the report of whicb i strongly com mend to the attention of my hon friend and to any one who wishes to knowr what those en both sides of politics think of great party demonstrations and processions in ire hand the government have also information of their own and they bave given still further consideration to the mat ter beyond thatthey gave last year i shall have pleasure in assenting on the part of the government to the second reading of my hon friends bill because we do not think it right or expedient that the resent party processions act should bo continued i boyd it to be exposed to many of the severe criticisms passed upon it by the hon gentleman opposite and by others i concur in much that was said by my noble friend opposite  i think there is no doubt the act was directed against the processions of a party and its definitions and technical restrictions and conditious have had the effect of making it unequal in its operation without any intention when it was passed to bring about that result it is undoubtedly true as my noble friend said that owing to the technical provisions and de finitions of the act precessions of one character come within its reach while processions of another charac ter which may be far more formidable and dangerous far more contrary to the law and inimical to the peace of the coantry cannot be dealt with under the provisions of the statute i was glad to bear niv hon friend in his opening observations are eredit to the present overnment for thieir desire in administering the la vto deal equally with all he knows that this is thc spirit in which tho govern ment have actel hiealso said with truth that the case of the procession at dublin was no exception to that rule if it had come within the party processions act we should have been doing no less in not putting it down than we did in the case of the great demonstration in ulster  but we were advised that it did not come within tho technical provisions of the act the banners flags and emblems used wero those of the trades of dublinand not such as in the opinion of our law advisers were aimed at by the act what was done onthat occasion was strictly police action and was done toprevent unoecessaryand excessivedemonstration in connexion with a perfectly lawvful public meeting as tho demonstration in its original form would have caused very great inconvenience anddisturbance in the streets of dablin thoso wbo organized and conducted it com lied in the main with tho requirements of the policeand took care that thore should be no collision in the streets and that the limitod vwishes of tho government should be strictly carried out while i say that the government accede to the motion and i consent to the second reading of the bill i must not be un derstood to imply that the government think that in the present condition of ireland public openair processionsmay be dernitted witholtl strmyd tiy n na tht we thnk it vwonud be safe at present to dfeprive the government of any power of dealing with such processions no matter where in what form or under what circumstances they may he held it will be my duty after easter to bring in a bil for the purpose of giving certain powers to the govern ment of dealing with processions in ireland everywhere and under all circumstances and i hope the provisions of that bil will give satisfaction i can assure the mover and seconder of this bill they will find all inequality removed by the provisions of the government measure but we can not agree that in tho present condition of ireland the sub jeot requires no legal regulation at alllord claud ahailton supported the second read ing of the bill because he wished to remove from tho statuntebook a law which was so framed that it conveyed to a portion of our follow subjects the idea that it was directed against them and which waa not carried out with impartiality at one time there ws a tendency to discou rage these processionsp they were becoming harmless and less frenent and far less obnoxious to the catholics who played mn the bands and otherwise took part in them but what had revised them and caused so much hostile feeling was that the overnment rbnlected to carry out the law with impartiality in the south on the occasion of the  meeting at dublin which was striotly illegal the place was for six or eight hours com pletely in possession of those nvho were acting iilenaily with the lord mfayor at their head and nothing wras donebut oraugemen of tho north were prosecuted dragnged before the authorities and pnished flow then could any one say the law was impartially administeredf the oblect or the dublin demonstration was ostensibly to found a statuo to oconnell but thoe board which used to stand in sackvilleatreet inscribed  site of the statue to oconnell had been removed as a violation of the act in any parti cular was held to be a violation of the whole act thero could be no doubt of the illegality of the dublin meeting which indeed according to the reports in the fretmain snd t
