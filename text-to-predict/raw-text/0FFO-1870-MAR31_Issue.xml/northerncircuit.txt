the injury doue to his crpos and trees by the noxious vapoura poured forth fror the works it appeared from the statement ofihis case by his counsel that in s by a wellknown suit which he carried successftuy to the house of lords the plaintiff shut up some neigh bouring works caued tho bold tbpper works in  however which was a damp season with prevail ing winds from the northwest the direction of the defendants works he found that he suffered most pal pable injury in the way ofthe shriveuing and killing of the vegetation by the vapour coming from them and ne gotations were then commenced with a view to abating the nuisance in sms the seasou being dry the injury and nuisance were not so great but in last year they burst out again in fuol vigour and negotiations failing this action was brought the damage was deposed to by a great number of farmes and similar wituesses who saw the smoke and noted tho result and the amount was proved by valuersmr grov for the defendants said that comning as he did from the south wales circuit where works of this sort abounded it was rather new to him to fiud damage of this kind pro ed by farmers instesa of by scientific witnesses who could prove demonstratively by chymical analysis whether the damage complained of was due to the tapours of copper smokel sulphuric acidor not the ordinary vpour of copper smoke in dry weather he explained was sulphurous acid which did little or no harm but in damp weather it was changed to sulphnric acid which an doubtedly did harm but it was not half so deleterious as many of the gases discharged from many other works in st elens such as alkali works and as there was an enormous number of worls there supplied in al with some  chim neys it was he argued most unfair to charge the whole ds mage to the sutton copper works when in fact the real amount inlicted by those works alone must be almost in finitesimal in no place could works of this sort more conve niently be carried out than in st helens where in all there were  tons of coal consumed in the year and  m tons of sulphur given off and the plaintiff who came from wlgan must have well inown the nature of the district when he bought the property there btlt all nui sances were a matter of degree in a country where people could not live in common without giving and taking some what and if after taking al other contributions to the nuisance awny the jury found that there was no damage due to the sutton works amounting to a nuisance the defendants wonld be entitled to a verdict and at all events they would jot be liable to pay for damage beyond that which had been actually infficted by themselves for other wise the plaintiff would after shutting up one set of works after another recover from each in turn in respect of the whole damage suffered from au combinedlfor the defendants a number of scientific witnesses were caled to prove that there was no damage done traceable to the sutton copper workl specifically and that if the smoke arising from them were left to itself and were not combined with a larger mass from st helens it would not extend to the plaintiffs park so as to affect it injuriously while valuers proved that the whole amount of damage done by the entire smoke of the district when esti mated in money vas a mere trifle and that the main causes of the depreciation of the timber were wind and old age it was therefore contended that no case of nuisance was proved against the defendants works which if left by themselves would not have done any appreciable damage tothe plaintiffs propertyand that the most whioh eoula be charged against them was pro ducinga certain amount of discomfort which any one coming to live in such a neighbourhood must be prepared to en counter eor the glaantiff it was
