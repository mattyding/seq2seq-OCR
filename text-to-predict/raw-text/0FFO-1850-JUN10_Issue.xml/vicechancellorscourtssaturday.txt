would fall due on the th of june following accepted b mr simpson on the solicitor of the executors calling on thm dais said he bad not the bill and soon after he wrote to the solcitor to say it was at mr peplows who had discounted it the executors not believing that the bill was genuine refused to pay it davis had said that  of the bil was for considertion but the remainder was puresent from captain simpson to him mr peplow broug ht an action against the executorbut after the trial had proceeded some length his counsel submitted to a nonsuit the bilu of exchiange was dated october   at  months and captain simpson died on the th of februm folowing to this case davis by his answer wore asifolows that he foraerly carriedon buin nessa as dentist at no  pallmall but did so nowat bsomersetstreet and occasionally adverts underthe style of  cartivrigiit davis and sons which is a fictitious firm and such practice is a genemal pactice in the profession or calling to which he belongs and signifies nothing more than beinga member of that partndlar school orhcing ofwhichthe name of  cartwri  ast itheprincia lorhead andtmoreover that the name  cartwright was the christian name of one of his davia sons he denied what was said about the e but said the fact was that he told the solicitor that captain simpson who wasavery old man gave him the bill to keep his teeth in good order and generally to attend on him for that purpose during the remainder of his life  that the bil except the signature was in his daviss band writing and it was writter on a s stamp of  that mr peplow as holder of the bill with the knowledge and under the direction of davis brought the action that captain simpson had employed him before for his teeth that he was a very old man and required two sets of teeth at a time of the value of from  to  aset and after the date of the bill he davis suppled the captain with two sets the last on the th of january  that mr peplow took the blut in consideration of a debt due for medicel attendance amount ing to about  and that the action was brought for their joint benefit mr peplow by his answer said that davis told him he had a bill which was sure to be paid when due but which he wished to be presented by a third party  and believing this to be true h agreed tobecome the holder and when paid he mr peplow was to retain his demand  igs and this was the only consideration he ever gave for the billmr russell and mr hislop clarke were for the plaintiff mr goldsmith for mr davis contended that the im potaitons of forgeryv and fraud in the bill had not been sub stanttiated  and that although an action had been brought in which mr peplow had been nonsuited the court would permit the defendant davis to bring an action and for that purpose would follow the usual practice of the court and retain the bill for  months but he could not under take to bb bound to bring any action until november or shortly before that timiemr malins and mr eddis for mr peplow argued that the only point for them to maeet was that of costs and as their client had already paid betwreen  and  for costs of the action he ought not to be visited with any of this suit he had believing the representations of davis taken the bill and brought the action and had sufrdeogfr that imprudence ufrdeog omr russel was not called on to replyhis hoxouitwill mr peplow bring any other actionmr malinsno  he has sufferedl quite enough already his honoustwhether if an action on the bill had not been brought or had not been tried i should have thought it right in such s case as this to treat the matter as one merely legal and retained the bill for  months in order to see that legal proceedings could be takeni and with what re suit i will not say in this case an actioni has been brought upon the bill which though in the name of one of the de fendants i must consider for every effectual and substantialuroesthe action of beth and that that action has  donthe merits as i understand the plaintiffs wit nesews were examined and he did not apply to postpone the trial on the ground of the absence or illness of a materia witness the action was tried and the witnesses were pro duced and hils counsel elected for him to be nonsuited at the conclusion of his case i must therefore hold that the action has failed on the merits and therefore if there is an equitable jurisdiction here i apprehend the court is not bound to take that course which is so common where there is a merely legal question to be tried that is of retklning the bill for a twelvemouthi with the view to an action being brought i am of opinion that if an action had been p roper it should be brought at the approaching asaizes but one of the defendants wi ll hve nothing fur ther to do with it and i do not wonder at it and the other will not bind himself by any terms or obligations to try before november is there then any equitable jurisdic tion here  in the first place the suit is to deliver up a document which is impeached for fraud a documentwhich has not beeai the subject of any judgmenit at law except the judgment of nonsuit and therefore the document cannot he said to be extinguished at la as to its real legal effct if there is therefore fairly to be inferred a case of fraud the courtclearly has jurisdiction to order it to be delivered up or to grant an injunction the story is this that a very old insai al captain simpson having rooms in greenwich hoe pitalaves the bill payable at eight months after date to thei xendant davis a dentist purporting to be generslly for value received and the bargain as the dentist says is that hie the derntist shall during his the captains whole life attend to his teeth and supply him with new ones the blltis for  s and the body of it inx the hand writing of the dentist and such part of it if any as was not his was in the handwriting of the captain and that being only the signature it is said to have been given by the captain no onae else bigbthe captain died before iheu was due and it dosntappear thiat any one else knew of it before that evenat it does not appear that the contract to atltend the teeth alnd to supply new ones was ever reduced to writing or that there is any evidenice of it except the recollection of this dentist and captain or one of them and men some time have treacherous memories there is not only this strange state of circumstances hut there is the suspicious cirgumatance that the dentist after the eaptains death in accurately wrote and spoke on the subject of the bill and the clrcmnstance also of the bringing of the action ia the naie of mr peplow another medical man to whom he owed a sum of between  and  and the action being brought onx the joint account of the two now if the case anibints to impiluted fraud where the court is to judge of facts is the plaintiff entitled to ask the coulrt as a judge of fiact whether an inference of fraud of gross fraud cana be drawn from the case as davis himself pete it he is and i think it quite impossible to ask any reasonable being to draw any other inference from such materials as are now before me the case ha many points of resem blance to that of dent v bennetta very remark able case in which a mnedicalmanp in the north of lincolnshire received from an old man a largo sum on a bargaia to attend to his health to his whole frame and not a part as here in every material part of that case it agrees with thisand there the jurisdiction of the court was exercised his honour concluded by de creeing the liijunction and directing the bill to he delivered up observing that asmr peplow had parted with the bill to davis the latter must dehiver it up and the defendants to ray all the costsmr uoldsmjthi said mr davis bad been in court for three or four days with the bill but although he was here now he bad not the documentt ae defendant davis saidlie could produce it in two or hig eouraitvery frequently hanpens that a
