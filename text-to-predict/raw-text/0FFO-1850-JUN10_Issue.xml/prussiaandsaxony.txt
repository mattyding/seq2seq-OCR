the austrian congress of states had arrived at frankfort it was expected the plenipotentiaries ol the other governments would shortly arrive the city has been disturbed by some serious conflicts be tween the prussian bavarian and austrian sol diers of the garrison at the last review the re port was spread that during the firing some cartridges were discharged at the prussian line that represented the enemy to be attacked by the austrian regiment there was no foundation for th rnmour but some of the prussian soldiers insisted it was true and in consequence of the feelng thus created a severe conflict took place between two parties of the rival regiments in the neighbouring village of bornheim peace was not restoredtill the guard was sent for from the garrison loaded their arms in

attend and the court is so overwhelmed with excuses for absence and not serving that it has determined to select them only once a month out of  persons from whom the selection is made it is almost impossible to secure the appearance of about  all that are required even by the plan of naming  every fortnight to serve this number will be now reduced one half this universal desire to evade the per formance of an important duty will be the ultimate destruction of the institution for the feeling seems to increase rather than diminish the citizens make it a positive grievance that they should be required to do anything or form any judgment of themselves on a matter with which they have no connexion the government some day wiu take advantage of this more than apathy to get rid of the system altogether and then the very same men who will not cross their thresholds to work it will cry out against reaction a similar indifference prevails at all the elections and is also on the increasethe state of affairs in saxony and the internal policy adopted by its government excite as much interest here as the affairs of prussia itself the total rupture between the cabinet and the cham bers the dissolution of the latter the summoning the former legiilature which was considered as long since defunct and the publication of the decrees against the press have drawn the attention of all germany to the state which a year ago was in the greatest peril and one of the two which were com pelled to seek the military aid of prussia to rescue them from the danger it is asked how can the same government have acquired the strength to risk being the first openly to undo the revolution and revoke all the concessions to the popular agitations of that year the general convicion is that it is butan indication of its havingfinauy separated itself not only from the bund but the more moderategeneral policy of prussia and accepted without reserve the austrian alliance with the as surance of austrian support saxony is com paratively a small ttate between two powerful neihbours it could increase the influence of either in rermany by a close aliance with it but cannot act quiteaindependently of them last year austria wasnot in a position to help it and it turned to prussia after the military service received it could not absolutely reject the political alliance ofered it and it signed the treaty of the bnd when the streets of its onpital had not been cleared of the traces of the insurrection but the connexion was never a hearty one and the leaning of saxony is more towards austria it now follows that ten dency and austria auxious to recover all the influ ence it can receives its proffers willingly the recent acts of the saion government are supposed to be the consequenieof an austrian alliance atd are variously judged generally the german de mocrats s iwt displeatsed at any exercse of arbitrary power howvever extreme  it hat fallen into  state of political

it refuses to accept or make use of the political power still in its hands looks for ward to another convblsion and if a next time come it wiu do wonders as they consider every re pressive act of the government likely to hasten the vollielon the democrats express rather a grim catis factiol at the dresden decrees and their criticisnm mnay be einbodied in the short sentence  the worse the better there is another party that would be not unwilling to see the prussian government adopt the sare sutinary process against au the results of the revolution as that of saxony but against the little that remains of it it is not worth while to pro ceed so violently much that saxony has only now done at a stroke prussia has long since effected by degrees the election law the great saxon difficulty has in prussia been abrogated and changed till two chambers were obtained in which the opposition was naever dangerous and the finan cial propositions of the government all approved hiad there been anything like a chamber before  it might possibly have been recaued last year but the old landtag with its classes or standl was an institution more fitted for the middle ages than the present time the saxon chambers of  were at least elected by a law no older than  in prussia at that period there was no election law at all the saxon decree against the right of association and holding public meetings is nearly word for word the same as the several main provisions of the prussian law on the subject passed in the last session the same object has been effected here in a more re gular manner the edict against the press is the only part of the last measures of the saxon go vernment that prussia has not anticipated but within the next three days the new orders will be published and as they may be expected to be more severe than the existing law the difference be twveen the two governments on this poiat will be lessenedthe latest measure of the saxon ministry is a decree dated yesterday th restoring to the cri minal code the punishment of death abolished on the d of january last year the decree however is prospective only and does not apply to crimes committed since the abolition of
