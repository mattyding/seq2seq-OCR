continue to wate their own time and to draw largely on the patience of their constituents by their fanatical selfish and shortsighted wrangling regarding the slavery ques tion aompromise after compromise has been pro posed each succeeding one has been found as unacceptable as its antecedent and on certain points the issue appears as vwide as ever between those who advocate the extension of slavery in the country and those who as earnestly insist not only on its confinement within its present boundaries but its absolute extinction in places under the especial jurisdiction of congressthe struggle has been and wil be severe but the north and tle west will be found decided nor will any weak dread of consequences induce them to swerve from their stern determination to maintain the position they have assumed their strength will for the future be made manifest by their prepon derance in the legislature of the nation and while they will respect the constitution and the law of property they will by moral force compel the slave holding states to be content with the recognition of their present rights and to look to them for the pro tection and support without which theirffuture posi tion must necessarily be anarchical and insecureit is supposed by many that the brigand expedi tion lately fitted out for cuba meets with sympathy and support from the south in the hope that the future influence and aggrandisement of that sec tion of country may be enhanced by the acqui sition of the island if so there never was a greater mistake made and never was a step taken more likely to frustrate its own design the move ment at the present moment will more than any thing else tend to unite the opponents to slavery in their firm resolve to confine the institution to its present limits and to exclude it from every part of this country which their numerical strength in congress enables them to controlregarding the desperate men who in defiance of moral and national law have enlisted in this mad adventure news has been received of a very exciting nlaturedates from eavannah are to the th inst general lopez landed on the northwest side of the island at the small town of cardenas on the th his force is reported to have been  men the garrison consisting of only  of course sur rendered after a slight resistance a larger force was said to have left new orleans and other ports in the gulf previous to general lopez but the place of their intended landing was not known it was supposed that a descent would be made on various parts of the island the city of havannah was under martial law several thousand militia had been enrolled and the resident foreigners had also been called on to take up arms in support of the authoritiesa very favourable feature in all the havannah ac counts appears to be that nothing is said of disaffection among the spanish troops or of a risingr among the inhabitants which would have been heralded with every exaggeration had any demon stration of that character been made so that the future prospects of the invaders are anything but encouraginga telegmphic report received yesterday from new orleans asserts that general quitman wvho was but lately elected governor of mdississippi had resigned that office and intended joining the expedition with a large aumber of recruits he is one of the dis banded officers who served in mexico where he was more distinguished for rashness than for ability if the telegraphic report be correct the precautions of the president should have rendered it impossible for any number of men to leave under his com mand now that so much is ascertained regarding the illegal nature of their intentionsit is deplorable to see that among the newspapers of this city the least objectionable of those which are styled the  penny press and which from their low price have the widest circulation in stead of denouncing this enterprise and show ing in strong terms the depravity and wickedness of clandestinely prowling forth to carry war with all its horrors among an unoffending population coolly calculate the chances of success another class advocates the proceedings of the robbers and one paper has been found to assume the unenviable tiotoriety of being the organ of this freebooting band while the proprietor hoists at his window their distinguishing flag and invites those desirous of enlistidg under it to inscribe their names at his officethis was carrying the matter somewhat too far and the belligerent proprietors have been held to bail for an offence against a law of  a section
