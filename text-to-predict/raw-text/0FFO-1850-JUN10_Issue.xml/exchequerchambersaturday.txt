recollection of our readers tho prisoner who was a clerk in the globe insurance company and lessee of the olympic theatre was indicted for stealirna pbeck value oog the property of tho treasurer of the gltbe inrsuamne company ee was tried before mr jue tice cresell at the central criminal court and was found guilty of stealing a piece of paper subject to a case to be laid before this courtthe attorneygeneral sir john bayley air welsby mr clarkson and mr boviu now appeared for the crown mw cockburn mr bodkin and mr bramweu appeared for the prisonermr cockburn submitted that this could not be held to be a larceny because the article or piece of paper had never been ih the possession of the prosecutors  that if the offence charged was anything it was embezzlement secondly he contended that the prisoner was a partner or shareholder in the globe insurance company and therefore could not be guilty ofsa larceny as against himself and he had this paper lauliy in his possesaion there were all the common in cidents of a partnership and although be might choose to become a servant or clerk thenstilhedid not part with his partnership rights he could not therefore be convicted of a larceny of property in which he himself had a joint interest he could not be convicted under the circumstances of steal ing his own property a third point was that he was charged as being the servant of the directors all that ap peared was that the directors had the general management of the concern but they paid all salaries out of the moneys of the company he certainly could not be considered to be the servant of the treasurer he therefore submitted that the prisoner must be dischargedtne jayroaryegmxaaa uried that the check as soon as it got into the hands of the prisoner ws held by him for his employers and that they wrere the directors therefore hav rng the possession it becnme a case of larceny he had re ceived it in the course of business to be kept by him for the use of the directors and therefore it amounted to krceny as to the second point that the prisoner being a shareholder must be considered a partner andeould not therefore have stolen from himself it was urged that messrs glyn and co had delivered the passbook containing the check to the messenger of the company and the messenger had de livqred it to the prisoner who had received it as the serant of the company he acted as the servant of the company if the prisoner took upon himself the duty f a servant it mattered not that he was a mem ber of the company it had been enacted that for the punishment of depredations committed by clerks or servants if any clerk or servant stole any chattel money or valuable security belonging to or in the possession or in the power of the master he should be guilty of the offence named in the sat if a person put himself in the position to abuse a trust he was liable for a breach of it as to the third proposition lbout the jervant he considered the jury had found the pri soner guilty as a servant that it was a question of fact for the jury and had been decidedmr cockiburx having briefly repliedthe court rose it being stated that it would adjourn to his day
