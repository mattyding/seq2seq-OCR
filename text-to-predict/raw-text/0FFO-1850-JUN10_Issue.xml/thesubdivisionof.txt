the subdivision of parishesthe following is the second report of the subaivi sion of parishes commissioners to the queens most excellent majestywe your majesty commnissoners appointed to in quire into the practicability and mode of subdividing into distinct and independent parishes for all ecclesiastcal pur eses all the deawypeopled parishes in enigland and wales inmiuch nmaner that the population of each except in ariclar cawes at our discretion shall not exceed souls hve proceeded with ouir iniquiries since the presenta tion of our frast report and have now to submit some furthersuggestons tendinig to promote the obgject of the commissionin our former report we sftated that we expected to be able shortly to lay before your majesty a general view of the probable number of new parishes and new churches required in all the dioceses in england and wales without personal inspection and much expense it would not be possible to arrive at a very correct estimate of guch requirements but letters bave been issued to incumbents of parishes containing a popation of hsouls and upwards and to all the bishops mt ngland and wvales requesting both advice and informa tion which we are bound to acknowledge with mnuch grati tude was in most cases readily afforded us in some in stances the archdeacons or other parties have been applied to and in all cases we have acted upon the best information within our reach the result of our inquiry shows that there is an immediate andapressing demand for the erection of about  new churches it is also desirable that these should in most cases have parishes assigned to them and that many districts already formed should receive a distinctly parochial character the above estimate is but an approxi mation to the truth and is not so framed as to leave nothing further for christian liberality to effect it does not propose to supply every hamlet or township with a chapel or to en large churches which are at present of insufficient size it takes cognizance merely of such parishes of larg population as clearly require a new church or churches to b built and a new parishor parishes tobe conatitatedto accomnplish the erection of churches we believe that a sum not much exceeding   would be suffi cient but it would not be deswirbe that the sum to be pro vided from any public source should be equal to the whole expenditure required this would be to leavprivate philan thropy and christian effort quite out of the calulation  and so to dowe behaevewould be neither reasonable nor expaaient we consider that it would be enough toplace at the disposal of the church building commissioners a fund sufficient to provide onehalf of the cost of the proposed new churches the other hbanftogether with the site to be provided by thefe p or thia

to consider whether it wroilst be possible without impairing in the slightest egee t efficiency of the establshment to derive the whole or an portion of the sum required from ecclesiastical source  are sensible that it would be useless to apealto the libof parliament until it could be shown hiat the chuychlier self had made every effort to supply the deficiency of iritual instruction and had exhausted all the meanswitinher reach available for fuch a purpose we also feel asured that the church would strengthen her hold on the respect ancaffection of the people if through her own independent exer tionst encourang and imulating the liberality of her own memoiers she could efrect an object of such inestuable im portance as the erection of many hundred new places of wwonsn iu the districts in which there is the most presing deman for increased spiritua inetructionin the course of our consideration of a subject of such deep interest our attention has been directed to that portion of church ptronage which although technicaly be longig to thte crown is practically disposed o indpn dently of the crown by a public functionary appointed by and under the control of your majestybefore we adver more deially to this subject we wil briefly refer to the condition of the church in referenoe to livings the emoluments of which are inadequate to provide a sufficient maintenance for the incumbent the dealing with which class of cames is necessarily in some degree involved in the scheme by which we hope to supply the greater defiien cies to which our attention has been more specially directedlit is clearly impossible to secure the continued services of an efficient resident minister for   or even oyear i and it appears to us that in any augmentation which may oe made an income of at least  a year should i possible be secured for the maintenance ofthe incumbent of every separate cure of souls the smallest benefice with the largest population or the most extensive area having the pre ference over those with a mall chargethe suggestion which we venture to offer in cases of this description where the stipend is insufficient to procure or at any rate to retain the services of a clergyman well quali fiedi foyr his office unfortuniately will not apply to canse where the private rights of ons make it impossible in any way to interfere with the advowsons of such beneficeln a lae number of cases of small livings however we find the right of presentation vested in the lord chancellor in these cases we conceive that by a process which we wlpresently describe the incomo of the benefice might be greatly improved and the efficiency of the church proper tioiiately augmentedthe lord chancellor at present administers the patrongag of no less than  livings having an annual value of about  he has likewise the alternate presentation of  benefices of which the annual value is z making a total of  benefice with an aggregate annual value of nearly  the income however of a great portion of these benefices isvery small too small to be desirable as preferment and in sufficlent to secure the services of a resident pastor we find so far as it is in our power to ascertain that there are  of less than  annual value  above  but under   above  but under z and  above  but un der z making a total of  insufficiently endowedit is obvious that the advowsons of benefices of this de scription can have no value as patronage in the ordinary sense of the word it is difficult to find persons willing to undertake the charge of cures which entail more than the re spoasiblity but yield less than the salary of a curaspeaking generally they are not and cannot be sufficienty served and the spiritual interests of their population are almost necessarily neglectedwe are of opinion that these evils might be greatildiminished so far as the benefices in the gift of the lord chancellor are conceemed by offering the right of presents tion to persons interested in the wevare of the population resident within these cures on the condition that the whole purchase money or so much of it as would suffice to raise the annual value of the benefice to  should be appliedt to that purpose hiis additional endowment would of courseincrease the value of the advowson and the sum which would be given for itthe marked and growing interest felt by the wealthier classes in the spiritual as well as the temporal welfare of the people would we believe under the circumstances and con ditions we have described induce many persous to give for the advowsons of these insufficiently endowed benefices a sum far exceeding their mere market value and if the ex ample so set were as is not improbable to be followed to the extent of selling the next presentation by public bodies and private patrons a vast number of parishes now almost without religious instruction for want of an adequate en dowmecntmirht be brought within the regular ministrationathe direct effect however of this proposal would be to place nearly  cures of souls now in the gift of the lord chancelor but which are almost useless for spiritual pur poses from the insufficiency of their endowment on a foot ing to secure to the people resident within their limits all the advantages to be derived from the ministrations of a re sident pastorthe remaining benefices in the gift of the lord chancellor are  in number and vary in value from  to  per annumbefore however we proceed to state what proceeding wo should recommend with regard to the advowsons of theso larger benefices with a view to the creation of a fund by means of whicb aided by private contribution the  new churches might be erected it is important to state the re sult of our inquiries into the origin of the appropriation of so vast an amount of church patronage to the keeper of the great seal it appears that until the reign of henry vm when sir thomas more succeeded cardial wolsey as chan cellor the great seal had been generally committed to the care of ecclesiastical persons and even stll later under edward vi the bishop of ely was lord chlancellor an in the next rein the bishop of vworcester and after him the archbishop of xork and in charles is time bishop wil hams was lord keeperapparently also the subordinate business of tle court of chancery was conducted chiefly by ecclesiastics and the patronage of church benefices was intrusted to the chancel lor for the purpose of being em loyed in rewardirg them for their services in that court hence the church patronage still held by the chancellor in the fourth year of king edward iii a petition was presented praying that  thehancellor may in future bestow crown benefices of g marks value upon the clerks in chancery as had been here tofore accustomed which ptition was recommended by the council to be granted ths state of things having now entirely passed away there is no reason as far as the oriein of the custom is concerned for its retention and we think it well worthy of consideration whether anry other reasons exist for its continuance sufficient to counterbalance the great advantages which as it appears to us may be gained by the adoption of the proposition which we are about to submit to your majestythe selection of proper persons to fill so large number of beneficesa number greater than has been intrusted to any six prelates of the churchmust impose a heavy burden upon any one by whom the duty is conscientiously and efficiently discbarged the minute inquiries which should be instituted into the character for piety learning zeal ani discretion of every candidate for preferment before ie ia intrusted with functions so sacred and important as those in volved in the cure of souls must demand a sacrifice of time and attention incompatible with the many laborious dutie of the lord chanceuorwve submit therefore to your majesty that so many of these advowsons should gradually and in the course of a few years be disposed of by private tender as would produce a sum equal to the amount which wouhl he necessary to insure the erecton of  churches the church building commis sioners being empowered to re ulate the order in which the a dvowsons to be so dealt with shouldbe offed to purchasers in whom the perpetual patronage of such benefices shal beif the annual income of the  benefices be estimated at l and the value of the advoweons at from seven tco ten years purchase of the net value after making the deduc tions necessary to such a calculation the sum ultimatelvy raised were all the advowsons to be sold would probably be more than sufficient for beth the objects in contemplation nsmely the augmlentation of the smaller benefices anhe erection of  new churchesour proposal therefore does not necessarily glieniate from the great seal au the church patronage now by law at tached to it but is perfectly compatible wvith the reserva tion to the lord chancelor if it is thought fit of a certain amount of church patronage were however au the ad vowsons ceded a fund might also be created to assist in the erection of parsonage houses thus completing all the re quirements of a new beneficewe consider that by the adoption of the proposal which we have ventured to submit to your majesty not only would an ample fund be supplied without any parliamentary grant for the erection of  new churches in populous parishes now lamentably deficient in religious teaching but the lni nistrations of the church would be rendered more efficient ina agreat number of places where a church or benefice already existswe have only further to consider what funds may be attainable for the endowment of the proposed  new churches and also for the existing subdivisions of

from which wc are led to infer that if their recommendations are carrled out a sum sufficient to meet these requirements may in the courhse of a few years be available from the re sources of the
