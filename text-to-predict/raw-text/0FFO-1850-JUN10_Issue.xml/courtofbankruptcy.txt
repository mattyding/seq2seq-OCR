court op bankruptry batwhl june before mfr commissiouer fanin the bankruptcy of martin luther pritchardthe whole of the day wws occupied in hearing this case the small and llrentilated apartment in which mr com dissioner faex sits was crowded with stockbrokers and others interested in the proceedings the meetings under the fiat have been so frequent and so fully reported that it is unnecessary to preface the report by more than a very brief recapitulation of the leading facts the fiat was issued in may  on the bankrupts own petition and directed to the liverpool court of bankruptcy in which town prit chard in conjunction with one dale carried on the business of stockbroker in july  the fiat was by order of the vicechancellor removed to london the main features of pritchards mercantile career are as followhe became clerk to a liverpool stockbroker named forsyth in  and some time after went into partnership with him for syth retired in  and pritchard entered into business on his own account his clerk dale joined him in  and this partnership continued until the issue of the fiat it was in april  that pritchard became a director of the southeastern railway and soon after deputychairman of that company in this post he continued until march  during his official connexion with the board of directors the bankrupt stated that nearly the whole of his time was en grossed dy the affairs of the company and that he attended  meetings the last examination meeting was fixed for the th of august  but it was adjourned to the th of september when he passed in conjunction with dale theemeetig was fixed for the th of november da firstclas certificate at once but on the th of january  the order that pritchard had passed his last examination was rescinded and the proceedings against pritcbard commenced de novo the cause of the rescision was that the bankrupt had not filed his balance sheet ten days before the meeting as the act requires since then numerous meetings have been held the southeastern raiway the commercial bank of liverpool and more recently mr morgan one of the assignees and mr canton a creditor opposig it is but fair to state that the other trade assignee and the offical assignee mr whitmore expressed themselves perfectly satisfied with the accounts rendered by pritchard who seems to have suffered severely in mind and body sinoe these proceedings were commenced his advocate on a former occasion expressed fears that pritchard would sink under the harassing ordeal to which he was subjectedmessrs tilleard sons and freeman appeared as

described himself as a member of the stockexchange and a sharedealer he was he said admitted a member of the stockexchange in  he first became acquainted with the bankrupt pritchard in january  through the introduction of a person named ray it was a business introduction and the bankrupt was described to him as a stock and sharebroker of liver pool doing an extensve trade and deputychauman of the aotbeiasterm railwary company this introdaction led to him morgan being appointed london agent to the firm of pritchard and dale of wbhich he wras awrare pritchard wras a member between the periods of january and february he bought a variety of shares for pritchard and the money for them was regularly paid through mlessrs barclay and co the bankers on the th of february he recollected uur chasing a quantity of midland stocl  on the th of fe bruary aquantity of newcastle preference shares also on that datea further quantity of midland stock and on the st of mearch some shares in the central of franace railway they wrere parchased in all cases for the account he made these purchases in the ordinary course of business and he had not the slightest notion that they were for pritchards own speculation hxe alwrays made out the contractnotes in the names of pritchard and dale believing as he thought at the time that the purchases arose from bond lide orders received by them as stock and sharebrokers and not as speculative operations at the date it became ne cessarybt pass names for the shares they did not supply him with thle information and on the accountday the th of march after a letter from pritchard through ray he borrowed the money necessary about  at the price of the day and continued the account he wrote and tele graphed to them respecting the busineas but he did not get any satisfactory answer aferwards when he met pritchard he made the excuse of temporary embarrassment saying that such an event had never occurred before and that it now purely arose from disappointment in the receipt of money ke understood at the time that he was to be sole agent to pritchard or he would not have accepted the busi ness he however discovered afterwards that he was deal ing with other brokers he did not get any mostey not withstanding he wrote frequently to the firm of pritchard and dale on the subjectmr jms here entered the court and said that his honour would perhaps permit him to interrupt the exami nation for a few moments as his address would occupy but a short time and it might when concluded lighten m some degree the proceedings he wouldnot have thus interfered but he had come down from westminster at great incon venience and ashehada case there goingon atthatmoment he was anxious to get back as quiekly as possibler linklater and mr lawrance having expressed their willngness that mr james should be at once heardthe court stopped the examination of mr morgan for the learned counsels observationsmr james said he appeared in this case as the representa tive of the commercial bank of liverpool and the south eadstern railway and this being the day appointed for the discussion ofthe bankcrupts certificate he ws extremely de srous to attend the court for he purpose of vindicating to the ustmost of hi abpity any congtructon that should be put on the conduct and moties influencing the parties ho represented those establshments in coming forwvard in the manlner they had done he fet it wras due to them that the court and the public should be made acquainted why they had thus made their appearance so that their motives might be thoroughly and properly appreciated and understood his honour would doubtless remember that it was not until the bankrupt through some informality not at the tinie within the knowledge of the court

advioe and if he had not done right he alone was responsible when be was con sulted by the respectable solicitors mess tileard who left the affair entirely in his bands ihe distinctly told them that if these debts were fictitious he did not mean to use the word offensivelyhis honour had on a previous occasion used the more appropriate phrase if they were delusions it was their duty to the court to themselves and the publicen to seek n examination into them whatad been done in that respect was already known and he mr james must express his belief honestly that there was not a shiadow of fonudation for their existence with reference to allusions that had been made and the importance attached to their apperuce befre his honour he would ask anyimpartial mercantilerman wshether when those wvere so stated it was not incumbent on them to claim a searching examination acting on that advice messrs tilleard had proceeded and that was the true foundation of the motives which had brought them into court the question of those debts would however not be taken into consideration now on the adjudication of the cer tificate they would rest for the present their object

bankrupt the attack was made on the other side it was certainly true that at the period of the last examination when the inquiries led to the opening of the maria barlow account the explanations of the books and the extraordinary entries such as transit account he felt bound to ask for fmuther time fee ing that it was necemsary that they should be inves tiated presenting the facts as they had

personal animosity on the occa sion he mr james was not there to press it with bitter ness against the bankrupt hut as under the present las the administration of the court w as found salutary in its effect and as the judgments without in the least indulging im adu ltion were regarded with great interest he was there as the representative of two public bodies to ask whether his honour taking n
