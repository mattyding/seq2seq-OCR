rhe uta rgjor uropberrs portion oilly of the folowing sppeored n our e eliiof rtanima eiaraneothe following is our paris correspondents letter dated friday a pm i mentiomn yesterday that lord palmerston had at length signified his intention to accept the conuention of london agreed to between iun and mi drouyn de lhuys and that general lahitte had declined giving a final answer until after consultation and ue deliberation with his col leagues this delay it was believed was occa tioned by the announcement of lord stanleys resolution which was expected to come on this day as the french government wrere as anxious to allowr that discussion to ptecede the final arrangement as lord palmerston might be for the contrary i am this day informed however that there is an additional ana perhaps a more important reason for the delay on the part of general liahitte in replying to lord palmerston namely his lordships demntnlthat one of the clauses con sidered as most onerousto greece in the treaty of athensthat respecting the indemnitiesshould be inserted in theilondon convention and that the greek government should be allowed per fect liberty after this addition to choose between the two conventions i stated now seve ral daye sinoe that it was considered probable lordpalmerston waa only trying t gain time in order to place greece in such a position as that she shoutld eclare her preference of the settlemeat effected by mir wyse it is probable that if such a elausebe insertelinthelondon convention thegreek government would prefer matters remaining as they aen if it be trme that such a demand has been made and i believe there is no reason to doubt it i am mot quite certain from what i know of the dispo iition ofthe french government that lord palmer ston will obtain anything by such a move except hat he willbecome more and more suspected of un fair play i see no reason for believing that general lgaitte will depart from his original demand viz the pure ad simple execation of the convention ofonon and i believe that unless lord palmerston preferkeeping up the estrangement between theeats he had better come to that con cluion at once the longer the settlement is de ayed the more difficult it will become the slightest accident too may invest it with a character of a stil more serious kinda mxitary force of about  men was re viewed this day by the president of the republic in the champ de mars the review had been an nounced for  oclocklong before that hour the ground was occupied by the troops the president punctuattothe momentasusual arrived atthechamp

cavalry and the artillery was sta tiomei on the rising ground in front of the ecole militaire with the pont de jena to the rear the prince rode slowly along the lines followed by the generals and their staff he then took up his station in front of the military school when the troops moved past in divisions of oonianies the fine regiment of gendarmerie mobite which has been lately reorganized defiled first then came the chasseurs de vincennes zmoving at their usual quick pace and then the other infantry corps the most striking patt of the review was however when the cavalry berau to move the two magnificent regiments of oarabiniers with their skyblue uniforms and their brazen cuirasses and helmets gleaming in the sun moted past at a quick trot after the carabiniers came the heavy dragoons uniform dark green and steel cuirasses the chasseurs came third after which followed the lancers as each man trotted past he slightly lowered his lance in compliment to the president of the republic the hussars closed the long column of horse there was an immense assemblage of persons to witness the manoeuvres which were executed with admirable precision and every one was loud in praise of the soldierlike appear ance of the troops a great many hand some equipages were drawn up in front of the ecole iilitaire and in fact vehicles of all descriptions bordered the sides of tke champ de mars louis napoleon as he arrived on the ground was welcomed with cries of  vive le prdgident  vive nqptpoin p i heard no other cries the attention of all seemed how ever to be rather fixed on the manceuvres of the troops of which almost the spectators were more or less competent to judge than anything else the president left the ground at  oclock and about  the men had all returned to their respective quar ters in a regiment stationed at havre there were  men belonaig to the department of the bas rhin of these  have just voted for m muller the can didate of the party of order and only

in the rue de rivoli the object of the meeting was to consider the true line of conduct they should follow in the assembly relative to the proposition for the increase of the presidents allowance most of the members addressed the chair but they all expressed their opinion with some hesitation and reserve no re solution was adopted except the intimation of a wish very generally expressed that full liberty should be allowed to each member to speak or vote on the subject as he might think properthe parliamentary committee that meets in the rue richelieu orleanists assemble together tonight the members who all belong to the majority that support the government propose deliberatinz on the same subject as that of the club or committee of the rue rivoli namely the increase of allowance to the

matter is stopped for that day otg and prevented from going to the departments that an indictment is then framed agkait its director that the matter comes in due course before the ordinary tribunals when it is tried in the police correctionnelle or by the jury according to the nature of the offence imputed to it that the director has of course all the advantage of legal assistance for his defence that if found guilty he is fined or other wise punished according to law and if a qitted the impression which had been suspended for one day only is restored to him and even when the paper is not acquitted it is not on that account pre vented from being published as before of course temporary suspension takes place in extraordinary cases such as when a place is in a state of insurrec tion and

increas ing the allowance of the president of the republic is termed is still the interesting topic of the day and it cannot be denied that by many peple serious misgivings as to its success are felt with two or three exceptions the project is either opposed or supported in rather a lukewrarmmanner bythe press of the great papers the conittaionnei defends it warmly  but since the day following the prespntation of the bill when it expressed it self in a manner that must have led every person to suppose it meant to support it the journal des digbts has abstained from any observation on the subject the ordre which is regarded as the organ of what is caled the odilon barrot party per sists in advising ministers to withdraw the bill as inopportune while at the same time it admits all the claims on which it is founded and moreover takes great care to protest against any personal hostility to the president of the republic it is diffioult to understand the meaning of the ordre as to the term inopportune it would be affec tation to be silent on the fact so well known to every one that the actual allowance of the presideut of the republic is not at all adequate to the necessary expenditure of his household it is not on the presentoccasion that the paris public have to learn that his position is by no means free from embarrassments and for the chief of a state pecuniary embarrassment must be of all others most humiliatingi have not heard it aleged even by the presidents worst enemies that these difficulties have been occa sioned by unnecessary or wanton extravagance on hispart but rather by causes over which neither he nor any one in his position could have any con trol at no hour of the day is louis napoleon free from applications for assistance and as all paris must have frequently witnessed his very walks are constantly interrupted by petitions from young and old and i believe not one is allowed to go away discontented there is not an old soldier in the country who does not believe he has a claim more or less founded not so much on the president of the republic as on the nephew of the emperor louis napoleon does not make a visit to a manu factory or any other public establishment where he does not leave marks of his bounty his charity is ceaseless and abundant it is absurd to say that the chief ef a state residing in a city so luxurious as paris can live with the frugal simplicity attri buted to the president of the united states the manufacturers of the costly articles which form the staple trade of paris look to the chief of the state as well as to their customers for protection and encouragement it is not because france has become republican that the habits and tastes of her people are changedi mentioned yesterday that the parliamentary club which holds its sittinas in the rue de riche lieu and the chiefs of which are m piscatory and m jules de lasteyrie were to meet last night to deliberate on the subject of the dotation and i now learn tait the club has decided on supporting the bill of the government yet it is impossibleto deny that this day a good deal of alarm is felt lest it be rejected and less a fresh and more serious di vision should arise between the assembly and the president it is not necessary to say that in the present state of the country barely escaping as it just has from the threat of a formidable insurrec tion and still not without serious perils to encounter such a result would indeed be a great misfortunethe ordre sayswe have received from m odilon barrot and several of his former colleagues the positive assurance that when in the ministry they never came to any resolution or engagement which can be now invoked in support of the demand for an addition of f to the allowance to
