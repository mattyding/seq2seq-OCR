atsstrtafiox our own correspondentvilen na jums  the festival of corpus christi may be considered the close of the vienna season as after the solemn processionwhich takes place on that day every familyrhich has the means hastens to exchange the close and oppregsive atmosphere of the city either for the purer air of its charming environs or for one of the watering places in whieh austria abounds the grand procession which was formerly so attractive as well for the inhabitants of the city as for strangers has proved a failure this year as no ladies acconpanied it and the hungaian and italian noble guards have been dissolved it was observed that the emperor who as usual followed the baldaquin which covers the host looked pale and less at his ease than usual but this is by no means astonishing when it is con sidered that his uncovered head was exposed to the scorching rays of the sun for nearly three hours the alarmists however and in this good city their name is legion attributed the abovementioned unusual appearances and the absence of the arch duchess to a cause which it would perhaps be im prudent to specify as to the youthful monarchs health and strength he is most robust as his subjects have an opportunity of remarking almost every evening during hiswal in the park of schon brunn indeed the length of his stride and the quickness of his step are such that few persons are able to keep pace with him and one of his aides decamp has recently been obliged to resign his office as it was found that the exertion was too much for hi i mention this simply as a refuta tion of some siuy reports about the emperors lungs not being so strong as could be wishedsome little sensation has been excited here by the speech of the prince of prussia to the authorities of the city of breslau  sentiments said he are no longer sufficient actions are required a period of heavy probation is at hand things will become known of which the world has til now had no idea and therefore it is necessary to act and that will be done little importance is attached to the news that m manteuffel has been the bearer of a letter to the emperor of russia complaining of the line of conduct pursued by the austrian cabinet to wards prussia and still less to the telegraphic ad vices that one prussian corps has been concentrated between erfurt and torgau and a second on the bohemian frontier even our stockjobbers heard the news with such indifference that the five per cents rose a little while the premium on the pre cious metals fell the fact is that no one here who is capable of forming an opinion will believe that the eagles will peck out each others eyes in order to give the vultures an opportunity of securing their prey although under present circumstances it is most difficult to form a correct opinion as to what the future may bring forth i should not be sur prised to hear that the congress at warsaw had consulted on matters of greater moment than even the difference between the austrian and prussian houses and that some great blow is about to be directed against the neverceasing ma chinations of the revolutionary party in germany the language employed by the king of prussia in his address to the assembled princes at berlin suffi ciently proves that the chances of a rupture between the two great german powers are but small  friendship with austria said the monarch  is the first condition to a suecessful struggle against the revolution and notwithstanding all appear ances to the contrary the same opinion is certainly entertained by the austrian cabinet in regard to prussiawe learm from frankfort that general peucker has not received any official notification of his appointment as plenipotentiary for prussia and fears are entertained that the wavering for which the prussian policy is so notorious is again about to be evidenced be this as it may austria will doubt lessly give prussia every opportunity of joining the plenum with honour to herself and will not split hairs with her about matters of mere form although she will to a certainty not swerve from the strictly legal position which she has now assumed things are tor the moment at
