british cookery growing prestige abroadby c hermax sennthere is no doubt that in the past far too mucll has been nmade of the superiority ofcontinental over british cookery it has too long been the fashion to dery the english as agairnst the foreign cook yet there have never been lacking a few farsighted culinary expertson both sides of the channel who have realizedl and freely admitted that the british cuisine  has its owvn peculiar national merits of which even the continent cannot boast although we cannot claim first place as regards the economy which the frrench housevife practises in her bourgeoise cookery the cookery of the british middleclass family compares very favourably with that of our gaelic neighbours indeed the average english table would carry off the palm any day for comfort and refine ment in any sense of these words was it not l alexis soyer himself one of the greatest savacnts in matters culinary who asserted that it was impossible to surpass english joints of meat and that when roasted in english fashion it needed the addition of no sauce andat alfred suzanne who was for a long time j the leader of the anglofrench school whose experience in england is founded upon a number of professional engagements including that of chef to the duke of bedford a position which he held for many years and who has written a book on english cooking in the french language for the french nation has declared that many of our exclusively national dishes have a merit and savour which excel even those of france or any other country is there he exclaims in his copiously illustrated volume la cuisine anglaise a mere unctnous soup than tutle can frying attain greater delicacy than that which is used in cooking whitebait is any roti comparable to suckingpig with its sage and onion stuffing above all is there any counterpart to the toothsomeness of the british steak pudding with larks or oysters added l suzanne is equaly enthusiastic over the angloindian items in our menu and he maintains with the late m jules simon that the force and vigour of our race may be in the main attributed to the staying qualities of the food englishmen eategliseh cooietry tx fbayceit may be news perhaps to the sceptically inclined to learn that quite a number of the apprentices in the better class paris restaurants are english youths or else the sons of french chefs long established in england on inquiry many of these wiiu openly admit that the future  cordon bleu however eaccomplished could not officiate wkithout foreign tuition before the stewpans and ovens of a westend hotel or a pallmall club or in the wondrous town or country kitchens of wealthy british families with a name for keeping a good table it is somewhat questionable if the french cook in england is in any sense superior to his or her properly trained british colleague for as a wellkmown chef once expressed itthe first sight of one of the splendidly equipped kitchens of england takes his breath awayhe is innocent of miint sauce and he has a happy wvay of forgetting that a bathchap may be served with roast poultrv or veal as for yorkshire pudding horseradish saucand bread sauce he has probably never heard of them even the nicoleaus and lenevcsters and other gastronomic pontiffs will acknowledge that their flrst days in england were puzzling but they were under good guaidance and reached the top of the treeeloquent proof of the growing appreciation of british cookery beyond the confines of this country is afforded by the tendency of several of the newer freneh dishes to become more or less faithful reproductions of the  fare of old englanld joints simnilar to those served in england aro becoming the rule rather than the exception of the soups nowadays aceliraa tized in france one may mention mulligatawny oxtail mutton broth real turtle end nmock turtle cockaleekie and scotch broththe latter indicating the growing taste for boiled log of mutton and caper sauce white rabbit stews known in france as  en saubise have long been served in this country with the typical english onion sauce and with petit sale or pielded pork lancashire hotpot irish stew steak and kidnev pudding and veal and ham pie are but few of the meat varieties which are found nowhere in such perfect con dition as in this countryred currant jolly is now served to be eaten with the sicculent salt marsh mutton of the brittany coasts as in this country whilst salt or corned beef is sold at mnost of the best charcutiers frinnon haddocts kippers and yarmouth bloaters are coming into france and switzerland by scores of thousands and are largely colnsumed by that intormixed popula tion of sojourners who have learnt to appreciate themn going into the list of  savouries  presented on the continent we find that eng land has been largely drawn upon of late the various savouiry toasts including tho perennial welsh rarebit are freely asked for and con suraed in french restaurants and sporting clubs the anchovy wllich was formerly a piece of raw uncouthness has followed the fresh sardine to tlhe grill fruit pies suet crust fruit puddings mnilk puddings plunm pudding english oakes

cookery las likewise undergone equally beneficial clianges of late years a recent writer has admirably summed up ourpresent position in the following sentencew ve are beginning to understand that the highest cookery is to bo found in tlle perfection of simplicity not in the adding or combining of flavours so much as in the retaining of those wlhich already exist though the balance between british and foreign cookery inclines in favour of english fare as a whole there is no doubt that in many respects notably vith regard to the use of good meat trim mings or leftovers and of other in ferior parts we fall far below our crosschannel comnpeers it has been said with al certain atnount of truthl although it is somei times rather farfetched that if we give ai french cook a prime cut of meat she willi assuredly spoil it but on the other hand i with only secondrate and inexpensive material she wvill evolve from it a firstclass and tasty dish which only a french cook can produce it is in this latter respect of economy that we have so far been unable to competo vith our culinary friends on the continent akn english epicurean writer some few years ago assured me that the judicious seection of viands and care and diserixnination in their managinentwaere entirely wanting in the majority of english i households  at least onehalf if not inore of the chief nutritivo elements in our

methods of training it has been said that the english man maesaq an excellent administrator and if he could oniv combine his administrative ability with his brother the frenchmans genius for cooking he would make a firstrate chef the art of cookerv in the british isles has too often been adopted in haphazard fashion instead of minutely studied and regularly followed as a bonafide profession but we in this country are gradually awakening to the necessity for methodical cookery training for both sexes if we wish to continue competing on favoutrable terms with our continental confrres the recent efforts of the london cotntv coneil in the establishment of cookerv technical training schools for youths who wish to become hotel and restaurant cooks and young women in dornestic service to qualify as family cooks are making very encouraging progress in this notable and commendable feature of technical education whilst the nuimerous schools of domestic seience dotted about the country are all so many attempts to fill in the hiatuns o oiur national shortcomings as regards thrift and economy
