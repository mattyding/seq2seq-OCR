thirteen coaches took part in the competition and there was a keen contest for the challenge cup between air w h moore nvith his american team and mr av a barron the latter who drove tho coach vivid was the winner along the whole route the event was watched by large crowds of spectatorsthe conditions are thzt the contestants must be road coaches but there is a certain amount of laxity in this respect and thus wvile a fair number of the coaches are actually on the road and others about to be the thirteen included several that are only road coaches for this particular contest the muster from the coaching point of view was the best which has been seen at hampton court all the coaches were smart and well turned out all the teams were good and the driving was excellentthe marathon is not a race but a competition and while the horses count  per cent condition claims  per cent and coach harness and equip ment also  laer cent the judges evidently take little notice of the times ninde for mr moore held his owvn all the wvay and wavs nearly min aheavl of his nearest follower when lie arrived at olrmnia mr barron on thle other hand lost tm o places during the journey and was about imin
