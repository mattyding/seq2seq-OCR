food from flour manufacture of bread amd biscuitsin its natural state wheat is scarcely at al fitted for use as human food it is therofore first of all reduced to a powdered condition and is then known as meal or flour flour is never eaten in the rawv statebut is invariably subjected to some cooking process that most commonly adopted being its conversion into bread any discussion of bread itself is appropriately pre ceded by a description of flour and consequently that substance must first demand attentionflour is of several different types depending on the varieties of wheat used and their treat ment during the operation of milling among the requirements in flour by which it is com mercially judged are its strength flavour and colour although well known to both miller and baker the meaning of strength is not familiar to the generml public the following is a generauy accepted definition of this pro perty  strength is the measure of the capacity of a flour for producing a bold large volumed wellrisen loaf sorne flours among which that fromn english wheat may be taken as a familiar example produee small flat close textured and runny  loaves these are called weak flours there is another class of flour of which that from manitoba wheats is one of the best illustrations which is just the opposite in character the bread is bold in appearance stands up well and in every way conforms to the definition just given these are strong flourspotenthe strength of flour is closely related to the amount and character of the protein matter it contains the proteins being the tiitrogenous constituents of food as distihct fromn the carbon aceous such as sugar and fat if a sniall portion of flour to made into dough and then kneaded and washed in a gentle stream of running water starch is first washed away in abundance and there then remains behind a pellet of a tough indiarubberlike mass to which the name of gluten has been given it is on the nature and amotnt of this substance that the quality of strength depends the gltuten should be very tough and very elawticbesides whieh it houald bepresent in sufficient quantity wheaten flour is the only substance in which the protein matter assumes this particular form on being wetted and even with this the proportion of the protein which can be separated as gluten is not fixed this proportion is governed among other things by tho nature and amount of mineral salts that occur in the flourspeakilg generally the strong flours are also the more nutritious flours because of their high percentage of protein flours of this type are not howvever well fitted by themselves alone to make good bread since they produce a loaf which tends to become harshi dry and flavour less english wheat although weak is supreme in flavour and so although it alone makes a small loaf it is nevertheless in considerable demand for breadmaking purposes the best allround result is obtained by using a blend of wheats each of which contributes its own special merit to the mixture colour is also an important factor in tho quality of flour and here the nomenclature of the flour trade is almost the opposite of that of everyday usage a flour is said to have plenty of colour or to be  coloury  vhen it is very nearly white or white with a delicate yellow bloom again english wheats are of good colour though with modern milling processes a white flour mav be obtained from most varieties flavour is the result of the presence in the flour of sugar and other soluble substances among which is dextrin although this latter is almout taste less yet by its gumuny nature it helps to retain the moist character of bread and so indirectly helps to improve the flavour it is the presence of starchy wheats which gives flour a good colouressential parts of vvheatflouw finds its way to the baker in various forms thero being in fact several types of flour amnong these the simplest is that known as wholemonal which is just the whole wvheat ground into a meal without the removal ofanv of its cemnonent parts in psing it may bo m nientionedl that vwheat coilts essentially of three rts the first is the germ or embryois the part

germ and endoaperm during thp storage and early life of the seed in tlhe usual operations of milling this outer envelope is separated and lknown as bran although from the very functions it exists to

conditions of wvarmth and moisture the germ not only changes its ovwn character but also acts on the other substances in the meal naturally the floury portionsof the grain are also present the bran

comparatively pleasant in flavour but that of the darker and red wrheats is strong and decidedly objectionable in this reaect so that when wholemeal is used the miller isrestricted to a comparatively narrow range of wheats there is a vvariant of wholerneal known as decorticated meal in which some of the coarse exterior portion of the bran is removedin the preparation of white flours the bran and the gern atc separated as completely as possible all the resultant flour may be supplied as straight grade or it may be divided into two or more grades the w hiter being known as patent and the darker as house hold flour duiring the last few vears a demand has been fortiiilated for a standard in flour for that purposo it has been insisted that at least  per lent of the wheat should find its wae

manufacture of bread consistos essn tially of taking flour water salt and yeast makcing therm into a dough anid allowing it to lie for sorne hours in a warm place thc yea vit acts on the natural sugars of the flour and laonvetts them into alcohol and carbon dioxide gas the latter distends the dough and causes it to rise the gas being retained by the elastic gluten tuitinmately the dough is cut into pieces of proper wveight and baked into loaves the varimris types of flour referred to each produce their cwrresponding bread in shape the loaves are either of the closepacked or crumby variety or the crusty type the latter is now the moro popular and crusty bread appears in the familiar shapes of cottages coburgs and tin loavesthe last word in breadmaking is the adoption of acinr  tion of machinery in place of the imanual operations which until comparatively recently were the general rule in the most modern develop ments the whole process is almost automstic and the actual handling of the dough is reducedto a minimtun the various kinds of flour used by the baker are blended by machinery the resultant rtixture is carefullv sifted and passed in known weight into a mixing machine it there meets with weighed or measured quantities of salt yeast and water at the desired tempera ture as soon as these are thoroughly incor porated the dough is discharged iato trough wheeled away into a special room and them allowed to ferment the dough is next passed through a dividing macline by which it is cut ito pieces of the necessary weight instead of being shaped or motlded by hand these pieces pass through one or two moulding machines they are then arranged on trays taken to the oven and bakedtathong special breads may be mentioned those containing a large proportion of the genrof wheat this is first subjected to a separate cooking process by which its active properties are destroyed awd consequently it is then with out action on flour a mixture of such treated gerrn and flour makes a higbly nutritiotis loaf another type of patented bread consists of aportion of the flour taken and treated wvith malt extract as a preliminary operation this partly digests the flour the maltextract conters a characteristic flavour and the addition of certain other ingredients resuilts in the produc tion of an exceedingly pleasant breadsioitt weigutin conclusion some reference may be made to tho muchvexed question of the weight of bread the newspapers occasionally contain miiost elaborate calculations as to the loss to the public resulting from the sale of shortweight bread of course ethically if a baker purports to sell a b loaf that loaf should weigh b tho law in recognition of this principle says bread shall be sold by weight the public for its own convenience says it wvill buy bread by the piece which is called a loaf now this piece of bread will usually weigh the denomi nated weight when first offered for sale to the public say b but if the purchase is delayed for  hours that samie loaf will have become an otnce lighter by loss of water the pur chaser is no loser because he has the same weight of ntrient solids in the staler bread that he would have had in the full weight new bread it is often argued that to provide for such a contingency the original loaf should have been made an ounce heavier this seems a very simple solution of the problem but it takes no cognizance of the very narrow margin of profit on wvhich the bakers business is conducted the writer had occasion some time ago to deal with this very point the business in question was a flourishing one and the amount of turnover and net profit for the year could be easily ascertained to have increased the weight of the loaf by an ounce would lhave more than swallonved up the margin available for the profit on tho years work inthere is no doubt that there is a good deal of shortweight bread sold but it is almnost always accompanied by a cut price it is signiticant in this respect that maniy bakers themselves demand a rigid administration of the bread laws as a remedy against under selling an example of this came some time ago under the writers personal notice a baker complained that while he was selling his quartern loaf at d with a full weight of b a competitor was selling his bread at id but on weighing it was founci to be oz short or b oz in weiglht in the interests of the public he alleged that this was a case for prose cution but a simple calculation will at once show that the fullweight baker was selling oz of bread for one penny whereas the shortweight competitor was in fact supplying the public with ooz of bread for the samne coin the deliberate selling of shortweight for short prices is a thing to be condemned but the public may console itself with the assurance that in bread it gets full value for its money the stress of competition compels the baker to render to the utmost the best service he can to the community and this is a more potent protector of the people than an aruy of inspectorsbiscuitsfrom its derivation the name bisrzcit mneans twrice cooked andl the original biscuit was pro bably a slice of bread or similar produet again passed through the oven the nearest modenm examiple of a literal biscuit is the rusk the present biscuit is essentially dough whlichl has been cooked in such a way as to keep for some considerable time w ithout deterioration one of the simplest of all biscuits is the ship biscuit whichl is muade from flour water and salt onlvy these are made into a very stiff dough which is rolled into sheets cut inlto round pieces anid baked unltil the total water present is reduced to about  per cent such biscuits may be kept almost indefinitely so loag as preserved from damp and the ravages of weevils and other insects the  captain known also ashore is mueh the same biscuit except tliat a little butter is used in the mixture and that it is doughed wvith milk instead oi water the  lunch  biscuit is a plain form and is unsweetenedother types of biscuit are made from a fermented dough and of these a wellknown  examplo is the  bath oliver in this yeast butter and sugar are included in the recipe and an altogether riicher biscuit is produced one of the most interesting biscuits of this type is the  cracker  of american origin here again a fermented dough is employed and by skilful manipulation this very characteristic biscuit is the result exceedingly good crackers are now made by british firmson still further ascending the scale one comes to the moderately sweet biscuitof which the osborne  and its later congeners may be taken as examples sugar butter and eggs enter into biscuits of this type which are aerated by the addition of a small quantity of cream of tartar and sodium bicarbonatethe suummit is reached with the fancy biscuit the number of which is legion in these not only are the finest qualities of the beforemen tioned ingredients employed but almonds chocolate and various essential oils and other flavouring matters are also laid under contribu tion it is impossible to attempt to describe the thousand and one methods of their manu facture one somewhat mysterious biscuit may just be alluded to and that is the curious puffy variety known as the cracknel this is veritably a biscuit sinco it is in realitv twice cooked a rich dough is first made and cut into biscuit pieces the pieces are then dropped into a vessel of boiling water and allowed to remain until they have sufficiently swollen to rise to the surface they are then transferred to cold water in which they remain for some time after which they are baked and then carefully dried until almost free from imoisture the result is the wellknown seductive articlepeeiwce of bbrish fnsrin its origin the biscuitmaking industry is essentially british and even now for most types the wellknown british firms hold easily the premier position not merely at home hut throughout the world as juror on behalf of the british government at several recent inter national exhibitions including those of brussels and turin the writer feels constrained to utter a word of warning the continental exhibitors were well to the fore in the biscuit section while the great british firms were conspicuous by their absence to an englishman who has been accustomed to hear certain wellknown british biscuits taken as the standard by which all others were measured it was not pleasant to find these forgotten and certain continental makes used as the exemplar by which others were judged this seems to poinit the obvious moral that the members of no industry how ever eminent can afford to rest on their laurels unless there is continuous activity the older will be more or less supplanted by their younger and more energetic competitorsenglish wheats yield flours that are simply supreme for biscuitmaking and english milled flours are superlative for the biscuit manufac turing industryconfctionermyto attempt to touch even the outer fringe of the confectioners art withini the limits of a single article is almost an impossibility it must be remembered at tlhe outset that confec tionery products are not merely foods but delicacies touching only on that branch in which flour is one of the prineipal constituents there are first of all sucharticles as scones and a number of other similar products in which our friends north of the border particularly excel a humble but distinctive branch is the bun well known in its plainer form while the bath bun is the more aristocratic examnple these are all made by a process of fermenta tion pastry goods are a product of flour and butter used in proper proportions by continued rolling and redoubling the marvellous flakiness of the most delicate confections of this type is attained the genus cale comprises goods of all grades from the richest and most elegantly and artisticauy decorated of wedding cakes to the plain cakewhich is only a little richer than bread
