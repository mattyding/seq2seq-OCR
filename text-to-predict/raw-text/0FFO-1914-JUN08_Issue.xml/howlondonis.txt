how london is fed daily needs of many millions organiation and transportin other articles in this issue the problem of food supply and transport in great britain is discussed from various aspects it is obvious that in a nation which contains many dense centres of population and which has to depend so largely upon imported foodstuffs the problem presented is somewhat complox the system by wliich the needs of such districts as london south lancaslire and the glasgow industrial area are met has only been gradually evolved and presents many features of interest it is the capital city however with a population of seven and a half millions absolutely depondent upon outside sources for their daily bread which constitutes the best example that the world can furnish of a scientific system of food supply and transport other cities have solved the samo problem on a smaller scale but it is in london that ths genius of organiza tion in food supply has found its fullest scope it is a problem which has to be solved day by day the foodstuff which are actually in london at any particular moment would probably not suffice for the needs of the popula tion a single week if tho transport avenue were blocked for more than a fevw days the prices of foodstuffs would first rise to a level which would prevent a largo percentage of the population from purchasing food and soon there would be none which money could buy the richest capital in the world is living from hand to mouth relying on a margin which any break down of the system would wipo oult and turn into a deficit vithin a period which caa be measured in hourste area of londonvto understand tho nature of tho task of providing food supplies to a great population it is necessary to try and form an idoa of its real size and tlho extent of the area which has to be supplied the administrative county of london with its  square miles of area over  miles of streets and  houses is only a part of the real city this artificial legal boundary takes no account of large areas which belong properly to london of willesden and acton of ealind and brent ford barnes and wtimbledon of east and west ham hornsey woodgreen and totten ham walthamstow or barking include those in london bear in mind that richmond and kingston harrow and barnet woodford and romford and even croydon are almost a part of it and a clearer idea of the nature of the task thrown upon those who are responsible for the food supply of greater london will have been gained even then however the real boundaries of the city which is ever including fresh districts witbin itself will not have been definitely fixed the growth of london is a process which is apparently im ending tho giant city is ever throwing out new tentacles devouring fields and hedgerowvs filling the valleys and covering the hills and creating centres of metropolitan life where once the hanmlet sleptsuprrly or pixmrxy foodsso complete however are the arrangements for the stupply and distribution of food day by day to the inhabitants of this growing area that the wonder of it all has passed into a commonplace take the simplest case of all the provision of water that there should be a regular and full supply of drinking water and water for domestic use generally is accepted as a matter of course the average citizen takes little count of the provision of new reservoirs and the laying of new mnains which is constantly occupying the attention of the water board in this field of supply it is necesmry to take long views and arrangements are now in progress to increase the supply and the storage capacitv to a point whlicl will meet the increased needs of london for the next  years or take the sulpply of another universal commoditvmilk at one period grainfed cows were largely kept in sheds in london but the practice ic rapidly dying out nearly all the milk now constumedl in london is bronght in by the railway coin panics it is drawn from a ver wide area hnndreds of farnm within a radius of  miles of the metropolis are supplying milk to london the great wuestern railway corn pany received at its london station last year nearly two million churnis representing  gallons of nilk the southwestern company received over one million chutrns the northwestern the great northern midland and other railways aro also large carriers of milk some of the supply reaches london from the north of france and in times of drought in england irish milk has been placed on breakfast tables in london these are two of the simplest instances of the organiza tion necessary to supply the daily needs of londons many million inhabitantsthe port or londonthey form only the preface to the real story of how london is fed the materials for this can only be found at the great dock system of the metropolis in the statistics of the supply of the great food markets of the metropolis by a study of railway traffics of shipping and of international trade farm produce raised ini distant cattle ranches of argentina the sheep farms of australasia the tea plantations of india and of china these and a hundred other sources are drawn upon for the food of london take tho case of the supplies vwhich reach the thames in ships from oversca a visit to any of the docks of the port autboritv will never fail to find food hips discharging into train or stora tea at st katharines wines and spirits at the london docks canadian produce at the surrey dock rum at the west india grain at millwall colonial mutton at the albert and victoria ware houses in the city itself refrigerating stores at smithfield reinforce the dock acconmnodation it would be easy to multiply statistics of food imports into the port of london a few domi nant figures will howevr suffice there were landed at the port last financial year  million tons of grain over one million tons of wheat  tons of chilled beef and frozen mutton  tons of sugar  packages representing  tons of tea  tons of cofee  tons of cocoa  tons of arrowroot sago and tapioca a large percentage if not all these and the many other foodstuffs which reach the ports are for consumption in londonfood by ranthe food supplies which reach londonthrough its docks are however only ono source the railways which do such im portant work in the carriage of milk carry a large food trafie not only from local producers in many parts of the country in the form of farm produce vegetables fruit game cattle meat and the output of breweries and dis tilleries but bring produce landed at otherports to the london market danish baconeggs and butter fror harwich irish bacon from the various irish ports potatoes from thechannel islands imported meat from liverpool and birkenhead fish from grimsby and other ports all these foodstuffs are reaching london over the railways every day small things as well as large necessary foods and luxuries figure in the traffic one raiway alone brought last year  tons of asparagus and  tons of watercress into london over another route there reached london in one month i million baskets of strawberries and the same company handled a large traffic in live turtles a newer system of food transport is that furnished by the commercial motor which is now being employed for short hauls between country districts near london and the metro poliswhoufsme marketssome of the food which reaches london is directly consigned to wholesale houses but the bulk goes to market to be sold an account is given in separate articles of the work of the different markets smithfield billingsgate covent garden leadenhall and others from whence foodstuffs are distributed to an area even wvider than greater london but it will be of interest to consider these markets in their relation to the supply of food to the metropolis take the case of a perishable commoditv such as is dealt wvith at billingsgate a constant stream of carriers bring daily to london the catch of the north sea trawlers but  per cent or about  tons of the annual catch is brought to billingsgate by rail from the various fish ports the railways also carry large direct consignments covent garden is the main source of supply for vegetables and fruit it is the custom of both large and small shopkeepers to send thither in the early morn ing for the days supplies and other local markets draw on covent garden its central situation is in its favour for the reception not only of home supplies from the railway termini and of the large tonnage which reaches the market by road but of colonial and inter national supplies fruits from california from australia and south africa and bananas from the west indies and canaries a large tonnage of the oversea consignments come direct from southamptonthr wor ov dstbbroxensmithfield the greatest meat market in tho world is the main distributing centre of the meat supply for london the  tons of meat sold here in the course of a single year go to other places than london but the metropolis is the principal customer and from this source the thousands of retail butchers in the londoin area draw their main supplies the market is well served by railways and the work of reception and sale of meat and its distribution to shops in the metrorolis is like that of covent garden and billingsgate done while london sleeps nearly  millions sterling changed hands in smith field miarket last year lpoultry and game sup ply is the work of leadenhall market and from thence london draws its supplies not only of the ordinary poultry and game but of the rarer varieties for which there is always a large demand the proximrity of the market to billingsgate is an advantage in view of the i association in retail shops of the fish and poultrv trades and the fact that the same cart can fetch purchases away from both markets has served to limit an early morning food traffic congestion which has now reached its maximummany are only familiar with tho aspect  these distributing centres during the day that is not the time to gain any real impres sion of the work they do they must be eeen in the full tide of their activities in the crowded hours from midnight until  am the whole cycle of operations the long inward procession of bulk arrivals by rail and road of empties to take away supplies the sales and then the outward flow of laden vehicles to fill the shops of inner london and the distant suburbs these scenes in whlichl chaos seems to reign and yet underlying wiich order and method may be dimly recognized even by the uninitiated must be witnessed if an adequate impression is to be gained of the organization which forms the first step in the task of filling the larders of a million houses with thleir daily foodtan damly rotdthe task is however not yet fully performed it has been shown how the vast variety of food products drawn from all sources and the pro duct of every soil and climate has been distri buted either through the docks the markets or by direct consignment or through the whole sale houses to the retail trade much worl has yet however to be carried out in about everv street the baker has been converting wheat into bread the dairyman has fetched supplies from the railway stations and the retail shops have obtained delivery from the various markets of tho commodities in which they deal the individual conlsumer has still to be reached streets echo with the rattle of the early morning cart the immediate mission of which is to enable london to brealdast once again to the deliveries from the dairy and the baker follow those from the greengrocer from the butcher from the fishmonger and from the general store then when lunch is over the dairyman who had furnished yesterdays couitrv milk for the breakfast table provides a later supply for afternoon tea a hndred thousand cooks and chefs are soon busy with the dinner menu in houses where they dine instead of merely eating the wins are selected regular diners out devote an hour to the pre paration of brilliant impromptus or in seeking to give familiar stories a frwh tun tables are laid cratains are drawn and the lamps lighted london is served
