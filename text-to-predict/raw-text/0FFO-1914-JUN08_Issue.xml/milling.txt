milling early history of the industrycorn miling possesses a distinctive historical interest over every other manufacturing art known it is the oldest continuously conducted industry of the world the earliest efforts of primeval man in the peaceful arts were pro bably directed to pounding a rude kind of meal from grain tle corn was simply broken up by a conveniently shaped stone such as the hammer stone found in kents cave tor quay in s in duo cotirse the pounding process of grain gave place to a grinding mill this was effected by what is called the  saddle  corn stone which stands preemident among the milling appliances of the world it was the first contrivance by whieh grindingas dis tinguished fromn poundingwas actually effectedthis saddle stone derives its name from a resemblance its coneave upper surface bears to a saddle in this hollow the gtain was ground by a small stone muller worked backwards and forwards by constant wear the original slight concavity was coinmonly deepened till the stone assumed the extremely worn ap pearance seen in many prehistoric british specimens and finauy became useless dr schlienann has expressed the opinion that saddlestones such for instance as those he discovered at troy were unsuitable for grind ing only a kinid of groats could be made in this way not flour and the bruised grain could not have been used for breadmaking in homer we find it referred to as being used for porridge and also for strewing on roasted meats how ever nothing is more certain than that the trojans did not live on porridge but ground grain for making bread or cakes the grain being reduced on the saddle stones it i possible to grind with the stono a very fair quality of meal and in fast meal which according to moderm ideas was of good qsualty haswithin the last few years been ground upon a prehistoric irish saddle stonetho ownership and wvorking of corn mnills at the birth of feudalism were prerogatives of the rulers of the people none but them or their nominees could presume to set up corn mills and the law of milling soke the common law of the lancl by immemorial custorn and older than any englisll statutebound theople to support mills thus set up by theirwater mmils and wlndxijsin an article of this charaeter it is not possible to do more than briefly treat upon the various changes which the industry has undergone and it is not a little remarkable what a small pro gross had been made in the art up to the com mencement of tho victorian era all power corn mills are shown to be directlv derived from the greek water miu water mnills alone prevailed till the twelfth century the earliest kcnown allusion to a water mill the first power mill of the world occurs in an epigram by antipater of thessalonica who flourished about  bcye maids who toiled so faithful at the millnow cease youir work and from those toils be still sleep now till dawn and let the birds with glee sing to the ruddy morn on bush and treefor what youir hapds performed so long and true ceres has charged tho water nymphs to dothe windmiul was not added to the milling resources of the world till the closing vears of the twelfth century when tho first authoritative records refer to one erected in england for centuiries millers accustomed to the click of the wheel and the wvhirl of the sail and dreaming of no improvement in their antique machinery or methods seemed to regard the unrelieved monotony of the past as the due and proper condition of affairs at the mil and appeared well satisfied with the simple rfforts to keep abreast with the requirements of tho times at length engineering science broke in upon the seclusion and apathv of this for sakeni or neglected industry rollers raoidlv supplanted stones rnd milling attained a position of scientific and economic efficieney never before possibleintroductio of rollipsin the year  appeared definite attempts to build power mills in which rollers should partly or wlholly supersede stones the firt wvere started in paris vienna and switzerland but these practically failedten years later a swviss narmed muller intro duced to some swiss capitalists a project of building roller mills oii plans he possessed a jointstock company was formed to carry out his plans at tho swiss town of frauefeldi with a capital equivalent to about  this mill had five storeys rollers breing placed on each floor the mill was started in  and given a thorough trial but despite every effort it proved a complete failure and mulller discredited disappeared from the scene at this juncture the companr called to their aid another engineer who proved equal to the occasion he undertook the complete reconstruaction of the roller plant arid oventu ally made it a great success and to sulzborger and to switzerland is to be distinctly attributed the hononr of devising and working tho first successful roller mill in the world following on this was the pesth mill and ultimately rollor milling reached so high a degree of per foction as to establish the system throughout the milling world it is thus to hungeary that appertains the honour of produicing the best results from perfecting roller milling oni a large sealo about  the roller system was introduced into the united kingdomn and profiting by past experiences a modification was made to avoid on the one hand tho grpat complications roferred to and on tho othor hand to obtain modern machinerv to deal nith the variouis qualities of wheat to be treated the result has been so satisfactorv that at this moment no moro perfect installation of machinery for flour producing can be found than what wve have in this countrythe great changes brought about by these modern inventions and developments now necessitate a considerably greater deg eo of scientific knowledge and practical skill on the part of the miller than has ever before been requisite and when it is considered how varied are the present trade complications and usages with wvhich the miller is called upon to deal it will readily be porceived that a vast multiplicity of hitherto unknown details have been introduced into his business and that a complicated yet complete systemn has ne cessarily been organized and is daily carried out by the conductors of our huge modern flour millsflou from native wheatup to the beginning of the last century the whole or nearly the wholo consunption of flour in great britain was made from native wheat and the crudo form of milling then obtaining was practically sufficient for the purpose but witlh the growth of population coupled with the decreased production of wheat the in creased supplies of the grain had to be furnished by other parts of the world ihe quantity of wheat wo now grow in comparison with the consumption is about  per cent so that taking the consumption of the country at  million quarters annually we require an importation of  million quarters of foreign wheat
