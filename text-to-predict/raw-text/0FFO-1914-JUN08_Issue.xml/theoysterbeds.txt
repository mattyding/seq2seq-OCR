the oyster beds of whitstable an ancient fishing industrythe oyster beds of whitstable alone have an average output per seasonaugust to mayof  million oysters and colchester and other essex centres furnish at least half that number the value of the trade of the chief whitstable company incor porated in the th century is between  and  each season although whitstable and colchester are the chief english sources of supply there are other smaller centres of the oyster trade one of these is the mumbles in south wales but there is a disposition in kent and essex to regard the mumbles oyster as of service only to the sauce chef the chief foreign supplies are from dutch and french sources and the areachon oysters are in good reputefamous ostxz bedselxperience has shown that while a certain measure of success has attended the endeavour to create oyster beds they are reallya natural formation oysters can be laid and kept alive almost anywhere but that is not enough the oyster has to be fed and fattened before it can be regarded as a table delicacy at whitstable the necessary conditions for successful culture of this bivalve are present here is to be found a moderate depth of water a sluggish current a sea bed formed mainly of the london clay and the necessary mixture of salt and fresh water in which the oyster thrives from the marshy lands between whitstable and faversham fresh water runs down into the sea and brings with it the myriads of diatoms which are the natural food of the oyster the beds at whitstable lie a short distance off the foreshore in a depth of water which accord ing to the state of the tide ranges from ft to ft and are about six square miles in extent oyster breeding is an ancient industry in kent one of the chief owners holds the freehold of the fishery by a grant made in the reign of queen elizabeth and there was a company of free dredgers at faversham in the year  records are in existence of sales of oysters to the dutch in the reign of henry i one advantage of the whitstable beds is the existence of a natural bank of boulders and sliingle this bank which runs out into the sea formas a natural breakwater and gives protection to the shallower fishery and breeding groundsfsmisg for ovsrnsthe whitstable beds are dredged daily during the season for the quantity on order for the market and it is an interesting experi ence to go out in early morning with the boats and watch the sequence of operations the portion of the fishery which is dredged for native oysters is about two miles off shore and the type of vessel commonly employed is a cutterrigged yawl of from  to  tons burden but lacking the mnizenmnast and sail which a yawlrigged boat should possess another kind of boat found in the whitstable fleet is the borley of the type used by shrinpers on the thames she can sail nearer to the wind than a yawl and distinguishing features are the rowingboat stern and the boomless upright mainsail on busy days a fleet of  sail will bn at work the oyster dredge each smack works five or sixis made of wrought iron and is triangular in form it varies in weight the heavier dredges being operated from the bows of the smack and the lighter dredges from the stern each dredge weighs from about b to b and four men generally constitute the crew of a smack the work is done with the vessel square to the tide with which and the wind it sails and drifts when the dredge is hauled and the contents turned out on deck it often contains much besides oysters and of eourse the small soles crabs l and some of the other fish are retainedold axd modern prrcestoday the best whitstable oysters are sold wholesale at ss per  wvhen this price which by the time the oyster reaches the con sumer is doubled is compared with the price of id per  for oysters in  as recorded in the roll of thorney no doubt remains as to the increasing prices of certain articles of diet even in  the oyster was only regarded as of equal value with the mussel and cockle the price for any of these shellfish being sd a bushel it was only by slow degrees that it became the aristocrat among shellfishamr collard in his work on the subject states that selsey oysters fetched is d per  in the year  twentyfour years later a barrel of mendham oysters cost s and a purchase of  great oysters is recorded at s per  and in  hunston oysters cost s d per  the kentish gazette in its issue of january   mentioned that oysters fetched four guineas a bushel at billings gate they were brought to london in wagons as the frost was so severe that vessels could not bring the oysters up by water the wholesie price of  royals  at whitstable in feb ruary  was s per  tale the samee as today french and other foreigu oysters are very much cheaperbreeding antd rareingthe high price of the oyster is partly ex plained by the time it takes for it to reach maturitv the common oyster which is the one cultivated in the british isles is a sexless creature and the spawn which it emits like a puff of white smoke in june is estimated to contain about a million organisms to each adult oyster most of it is destroyed or we should live in an island surrounded not by sea but by oysters the spat which changes through grey to black in colour floats at first in the water and the survivors which become the oysters of the future fall to the bottom of the sea and fasten themselves to a stone a shell or other hard substance the dredge often brings up the shells to which the young oysters are attached and these which are known as cultch are invariably put back into the water at a later stage generally in spring time the voung oyster leaves the cultch and begins an independent existence settling with the deep or left shell which has now been formed uppermnost the flat shell lying on the ground the oyster goes through a variety of stages and it is not until it is six or seven years of age that it is considered to have reached a condition suitable for the marketa great deal of the spat would be lost if the young oysters were not fished for outside the limits of the port and returned in large numbers to the breeding beds inshore and at whitstable the flatsmen as they are caued make a good living by dredging for immature oysters oysters in various stages of development are also importod for fattening purposes from other districts and from abroad during the close season the fishing fleet engage largely in what may be termed submarine gardening the breeding beds being put in proper conditions by the deposition of shells and inother ways prepared to ensure the best condi tion of the sea bed for breeding purposesthe enermies of the ovster are numerous and persistent the chief of these is the sea urchin  the common starfish is another who lies patiently in attendance until the molluso opens the dogwhelk is also appreciative and uses a filelike weapon with which it bores a hole in the shell and then extracts the oyster cold too is another enemy and one advantage of whitstable is the warming effect of the streams wlhich flow over ravashsm flats into the sea then there is the natural mortality from various cause n an oyster bed
