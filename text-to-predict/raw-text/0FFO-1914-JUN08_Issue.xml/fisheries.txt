british ports and whose share in production is therefore not included in irish statisticsmacemrxl hbdsnocsirelands average annual production of mackerel amounts to some  tons of which about twothircls

of butter to england for the year  was  an amount onlv exceeded bv the danish export of  the trade in irish butter is largely concentrated at par ticnlar centres of distribution in great britain this fact while perhaps to somo extent limiting the total trade makes the irish butter supply at certain places a factor of very great im portance it is largest in the great centres of consumption in the west and northwest of great britain as for instance wales lanca shire ancl the west of scotland this tendency to centre itself in these particular localities is largely due to transit facilities but it ispartlv owing also to the fact that in these districts it has obtained a special vogue as testified by many wholesale merchants from great britain at the departmental committee on the irish butter industrv which sat in  some of the butter produced in ireland is superior in quality to butter from any other cotuntry which supplies the british markets if there fore the average quality of irish butter were levelled up to the standard which has been reached by not a few manufacturers its reputa tion wvould be even more firmly establislhed in british marketsof late years a very great improvernent has taken place in packing butter for the wholesale markets since the department of agriculture and technical instruction for ireland has drawn up standard specifieations for the b kiel and for the tlb pyramid boxes it is not only however in this wav that the department has been helping and guiding the butter trade it employs eight imtructors in dairving wvho visit periodically almost all the creameries in ireland and advise the proprietors and managers as to the best methods of production and marketing of buttor in addition  instructors in hoime butter making are employed

probably due to the fact that the conditions under whlich irish poultry are kept are very well suited toegg production as they are generally permittedi to range freely over considerable areas ihisi is

have been made in recent years in tho packing of eggs thle old type of case which held  or  long hundreds of eggs has almost entirely disappeared and now eggs are sent by the best shippers in cases of three six eight and  long hundreds aid in a manner which leaves very little to be desiredpouitrmywhilst egg production must continue to be the mainstay of the poultrykeeping industry in ireland the rearing of table poultry is in itself of sufficient importance to demand seriousattention and is moreover capable of i very considerable development the valueof the export of poultry fron ireland to great britain in  exceeded  or nearly four times as much as the pouitry traue of russia her nearest competitor about one third of the irish exports of poultry consists of live birdstho raising of market chickens is confined chiefly to certain parts of the country notably the counties of kiilkenny carlow wexiord i and waterford good chickens are also pro duced in some areas in the north of ireland the districts of lisburn saintfeld lurgan and portadown in particular a large portion of the chickexns reared are exported alive to english fattening centres although of late years efforts have been made to promote poultry fattening in ireland thuis the depart ment of agriculture established at rathdrum co wicklow a training school for this purpose the department has been consistently advising irish exporters with regard to the gradinig and paeking of poultry and an instructor con stantly visits shippers of poultry and is at all times ready to afford such inforrnation advice and instruction as may be sought in connexion with the tradethe trade in poultry has of course been helped by the eggdistributing stations whichas already pointed out have been established in connexion with the irish egg industry a feature of the poultry trade is the export of turkeys and as is well known irish turkeys are famnous in the english markets con siderable numbers of geese and ducks are also f exportedfruitthough the irish fruit trade does not attain to any very considerable proportions yet the export to great britain is worth some  per year apples being the largest item the area under fruit in ireland has been extended considerablv in recent years and this is es pecially true of orchards the acreage of which for the year  was more than  per cent greater than that for the year  the largest fruitgrowing areas are to be found in i co armaghforty instructors are employed each vear by the department of agriculture in giving demonstrations in orchards and gardens and in advising fruit growers generallv verv great irmprovement has been effected in the marketing of irish frnit in conjunction with the ulster fruit growers association a most useful body the organization rf which was materially assisted by the departments officers rules for the grading and packing of fruit have been drawn ip and standard packagets have been approved a very distinct improve  ment has been eficted int the packing of applesin standard barrels o canadian lines the associations label on a barrel or box of apples is a guarantee as to the variety and grade of the contents and also that the package is a standard package the label bears the packors registered number so that if the con tents are found to be other thani what they should be he can be communicated withtile department has also endeavoured with a considerable degree of success to bring about an improvement in the marketing of black berries of which very large qxuantities are sent to engish and scotch preserve makers their efforts have been directed mainly towards inducing exporters to use small kegs holding about lewt of fruit instead of large casks lholding cwt to cwt  to grade the f ruitmore carefully rejecting what is overripe and under ripe and to forward the fruit while quite fresh for small fruits chip baskets havebeen very largely introduced
