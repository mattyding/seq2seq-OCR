the meat tradr   iteportance of south america chief sources of sutply increasing importsonefifth of the ujnited kingdoms imports of food is meat and the total value of imaports of meat of all kinds in  was no less than  tho changes in our sup plies of meat from abroad have been sig nificant especially withllin the past  years these changes have in great part been the resrult of improvements in refrigeration and the development of cold storage but whereas these specified causes have been responsible for augmentation of supplies they have had little direct bearing on the most remarlable of all the changes that is the almost corn plete cessation of imports from the united states once our chief source of supply the reasons for this change are well set out in the article on the worlds cattle supplies today argentina supplies by far the largest proportion of maeat sent to this countrylrve stocxso rapid has been the diminution during the past decade in the number of lier stock coming from abroad that this factor is now almost negligible when dealing in a general wav with our meat supplies indeed in  the total value of live stock imported was in round figures only about  in  the united states sent us  head of cattle and  sheep last year the number of cattle had fallen to  while no sheep arrived a similar change has occurred in regard to canada taking the samo years the decreases were cattle from  to  sheep  to  there is little variation in the importatioh of channel islands cattle which show an average number of  head yearly in the matter of weight beef heads the list of meat imports while bacon comnes out on top in regard to prices thus in  our imports of bacon vete valued at  representing cwt and beef fresh and refrigerated at  representing cwtthen followed
