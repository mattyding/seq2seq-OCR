rwroicncoslond mxrt said the irish nationalistc and some of their british vassals had been throwing their caps into the air and cheering for the victory of their cause the home rule bill having passed the third reading in the house of commons thev thought or pretended to think that the battlc was won and that all was over bar the shouting there never was a greater mistke he added amid cheers  the real battle ie only beginiing there are some things too big to be achieved by trickerv however clever lhe attempt to break up the union nithout giving the people of great britain a chance of preventing it is one of thosc i hings the government would not in the end be able to withdraw their irish policy from the judg ment of the people they mizht perhaps succeed in placing the bill on the statutebook though it is not there yet by a long way but thev would not be able to enforce it before they were obliged to go to the tribunal of the nation whose verdict alone could settle this businessthere was no seat in all englandthere might he a ferw in scotland and walesthat the liberals could be sure of holdin ant the present time that was the position of a glovernment which proposed to ask the king to put his signature to the greatest constitutional change which had been introduced in this coiuntry for nearly a century ut the people were going to be the final arbiters whateverthe government might do the house of lords was to be asked to help the overnment out of the mess into which thev had got themselves and to avert civil war in ireland whlielh the liome rule ill as it stood was certain to bring did they ever know such a topsvturvv pro ceeding  the right wavy to avoid civil war and the only sure way was to scrap the whole policy vhieh ws leading to it if the government were not pre pared to do that let them go to the people and try to get authoritv for itit would lbe better that treland should he cut in two than that the wvhole of lreland should bcomne a cokpit hut that was only the lesser of two evils the tunionist partv wanted to avoil both and tlhe wav to do that was niot to dismemlber the tnited kingdom and thus escape the necessity of dividing irelandwhat was the use of going on with this wrtched buziness  thev have got on to the wrong traek and to stick to it was orly to lead from disaster to disastera fomr wnoyoload selborn said that on two oecasions home ritle billi hnd been rejected by the electors wvhy was it that the people were not now going to have the cmrtiee of doing wvhat their fathers did  the govornment had passed the parliamcnt act because they did not want to refr the question to the people they had said that they wvere going to take away the peers veto but they were reallyl takinig away the veto of the neople if they had reformed the hiouseo of lords thiat would have been all right but they hal not done sotho uninimity of thought nnd conviction in uistr was onie o the most wonderful spectacles ever seen thehy had triade unionists andl nonunionists emnploy rs aniid workmen united in their hatred of ine itule it was only whenl the government found that ulster was arming that thev listened to her appeal wvas it any vonder tllat ulster was relying on her owvn right arm  but she still trusted the pople of england their message to utlster was to le lpatient ito keep llf itheir organization but not to break the peace and vuiy still might look to the working men and to the classes of england to stand by them cheers the irish people could not settle these matters by themnselves if the unionists of england stood aside the men of the south could never force the men of the north to submit to a parlia ment in dublin the nationalists would rely on thle people of england to send the kings regiments to maku e tl i men of the northi submit to idome itweif this foul rong is done lord seiborne con chided  remember it will be done in your name cries of  never i  we see civil war looming on every handthat is

eastbournethe duxin of devoqsra who presided said that in some pigeonhole of the government offices there might be or might not be an amending ihome rule bill in the process of creation the betting was about equal whether the bill ecisted or whether it did not exist laughter personally he nwas inclined to think it did not exist he had heard from a reliable source that if the home itule bill became an act of parliament they would have from the west and south of ireland at least five parties some people thought there might bo six they would all quarrel they would all fight and thev would all be on the make laughter there was one thing these five parties would unite upon they vould combine to make a raid upon the british tazpayers cheers he asked that before a change involving such great fundamental alterations was adopted the people of this country should be allowed the opportunity of saying yes or no to these proposals cheerslord ciarleus baxsson said the government had threatened ulster all along the line until thev armed and now the government were creeping and crawling asking what concessions they would take they wouldtakenone ecxept the maintenance of the union
