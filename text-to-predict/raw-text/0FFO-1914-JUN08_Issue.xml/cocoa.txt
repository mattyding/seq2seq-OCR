cocoa increasing consumptioncocoa was first brought to europe from mlexico by coluumbus about the year  wlhcnce its subsequent introduction into ejngland took place in  in mexico and peru it was cultivated and enjoved long before the advent of columnbus and so highly was it valued that in fexico it was used as a medium of exchange in place of moneviho cocoa of commerce is manufactured from the beans of two or three species of small trees indigenous to the forests of tropical central america the worlds cocoa supply being chiefly derived from the species theobroma cacao l the narric theobroma was given by linnaus whose opinion of the product was so high that lie named it the food of the gods oa god and fpipa foodthe common species of cocoa trees are evergrcens with short straight trunks while plantation trees sometimes reach a height of ft the fruits which show considerable variations in size and usually contain five rows of  beans each are formed from cushions or swellings on the stem or principal branches of the tree these tirst give rise to flowers and subsequentlv to the fruitsthe age at which the trees begin to bear mov be three and a half years as on the gold coast in samoa trinidad and ceylon or six years as in nicaragua and ecuadorcounries of productionthe principal cocoaproducing countries are brazil and ecuador which contribute between them nearly a thirdl of the worlds supplv other important sources are san thom trinidad santo domingo venezuela britislh wx est africa the west indies and ceylon the total production at the present time amounting to some  tons a year the principal consumers are the united states gerrnany united kingdom france and the netherlands wvho among them account for  per cent of the total eonsumptionthe inereasing popularity of cocoa and chocolate in this country is shown by the fact that its consumption has risen from half a million pounds in  to  million pounds in  and to  million pounds in  at the present time it is considerably over llb per head of populationbroadlv speaking cocoa cultivation is limited to lands lying within deg of the equator al hot moist equable climate witlh well distributed though not excessive rainfall appear to he indispensable while the soil requires to be relatively rich in lime potash and phosphoric acidpropagation may be effected either by grafting or by eansowing in the latter cace the beans are planted in nurseries or preferably in pots whence in sbc or eight months time when they are about a foot high the young plants are carefully transplanted just before the rainy season to their permanent homes in the plantation cocoa is a delicate plant and requires to be carefully shaded from the wind no less than from the withering heat of the sun this is usually effected by planting some shady tree such as the banana chillie or para rubber at regular and frequent intervals throughout tha cocoathe cocos bedrthe fruits which in shape somewhat re semble an elongated citron vary in colour from pale yellow to dark red and require the exercise of much care and discrimination in the matter of harvesting the method usually employed being that of severing them from the parent stem by the aid of a sharp knife attached to the end of a pole the fruit shells are then split open and the liberated beans transported to the fermenting house where the subsequent fermentation not only facilitates the removal of the slimy substance surrounding them and helps to dissociate the bean from its seedcoat but at the same time substantially improves the quality of the kernel by removing a proportion of the tannin presentthe cured beans are then cleaned and graded by being rotated in barrelshaped sieves and are then passed through a machine which cracks and removes their shells the shelled and roasted kernels are then ground into a paste between heated rollers when the greater proportion of the contained fat is run off into moulds and subsequently sold under the name of cocoa butter the flavouring matters generally added are vanilla spices and volatile oils while starchy or sugary matters are added to improve its miscibilitv the shells are frequently ground and used for the adulteration of the lower grades of cocoa
