talking poor a privilege of the richnbom a coprespondentono of tho greatest hardships of comparative poverty is that it must niot be admitted for the poor man to say that he is poor is fatal to hide his miserable condition ho must spend and spend lavishly he muist foed at the best restaurants be clothed by good tailors scorn the cheap and convenient omnibus adopt the worries of an income he does not possess and talk loudly of the iniquities of the supertax by doing au this he may be able to give to the rich as well as to the other poor an impression of wealth that at least keeps his credit good only to the really rich and the really poor is it permitted to practise economy openly the really poor do it because they have no credit the realy rich because they do not need itbefore we may indulge ourselves in that luxury of the rich talking poor we must be very sure of our banking account it must be able to support us adequately in our pro testations of poverty so that we may never be believed we must be beyond temptation able to talk poverty but never forced to act it we must have so mtuch money that we can really believe ourselves poor or at least capable of being made poortve m uolaines dreadmillionaires must live in a constant state of dread lest they should some day cease to own millions they take no chances tradition has itand tradition is mostly founded upon factthat there never vet was a millionaire who walked the streets with as much as los in small change in his pocket and why should he  the world is fulll of people only too anxious to lend cab fares to millionaires hoping that the loan thus cast upon the waters will return to them some day in a grossly magnified form it is always a safe or at any rate a good gamble to lend a very rich man a few shillings if you are a poor man just tribute is the least we can call it for the poor man has everything to gain by being seen in the company of the rich evervbody knows the story of the bright young man who made a fortune because he was seen walking down throgmnortonstreet or threadneedlestreet or some other city byway in company with a very big man of finanee they tell the story in berlin in paris probably in tokyo it is not necessarily true in fact but the spirit of the story is sounclas a rule when poverty hobnobs with wealth wealth talks poor all the time and acts rich poverty talks rich and acts poor that is the difference millionaire seems to take a special delight in seeking the sympathy of fivehbudred ayear ee tells hnim of the stupendous ex penses of his palatial establishments draws vivid wordpietures of the straits in which he finds himself in order to meet the ceaseless demands for money that beset him on every side and generally manages to assque his conm panion in the most convincing tones that he should thank the idndly fates that mucll wealth has been denied hinm ho doos this partly boecaluse he likes to believe it partly to hoad off any attemptontho part of fivelilndredayear to get anything out of himbut fiveliundredayear is flattered by it he is pleased that the great man should corne down to his level and seek his sympathy he feels that he is seeing the human side of this magnate that is hidden from the rest of the world and he almost believes the story of the sorrows of the rich and then perhaps diffl dently he will ask the great man to lunch with him it seems presumption but thenbefore he has time to wonder whether he hns over stepped the bounds of consideration the poorshould by right accord to the rich the great nan has accepted hailed a cab and given the driver the narne of thle most expensive restau rant in townfivehundredayear pays for the cab and the tunch and at the end of the meal millionaire shakes him warmnly by the hand and leaves him and takes an omnibus to pall mall to buy another steam yacht five hundredayear takes a taxicab to the bank to arrange another snmall overdraft but they are mutually satisfiedmillionaire because he has had a good free lunch fivehundredayear because he has been seen in a public place with a most influential personaifeoctatmion of srmrrcitywe might have expected that the poor man would have spent the ilmch time in seeking advice from the rich on howv to become rich or in trying to boitow some of his riches from hirm or the millionaire unbending over the coffee and liqueurs might have spoken kind helpful words whispered that certain stock was worth buying or even scribbled on his card an introduction to some other influential man by whose favour the poor man might have become rich perhaps the hope that something of this kind might take place was not altogether absent from the mind of fivehrundredayear and most probably millionaire knew itwilth millionaires the art of talking about unexpected things is a very fine one they know that nearly every one they meet even a brother millionaire wants something out of them and so in selfdefence they choose at once the subject of conversation and the poor man never thinks it tactful to interrupt the rich he agrees with him joins willingly in the dis cussion expresses his apparently muchsought after views becomes in a few minutes greatly impressed with the impression he is making on the great one  imen we have finished this interesting conversation on gardening or indigestion or egyptian searabs he tells himself  i shall be on such friendly terms with this great man that i shall be able easily to persuade him to do wlhat i wantand then the conversation ends the great man rises hle is amazingly human as he offers his hand and tells how much he has enjoyed the chat it is so seldom that he finds one quite so original in his views thev mrust continue the talk at some other time soon he would like to so now but alas  he has an appointment that will not wait  goodbye goodbye now come and see me again soon he reiterates andthe poor man is out in the corridor out in the street perhaps before he realizes that the object of his mission was never once mentionedthat is how the rich defend themselves against the poor they talk to them as poor man to poor man rs brother to brother flatter them interest them but talk business never for the rich man knows so well that the gateway to wealth is found by chance stumbled upon as the result of a word at hazard not found by long laborious toilng along the narrow paths of industry and virtue and the rich man knows that the more people who find that door the harder it is for him to keep his riches so gently but firmly he edges the poor man on to the wrong path but he does it very nicely
