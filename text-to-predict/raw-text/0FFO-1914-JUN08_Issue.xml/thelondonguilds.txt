tnhe london guilds a  history of victuallieng evolution of the ivery comaipanies their rise and decayin the miiddle ages every art craft trade or other industrial occupation in which men engaged for profit had its guild or its  mistery which controlled the procecdings of au who practised the art craft or trade affected the word  mistery  needs somo explanation etymologically it is quite distinct from the word  mystery and it lhts nothing to do with trade secrets as such it is merely the english form of the french mnticr and it has exactly the same connotation that of a trade calling or pursuit in which were engaged all those who were enrolled in or controlled by the same guild rnistery or company as the guild after wards catne to be called tho same kind of association which wvas called a guild or mistery in england was also called a guild or gild in north oermany whoreas in sotith germanv it was more comnmonly called a  zuaft and in france it was called a  nmticr littris finds the origin of niicr in the latin minister while others have preferred to connect it with magister but as littro suggests these two words may be respectively formed from marjor and minor so thrat the vwords rmitie and mistery may include etymologically as inl practice they comprised both masters and journeyrmen of the saine craftbut the gutild as suhli had a very long history before it became identified with and absorbed in the mistery no attempt can be made to trace that history here it covers the wvhole social life of england from anglosaxon times down to the t and lth ceenturies and it enters as an organic factor into the history of the english town avo are here only concerned witi the gtild in its wadual evolu tion into the mister as abovo defined and with its further evolution into tho liver company we must also fuirtiher limit our surveto those special formus of it wvhich conduicted and controlled the supply of food jho livery companies of today vwe knonv fhey are the most conspicuous survivals of an organization for the regulation of trade and induistry wliich once spread over the wvhole country vith a rare exception here andl there they now survive in london only therefore in tracing the relations of the guilds and misteries anld the livery companies to the stupply of food in london wve shall in effect be doing the samne thing for the whole countrymedieval tiadl and industvyin a famous passage at tho beginning of his history froude has contrasted the conception of trade and industrv and their reulation which prevailed in the mliddle ages with that which now finds acceptance mith the votaries of carlyles  dismal science there was no dismal science in the miiddle ages if says froude  the tendenxcy of trade to assumne at last a fonn of inere selfinterest be irre sistible if political economy represent the laws to which in the end it is forced to submit itself the nation spared no efforts either of art or policy to defer to the last moment the utn welcome conclusion the guilds were the agency througl which these efforts were directed and coordinated froude con tinuesthose companies were once some thing more than names they are rl which now remain of a arst organization which once penetrated the entire trading life of englandan organization set on foot to realize that most necessarv if most difficult condition of commercial excellerine under which rnan should deal faithfully with his brotber and all wares ofrered for sale of whatever kind should honestly be what they pretend to be i spoke of the militarv principle which directed the distribation and the arrangements of land lbe analogy will best explain a state of things in which every occuxpation was treated as the division of an army regiments being quartered in every town each with its own selfelected offcers whose duty was to exercise anuthority over alt crsons professing the business o wilich theay belonged who were to see that no person undertook to

sbould be trulv and faithfully observed an organization for that purpose did once really exist in england really trving to do the work which it was intended to do as half the pages of our early statutes witness    no person was allowed to open a trinde or to commence a manu facture either in london or the provinces unless he had first served his apprenticeship inless he could prove to the satisfbction of the authoities tbat he was competent in his craft and inless he sub mitted as a pmatter of counse to their supervision the legislature had undertalken not to let that in dispensable task go wholly unattelpted of distributing the variouls fngtions of socety by the rule of capty of compelling every nman to do his duty in an honest following of his proper cxllin securing to hime that he in his turn should not be injured by his neighbours misdoingsthe growth of this syst was a very gradl one and the evolution of the guild into the mistery was the work of centuries the earliest

without profound significance that the central place of meeting of the citizens of london is still called the guiildhallciowtini op tb mistriesthe livery companies of tho city of london recognized by

that the  great companies enjoy precedence and consideration above the rest the leather sellers now dispose of a larger income than three of the great companies the salters the iron mongers and the vintners yet they stand only th in the order of precedence the reason is that nearly all the older companies representan nanlganmation in early times of several allied tradeg or c nfts previously organized in separnle gtdi ils or inisteries and that tho ordnr o pre ilenco is determined by the date o amnlligamation this is clearly shown by a docurneit prcservcd amtiong thfe records of the

shearman both of which are enume rated among the crafts in  the fullers and the shearmen says mir unwin in his learned work on  the guilds and companies of london  had each contrived in spite of strong opposition fromn the drapers and the tailors to obtain grants of separate incor poration yet they still found their wealthier members being drawn away from them by the superior attractions of the drapers company accordingl they joined hands in  and by this stroke just roanaged to secure the last place among the  great companiesof the  sur viving victualling companies enurnerated above  are

all these crafts and guilds were either of unifornm type or of homogeneous stru rc on the contrarx they were exceedingly diverse in origin con stitution and evolution and the historv of thelir vieissitudes is almost coextensive wvith the municipal histor of medieval london froudces engaging picture of the rlie of the gulds might easily convey the impression that their golden age was one of peace concord and harnnomy when every one went about his business in a spirit of faith loyalty and obedieiiee and every one submnitted cheerfully to the stern regimentation of trade and industry which the rule of tho guilds irnposed nothing could be further from the tnrth the middle ages were no period of tranquillity in england they were a period of incessant conflict and frecquent violence in london the rule of the citv and the rule of the guilds were in constazit  antagonism the glivds were just as constantly at feud with onoe another and the internal conflicts of the jguilds between mer chants and retail traders between capitalists and the smaller craftsmen between masters  and their journeymen between native andforeign competitors for the profits of the itrade of london were the cause of many ascene of violence in times when an appeal to force was a much more conunon way of settling l municipal and industrial issues than the peaceful vote of an orderly and constituted assembly or even the tumultuary acclairn of a fortuitou concourse of citizensteie victallers and tr trade craptsin the work already quoted ir unwinthe first io vears of the reign of richard ii were the most eventft lo yeaxs in the history of london not excepting even the first  years of richard i or the last   of henry uil revolution waas twice followed by counterrevolution and then after a lengthened period of unrest the constitution of the city settled down in whit proved to be its final shape but the records of this time are a labyrinth to which there is no single clue the struggle in london cannot be interpreted simply as the working out of an issue in nmicipal cdevelopment intermingied with the crisis in civic affairs there was a still mmre important national crisis and the national crisis itself nre sented no simple political issue the ordinarv landmarks of constitutional conflict had been for the moment swept away by a tumultuous flood of social and economic discontent which had long been angrily chafing the restraining banks of custom and tradition and behind all lay the brooding spirit of religious reformation which though it had taken logical shape in the minds of but a few had weakened the allegiance of many and loosened th hold of authority on allho interest of this period for our purpose turns upon the feud above mentioned between tho importers and the exportersthat is to quote mr unwin again  between the dealers in food and heavy produce who wished to control the citys supply and were specially hostile to aliens and tihe manufacturing ex porters who wished to keep down the pnce of food and were therefore in favour of free trade in imports that is the main issue perhaps but it was complicated by many crosscurrents and countercurrents such as to follow mr lunwin again the cleavage between the govern ing oligarchy and the general mass of the citizens the bitter rivalry between native and foreign merchants the conflict between those who had a large national interest in imanufacture and those who had a smaall private interest end lastly the widening breach in a number of trades between the maeter eraftsmen and the journeymren who were now excluded from the benefits of the craft organization and were bent on forming fraternities of their ownthese were the main factors of turbulence and discord which distracted london itself durinmg this period and they were intensified by the equally distracted condition of the country at large which culnfinated in the peasants lrevolt of lsiof the actual confiiet in londlon during the crisis of the peasants revolt a vivid nartative is givon in mr  i revelyans admirable survey of  england in the time of wychiffe it was there ho tells us  that for four days a dnrma was played outl second to none in tho history of england for appalling situa tions horrible possibilities and momorablo actions for our purpose it must suffice tosay in a very few words that the central feud between the vietuallers and the trade crafts was carried on for many years with many vicissi tudes and varying fortunles under the leader ship on the one hanl of john of northamnpton who represented the freetraders and on the other of nicholas brembre who represented the victuallerstwo of the most memorable names in the civic history of medieval londontehi peasaus revoltthe relation of the peasants revolt to the civic conflict is at first sight perplexing seeing that it was by the hand of walworth another citizen of high renown that nvat tylerthe leader of the revolt xvas stricken dowvn at smithfield and that walwortlh as a fishmongerwas one of the leaders of the party of the victuallers with whom the peasant insurgents were undoubtedly in league but though walworth may have been no party to it it is certain that the admission of the insurgents to the city over the bridge from southwark and through the gate at aldgate was the work of members of the victuallers party to whom the custody of those stations had been entrusted antd who deliberately betrayed their trust for their own purposes the action of the insurgents when admittedtee vintners coipanyearly settlement in thfvintry wardthe vintners company now stands eleventh in the hierarchy of the great companiesand its earliest charter as an incorporated mistery appears to date from  but of course foreign wines were imported into london from very early times and there were several guilds concerned with the trade in wine long before the incorporation of the vintners in  in fact a whole district of the city bordering on the river was known as the vintryit is still an aldermanic wvard and the hall of the vintners is still situated in it as it was from the first because the vintners there had their wharves and their warehouses while the cooks who sold food and the taverners who sold wine congre gated in the same region for convenience of retail supply in  a writ was issued by edward i making better provision in

penetrating insight and his rare powers of presentation might almost be termed the carlyle of the th centurythe grocews cowpatnydescent from fraternityof st anthonyfrom this brief sketch of the medieval misteries we turn to an equally brief survey of the history of such of their surviving lineal descendants amnong the livery companies as were in former times concerned with the supply of food of these the first in order of precedenceis the grocers company which stands second onily to the mercers in the hierarchy of the great companies there was a guild of pepperersas early as  and its importance is attested by the fact that as early as  one of its members andrew bokerel by name was mayorof london for seven years in succession and  that before  when the grocers as such first made their appearance by that name eight other pepperers had held the office of mayor it is a plausible conjecture that bokerel was a scion of the boccherolli fanily of pisafor italian traders and financiers were men of mark in london in those daysand it is certain that his residence gave its name to tlle street still called i bucklersbtry is it fanciful to conjecture that i the name  italian warehouseman which until quite recently was appropriated bv many retailgrocers as a more dignified appellation may be a survival fromn the days of bokerel  be this i eas it may the pepperers were associated withi certain other gualds in the control of the kings beam whereby heavy imnported merchandise was weighed by what wvas then knowvn as pcsoj grosso and is now known as avpoirdupois wyeight and it is probable that this is the origin of the term  grocer for as early as  complaint was made in parliament that merchants called grocers engrossed all manner of vendible goods and  those who have merchandise raise the price suddenly by a covin called a fraternity and by counsel and assent keep the goods for sale till they are dearerthis conplaint wass mnade just  years after the fraternity which was the real parent of the grocers company was founded this fraternity was an amalgamation of the pepperers of sopers lane canvassers of the ropery andpipicers of the ward of cheap its patron saint was st anthony not of padua i but of coma a saint whose intercession was held to be specially efficacious in certain forms of disease very incidentzal to medieval habits one of which was long lnown as  st anthonvs fire st anthonys patronage was therefore peculiarly appropriato to a fraternity whose secular occupation included the import of drugs until in coturse of time it gave birth to the apothecaries company which was separately incorporated in  its members woer to contribute to the common fund to wear a livery and to submit disputes to the arbitration of wardens they were to maintain a priest and to attend one anothers funerals members faliing into poverty were to be assisted out of the comnmon funds and on st anthonys day they were to attend mass at st anthonys monastery and to dine together afterwardsthe early history of the fraternity of st anthony is obscure but bv  it had beeomo the grocers company thouh still lacoeng incorporation by clhater and was strong enough to take a leading part in the great feud between the victuallers and the trade crafts already describod nicholas brembre was a grocer so also was j ohn philipot another historic name in those dayscamuoiq wrrh food a dnristhrie company obtained its first charter in  and this was also the date of the com pleton of its first hall the company having acquired for the purpose the property of lord fitzwalter the hereditary standardbearer of the city situated to the north of the poultry between old jewry and princesstreet thishall was destroyed in the great fire wlich i greatly crippled the companys resources the hall was rebuilt with great difficulty and has since boen twice reconstructxedat first the company seems to have contolled the imnport of nearly all comnmodities except perhaps wsines for it long held a monopoly of alum and we have seen that canvassers or dealers in canvas were origially included in the fraternity by letters patent of  it wvas speeially charged with the sale of all kindls of spices drugs medicines oils ointments plaister confectionery syrups and waters whble its right of search and of weighing gavc it a wide monopoly which survired until the close of the th century spices and condi ments of all hinds were of universal constuso tion in the miiddle ages being largely used for the flavouring of their none too palatable food and even of their clrincs chaucer speaks of a saunce poynaunt and sharp and the alewife in piers plowman  says i have pepper and peony seed and a pound of garlick a farthingworth of fennel seed for fasting days among

raisins broken sugar and  messes of wafers withl the trale in these and other commoodities the grocers company have now nothing to do but in the true spir it of their founders they continue to discharge on a generous sale the abiding funetions of charity benevolence and public servicelatz hrstonof the later history of the company we have no space to speak at length it must suffice to say that in the list of its masters are to be found the names of two kings of england cnarles ii and willian iii that the bank of england was founded on its premises in  its first ciovernor being sir john houblon a member of the company that for  years the business of tho bank was conducted thore tmtil in  it purchased and converted to its uses the premises still occupied by it in threadneedlestreetso called we may note in passing because since  it lad been the home of what is now the merchant taylors com panyformerly the property and residence of sir john houblon that in the list of its honorary pmembers are to be found the names of sir philip sidney general monk whose policy at the iuestoration was warmly supported by thecompany wvilliam pitt george canning sir robert peel and many other men of light and leading that the grammar school at oundlle was founded by a grocer sir william laxton in  and is still maintained by the company in a spirit at once generous and enlightened and that as hazlitt says in his work on the livery companies  the later history of the grocers constitutes a narrative of which they may be justly proud since in nearly all the charitable or benevolent foundations entrusted to their management their corporate estate has been largely expended from year to year in an everincreasing ratio in en larging the original bequests or in adapting them to modern demands and views finally wo have to amknowledge that for many of the details given above we are indebted to a memoranxdum on the history of the company compiled by mr r v somers smith the present clerk of the companyfismiongers cpanypromint role in londonhistorythe neit great victualling company in ordcr of precedence is the fishmongers which stands fourth among the great companies in early times when the consumption of fish and fish alone was obligatory on all fast days fish either fresh or salted constituted a staple of prime importance in the victualling economy of the people the trade in fish was also one which was held to require special regulation partly owing to the perishable nature of the commodity and partly to the ease with which in default of such regulation independent or unrlicensed traders could bring their fish by water to market hence from the very first fishmongers were bound together by an excep tionally strong sense of corporate selfinter and from very early times they maintained a close monopoly through their jealously guarded h iallmote indeed to trace the early history of the fish trade in london would be to write no small portion of the municipal and social history of london down to the days of the misteries and of the great feud of the th century between thevictuallers and their rivals in which the fishmongers took so prominent and active a part this cannot be done herethe fishmongers appear as ant organized tradethough not apparently as a fratemity with anv religious or charitable complexion as early as  when they were amereed for carrying on their trade without a licence the customnary rights thus recognized as long existing were sucessively conirmed in  in  and in  until in  ledward iii recogntized by letters patent their rights of supervision and restra int as having existed from time imnmemorial even in  the year of edward is return from his victory over the scots the fishmongers were so wealth that their pageant to celebrate the occasion was the most magnificeut of all  in a solemn procession says stow  they passed through the city havming as amongst other pageants and shows four sturgeons gilt carried on four horses then four salnons of silver on four horses and after that six and forty armed knights riding on horses made like luces of the sea and then one represenxting st magnus because it was st magaus
