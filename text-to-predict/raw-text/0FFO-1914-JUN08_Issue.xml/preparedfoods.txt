prepared foods  oh infants children and invalidsstrictly speaking there is but ono suitrble and nattural food for the infantviz its mothers own milkand there is no sulbstitute howover slilfully it may be compounded which can replace such milk with equal cffcct so that when we undertake to treat of infants food other than humnan milk we can only show in how far it has beon possible for modern science and skill to replace what nature has herself provided for the babys sustenance wvhen the mother is unable to feed her child from the breast and it becomes necessary to bring the infant up  by hand as it is termed we naturally seek for the milk of some suitable domestic animal and of all the varieties of milk available for this purposethat of the goat the ass the mare and the liketho milk of the cow holds the proeminence chiefly beceuse it is evervwhere procurable and abundant it must however be remembered that cn s milk is a different product from human milk and tbough it contains all the elemnents present therein they are not in a state readily assimil able by the infaots stomach the calf is much more liberally provided with stomachs than tho human subject and it can break up and digest the clotted curd of the rich milk of the cow which the baby is unable to do if it re ceives the milk in an undiluted form for this reason it is usual to add water to the cows milk before it is administered to the infanttea lmnc o m cowin the choice of cows milk it is well not to insist uipon having the milk of a single cow since the rmixed milk of a herd is more uniform in composition and the quality should be the best and purest that can be obtained it should be dispatched from the dairy in a sealed glass vessel to avoid possible contamina tion in the course of delivery and it should be free from all kinds of preservatives it is not we think advisable that the milk should be sterilized or pasteurizedthat is sub mitted to a preliminary heating process at a regulated temperature to destroy disease germsfor in order to carry out the above treat ment it is impossible to avoid a certain amount of delay in sending off the milk and as all milk should be boiled before the child is fed the same results are really attained at home it must be remembered that no fluid is more readily impregnated with germs likely to be floating in the air than milk is and therefore the supply must be kept carefully secure from contact with the atmosphere and it should stand in a cool place in very hot weather in order to run no risks the milk should be scalded as soon as it reaches the house it is well also to bear in mind the fact that the lactose or milk sugar which imparts the sweet ness to milk very speedily begins to undergo a chemical change and becomes gradually con verted into lactic acid the presence of which renders the milk sourprxparid mkit is probably on this account that so many descriptions of special milk food are placed on the market and have been used with con siderable success among these a prominent position should be assigned to glaxo which is a desiocated rnilk of great purity prepared in new zealand it is claimed for this product that in tho infants stomach the proteids take the forn of an easilydigested flaky curd and that glaxo contains in au cases the same pereentago of fat this preparation is in fact the dried essence of the whole milk suitably modified so that wrhen reconstituted by the addition of pure water it provides a real substitute for human milk the only additions to the natural milk of the cow are cream and milk sugar and its success depends upon its absolute purity freedom from contamination at all stages of its preparation and the entire absence of starch flour or cane sugar it is asserted that fresh glaxo should be used for each feed and that it is advisable to mix tho requisite number of spoonfuls into a stiff paste with a little boiling water and then to add the proper amount of boiling water stirring all tho timethe allenburys milk foods are prepared also from cows milk from which the excess oficasein has been removed and tho deficiencies of fat and sugar as compared with breastmilkl havo been mado good bv admixturo with eream and milk sugar it is pointed out that care is talken to prevent any acidity and the milk thus treated is ovaporated to dryness and put ud in hermetically sealed tins the no

foodsin severe illnesses in prolonged con valescences or when the digestive functions are much impaired as in cases of gastric ulcer or acute cardiac diseasc recourse is had to predigested or partially digested foods known as peptone preparations peptones are sub stances which represent proteids after the action on the latter of gastric or intestinal digestive juices and aro of considerable value where the powers of digestion are weakened these can be and are prepared artificiallv and both meat and milk are obtainable inthese teorms it is believed that they possess the valuable property of promoting appetite which is often failing after long indisposition milk can be peptonized at home with liquor pancreaticus or it may be bought condensed and peptonized in tins and a powder that is made from the proteids of milk peptonized is also available peptonized milk is taken alone as a food or is used in making gruels the casein of  lkephir a kind of sour milk re sembling the  koumiss  of european russia but made from the milk of the cow inlstead of that of the mare is partially predigested many meat extracts are peptonized but the disadvantage of those that are liquid is that they contain much water whiclh reduces their food value beef powders either completely or partially predigested can be added to fluid or semifluid foodsmalt extractmialt extracts made from an infusion of malted barley aro sometimes ordered for the patient as an extra source of carbohydrate is they contain this substance in the partially predigested form of maltose and the diastasepresent in them helps the digestion of other mtarch foods it may be remarked however fhat honey is preferable for the former purposeas from  to  per cent of the sugar therein is predigested it is found to be extremely useful in fever cases malt extracts are as we have seen mixed with milk to enrich and flavour it or they may be prescribed as a medicine alcohol up to  per cent is present in many of the fluid preparations but more frequently they are put up with ernulsions of codliver oil or olive oil or thev are mixed with marrow yolk of egg or devonshire cream by this means their foodvalue is much increased of the malted foods proper bread made from whole meal is the most popular the starch in it is predigested so that it is useful in some cases of dyspepsia malted farinaceous foods are occasionally given during convalescence
