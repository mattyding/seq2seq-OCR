transport of food how europe met a crisis an economac romance the scramble for marketsby edwni a prantin the multiplicity of facts and factors which bear upon the feeding of nations the question of transport is tho predominant partneragricuilturists may grow their harvests or their crops scientists may improve qualitics and enhance quantities lands across the seas as well as rural districts at home mnay produce everincreasing supplies yet unless what is grown can be brought readily speedily and at not too great a cost to urban populations growing nothing for themselves the existing social industrial and economic order of things could exist no longerearly conwoxsin the days before steamships before rail ways and before good roads the average english household had to depend mainly on its own exertions for the supply of food as woll as of other domestic requirements and the approach especially of winterwhen such apologies of roads as then existed would be passable alone for pedestrians and herses had to be prepared for by the laying in of stores of flourground at the village mill from wheat of the familys own growing of such fruit and vegetables as the neighbour hood could produce and of salted meat from the beast that each household or each little group of households would have purchased for the purpose at the autumn fair the com modities in the way of food supplies for which these winterbesieged residents mainly de pended on the outside world were salt and spices otherwise they were their own growers their own butchers their own bakers and their own brewersthe advent of ralwayswith the industrial revolution of the second half of the th century caane an tnprocedented growth of urban comminities now more than ever dependent on food supplies vvhich they had not the means the time or the opportunity to produce for themsclves and the possi bilities opened out to agriculture as a business becametogether with theo need for still further development of transport faeilitiesgreater than everin tho matter of trarsport the introduction of railways wont far towards mecting the clifliculties wlhhich had arisen they widened the i radius from whieh the urban food supplies could come this was dono not alone through the better transport naturally offered by a railway system but through also ithe adoption of the  tapering  principlein the tixing of railway rates tho amount thereof dimiinishing per ton in proportion s the length of haul increased the so called  equal distance rates  would have pre vented the distant producer from competing with the producer situated near a leading centre of consumption the near producer would have retained his  geographical ad vantage but the tovnspeople would havo paid moro for their food because of the absence of competition the distant producer it is true has to pay for a much longer haul but as against this he may have compensating ad vantages in the way of lower rent rates and taxes better soil an earlior season and cheaper labour while ho may also be in a position to send off his consignments in such bulk as will enable him to take advantage of the lowest available scales of transport rates tho balance of advantages as between near and distant pro ducers is thus more or less preserved on tho leading markets and althoughi tho former may disapprove of the greater competition he must necessarily meet the general position has con ferred a great boon alike on tuhe general body of producers on consumers and also on the country since it has helped to spread out the area of cultivation and to check that concentra tion of the productive area within a limited radius of urban populations which otherwise wvould have been unavoidableiocean transportsrevolutionary changesmeanwhile the equally enormous advance in sea transport through the introduction of steamships was leading to some further and no less revolutionary changes in the food supply conditions alike of the united kingdom and of europe in general thlere was no longer simply the competition of shortdistance and longdis tance producers in the same country there came the competition also of new countries havmig virgin soils and vastly greater powers of production at comparatively small cost and enabled thanks to the steamship practically to eliminate the distance wlhich separates them from the teeming populations of the old worildcomparisons are frequently made between the respective costs of rail transport and sea trans port but the fact should bo borne in mind that transport on an ocean highway free to ail comers and requiring orly a vessel and a crew to work itwith theaddition of coal in the case of a steamshipmust needs be cheaper than transport by rail involving in this countrv at least heavy expenditure on parliamentary proceedings tiho purchase of land the laying of a separate track the provision of stations goods sheds signalling arrangements man tenance and operating expenses and on the payment of rates and taxes in respect not only to railway property but to tho traffic carried through each and every rating area even althlough it may only cross a romote corner thereof it may thus readily happen that the freight per ton on commodities in huge con signments carried  or more miles by sea will be less than the charges per ton on tho samo commodities in small consignments carried for even  miles by railocear frfigwzmfollowing on the importation of wheat in steadilyincreasing quantities from these newer lands across the seas came the agricultural crisis which from the s onwards was to affect more or less acutely all tho courtries of etiropecheap and rapid ocean transport had in fact begun to change the economic conditions of the world in the newer countries it opened out enormous possibilities of development in europe it transformed national markets into an international market in the early eighties the detail as to whether tho home harvest had been a good one or a bad one had little or no effect on market prices and was a matter of practically no concern for the consumer how ever gravely it might affect the british farmereconomic conditions changed still further when the advancement in the art of navigation was supplemented by the application to theoceangoing steamship of that principle of refrigeration which allowed in turn of perish able products

of organizationcontinental countries wero affected no less than the united kingdom by the rovolutionary changes brought about by the choap and efficient transport of food supplies and these countries proceeded to reorganize more or less their own agricultural industries on lines which in tiurn were to react mnateriallv upon ourselves from the point of view alike of consumers and producorstho samo causes were in fact operating there as here improved land transport had meant for them no less than for ourselves thie growth of urban industries an influx of population into the towtls the discourage ment of home agriculture and in the case of central rurope generally a greater and still i increasing dependence on irnported foodsupplies improved sea transport had not only brought keener competition from over seas lands but was offering such greater encouragement for emigration to those lands that somo of the smaller countries in europe were threatened with depopullation while from germany  eoigrants were leaving each yearpnorosed rmnsenntsamong the remedies adopted for meeting the crisis thus brought about were i the resort to schemes of homne colonization for the settlement of more people on the land  the establishment of systems of rural crecit open to pcasants who could offer no guarantce for loans but that of good character   the development of rural education on essentially practical lines the encouragement of agricultural researchl in regard to production and kindred questions and  the organization generally of agtricul tural industrieswhether through cooperative effort state aid or business enterprisein such a wav as to overcome the disadvantages which had to he faced and give an assurance of higher prosperity to the cotuntries concernedi among other results of the courso thus adopted by continental countries in seeking to adapt themselves to the altered economic conditions was an increased production of food supplies i other than the wheat or the meat in regard to which the position of the amorican continent and australasia was unchallengeable and what further happened was that some of these continental countries developed their agricul tural enterprises with the express idea of supplv ing markets elsewhere and notably our ownwhilo others sought to find an outlet in other  lands for their surplus production southern countries again had the special advantage of being able to send their early vegetables and fruit to northern countries in advance of the production by tho latter of their own supplieseconomy d hndljj melrccaxdiseto the attainment of these ends however it was necessary that organization for produc tion on the best scientific andi most economical lines should be followed by orgarization for a no less scientific and economical system of transport and the fundamental basis of such svstem lay in the fact that the railwav rates for wagonload lots or their equivalent are lower per ton than those charged also per ton for small consiglunents involving more trouble in handling less satisfactory loading and a higher standard of working expenses generallyin manv instances shrewd and farseeing traders etablished themselves in producing  countries in order to collect supplies gradethem pack them afresh and then despatchthem not only in wagonload but even in trainload lots to the particular destinations where thoy woould have the bost chance of meet ing with a ready and successful sale in other instances this procedtire has been adopted by societies forned by the producers themsolves but from tho point of view of econoinical trans port the only material factor is the provision of the big loadslowsa rates for big loadsmuch criticism has been directed against thebritish railway compaiies on the ground that they carry imported foreign produce at lower rates than home produce the companies reply that what they do is to carry big consign ments at lower rates per ton than small ones those lower rates they explain apply to con signments of a specified quantity whiie no dis tinction is or under the english law can be drawn between british or foreign produce offered to them under  the same or similar conditions  as regards bulk packing and so onthe principle of charging a lower rate per ton for big loads is the one universally adopted and is one also that has had a great influence on encouraging organized effort in food pro duction and food distributionin frarce for instance the rates per ton for fruit other than grapes sent on the parislyorw and yediterranean railway from hyhrto paris a distance of  kilometres are for consignments of kg nearly lcwt f c for wagonloads of kg five tons f c and for consignments exceed ing kg f c here the difference between the rate for lcowt and that for a con signment exceeding five tons is over s per ton thlen in the united states the railway rate for apples sent from springfield mo to chicago is  for  less than carload  lots and  for  carload  lots  saving in the latter case of  a carload of potatoes from crowley la to st louis costs  as against  for small consignments though this is spoken of as  an extreme caseone sees from such examples as these the enormous advantage that organization in the transport of food supplies must have over the efforts of individual producersand more especiallv those of the smaller typein sending each his own particular consignnment to some more or less distant marketa woiipmovijzothe conditions here described are but typical of what is going on today in all parts of the civilized globeno fewer than  different governments have given in their adhesion to the international institute of agriculture established in rome in  under an international treaty  to study questions concerning agricultural cooperation insurance and credit among other matters and most if not all of these  countries are making more or less successful efforts to reorganize or to develop their agriculture along lines which should result alike in increased pro duction and in a still better distribution of the worlds food supplies
