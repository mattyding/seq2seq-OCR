railway rates details of tue cost of distribution effect on seuing prices ncreases mi freightsthe actual effect of railway rates on the cost of foodstuffs was one of the subjects dealt with by the food investigation commiwssion appointed by the state of new york to inquire into the causes which had led to the raising of food prices as affecting the city of new york and it was in turn relegated by the com mission to a special committee which carried out a close if not an exhaustive inquiry and presented their report in  the report shows in effect  how little importance the freight rate is as a part of the ultimate cost of foodstuffs and  what a small part of the ultimate price of food products represents the cost of transportation the committee further says this general review of the history of foodproduct rates to four of the principal centres in the state seems to indicate conclusively that the increase in the price of food during the past  years has not been in any way attributable to transport chargesin the case of great britain we shall take the railway rates for transport of food products m our own country and see what effect theysight could or should have on the retail prices paid by the consumer here reducing the rates per ton or otherwise to such unit as will appeal to the average householder and adding such infonmation as wiu allow of a better judgment being arrived at ooncerning the proportions of the traffic in the particular commodities and the nature of the services rendered in re turn for the charges mademinin addition to being one of the most important items in the dietary of our urban popula tions milk is one of those which cau in a special degree for  collection from a wide productive area  quick transit to the consuming centres and  an essentiauy reasonablo scale oi rail chargesas to the first of these conditions there is a greater guarantee of sufficiency in quantity and of production under more wholesome conditions than was the case in prerailway days and is still the case in certain foreign cities where in order to save cost of transport covs are kept in sheds in the citiestoday thanks to the transport facilities afforded the bulk of the milk supply for london comaes from much lreater distances a good deal comes  miles milk having been brought to paddington from st erth cornwall  miles distant and to euston from the north of ireland on the great western system on which the largest quantities are carried most of the supplies brought to london are from places within a distance of about  miles eggington junction a centre point for the north stafford shire district is  miles from euston a large proportion of the milk brought to london by the great easter prailway originates within a distance of  milesrats by ramthe rates charged for the transport of milk by rail vary slightly on different lines or according to local conditions but spealing generally they may be illustrated by the following examplesgreat

any appreciable eftect on selling prices it has indeed been a grievance with certain of the traders that the increases cannot be passed on to the consumer because they are so small thus the cost of

by the transportation committee of the new york state food investigation commission con cerning the conditions there as recorded at the outset of this article  the transportation cost the committee further declared  is practically negligible in comparison to the cost added after the articles have reached their terminals  and not only is this found to be equally the case here but those who are seek ing to reduce seling prices would do weu to study the problem of these added costs and see in what waywhether by better methods of marketing reduction in the number of middle men or otherwiseit may be possible to bring them dowa to such a point sa will benefit the consunmers without involving prejudice to the producer
