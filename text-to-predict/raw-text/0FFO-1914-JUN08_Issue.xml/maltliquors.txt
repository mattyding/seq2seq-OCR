malt liquoes the bbitish brewing industry variety op beer produced eise of bottling tradeexcept in so far as rnachmery large scalo operations and chemical control have made the produce of any one brewery more uniform than formerly the manufacture of malt liquors has undergone no essential change since the use of hops became genoral some three centuries ago the success of tho brewing industry is dependent on access to a suitable water supply tho deep well water of burton is pre� eminent for the production of pale ales whilst dublin stout and london mild ales owe much of their character to the excellent water avail� able to brewers in those cities barley barley for malting purposes should be matare and m an average year only the best of the homegrown crop can be so described the types of foreign barley most in use have other valuable properties besides that of ripeness  for example thoy possess especially tough skins which resist disintegration between the rolls used for crushing the malt in tlio brewery and pro� mote drainage in the brewers mash tun on the other hand light foreign barleys when malted aro somewhat lacking in flavour it is such considerations as tliese rather than any question of price that determine the pro� portions of british and foreign grain used formerly the eliief source of these husky foreign barleys was california though asia minor and more recently north africa have supplied us with notable amounts for many years but the amount of californian barley available has sharply diminished of late this is counterbalanced by the appearance of india as a producer of malting barlev and the rapid improvement in quality of the shipments is not less remarkable than the increased tonnage brewers make perhaps half their own malt the rest bemg produced by maltsters for side malting� the first step in malting is to steep the barley in water for about tliree days durine which time it absorbs nearly enough moisture to carry it through its short life on the malting floor the steeped barley is sdread to a depth of a few inches on a tiled floor in a building that may contain many such floorslong narrow rooms here it is allowed to grow for  or  days and is moved from time to time on to a fresh section of floor in such a way that it gets uniformly aerated the object of malting is as follows the principal material of barley as of all cereals is starch which is insoluble and useless as such either to the brewer or to the embryo plant but when live seeds are supplied with moisture at not too low a temperature certain of their cells secrete unorganized ferments or enzymes which enable the embrvo to draw on the re� serve material stored iip in the endosperm in tho normal life of a barley plant the whole of the starch of the seed is converted mto soluble substances which pass to the cells of the growing embryo where they undergo further transformations but the maltster arrests tne process as soon as the cellular structure has been sufficiently broken down by the eytase  the process of growth is arrested bv drying  tne malt on kilns at a gradually increasing i �ta�urev wl�ich  �inai� rea jjodeg f the operation extending over about tliree days when loaded to the kiln tne socalled  green  malt has a number of welldeveloped rootlets but the incipeot aerial stern of the young piant though visible through the husk is never allowed io grow out and pro� duce green leaves the drving process serves not only to arrest� the growth �f the malt but induces partial carameiization of the cell con� tents with development of the characteristic malt flavour and yields a product so free from moisture that it will keep unchanged in good bms for a year or more as malting is practically suspended during tho three hottest months stocks of malt are lowest about michaelmas when there is pro� bably not much more than three months supply barley stocks are highest when malt stocks are lowest but are not whollv dependent on the british cereal year preliminary brewing operations in the brewery malt is crushed between rolls and mashed with water at a tempera tine in tho neighbourhood of l�odeg f the diastase now converts the whole of the starch into maltose and dextrin and the relative pro� portions in which these two substances are termed depends partly on tho temperature at which the malt was cured on the kiln and partly on the exact temperature emploved in mashing it tho clear wort is drawn off through the perforated false bottom of tho tun and the grains are deprived of the lare amount of valuable extract they would other� wise retain by sparging or spraying hot water on top of the goods whilst con� tinually running off weaker and weaker wort up to this stage the brew nig process is identical with that followed in producing malt extract and some of the best infant s foods wliich are substantially brewers wort concentrated to a syrup or reduced to a dry powder the wort and spargings are next boiled with hops in tho copper thereby acquiring a bitter flavour and preservative properties trom the hops and being at the same time concentrated by evaporation the boiled wort is separated from tho hops in another vessel with perforated false bottom and is then aerated and partially cooled by exposure in a larce shallow vessel the final cooling to about bodeg i� is rapidly effected b v passing over a

aided by certain other organisms and the process is assisted by the addition of fresli hops the enzymes of which enable the yeast to ferment a portion of the otherwise unfermentable substances in the

most famous breweries do not engage in it directly on the other hand in many breweries the most in� teresting department to a visitor ia the bottling store the trade has led to the introduction of new types of beer mostly of relatively low alco� holic strength and it is difficult to tell whether the convenience of the package or the modified character of the beverage has contributed most to the popularity of bottled beer the brewer who sells in bottle gets a higher price for his beer but the cost of bottling is very great and has led to the introduction of the many labour saving machines that make the bottling store the most vivid remembrance of the casual visitor to a brewery in describing the brewing process no mention was made of materials other than malt hope water and a little sugar for priming before  duty was paid on malt and for the protec� tion of the revenue brewers were forbidden to use any materials other than hops and dutypaid malt long before that date it was known that the diastase of a small quantity of malt was capable of converting the starch of a much larger quantity of unmalted grain and it was argued that the old tax hindered the economic development of the brewing industry for these and other reasons mr gladstone trans� ferred the tax from malt to beer or rather to the wort gauged immediately before fermenta� tion and permitted brewers to prepare then wort from any wholesome materials provided they kept a register of these materials and the materials themselves open to tho inspection of the excise the readjustment of the mode of taxation was followed by experiments in the use of large proportions of raw grain but these were less successful than in the distilling industry the flavour of the resulting beer suffered and breweries that led the way with raw grain found their trade leaking to then more conservative rivals a proportion of un� malted grain can bo used with advantage the most popular material being flaked maize that is to say maize tjiat has been degerminated and then by a process of torrification has had its starch rendered amenable to diastase use of scgars more important results followed the introduc� tion of sugars as raw materials of the industry cane sugar is employed to some ex tent in brewing but a beverage brewed wholly from cane sugar would scarcely bo recognizable as beer since it would lack tho body which tho unfermentable dextrin of malt wort confers other socalled sugars manufactured from starch resemble the solids of malt wort more closelv sinco they are really mixtures of sugar and dextrin the proportions of which can be controlled to suit the requirements of tho brewer the quantities of all these raw materials used in the united kingdom in  woremalt  tons unmalted cereals  tons  and sugar  tons these figures are based on�an official return and sufficiently answer the charge so often heard that beer is no longer brewed from malt and hops but from  chemicals no otiier materials aro used except  tons of hops and  tons of hop substitutes of which a portion at least is manufactured from hops types of beer the variety of malt liquors is very great even an irish brewery brewing

most unportant type of beer it may be stronger or weaker than that of which the analysis is given below competition among brewers takino� the form of offering their customers the strongest ale that current prices of raw materials and other variable conditions such as taxation permit for the retail price of beer unlike that of most commodities is practically fixed a beer made from a wort with a
