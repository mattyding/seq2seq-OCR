dairy products butter milk and cheese inadequacy of local sltppliesthe annual imports of milk products and eggs exceed in value s per head of popula tionthat is to say they cost more than  their home production has very substantially increased in the past s years but not nearly so rapidly as the demands of a growing and better fed populationof this large figure more than halftiz was paid for imported butter in  and even this was less by  than in  when exceptionally high prices pre vailed the continent of europe sends more than threequarters of the imported supplies and denmark cwt and

imports of canadian cheese have been persistently decreasing for several years past but we stil pay this dominion more than au other cheese exporters put together the prohibition of chemical preservatives in fresh mili has reduced the never large imports of it to a negligible quantity but on the other hand foreign supplies of condensed ipilk cost it is a demonstrable fact that the average milk yield of cows can be iaworeased by kenping records of the yields of individual animals and by breeding only from the deeper milkers a ntmber of dairyfarmers have been able to raise the average yield of their herds some  per cent above that of ordinary herds this system has recently been afforded financial encouragement by the development com missioners and promises to be greatly extended unfortunately the past two years have shown a decline in the numbers of cattle buit this is only temporary and a growing appre ciation of the economic waste of slaughtering calves and the stimulus of high prices for adult stock promise a speedy recovery in numbersthe average dairy farmer who works alone finds that unless he can produce butter or cheese of exceptionauy fine quality the competition of imported produce is too much for him while the sale of milk involves a minimum of trouble and risk and brings inquickreturns it is only when he builds a cooperative cheese or butter factory guaranteeing a minimum supply of milk that he is able to derive any considerable profit on these productscoorenatevn daay farxmsit is essentially by a thorough and farreach ing organization on cooperative lines that denmark has built up her huge and profitable export trade and the dairying industry in ireland and in districts in great britain has been stimulated modernized and made more profit able by similar methods milk is the most deli cate and perishable food in common consump tion and its distribution or conversion calls for scientific resource and heavy outlay if waste is to be avoided and strict hygiene to be respectedthere is naturally wide diversity in the dairying methods of various districts but the cooperative principle has proved adaptable to each special requirement some cooperative societies deal with whole milk only but have provided themselves with apparatus for cleans inig and cooling the milk as received from the uembers others exist primarily to deal with surplus rnilk in the summer which in un organized districts is usually difficult to dis pose of at a profit the societies convert it into cheese and other products in at least one buttermakinig district a societv exists to receive its members butter and blend itspecial treatsmrm of mmlmuch labour and ingenuity have been devoted to the preservation of mnilk medical opiinion has long condemned the use of chemical preservatives in milk and they are now pro hibited under an ordor of the local govern ment board apart from coolig or actual refrigeration the only practicable methods of preservation are by exposing the milk to heat ierfect sterilization is effected by heating mnilk at deg f for  minutes on three or four suceessive days mairntaining it between each boiling at about odeg f to permit spores to germinate in sealed bottles milk so treated keeps indefinitely but the milk sugar is burnt or caramelized the soluble albtimens coagulated and the natural ferments destroyed rendering it less digestiblethese disadvdntages are avoided by pasteuri ation in which much lower tempera tures are used rtne tubercle bacilli can be killed in  minutes at deg f or in one minute at deg f whereas heating for  minutes at deg f does not change the casein or albumen or injure the enzymes which assist digestion probablv about deg f is the ideal temperature for pasteurization and it need not last longer than a quarter of an hour immediately aftervards the milk is cooled to about deg fcohndensed mrwzin the manufacture of condensed milk a high temperature is employed to evaporate enough of the water content to reduce the bulk on the milk to about onethird as a rule beet sugar is added beforehand so as to form about  per cent of the condensed milk but unsweetened nmilk is also conridmsed and hams the advantage of being sterile whereas the sweetened kiinds generally contain some mi roorganisms which howeverrarely multiply either in the unopened or opened tins until water hss

separated miilk between the two tlhere may be a differ once of as much as  times the amnount of fat present the fat in machineskdmmed milk sometimes proving on analysis to be no more than a per cent this poverty in fat and the excess of sugar casein and mineral matter render condensed skimmed milk entirely unsuitable as a food for infants and its use is a direct cause of rickets and other constitutional disordersevery tin of such milks is required by law to bear a label admitting that it has been skimmed but it is doubtful if many mothers of the poorer classes are aware of its unsuitability or even of its relative dearnesson the other hand condensed whole milk is a valuable food to which exception cannot be taken and where the supply of fresh milk is unreliable particularly on account of seasonal difficulties as in the hot summer of  it is the most satisfactory substitute its popu larity is well shown by the fact that its imports have doubled in the past  years while

fattv compounds and sometimes vegetable moulds are developed if eaten at a younger stage cheese is not only softer in texture but is less liable to cause indigestion the larger quantity of water in soft or unpressed cheese dilutes the nitrogenous matter and makes it easier to digest than pressed cheese especially if it is eaten when only a few days old and not ripenedchoice cheeses like the camembert were long supposed to be a monopoly of the districts where they originated but they can be produced as well in britain as elsewhere pro vided that a starter is employed consisting in the case of camembert of a iittle curd from under the crust of a fine qualitv cheese a special mould fungus penicilvium camemberti being responsible for the ripening processthe consumption of soft cheese

food of a vast part of the population in europe sia and africa from a remote period and great interest was aroused in them a few years ago by the researches of professor elie mietchnikff senility he

bulqnricus and its presence in the soured milk whiiei forms so prominent a part of the dietary of the peasants of eastern countries is believed to explain their tendency to longevity it is found in
