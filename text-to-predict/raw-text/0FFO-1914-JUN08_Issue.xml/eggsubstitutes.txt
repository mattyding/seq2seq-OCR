egg substitutes wide use it modern cookerythe value of the egg as an article of diet due to the ease with which it can be prepared for the table and the concentrated form of nourish ment thereby provided has caused manu facturers to produce different kinds of egg substitutes most of which partake but little of the character of the egg itself though they can bo used with advantage in the kitchen for many of the purposes for which the egg is employed in the average egg the mineral matter in the shell accounts for about  per cent of the weight the white for  per cent and the yolk which is the portion most needed by the cook yields  per cent the socalled egg or custard powders which are prepared to replace eggs consist for the most part of starch to which a colour intended to represent that of the yolk is imparted by admixture witihlturmeric or some other dve of vegetable origin the following table of analyses taken from food and sanita tion for november   indicates the approximate composition of some of the best known egg powders on the marketit will be seen that the last four substances on the list consist almost wholly of starch and baking powder a comparison of the above table with the actual composition of tlle volk of egg which contains in  parts water  proteids  mineral salts  fat  other non nitrogenous matters   will serve to show that the two substances have little or nothing in commonit should however be noted that these egg and custard powders have proved most useful in the kitchen and can take the place of eggs with very favourable results for many kinds of cakes and fancy dishes they may be em ployed also in the preparation of custards which are of excellent favour and are much liked with stewed fruitsthe powders are put up in packets or tins and if the directions given for their use are carefully followed no fear of failure in the results need be entertained in some ways they are reallysuperior to eggs and owing to the action of the baking powder contained in them the cakes and dishes for which they are employed are very light and easily digestible they lack however the nutritive matters of the egg and should not be given to invalids or persons in delicate healthegg powpdams made from eggsin addition to these artificial substitutes there are a certain number of substances which result from the desiccation of the yolk or the entire contents of the egg among these we may mention the socalled  condensed eggs prepared by the evaporation in vaczo of the yolk matter with or without the addition of sugar  eggo  is composed of the whole con tents of the egg dried at a low temperature and this material can at any time be admixed with water and forms a convenient way in which to store eggs for cooking purposes the powder is produced from selected eggs only at a wellappointed factory in the largest egg producing country in europenamely in central irussia it is claimed that no preservatives chemicals or colouring matter of any description are employed and the cherical analysis as supplied by the makers which is as follows shows that it is a genuine preparation from eggsthe proteins and fat present ocfur in the same physical state as in the fresh egg and in proof of this it is found that the eggo can be used for the preparation of omelettes and custard in which the full flavour of the egg is preservedthe powder packed in tins representing six  or  dried whole eggs is in large use by bakers confectioners and on steamship lines and its employment renders the risk and trouble of breaking and testing eggs unnecessary eggs put up in this wvay are much superior to the c onfectioners yolks  and much of the raw material formerly used for similar purposebwhen reproducing tho liquid egg all that is requisite is to add water in the stated propor tionsthus loz of eggo with joz of vater is equal to about three eggs of average size
