condiments pickles and sauces various aids to appetite and digestionnotwithstanding the wise old proverb which still retains all its ancient force that  hunger is the best sauce man has sought out many inventions and has flooded the worlds markets with a host of ingenious appetizers and stimaulants for the jaded palate the reproach of the french savant that england was a nation with a hundred religions but only one sauce has long since become wholly un merited even if it ever possessed a particle of truth and now almost every epicure has his own favourite sauce or condiment in the absence of wlhich even the choicest morsel is apt to lose its attractiveness it is claimed by the pur veyors of certain of the popular sauces that they are adapted for viands of all kindsand that they can be used indiscriminately with fish flesh or fowl other manufacturers prepare special qualities of sauce suitable for fish alone or for meat and game though many of the flavourings are scarcely sixch as to accord vith every dish the resident in india or in hot climates who has been accustomed to curry and other highlyseasoned foods cares little for the ordinary qualities of thick sauces largely compounded of fruits and spices and even his pickles havo to be specially prepared with flavourings of extra potencypickled vegetableswe think it can readily be proved that pickles properly so called were anterior to the modern sauce done up in bottles of peculiar and dis tinctive shapes and attractively labelled the word  pickle  is said to be derived from the dutch pekel brine the pickled vegetable as kcnown to our forefathers was a homemade delicacy and served doubtless in the first in stance to furnish them during the months when garden produce was scarce or unobtainable with something to represent green food for their daily fare every farmers wife could obtain a supply during the summer months of fresh young onions french beans cauliflower cucumber and of the vegetables and fruits employed and the bottling and preparation is not a task involving any great atnount of sldll or trouble in order to make really good pickles the vegetables should be fresh gathered thoroughly dried and not too ripe the vinegar used for preserving purposes should if possible be brewed from malted or unmalted barley and it should be well boiled before it is poured over the vegetables which are generally cut into convenientsized pieces and placed in wide mouthed jars in boiling the vinegar a small quantity of salt or sugar and some spices may be added and for many purposes a proportion of mustard is mixed along with it to prepare a hot pick le wanlnuts damasons capers and olives are frequently made into pieldes and in lieu of vinegar a solution of salt or brine is em ployed wvith good results by wvay of preserva tive ns in the case of the wellknown sauerkraut made from green cabbage finely shreddedvarietirs o saucesa sauce in the language of the cookery book may take an infinite variety of forms and is regarded as an accompaniment both for balked meats and for swveets thus game or roast fowl is always served witlh bread sauce many fish dishes must have melted butter and certain descriptions of plain puddings are almost unpalatable wvithout a wvine sauce or some kind of fruit condiment it was an oft quoted saying of the great alexis soyer that sauces are to eookery what grammar is to languane and this is certainly an apt illistra tion beeause the graimn must be adapted to suit the genius of tho language to which it relates and tho sauce takes

anchovies sardines and the like the derivation of the word sauce is somewhat obscure but it nio doubt comes froiim the latin salsa applied to salted or pickled food tho earliest sauces would thus seem to have depended largely upon salt which liad an important place in the cookery of the ancients  indeed fuller says of it nrith out wvhich condiment nothing can be whole some niutriment the use of salt has had at times very fiereo opponents and a book was written during the last century witlh the title salt the forbidden fruit or food in wlhich the author sought to prove that it was in

theyappear to be almost tasteless in its absence and even galen mentions it xvithrespect pepper is a comparatively modern invention but none the less valuable and it seems to have come into notice when trade was first opened up in india by the dutch the red pepper of cayeine wvas originally known as guinea pepperinogredients o table saucesnearly all the famous sauces in this country have certain features in common and whether described as fruity creamy black or brown itheir accepted basis is some form of vinegar as a preservative medium with spices peppers ketchup tomatoes chutney anc many kinds of fruits and vegetables these last in the true sauces have been so finely divided and comminuted that nothing remains perceptible but the delicaey of their flavour or the grateful aroma they impart to the preparation the skill of the saucemaker is thus to select suit able ingredients calculated to tickle the palate or give a zest to the meal and to serve them in an acceptable form the fruits employed must be the best of their respective kinds they must be absolutely sound and ripe and care must be taken to remove all hard and gritty substances such as the pips of oranges lemons and raisins the stringy matter of tomatoes and the hard or husky portions of certain spices much depends on the quality of the vinegar and the essential difference between the highclass sauce and its cheap rival is that for the former nothing is used but the finest malt vinegar while in the ease of the latter the cheaper qualities of acetic acid are sub stituted with disastrous effects it is claimed that not only does the wellmdde sauce stimu late the appetite but that it is also an undoubted aid to digestion owing to its beneficial action in promoting the flow of the gastric juices a good sauce should serve at the same time as a valuable tonic and thus a skilfully preparedana daamty sauce s in this sense a food as ell as a medicine in fact the best sauces not only provide a wholesome relish but they likewise possess important dietetic propertiessome faous satucescertain descriptions of sauces are so well known that their names have become household words and whether they are called after their inventors or are described by the towns they have rendered famous or depend upon the use of certain letters of the alphabet the secret of their composition has long become a matter of common  property take for instance the famous harvey sauce which iscomposed of a mixture of malt vinegar indian soy and mushroon or walnut vinegar to this must be added finely chopped anchovies a clove of garlic bruised and a seasoning of cayenne pepper these ingredients kept in an earthenware jr for a month or more and very constantly stirred will yield at the end of the time after most careful straining the sauce we need take again worcester sauce for the manufacture of which we must have bordeaux vinegar walnut ketchup essence of anchovy indian soy cayenne and garlic these essentials placed in a large bottle must be corked up and shaken many times daily for several weeks then strained and bottled for use these may be regarded as typical of the thin or black saucesthe recipes for the thick or creamy sauces now so much in evidence at the restaurant or the club have not yet become included in the ordinary cookery book and are thus to some extent trade secrets such sauces as the ok sauce or the al sauce containing a larpe arnount of fruity material are prepared in bulk in enormous quantities in wellequipped factories in the case of the creamy sauces which still retain the vinegar basis it is important to select a pure malt vinegar while the ingredients which consist of fruits and spices in great variety must be reduced to a semifluid or pasty mass this is sus pended in the vinegar in the form of an emulsion and tends to sink to the bottom of the bottle for this reason all such sauces need to be well shaken before being poured out the keynote of the sauce manufactory is cleanliness and the use of enamelled pans for the boiling opera tions all the vats in which the compounds are cooled are made of british oak kept scrupu lously free from impurities and even the taps through which the vinegar passes are plateda dnxicacy of brtrsh originthe manufacture of bottled sauces is essen tiahly a british industryand the names of certain of our native sauces have become everywhere familiar the food we partake of in large towns is as a rulo from one to three davs old and has consequently lost some of its freshness it is in consequence of this that a good and pure sauce is a pleasant and useful adjunct to the meal such sauces are now prepared in this country at the rate of millions of dozens annually and are sent to all parts of the world in fact england once taunted as we have seen for its poverty in the matter of sauces has now become the worlds purveyor of these delicacies
