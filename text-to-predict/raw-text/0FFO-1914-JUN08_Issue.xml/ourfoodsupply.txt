our food supply  the feeding of the peopleall the vast and varied activities set out in this special number serve one purpose the feeding of the people it is this which has set them in motion and developed them into an everexpanding network of worldwide operations the statement is a truism but its full meaning is not generally or readily realizedthe great central fact of our civilization during the last century and a half is the growth ofpopulation or the increase of human life but it is habitually ignored in current criticisms of the existing economic order critics and reformers look back to some earlier state of society which they assume to have been stuperior and they call it a golden age this character is ascribed to it on the strength of selected fragments of evidence other facts are ignored and the greatest among them is the relatively small sum of human life existing at the time chosen for comparison with the present the aggregate was small and the rate of increase low because the conditions were relatively unfavourable to life the rapid growth of population which has resulted in the great mass of life we see about us today has been due to more favourable conditions the first of which is nutrition the people in these islandls began in the latter part of the th century to multiply more rapidly than before mainly because they were better fed and they have gone on multiplying for the same reason the change which then set in is shown by the statistics of populationgrowvtr of populatiosno complete enuneration of the people was made before  but a careful com pilation of available data by the census authorities enabled them to state the population at earlier dates with substantial accuracv the census of  gave the following comparative figures for great britainthe rate of increase in the first of these centuries was about  per cent in the second it was more than  per cent another com putation gives the following for england and walesthe broad lesson is substantiallv the same and it is plain enough even when ample allow ance has been made for inaccuracies if the population of  hacl been plumped down into the england of  it could not have been fed and still less could the population of  l have been fed in  economists were in fact very much exercised about this problem of feeding the people at the latter date it was in  that malthbus published his famous  essay on the principle of population in which he contended that the human race tends to multiply faster than the means of subsistence the enhanced rate of increase had then been in progress for sonme time and if conditions had remained as they were his reasoning would have proved substantially if not maathematically correct the people could not have been fed and their multiplication wvould have been chocked instead of that it proceeded at an accelerated pace yet the people were not only fed but fed on a rising scale of abundancesources of food supplyat first the rising demand for food to main tain a rapidly growing population was met by tho development of native resources down to the rniddle of the th century england pro duced rnore than she needed and was a food exporting country about  a change set in and though the export of surplus corn in abundant years did not wholly cease until  the home market not onlv absorbed a constantly increasing proportin of the pro duce but required an extensive development of agriculture to keep pace with its rising demands hence the enclosures and the great irnprovenment in fanring which marked this period they were called for to feed the town populations which sprang up and grew with the development of manufacture through mechani cal inventions and inproved transport these things furnished new and everexpanding formns of employment which provided means of sub sistence to a correspoadingly increasing number of persons and stimulated their multiplication at an unprecedented rate this is the real mean ing of the socalled industrial revolution its outcome was a great volumne of life sustained by the development of agriculture the people were not woll fed according to modern stan dards but they were enabled to exist whereas previously they did not exist and could not have existed under the former conditions when the industrial order then evolved is criticized and denounced this central fact is always ignored the multiplication of human life may be thought desirable or not but it is the most reall nnd tangible result of social activity and a thing of primary importanecmportation of foodbut thio mere multiplication of life was not all we have said above that the people were not only fed but fed on a risizng scale of abund ance ihis was achieved by drawing supplies from abroad and gradually extending the area until all parts of tho world were brought under contribution home production kept pace with the inoreasing population for many years after the beginning of the th century home grown whezat which sufficed for  millions in  was so far augmented by onlarged and improved farming as to feed ff millions at the same rate of constunption in  but the task became moro and moro difficult and in bad years thle deficiency had to be made good by larger and larger supplies from ebroad the annual imports of wlheat which averaged about half a million quarters at the beginning of the poriod had nearly doubled by the end of it and in the next decade rose to  millions after the abolition of the corn laws in  the movenment wvas accelerated and importations not only of wheat but of foodstuffs in general mounted rapidly upwards the following table compiled froem the returns of the board of agri culture gives the annual average imports for the last  years dowvn to in   per cent of our meat and  per cent of our wheat and mlour came from abroad under the rising flood of imports which was paid for by industrial products and rendered possible by the development of new countries and of transport prices went down and home agriculture languished but the people were more and raore abundantly fedprasa great deal has been heard lately of the rise in the cost of living and particularly of food but a survey of the past shows it to be a com paratively small wave between  and  the average price of wheat whieli was last year s d ranged in each decade from s to es a quarter in the next two decades it rose to sl in five separate years it exceeded s and in  it stood at s d this was partly due to the french war and partly to bad harvests the last is a point particularly worthy of note but generally ignored in i former times bad harvests meant a famine the present worldwide supply has abolished famines and people havo forgotten the mean i ing of the word year in year out the supply of bread is maintained with comparatively slight fluctuations of price even during the recent i rise the loaf has only averaged id a century ago it went up to ls d and wages then wereonly about half the present scale the wage i earning classes hardly ever atte butchers meat i then sugar was double its present price and tea was quite beyond their means thevariety of food now available to them and i habitually consumed is quite as striking a feature of present conditions as its compara tive abundancetxacsporta reference to the twopage map published with this issue together with the accom panymng text will show in a verv striking way how every part of the world is called uponi by this country for supplies from countries great and small near and far a continual stream of food of all kinds pours into great britain the question of transport thus becomes a most important factor in the feed ing of the people withoul a systern of trans port exectly balanced and adjusted to the needs of the situation the existing social industrial and economic order would cease to exist reference must also be made to the immense progress in recent years of refrigera tion and cold storage by its means perish able food products meat from argentina and australasia eggs from russia and siberia and a host of other food articles are carriedsafely to this country without this aid to transportation the teeming millions of great britain coirld never be fed modern transport i and mnethods of preservation are thus seen to i be factors of primary importance in this connection rnay be mentioned the supply of fish which has been rendered possible by steam trawling and preservation by cold thus exl tending the area of supply practically without i limitrscntr cost of lmvncto roturn to the subject of prices after thel period of excessively high rates mentioned above a general but unsteady decline set in with wide variations in individual years during the latter part of last century it became both more marked and more steady wheat went down to a point never imagined before and during the last  years has maintained a comparatively steady level of about onehalf the price that prevailed before  the recent rise is relatively trifling and that holds good of foodstuffs as a whole the comparative statistics of the board of trade bring it out verv clearly by the method of index numbers the vear  is taken as the standard represented by  and the corresponding figure last year was  indicating a rise of considerably under  per cent this is for the whole group of articles included under

yearsbeginning with  the date to which these statislics go back the level was higher than last year in  the lowest year of the series the figurefor the whole group was  in  it was  the exces sively low prices which obtaiied in the nineties were in truth quite abnormal and the rise that has been going on since  is really a return to a more normal level the acute conscious ness of its effects in diminished comfort which bas caused so much comrotion is a con vincing sign of the rising standard of living what was comfort a generation ago is hard ship todayeffcts or ixrnovx fxedingthe proofs of an advancing standard of living are numerous massive and incontrovertible there is first the deathrate which has fallen from  per  in  to  in  england and wvales the fall is not of course wholly due to improved feeding but that is one of the most important factors still more striking is the fall in the deathrate from consumption which is peculiarly influenced by nutrition in  it was  per  in  it was about  another proof of the same kind is the disappearance of typhus fever whichl is preeminently the hunger fever then again we have the decline of pauperism from  per  in  to  in  accompanied by a rise in the expenditure per head from  s  to  s id  the last figures show more clearly perhaps than any others the rising standard of living for destitution is the lowest economic condi tion of all in fine wo see destitutioni disease and death visibly receding in a great popula tion where once was a small one increasing very slowly and in this immense change the feeding of the people has played a leading partcomfort and natioxal vrriaiyin recent decades the rate of increase in the population has fallen off and is now much lower than it was a century ago in  the rate for england and wales was  per cent in  it was  per cent at first sight this may seem to show either that the conditions of life have grown worse or tbat the earlier rapid increase of population was not duo to improved conditions as argued above neither inference is correct the recent decline in the rate of increase which is due mainly to a falling birthrate is a con sequence and a proof of the rising standard of comfort tbe apparent discrepancy between the action of improved living in promoting a rapid growth of populationi in one period anid its aetion in ehecking that growth in another is explained by the influenei of comfort itself below a certain standard of living people cannot increase above it they will not because childrei impair tho comfort they have learned to take as their standard the same phenomenon is presented by earlier civilizations and by other contemporary countries in short there is excess and efficiency of comfort for nations as for individuals in regard to their vitality
