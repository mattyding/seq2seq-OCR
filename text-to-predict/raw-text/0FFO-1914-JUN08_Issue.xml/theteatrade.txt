tthe tea trade  a flourisfing industryenglish people have been drinking tea for more than two and a half centuries the beverage became inown to europe through the mediurm of the dutch east india company and was introduced into england from holland by lord arlington and others in the first hall of the th century by  the custon of drinking tea was sufficiently general to cause tea to be taxed in company with coffee and chocolate tea was to be prowured at the chief coffeehouses of the day but at a price ranging from  to  a pound it must stiu have been a luxury it was considered worthy of record that the english east india company made a present of some tea to king charles  in  but a decade later the company was obtaining a regular supply in  the imports of tea amounted to ooolb they

population the customs duty at d per lb amounted in this same year to historyalthough euirope had to wait until the th century for the pleasure of drinking tea the beverage was known to cliina more than a thousand years previously the tea plant is mentioned in the ancient chlinese dictionary the rfhya but we do not liear of teadrinking until the fourth century ad eiven then the taste would seem to have been an acquired one as the decoction was pronounced to be too bitter for the ordinary palate originally the plant appears to have been used for medicinal pur poses and then as a relish or vegetable thetea classic  is attributed to the eighth century and bv that date the use of tea was sufficiently established to call for an imperial duty upon ita long controversy hasl raged round the tea plant its spccies and its varieties as the result of an exhaustive analysis of this question in  the ommenircinl pr oducts of india sir eorge wvatt decides in favour of one species cacnmlia thea with three chief varieties viridis bolera and stricta to the firstnamed variety belong the plant indigenous to assam the wild tea of amanipur and the pick of the china teas thea bohea is the hybrid tea of indian teaplanters and the chief plant in the ftukien province of china it is regarded as a cross between viridis and the third variety thea stricta is the chinese tea known to indian tea planters but seems to be better known in india than in china the tea plant is usually propagated from seed for scientific culture we have to tuirn to india as in china tea pldnting is in the hnds of individual peasants and for reasons to be stated later is not the ifevocation that it is in india plants for seed production are not checked in their growthby pruning and sometimes reaeh a heightfrom oft to ft the china  plant as it is termed in india is smaller from loft to ft in height  but planits of ft to ft are known in china the seeds are sowvn in nurseries in november and december and planted out at the end of six or  months usuauy at the rate of  to the acre in triangular forma tion the plants being ft apart pruning takes place every year a very small leaf crop will i be obtained the second year after the first pruning in the third year the yield should be at the rate of b per acre and in six yeairs from b per acre upwards an average yield in india is a little under bblack anmd reen teasthe difference between black and green tas arises from the different methods of preparation and has nothing to do with differences in the plants sir george watt points out that as early as  bontius a dutch physician living ill batavia called attention to this fact but it was lost sight of by europe for two centuries briefly the distinction between the two kinds of tea is that the proeess of fermentation which gives to black teas their colour has been avoided or arrested in the case of green teashand labour which iin china is employed almost exclusively in the preparation of teas has in india made room for machinery which was first introduced in  and becamegeneral after  in the scientific method of preparing tea for the market the first process after the plucking of the leaf is to spread it out to wither until it is flaccid an operation that takes about  hours at a temperature of deg f the leaf is then rolled by machinery for from a quarter of an hour to one hour and it is at this stage that the fermentation or more correctly spealing oxidation begins the edges of the leaves and the ends of the stalks losing their greenness and becoming brown the leaves are spread out in a cool darkened room in layers from twvo to six inches thick for from two to six hours they have then to be dried or fired as quicklv as possible originally this was dono over dlear lharcoal fires but machinery is now employed in india the leaves being treated with a current of hot air of about odeg f reduced towards the end of the process to ldog p hlie tea is then graded according to the various marks or  ohops in china whieh supplies nearly the whole of the phraseology of the tea market and packed before packing eaeh grade is refired at a tem perature of lsodegdeg f rand is packed nhile still just warmin the ease of green tess witb a viewv to avoiding fermentation the leaves immediately they are received fromu the pluckers are treated by a process kinown as panning they are thrown without being withered straight on to a heated castiron basin sloped from the back here they are tossed about by hand until soft enough when they are slightly rolled alternate panning and rolling are continued uitil the edges of the leaves are slightly crisp ihev are then dried off as quickly as possible as in the case of black teas the next process is to steam the leaves under pressure in a rotating cylinder a treatment that lasts from   to  minutes under a steam pressure of b to the squaro inch after being steamed the leaves are placed in a centrifugal machine to get rid of the excess of wator  they are then roued slightly and immediately dried offln regard to the plucking of the leaves india and china again part companv the rough and readyn methods of the latter beina superseded by the scientific plucking of the indian plantations only the topmost leaves on each shoot are used for the best tea and the object of the cultiva tion is to secuire the maximum supply of young shoots throughout the season thus while in china only tihree plluckings take place in april may and august in india bushes will be plucked from  to  times during the year at intervals of from sevon to nine days tradi tion connects tho grading of teas with the posi tion of the leaves on the shoot the bud and the first opened leaf are supposed to give orange or flowery pekoe the next leaf  pekoe with  souehong  and  congou  lower down in the scale but according to sir george watt  the grades are now merolv commercial terms which have little relationship to any particular leavesindia teasindia went to china for its teaplant but is inclined now to regret the step as the in digenous plant has proved the better grower petween  and  the tesplant was discovered in assam and manipur in spite of the fact that in  the governorgeneral had pointed out the desirability of cultivating tea in india in order that england should not be dependent for her supply on china no practical notice seems to have been taken of the discovery and little was done until  when a com riittee was formed to report on situations for experimental cultivation and a delegate sent to china to obtain seed and information the tea plant was rediscovered in assam but expert opinion was against the native variety and the indian tea industry was started under govern ment auspices with china plants in  the first sample of indiangrown tea was sent to england two years later the government had withdrawn from tea planting in favour of private enterprise and in  the first public sales of indian tea took place in calcutta when b were sold the early years of the industry were not marked with conspicuous success and it was not until  that any great inmpetus was given to the trade from that year tea cultivation spread rapidly and bringing in its train the uisual gambling transactions was the victim of a disastrous crisis in  thle episode  steadied  the industry which sinco then has

the popular taste has indined tea analyses it is generally admitted are not yet satisfactory and where they set out to emphasize or minimize differences between indian and chiaa teas there is no guarantee that the samples can be regarded as equally representative the tannin bogey in indian tea has been conjured away in the interests of the market leaving china tea with a deficiency of caffoine but the vast majority of con sumers are probably not overanxious or the subject indian teas deserve their success for they are well growvn well marketed well advertised tea auctions deal with indian ceylon java and any other kinds of tea except china tea which has to rely upon private sales scientific culbure has prevailed over muscientific methods with the result that the world has a larger and much cheaper supply of tea than if it had to rely upon china teas alone the present position of the india tea industry has been reached by the continual adoption of improve ments in methods of prunig of plucking of cultivation and of miacsftture in assam it is pointed out the average crop in  was from b to b per acre ia  it wasfrom b to b but the great hold that india has on the worlds tea market is given it by tho cheapness of its productschina teasteagrowing in china is a peasant industry the plant is cultivated mainlv on the slopes or at the foot of hiills generally in small patches round the homesteads the family picks the leaves and gives them their pre liminary drying in the sun they are then bought up by the middleman who takes them with his other pturchases to tho firinghouse for assortment and treatment the farst picking is in april the second lasting  to  davs is in may while a third crop is harvested in augustin contrast with the mechanical appliances of the indiar plantations the preparation of tea in china is dolne exclusively by handor by foot the leaves when picked are thrown into large flat basket trays and exposed to the sun as they begin to darten and curl up they are gathered up and made into balls this process being done by the feet when a large quantity ofleaf has to be twisted as soon as the leaves have been given sufficient twvist thle
