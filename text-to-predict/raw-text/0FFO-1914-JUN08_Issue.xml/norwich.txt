mustard industry whiclh for over a century has been carried on at tho gates of the city there is a reason for the establishment of the ustard trade in this district norwich is the centre of a vast tract of the rich soil in which the mustard plant is best cultivated the lowlying lands of spurn head and other parts of lincolnshire the fen districts of cambridgeshire of essex and parts of yorkshire and durhamr are well suited for the growth of the brown mustard planit wliich furnishes the chief ingredient in edible mustard these english counties produce all the finer qualities of the seed but another source of supply is holland which produces a considerable variety of wlhite and brown seed it is difficult to arrive at an estimate of the quantity of mustardseed pro i duced and consiuned annually and the tradeis so close a monopoly that those engaged in iit are chary of furnishing statistics it iscertain however that many thousands of acres in england are under cultivation with plant for the purposes of the condiment industry the average yield may be taken at about three quartkrs per aere butthcaverageprice during recent years has been s to los per bushel i for brown

vinegar ar a remedy against the stings of serpents the first record of its use in engl md would seerm to occur in the household book of the duke of nortii umberland in tle reign of henry vii where it is stated that  gallons of mustard seed was the allowance per annum for his retainers and servants the seed was not at that time manufactured but was brought to table whole where it was bruised and mixed with vinegar according to taste gerarde the herbalist wrote of the white mustard  it makes an ex cellent sauce good to be eaten with gross meats either fish or flesh and shakespeare in the taminq of the shreu act iv scene iii has the fouowing  what say you to a piece of beef and mustard  origin of grond mustardthe begiinings of the moderm industry are due to a woman about the year  durham mustard first became popular owing to the fact that a woman name e riements hit upon the idea of grinding the seeds in a mill and sifting the flour from the husk lmrs clements was her own ambassador and travelled twice a ear to london for orders king george i took a liling to mis clements and that of course helped the sales the old lady managed to keep he secret for many years and accumulated a small fortune it is the development of the crude methods by which durham mustard was pro duced that has built up the mustard industry at norwich today the raw material reaches the factory at carrow by road rail ard water but in the old days there were great difficulties of transit between stoke holy cross where the old mill formerly a paper mill was situated and the lincolnshire fens wagons were loaded up at the farms in lincolnshire or else where dispatched to soham and the seeds then ransferred into emnpty wagons which bad been sent from norwichalthough both wvhite and browvn or black mustard seed is employed in making table mustard it is still largely a secret promess of which no one posesesses the key except the principals of the norwich works it is the correct blending of bothi seeds which makes the best table condiment the white seed although possessing very little pungency has within it a peculiai ferment whichi develops the pungent flavour of the black seed the practice adopted by the largost manu facturers is to prepare mustard of several grades to suit uhe taste of different markets for although no separate statistics of mustard ar available the produet of the norwich factories goes all over the world and is regularlycarried by those hardy bands of pioneers who penetrate the icy fastnesses of the arctio and the antarctic some of the mustards made are perfectly pure others are mixed mustards the french mustard is again a different variety of the manufactured mixed article flie justification by british makers for the use of these mixtures is that the finest quality of seed is used and that by tempering this with a small proportion of wheat and flour they are able to produce a table mustard which will not onlv be free from the bitterness and coarseness of flavour of pure mustard but will keep much better it is ehis condiment mustard of which the public taste approves
