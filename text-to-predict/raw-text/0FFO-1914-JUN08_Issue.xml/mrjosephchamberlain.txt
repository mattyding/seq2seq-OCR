men if they were wvise did not talk about civl war they did not enter into combina tionls of which the object might be civil war in a civilizpdnt community there wals no partv or class or individual whvo did not unquestionably stand to lose by civil war t herefore let no one be so foolish as to suppose that the party which of alu others in the state stood to gain by the maintenance of order and civil stability had liglty or inconsiderately anclnneod to e position in vwhich they said as the unionistc saidl today that if civil war came over this quarrel the wvhole of the unionist partv in england would range themselves side by side with the in habitants of ulster this question had become too serious for mere partisanship we had been brought to a point at which men wonld he well ad vised to remember that they were english citizens first and party men afterwardsit would be said that there were many other issues before the country at this moment but he replied that there was only one issue and that was whether england was to pronounce upon this bid or a coprulpt cabinet autocracy backed up by a corrupt hiouse of commons was to decide it no liberal government had ever yet tonched home rule excepting when they wanted the irish vote but when nfr asquith made a bargain with mr redmond to grant home rule in re turn for nationalist support for the budget he forgot that you could not sell men ulsternen never belonzed to mfr asquith and they never would cheers if he lr smith were sked which wrs the rogue and which was the fool in that bargain he would find it difficult to say langhter but mr red mond had not got thle goods for which he paid his price and he never would get them cheersthe army was the servant of the king primarilv it was the servant also of the people it was bound to olbey and carry out the expression of the popular will but neither the army nor the navy were the slaves of the premier cheersthe government claimned that they had the support of the people but they were afraid to test it bv a general election they were engrged in a deliberkte frauid against democratic right nild they knew they had not the support of the country the government
