tea coffee and cocoa  le their values as foods their growing poptjlaritythe influence of tea coffee and cocoa on salivary and gastric digestion is on the whole accounted unfavourable the presence of oven  per cent of tea infusion in the digesting mixture appears to inhibit completely the conversion of starch into sugar vwhich is the steppingstone whereby starch is able to be digested this effect is attributable to the presence of the gallotannic acids accompanying the caffeine in tea and coffoo and not to the caffeine itself this latter being regarded as an aid to digestion rather than otherwisethe pronouncement by the authorities that tea and coffee are in no sense foods will be accepted or possibly rejected by the ordinary layman with a certain feeling of pained surprise whether according to their own definition of food the authorities be right or wvrong he will hardly stop to inquire so long as hlis accus tomed supplies of tea and coffee are in no vway prejudiced thereby the reason why tea and coffee are not ranked as foods is because they can neither build up the tissues nor impart potential energy to them both beverages in their ordirlary forms are but infusions and their respective actions upon the body depend entirely upon the tannic acid caffeine and volatile oils they contain the caffeine of the coffee being identical with the theine of the tea cocoa on the other hand is undeniably a foodstuff though its value as such is con sidorably less than would naturally be sutp posed owing to the very limited amount that can be taken at a tiineencs of tsea ad coreethe properties of a bowl of hot tea are varous and at first sight somewhat paradoxical depending in no small measure upon the predispositions of the individual consumerif you are cold it will warmy ou by stimulat ing the circulation if hot it will cool you bv atimulating evaporation from your skin if sleepy it will probably keep vou awake and if wakeful it will verv likely send you to sleep if you are a glutton it may save you by prevent ing the too rapid digestion of your food while if you are a mere ordinary person it is as likely as not to cause you indigestiona culp of tea contains about the samo amount of gallotannie acid as an equal volume of black coffee and like coffee it is a stimulant to heart and brain and an antidote to the comatose effects of an overdose of alcoholtea and coffee should be avoided at meals where meat is taken since they awe apt to produce the wellknown effect of  tanning when brought into contact with meat thereby considerably reducing its digestibilityteca possesses in a marked degree the property of dispelling the sensation of fatigue and while readily accepting the dictum that it is not a food it may be stated without fear of con tradiction that in cases of extreme physical exhaustion it possesses restorative qualities unexcelled by any other beverage foodstuff or stimulantfood valle of cocoacocoa differs materially both from tea and coffee and althouglh its active principle theo bromine bears a close chemical relationship to caffeine nevertheless in view of the general absence of gallotannic acids its effect upon the nervous system is practicallv negligible the food valuie of a cup of cocoa is greatly increased if milk be employed ia its preparation instead of water owing to the high nutritive value of the milkof the socalled medicated  cocoas perhaps vicocoa is the most widely known this preparation contains a considerable proportion of caffeine as well as a glucoside kolared and cxerts a marked action upon the brain and nervous system kola is said to possess remarkable sustaining qualities prolonging muscular contraction and abolishing fatigue but the use of so potent a drug in an every day beverage such as cocoa is hardly to be recommended
