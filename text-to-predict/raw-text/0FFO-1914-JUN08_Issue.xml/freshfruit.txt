fresh fruit home sutpply steadily increasinga larger variety of fresh fruit is enjoyed in britain than in any other country and its abundance contributes greatly to the good health of the community without entering here into dietetic controversy it may be safely said that if the average consumption of fruit were still higher our peoplo nwould be less susceptible to digestive disordersstatistics of production are onlv collected from holdings exceeding one acre and as mnuch fruit is grown m gardens and smau private orchards it is not possible to speak definitely of home production but it is obviously far short of requirements for tho imports are very large for oversea supplies of apples alone we paid last year   and though mnuch of the canadian and californian produce is of excellent quality plenty of apples growna in britain ere equal and perhaps superior to it yet it is probable that the home production is little greater than the imports there is an enormous nurnber of varieties and sqlective tests for different districts and soils are much needed at the present timeplnums chemes and pzamsplums are the second fruit crop in order of importance and in many an old orchard as well as in modern plantations and orchard houses they are grown in unrivalled flavour and beauty our imports averago in value each year about  and it seerns likely that they may increase if the ravages of our trees by tho mysterious disease known as silver leaf are not checked a saprophytic fungus stereum purpureum is generally found on silvered trees but authorities do not agree that it is the cause and preventive treatment is therefore still to seek greengages do not fruit wcl and we are mainly dependent on spanish and french supplies of this delicious fruit damsons aro characteristically british and grow where no other fruit will the record high prices last year suggest extended plantation of young treesthe imports of cherries are much less than the supplies produced at home principally in kent they are an erratic crop but on the whole are profitable when small birds can be kept in check the quality of cherries sold is widely variable but the supplies are never too large the choicest fruit is now produced by pot culture in the orchard house a system with many recommendations which is likely to be much extended in the culture of all the choicer hardy and halfhlardy fruitstho home production of pears is surprisingly small and the imports for  were the heaviest for many years costing  good varie ties have been introduced in recent years but far too many inferior sorts are grown and old unhealthy trees preserved this is a fruit that especially deserves more attention though adnmittedly it presents some difficulties which chauenge knowledge and skill on shallow soils for instance the quince stock must be employed while the choice of varieties must be carefully made to provide a crop of fruit that will be in use from the late sumnmer till may followingstrawberries goosexbezrs oucarsad raspberriesstrawberry production valued in  at  has greatlv increased in recent years particularly on the south coast though over  is sent abroad each year princi pally for early supplies some ob servers have hintcd that the fruit is losing favour this does not prove to be so in a seasonable summer but growers would do well to recognize that many people prefer other fruits to the flavourless insipid produce sold at tho cheaper pricesgooseberry culture is seriously burdened by the prevalence of american goosoberry mildew whichl very imprudently was not taken in hand by the authlorities until it had already gained a strong hold the regulations now in force to check it are so stringent and apparently barren of result that the kent county council recently refutsed to work the order in their area the disease can be controlled by re moving infected wood early in the season and seeing that the fruit is cssentially british it is urgently necessary to rid our orchards of the disease even at some inconvenience and ex pense growers of black currants an inusuially profitablo crop are somewhat simnilarly ham pered by  big bud and the gooseberry mildew has lately been found on these fruits as well as on red end white currantsraspberry production is a surprisingly large industry and crops to the v alue of  were grown in  loganberries and other hybrids between the raspberry and the black berry have become popular in recent years and as they are prolific and hardy are being extensively planted the general liking for blackberries has led to the cultivation of im proved varieties on a small scale in kent but the main supply continues to come from tho hedgerowswild fiatnisthidgerows occupy space which must repre sent many thousands of acres of mainly un productive yet not poor land and its suitability for fruit culture impresses itself upon those who have seen roads in hungary and elsewhere lined with fruit trees which we are told are no more subject to spoliation than enclosed orchardsa iruit in good demand in northern industrial towns is the bilberry or whortleberry and though it occurs plentifully on the moorlands is imported in considerable quantity from germany the marsh whortleherry or cran berry bought chiefly from russia is a useful autumn and winter fruit in tarts and is worth buying even at d per lb this and the american cranberry have been cultivated in tho eastern counties but did not prove very profitablegrapes peaches nectanines apricots end figs are extensively grown in private gardens and glasshouses but their commercial pro duction is a small industry and not likely to grow very much on account of the competition of warmer countriesfruit presrvingthe problem with all perishablo foodstuffs is how to avoid the heavy loss involved by glut in tho production of fruit particularly soft fruit a bountiful season is often the least profitable because of low prices and the grower who seeks a better market must preserve his fruit apart from cold storage and jam making the only practical methods of preserva tion are by bottling and by drying well battled fruit keeps for years and is almost indistinguishable from fresh fruit when used in tarts and similar dishes the process requires only simple and inexpensive apparatus in which the fruit in specially made bottles can be steamed at controlled temperatures for a short time the bottles after cooling can be kepttill the autunn or winter before being offered for sale and then the fruit is very acceptable and if attractivoly marketed commands a good profit a colony of small holders can provide themselves with tho steaming plant necessary to deal with many bottles at a time and find a better market for a large proportion of their fruit than if it were all sold fresh while thefilling of the bottles requires but little more labour than packing the fruit for safe carriage by rail asparagus and peas are also bottled satisfactorilyapart from exotic dried fruits a large amount of money is paid for imported apple rings dried plums and pears grown in britain and the admiralty and the war office are largebuyers yet the art of fruit drying which enables much otherwise wasted fruit to be utilized is neglected in britain
