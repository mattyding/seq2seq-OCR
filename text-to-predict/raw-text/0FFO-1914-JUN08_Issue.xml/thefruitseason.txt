the fruit season damage by frost and drought small crpops in prospectilarely if ever had there been a better all round prospect for firuit than there wras up to the evening of may  inearly all varieties of plums pears and cherries had blossomed profusely aind apples had an equally liberal display gooseberries and black currants pro maised at least an average yield strawberries in the earliest districts were well covered with blossomrs or buds and raspborries wvere satisfactory red currants alonie among the principal fruit crops wero somewihat below the markearly in the morning of may  howrever without any wvarning frost of exceptional severity for the time of yearoceurred through out a great portion of the country the results were disastrous but curiously partial on the lower grownds of evesham pershore and many other fruit districts the plun and pear crops were almost entirely destroyed and strawberry blossom so far as it was open was killed on high grounds comparatively little damage wtas done wlhile the frost was not severe in kent and other southlern counties for some reason currants escaped injury while coimparatively little damage was done to goose i berries early apples whichi were in full i blossom were badly injured  but the bulk of i this crop was fortunately not forward enough to be seriously damageddrought and more frostalthough the southeastern counties escaped the first mlay frost they suffered from drougaht more severely than any other part of great britain the yield of gooseberries was miucll lessthan it should have been and black currallts i  ran off  badly in many places while a great i deal of the blossom on some varietiesof apples also withered mainly it is believed fromn lack of moisture also mnucll harmn was done by northeast winds during muchl of the second half of may it remained however for tho frosts of the last week in the month to iifict the worst of the disastersreports of the inmmense damage done by i the frosts of the mornings of may  and  have appeared in the times while they swept away most of the plums and pears which had escaped on may  they annihilated much of the strawberry crop where they were in full severity fortunately kent usually a great sufferer when frosts are prevalent again escaped lightly as kent is the greatest slp plier of strawberries andl cherries the shortne ssi of these crops will be less serious than might lhe supposed if sufficient rain falls soon enoughl this is particularly the case witlh cherries and local reports are still hiopeful for this croptar need of rainfor raspberries the only chance is also a good supply of rain the need of which is now urgent in the important airgovirio district about an average yield is expected if sulficiert rain falls soon enough reporbs from lwisbech mention damage to thi erop romu frost black currants too are badly in need of a thorough soaking in any case this crop will not be a full one and if drought laists another week itwnill bho iuchi beloxv average it is eertain that  the plumt crop will be a very short one not only at evesharn and pershoro but in other parts of wore stirshire in i loucesterslire canibridgoslhire norfolk and in countics farther north thl destruetion by frost has been very extensive and where the frost was light as inkent the crop has failed to set well or has droppd off to a serious extent from what has been stated above it wvill bo seen that the crop of strawberries wilt be very smnallwhile gooseberries currants and pears will be moro or less under averago and raspberries at least a little under cherries if they pass well through the stoning ordeal are alone expected to be up to the mark unless cobauts and filberts turn out fair crops as they seem likely to do in kent at presentthe chief uncertainty is the apple crop the second frosts in may did much more damage to this fruit than the first apart from this somne varieties have set fill crops while others have failed badly in kent the crop is expected to be below average on the wholo and the other counties do not promise to counterbalance the destructioti by frostthe fruit harvesz will be one of great in equality for different growers those who have escaped frost damage will reap the benefit of the high prices resulting from general de ficiency while it is to be feared that many small growrers will be ruined the partialitv of the frosts was extraordinary some orchards in even the most badly injured districts having suffered very little damageinsecs s antd fjrrsimilar variation is noticnable in the attaeks of insect and fungoils pests the aphis has injured plums apples gooseberries and currants badly in some districts or particular farms and hardly at all in others as a role the apple sucker has been in strong force but not ulli versally while caterpillars are numerous in sorne places and few in many others the maggots of the pear inidge have done mueh damage but this attack is variable like thie rest as a sequel to the extremely wet weather of the winter and the early part of the spring there has been more brown rot fungus among apples than for some years past and in some plaees it is eoially troublesome among plums and cherries the powrdery mildnw of apples is exceptionally prevalent in some parts of timn country and not in others these attacks would probably be even worse if it wore not for the drought which has kept apple and pear scah in many orchards at least from developing american gooseberrv mildew is prevalent in various degrees of intensityon the whole the seasson
