our food imports a worldwtde levy for supplies large and small caterers consigmeents from all countriesthe twopage map published in the present issue affords what will doubtless be regarded as impressive evidence alike of the wide area from which supplies for the feeding of the british nation are drawn and the magnitude of the proportions those importations have assumed the entire globe is shown to be put under contribution more or less for the satisfy ing of our needs from countries great and small near and far we accept what they can offer whether their consignments are huge or insignificant neither distance nor quantity seems to count japan and china are en couraged no less than holland and belgium we take  worth of food in a vear from argentina but we do not despise  vorth from afghanistan while recording that british india sent us in  wheat of the value of  the board of trade statisticians do not omit to mention that from the seychelles we received miscellaneous food supplies the value of which apart from cinna mon was none the less it would be a mistake to assume that the position of the uinited kingdom in this respect is unique among the countries of the world other countries almost without exception also look elsewhere for at least some of their food supplies the one which bas approached nearest perhaps to a selfcon taimed and selfsufficient standard is china though even cbina is now importing among other thingg butter and flour from australia england is thus only sharingthough perhaps in a more accentuated formthe experiences of to a greater or less degree the nations of the world in general these experiences are to be attributed to a combination of causes pro minent among which may be mentioned  the economic tendencies of the age  the social progress of communities and  the greater facility and the greater economy with which the movement of food supplies can now be effectedsuch causes as these are of universal applica tion though they may indeed seem to operate with especial force in the case of the united kingdom when shown in the form taken by the map which is here presented with the object of offering a birdseye view of the situation as a vwhole in its bearing on our own positionone further material fact to be borne in mind is that the food imports into great britain are higher than they would otherwise be because london especially is an entrept from which considerable consignments of produce are still being redistributed to other lands notwith standing the increasing tendency on the part of continental countries to trade direct with the producersources of supplybrpitish possessionswhen we inquire into the sources of supply of the imported food products coming to us under the aforesaid conditions and circumstances it is certainly gratifying to know that of the  thus expended no less than  already goes to the credit of im ports from british possessions the productive resources of wlhich should nevertheless be equal to their securing a still larger share in the sum totalindia takes the lead among these possessions the value of her own contribution to our food supplies in  being  of this

thereon of systematic organization by those countries of their agricultural industries with a view alike to better production cheaper distribution and systems of marketing based on scientific and sound economic principles must be borne well in minddenxarxdenmark by reason of her agricultural organization on cooperative lines has relatively to her size become one of the greatest of food producers our imports of butter from denmark in  were of the value of  this figure compares with  in  and with  in  but the total rosein to  notwithstanding increased shipments of danish butter to

during one week in february leith  grimsbv  newcastle   hull  goole   harwich  london direct  while therefore the northern ports received  casks the southern received only  one reason for these conditions is that the northern ports are nearer to denmark than the southern which draw their foreign supplies mainly from france another is that the salted danish butter which all fetches the same pricethe top price of practically all the butter importedsuits the more delicate palates of the miners and millhands of yorkshire who are the chief consumers and who do not favour the more varied qualities of french butter accepted in the southour imports of eggs from denmark in  attained a total of   great s  viz  eggsand represented a money value of  formerly the greater number of the eggs received here from denmark came to london via harwich but a far larger proportion is now sent to leith grimrsby newcastle hull and goole to meet more readily the dernands of the northern marketsin the

her total for  being  as compared with denmarks denmarks achievements in agricultural organization have somewhat overshadowed those of holland vet the dutchmen have been no less practical and no less thoroughgoing in this respect than the danes as a result of her efforts the country which is only  square miles in extent exports a prodigious quantity and a large variety of food productsthe  we paid her for butter in  is considerably below the  worth of butter we had from her in  though the  for cheese was an advance over pre vious years but the chief item on the list of our imports fromn holland in  was  for margarine a figure which rose to  in  and compares with  in  the next largest item was  for refined sugar the fruit or vegetable imports which had not been diverted from us by the german dealers included in  raw fruit  potatoes  onions  tomatoes  dried vegetables  other vegetables  eggs we received to the value of  of meat holland sent us fresh pork  mutton  and rabbits  other items

are fruit and vegetables the total exports of grapes fron belgium have incrcased in value from f  in  to f  in  the belgian growers claim to be able to supply foreign markets with certain of their varieties of grapes at any tiue of the year grapes sent to us more especially from groenendael near brussels and coming here in dailv consignments via antwerp in the season have to compete witlh the channel islands varieties as well as with those grown umder glass on the sussex riviera all the same our total imports of belgian grapes amotuted in  to the re spectable figure of belgium again competes with france and holland in supplying the london market with vegetables she follows intensive methods of culture more or less on her approximatelv  acres of market gardens and she sent us in  no fewer than  tons of vegetables as compared with less than  tons in belgium wlhile seeking to emulate holland in supplying us with fresh pork has not yet got beyond  worth in a vear as against her neighbours  but she surpasses holland in the matter of fresh dead rabbits her consignments weighing cwt valued at  poultry come from belgiunm to the extent of  we also had from belgium in  maize meal  peas and beans  barley  wheat meal and flour  farinaceous foods  eggs  fresh fish  hops  yeast  and other things besidesfrancein the early eighties the policy of cooperative action as a means of meeting the agricultural crisis of that period was initiated in france since then orgauization has undergone a remark able expansion and in view alike of this fact of the exceptional advantages that france enjoys as a producing country and of her nearness to our own shores it may be regarded as a matter for surprise that the sum total of the food supplies she sends usnamely  should be so much below the totals for den mark holland and russiait is however to be remembered that france herself has a large population to feed that she has to meet on our own markets the competi tion of denmark and australasia in her butter of russia and other countries in her eggs and of cornwall in her broccoli that her consignments of other vegetables and of fruit are no longer wanted here when our own later supplies are ready and that also her exports of food to germany have greatly increased of late yearsamong the more important articles of food imported annually from france are wines and brandies valued at about i million sterling fresh fruit amounting in  to some  tons vegetables fresh and dried amounting to  tons sugar  tons butter  tons and cheese some  tonsgermainyhome consumption is more and more over taking home production in gernany leaving fewer supplies available for export and occa sioning such greater need for foreign food supplies on her own account that her imports of fresh vegetables for instance increased from  in  to  in  in germany as in france a vast amount of organi zation work has been carried out in connexion with atriculture but in the former country the results while of great importance from the point of view of german economic progress have had a less appreciable effect on inter national marketsthe sum total of our food imports from germany in  was  of this amount no less than  is ceounted for by sugar refined and unrefined though here there is a falling off as compared with  when the corresponding figure was close on  the only other item in  which

exporter to great britain of considerable quantities of wheat ryo and barley sweden today sends us instead increas lug consigaments of butter her agriculturists having found this to be the more
