the wheat problem  our reliance on foreign supplieswvheat being the main food of the people it is as well to take stock of supplies from time to time and the fact that this country produces less than onefifth of the wheat consumed is mattor for reflectionthere aro two principal causes for thieone the increase of the population and the other the diminished home supplyaccording to the census of  the popula tion of the united kingdom has increased bv  during the last  years this is an outstanding fact which must be considered in connexion wvith the food supply especially as if the present rato of increase continues the home supply of wheat will constitute only a very small percentage of the total amount consumeda study of the averago prices per quarter during the last  years reveals the followingyear wheat barleg oatss d s  s d        sss s s             s            the fall of prices between the years  and  was  per cent in tho case of wheat  per cent in barley and  per cent in oats and although prices have somewhat improved since then they are not yet sufficiently attractive to induce agriculturists to change their present systemthe total acreage under wheat barley and oats in the united kingdom decreased from  ares in  to  in  to  in  to  in  to  in as the price of corn declines the margin of arable cultivation shrinkls from this the deduction may safely be made that if the price of cereals rose considerably an increase in the arable land of the cotuntry would follow and the land would be able to provide a greater amount of home foodyield and consimnowthe average yield of wheat per acre may be taken at  bushels so that if the acreage under wheat in the united kingdom went back to whlat it was in  that is if there was an in crease of  acres we mnight expect an increased y icld of  quarters or as much again as the present vield but this benefitwould soon be lost providing the popu lation continued to increase at the present ratethe price of wheat however is not likely to go back to the figure at wlhich it stood for many years to come a rise of anything like s per quarter would stimulate production not only here but abroad and we have yet to learn what a more intensive cultivation in the new world will do for the wheat cropin the report of the royal cominission on the supply of food c in time of war it was estimated that the annual consumption of wheat including flour per head in the united kingdom was b equivalent to an average weekly requirement of  quarters but these figures were based on the population recorded in tlhe  census and would require revision todayin  the population of the united king dom stood at  in  it had in creased to  showing an increase of  so that the population as taken at the  census would require at the rate of b per head per annum another  quarters or altogether an average of  quarters per week but the acreage under wheat in the united kingdom was in  whereasin  it was only  showing a decrease of  acres which taking the average yield at  bushels gives a reduced yield of  quarters per annumthus in allowing a deduction of  per cent for seed and tail cornthe home supply of wheat was sufficient for  weeks consunption in  it was sufficient for only  weeks consumption in  the home supply of wheat provided b per head of the population in  the home supply of wheat provided only glb per head of the populationrelation of wheat area to pbiceit is constantly being asserted that the pro duce of the soil could be very much increased by more intensive cultivation that may be but not at a profit and without a profit no one will cultivate so that for all practical pur poses this argument may be put asidescience perhaps by the production of wbeatb of superior vielding power and by the preven tion of disease might irnprove the crop by  per cent but on the other hand in propor tion as prices increase and more land is brought under wheat cultivation a less retunn must be expected per acre because it will pay to culti vate inferior soils the average yield would probably then return to  bushels per acre which was the average given by mr pusey for ehngland and wales in the first volumne of the royal agricultural societys journal barley being principauy used for the manu facture of alcoholic liquor which though it may be classed as food is not a necessity and oats in england being used for provender are excluded both these crops however occupy a considerable proportion of the arable land of the country and are likoly to do so ia the future it is not probable there fore that the wheat ares can boe increased at their expense there remains however a large extent of land which owing to the fau in prices has been laid down to grass whih taight be brought bacl into wheat cultivatio
