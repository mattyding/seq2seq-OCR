mineral water trade indications of continued prosperityaerated and mineral waters may conveniently be divided into two main groups tablo waters and medical waters and the table waters may be subdivided into two clasos the artificial and the natutal the artificial aeration of water was invented by joseph priestley who wrote in  an account of the methods he had lately discoveredartipicial arrtend watlsthe following are the chief varieties of arti ficial aeratedwaters l plain water charged with carbonic acid gas the most suitable water for this purpose is that obtained from artesian wells which is usually of great purity ordinary water so impregnated is commonly known as  soda water even when there is no soda present and is a form frequently to be met with in syphons  aerated distilled waters from which all solid matters lime and other salts are removed by distillation they are subsequently charged with carbonic acid gas under pressure and are in consequence perfectly pure carbonated waters  waters to which various salts bave been added for instance soda water containing three to five grains of bicarbonate of soda to the bottle potash magnesia ana lithia waters containing similar proportions of their respective carbonates  imitations of natural waters of which perhaps the best example is the ordinary seltzer water which is intendedl to approximate in quality to tho water of the natural spring at selters nassau seltzer water contains common salt bicarbonate of soda carbonate of magnesia and hydrochloric acid and by the interreaction of these sub stances an effervescent saline water is pro duced which iurnishes a good inmitation of the genuine seltzer  the sweetened and flavoured mineral waters including lemonade ginger ale ginger beer and so forth the basis of these minerals is water sweetened with cane sugar the requisite degree of sharpness and flavour is imparted by the regulated addition of various acids and flavouring materials the resulting liquids are generally charged with carbonic acid gas under pressure in the usual way genuine stone ginger beer however is a properly fer mented liquor containing sugar ginger tartaricacid gum arabic oil of lemon and yeast and yielding on fermentation  or more per cent of actual alcoholnatueal t anle ivatrsthe following are examples of natural table waters in use in this country both sparkling and stillin sparkling waters perrier water from france and apollinaris johannis and cambrunnen from germany are the best known and account between them for the great bulk of the favour and patronage ex tended by the public to imported waters in the still water class malvern from the west of england and evian from france are the best known the water from st annes well at malvern is remarkably clear and has been eulogized by the late sir henry thompson in the following terms  no purer water exists in any natural source than that of our own malvern springsmedical watesin addition to the foregoing list of mineral table waters there are hundreds of other mineral waters containing variotus chemicals which lend them a special value in certain cases thus there are i aperient waters of which apenta seidlitz and hunyadijanos are wellknown examples these owe their medical activity chiefly to their large proportion of sodium and magnesium sulphates  alkaline waters such as those of perrier and vichy from france the former is onlv slightly alkaline and is in no sense a medicinal wvater although it is essentially useful in all functional disorders and disturbances of the digestive organs and especially in the ease of gout and rlheumatism the latter is strongly alkaline and essentially a medicinal water and can be recommnended for definite medicinal use  ferruginous or chalvbeate waters such as those of hiombturm marienbad nau heim scliwalbach and vittel these waters are stimulant tonic and astringent and are found to be efficacious in all forrns of debilitv associated with anmmia  sulphurous waters such as those of aixlachapelle aixles bains harrogate and strathpeffer which are impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen and used in cases of scrofulous diseases and chronic cutaneous affections and  lithiated waters of badenbaden buffalo carlsbad kaiserfried rich and royatthere is hardly a complaint so raro or so terrible but some mineral water may be found which professes to be able to cure it thus we read of one of these waters that it is of value in cases of numerous diseases which embrace practically all the recogaized maladies that flesh is heir to and yet simple analysis shows the principal saline constituent to be common salt while next in abundance are bicarbonate of soda lime and magnesia together with silica and traces of iron and arsenicaxnualz consuxaronduring the last  years the mineral water industry in this country has witnessed a degree of development little short of marvellous the principal causes of this expansion are doubt less to be found in the followingconsiderations namely that we are becoming less and less a winodrinking people that the mineral waters themselves have attained a very high standard of excellence and perhaps most important of all that the whisky blenders have been emi nently successful in producing whiskies more i and more in accord with the reqairements ofthe public taste the following table shows the imports of foreign and colonial aerated and mineral waters for the four years  to wtule the imports for  amounted to  dozen bottles valued at  in addition to these imports an enormous amount of soda water and aerated table waters of various kinds is manufactured and prepared in this countrv from a number of private sources so consider able as to defy any attempt at exhaustive enumeration from one source and another however it is estimated that our total con suimption of mineral waters amounts to no less than  million bottles per yearmmdical aspects of table wateaswith regard to their action upon the digestive processes of normal persons carbonated waters are upon the whole accounted beneficial carbonic acid gas is an undoubted aid to diges tion since it promotes a mnore abundant secre tion of gastric juice it reacts furthermore as a stimulant to the movements of the stomach thus aiding the mechanical processes of diges tion while the mere fact of bubbl in urp through the food contents of the stomach facilitates the disintegration of the food carbonated waters should however be carefully avoided in cases where there is already excess of carbon dioxide in the blood as in cases of cyanosis for the gas is rapidly absorbed from the stomach into the blood they should also be avoided in cases of dilatation of the stomach and in cases of weak hcart wheni distension of the stomach may put an additional strain upon the heart by causing the fundus of the stomach to press against it the use of mineral waters should be avoided in cases of lack of appetite for the carbonic acid gas by lowering the sensibilitv of the stomach nerves may still further lessen the desire for foodcarbonic acid gas is not fatal to organisms with the possible exception of the cholera bacillus it is a mistake therefore to imagine that carbonated waters must necessarily he sterile on the other hand the best makers employ water drawn from artesian wells wvhich is usually free from germs the distilled aerated waters such as salutaris are of course quite beyond suspicion in this respect thoughit is inadvisable to take large quantities of them except with food as there is reason to believe that distilled water may have injurious effects in the stomach and lead to nausea by destroying its surface epitheliumsee food and dietetics by robert hutchi son mdnaturl venss artiticira watbnsit has been authoritatively stated that naterl mineral waters are in every way prefer able to the artificial there appear to be at least three reasons for tlis conclusion in the first place the natural waters contain no excess of gas and such as they do contain seems to be held in solution in the form of a loose compound the result is that the natural waters give off their gas at a slower and more even rate than the artificial waters and retain a proportion of their gas for a longer time there is consequently less likelihood of sudden distension of the stomach in the case of natural waters than of artificial with regard to the chemical contents it appears to be impossible to reproduce precisely by artificial means any given natural water hiowever careful be the analysis of the latters ssline constituents many of the natural waters contain but the merest traces of a great number of salts and it is impossible to say with any degree of cor tainty in what manner the precise proportion of these salts ultimately determines the physi ological character of the particular waterit is claimed for some natural springs that their waters are radioactive and thus possessed of peculiar healing properties but it is as yet too early to assign to any observed radioactive emanation any specific action whether it be healthful or othernwise the emanation if present at all is present only in the minutest imaginable traces nevertheless there is evi dence at all events to prove that emanatioa are considered desirable since water can now be obtained which has been artificially rendered radioactive
