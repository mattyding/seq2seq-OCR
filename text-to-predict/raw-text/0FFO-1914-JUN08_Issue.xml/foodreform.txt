food reform a balanced ieatless dietthe march of civilization has brought with it countless improvements in the matter of food whether in regard to variety suppliesor methods of preparation and yet in this supposedly enlightened age the battlecry of the food reformer is louder and more persistent than ever beforefoodreform organizations increase in nuam ber while numerically their patrons and sup porters grow in increasing ratio the time has long since passed when the food reformer was universally regarded as a crank true there are many who still hold that opinion but investigation frequently shows that these in comparison with the reformers have made a very cursory study of the all important question of foodthe aboition of mjeata knowledge of some of the people in clu ed in the ranks of the foodreform movement leads to the conviction that there must he something in it the average man in the street has weird fancies as to what food reformers eat it would probably come as a surprise to him to learn that many articles included in his diet are also included in that of the food reformer that surprise would merely mark the beginning of his disillusionment what the foodreform movenment stands for primnarily is the abolition of all meat aa anarticle of food the food reforrner however docs not stop here for meat he substitutes variotus forlms of food which aro equally or in sonie cases more beneticial in tho matter of body building indeed the proteid qualities of niany of the foods used by the reformers cannot be too hiizhly emphasizedas an illustration of how broadminded are some of the best missionaries  of food reform a recent remark by one of thein may be quoted  even food reform he saicl does not bind anyone to a fixed diet different food basos sulit different people and the same people at dilferent tirnes in other words exvery one niust judge for himself though speciall v written in the cause of food reform tlie following quiotation applies almnost equally wvell to those who eat meat he or they wvho can convince the messes of the people that their food is unwisely chosen and eaten in profound ignorance of all the laws governing alimlentation would confer on

instanees the direct result of flesh eating and also that consumption is frequently caused bv eatin the meat of tuberculous cattle one mediel authority has gone so far as to declare bluntlv that flesh eating as a habit is followed by indigestion as a result and by selfdrugginig as a vice and then by appendicitis as a penalty leaving out of eionsideration the question of the actual slaughtering of animals which is perhaps sometimes indulv pressed food re formers have veighty evidence on their sidethat the value of butclhers meat is nothing more than a tradition is an indictmrent frequtentlv emntploy ed by food reformners it is true that the majority of people are brought up in tile belief that what is set before them is the best kind of foodl for their neleds and feeling assured that their natural guarians know wvhat they are about they the younger generaticn accept that belief and pass it on  moeover food reformers contend that meat eatilg in volves the eating of so many other things and an altogether uninecessary quantity of soine of these further while they are not all advocates of temperance they declare that meat eating increases the craving for alcoholic beverages and that the food they eat has the reverse effectth cf food basesas has been nmentioned already there is no standard food for those of the reform movement perhaps the bcst general description of what they advocate is a balanced meatless diet the ardent foodl reformer is emphatic as to the necessity of balance in cliet a summalry of his food bases may be given as ceelals nuts fruits vegetables and green salad stuff pulses peas beans and lentils eggs cheeses and milk there are food reformers who advocate all and others who commlnend only a proportion of these generally speakingg howvever the summary covers tho food bases advocatcd by the leading authorities and organizations it is specially noteworthy tlht tile majority are wellknown body building bases to enter into a review of the miost advanced idleas is impossible in this article as illustrations of these idcas however ilhere might be mentioned those of one food eformner of note viwo believes that the day is eominig wen by the aid of science all milk supplies wvill reach the large cities and towns in a dried forra other reformers declare that itl the future there will be no necessity for cows mlilk others go farther and claim that tile milk belong to the calf only and still others look upon the liquid as an overestinated fuoec and too dangerous for general usehousewives ayd a meattess dietthe food reformer recognizes the difficulties he does not regard thein as suchthat the average housewifo wouild encounter were she to adopt a meatless cliet for her household that is not till he wotuld discuss wvith her in all probability he would offend her very much by imparting the information that at present she puts much that is valuable in many things she cooks such as vegetables down the sink  ith tis coinexion tilre comes to mind the story of the englishman who had been to paris and wlho on his rettirn told his wvife witil eident disgust that lie had seen a frenchwoman after cooking vegetables pour off some of tho water in which they had been cooked and save it as stock for next days soupif anyone has the impression that by the exclusion of meat the menu must be a very limited one a visit to any of the wellknown restaurants where no meat is tused wvill quickly alter that impression indeed many of these restaurants can show a much more varied menu tlhan the average restaurant where meat in various forius constitutes an important itzm hotrs lnevres soups entres and savouries vegetables swveets and stewed fruit chccse salads and cold dishes dessert that is a fair sample of what the non meat eater can ehoose from his drinkls vary very little from those of the average meat eater except that alcohol in any form seldom ligures on the list that the meals obtainable at a foodreform restaurant are no satisfyingto use the word in the sense that the majority of people use itis a fallacy long since exploded these meals are decidedly sustaining both for brain and manual workers and they can satisfy all physical requirements without producing that heavy feeling that meat eating often produces in various branches of the athletic world and especially those demanding great physical endurance will be found many men of note who live on abalanced meatless dietvalue op vegetablels aid saladstrho danger of uricacid or purins is too well known to requirc lengthy comment and yet how few people know that green vegetables and salads possess the oualities which best counteract acidity  the man who grows a plentiful supply of these for his own use is really also grow ing his own medicine there is intthis country a great need for more green stuffs the land is there and the occupiers only need instruction if we would but take a leaf out of the united states book in this respect the need would soon be remediedopponents of the movement have said that the average british navvy could not exist withotit meat and food reformers are just as enmphatic that he could many farm servants in country districts have very little meat in their diet buit they are none the less physically ahead of town workers the british soldier has tried a meatless diet and been fit and well on it therefore it is safeto say that were the real facts known to them thousands more would join the ranks of the food reformers
