eggs and poultry production in the united kingdom growintg foreign demand necessity of bicreasing home suppliesdevelopment of the food resources of our own cotuntry should be our first and foremost objective in so far as eggs and poultry are concerned considerable though the advance has been within recent years consumption has grown to a much greater extent in the sbsenee of official figures as to british and irish production below are careful estimates as to the values of native supplies iax the years  and  respectively the former year being chosen as the closing period of last century together with imports from other countriesof the increases shown above abfout  per cent represent advanced values in themselves proofs of greater demand what is evident is that the enhanced home production has failed to meet the requirements of our population ini  s si per cent of the total values of eggs and poultry consumed were of native production and in  the proportion was  per cent it is necessary to mention that the abovo are wholesale values and that in  the actual sale value inclusive of profits snd expenses of distribution of such as were not constmcd by producers would be at least  millions sterlingdemiand fob eggsan increase in one branch of rural industriv equal to  per aninm may be regarded as a satisfactory beginning we have nowv to see how far it is capable of extension ihat is specially important in view of two suipreme factorsnamely that germany is com peting with great britain for supplies of eggs in auistriahungary holland italy and russia and has already affected tho volume of trade with thret of the countries named also that the united states will prob ably becorecl a largel buyer of eggs in uropean producing countries these two great peoples numbering upwards of  mnillions could absorb lcontinental supplies witlhout any difficulty wve should then have to depend upon our own resources or prices would rise to a prohibitive point tho e british colonies havo showvn that they can onlv provide for their own needsthe last census returns available in relation to poultrv for great britain were taken in i  and those for ireland in  the fouowing figures are derived from thesentumbe op adrltr fowls tx xfd kixngdoorengland       wales      scotland      ireland     total   in addition to the above there wvere  adult ducks s geese and  turkeys i in the four cotntries as a goose or a turkey is equivalent to five fowls or ducks in respectto the amount of land occupied if all are corrected to the fowl standard the adult poultry population upoii the farms of the united kingdom per  acres of cultivated land was as followsthese figures indicate that in england and wvales there is a fraction under twothirds of a hen per acre of cultivated land that in scotland there is a little more than half a hen oni the same area and that in ireland the pro portion is one and oneseventh hen per acre it will be seen therefore that in ireland there is not far from twice the proportion in great britain and that pro rata to her area ireland has made the greater progress one county monaglhan has nearly  poultry per  acres and  others are above the average of the wvhole countryinadequate svprlisthe relationship of the number of consmuners to that of the adult poultry supplying them with eggs and flesh is an important considera tion on this basis it is interesting to note that on the farms of the country there is only  fowl a fraction under half a hen per unit of the population in england in wales  a fraction over a third of a hen ir scotland   slightly over half a hen and in ireland  hens say i per unit of population the average for the entire kingdom is  hen per unit that is to say  fowls for every  inhabitants of these islands ireland is an exporting country while england is not upon the present basis it is impossible for the present poultry population to supply the needs of our people even if we add the large number kept by householders and occupiers of less than an acre of land which is not included in the british figuresihe average consumption of eggs in the united kvingdom is estimated at  per unit per annum of which  are produced at home and  are importedwnhat is mainly wanted therefore is an increase in the producing factor that may be arrived at in two waysnamely by greater output on the part of each individual hen or by increasing their number something has been done in the former direction and the possibilities are regarded as considerable but the realization cannot be rapid what should be attempted is to add to the stock of poultry in that direction the capacity of the land must be considered it is generally accepted that upon the farms of the country three fowls or their equivalent could be maintained per acre of cultivated land without interference with any crop or displacement of any other stock one irish county has already exceeded i fowls per acre three fowls per acre may therefore be regarded as the standard capacity of the country and within the range of its possibilities on that basis the poultry popu lation might be as expressed in fowls com pared with what is now the case as undermoportance of britisih developmentit is evident therefore that the united kingdom could produce all the eggs and poultry required without difficulty the value of inmported supplies in  was  of native produce  if the present poultry populationi were doubled which inritain could be accomplished in two years there would be an abundant supply and nmillion pounds sterling added to thel production of the country annuallyfor the development of this mine of un realized treasure efforts must be put forth in twvo directions first the standard of quality in homo produce mutst be raised pro ducers in the british isles have the best marlets in the world at their doors secondly there should be a determined and sustained attempt on the part of central and local authori ties of colleges and county education com mittees to promote and develop the industry on practical and scientific lines in which respect somo of these bodies have been lamentably supine probably because they did not realize the importance of the subject for every  expended upon poultry annually in the united kingdom there is pro bablv not more than s sd spent on education in and promotion of the poultry industry
