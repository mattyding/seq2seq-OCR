mir arthur morton grenfell on the subjectthe suspension announcements follow tho trouble in the city some few weeks ago when what was understood to be the accotnt of ir arthur grenfell was taken over by a few leading city firms in order to avoid liquidation of too drastic a nature serious trouble on the stock exchange was thus averted at the timechaplin milne grenfell and co is practically a private companv which had been in existence in one form or another for half a century its present directors are messrs ernest chaplin george grinnelliilne r w skipworth eric chaplin and douglas grinnellmilne mir arthur grenfell was recontly on the board but some time after the recent trouble messrs chaplin milne grenfell and co publicly announced that he had ceased to be a director as from februaryl the canadian agency is a privatelyowned company in which mr arthur grenfell the chairman has by far the largest interest it acts as an issuing and financial house for canadian and other securitiestr grenfells statementorigin of the troublemfr arthur grenfell at his house at roe hampton yesterday made a personal statement on the position to a representative of the timeshe said that the suspension of chaplin milne grenfell and co was quite independent of tho troubles of a few weeks ago in connexion with the canadian agency accountor it was at all events only indirectly connected the suspen sion of what after all was only a small busi ness was in his opinion brought about by ad verse rumourscutadala boapd pon gband tunxmr grenfell desired to state omphatically that tho trouble in the case of his canadian agency wlhich had been sottled somo weeks ago had not arisen from any mera speculative campaign the stocks in question were mainly those of the grand trunk railway and of the lake superior corporation in the case of the grand trumk railway the aid of the canadian agency had been sought to the mvovment for the establishment of a board in canada without any hostility to the london board in tho case of the lake superior corporationi their aid had been asked to reform its affairs and as a matter of fact they had brought it from a state approxi mating failure into a great and prosperous busi ness it was necessary in the course of initiat ing these reforms to control a considerable arnount of stock the stock was secured and soon afterwards he mr grenfell met witlh a serious riding accident which incapacitated him for business for about fotur months the balkan war broke out and prices of all securi ties and especially of canadian including grand trunk and lake superior stocks came down thus mr grenfell explained the losses had been incurred not by speculation but by an attempt to carry out a definite policyin speaking of these commitments on grand trunk and lake superior stocks which wore taken over a month ago mr grenfell referred to them as commitments of the canadian agency on it being put to himn that at the time they were generally regarded as his personal commitments he explained that he vas acting for the canadian agency that the profits would have gone to them and to him as the largest shareholder of the canadian agency he in fact was the canadian agenevir grenfell said he really know very little of the affairs of messrs chlaplin milne grenfoll and co whose business he thought was small ile had not taken any activo part in the company for five or six years although in accordance with the notification issued by the company his directorship did not cease until february lastthe news ir grenfell continued was received quietly and nio serious trouble wvas to be apprehended as the result of the failures as the liabilities of both companies are mainly to largo financial houses wlho are well able to protect themselves indeed it had generally beon known in the city for some time past that both houses were in difficulties so that the newvs did not cause muclh surprisecanadiax agrcy and stoci excgangenone of tho share capital of the canadian agency amounting to ooooo was held by the public and as to the liabilities as he had said they were due to banks and other companies so that the general public was not likely to be affected tho agency was largely interested in the grand trunk railway and its difficulties had been largely due to the great depreciation in the compdnys securities against which considerable loans had at one time been obtained these were the accounts however that had been taken over some time since by strong groups and no open position on the stock exchange now existed in these grand trunk or in any other securities it had been suggested that the recent settlement of these accounts might be affected by the developments but suich was not the case the position was definitely taken overand there was no fear of any further traluble on that account or in any otlher way as a result of the failures it is unfortunate said mr gronfell in conclusion  that the canadian agency should have been brought down at the present juncture it has been prominently connected with canadian finance and many successful enter prises in canada have been financed by the agency neggotiations were well advanced last week for a settlement of the outstanding claims and it is to be hoped that some scheme maybe found praeticable for rehabilitating these companies and so saving the valuable organiza tion which has been built up wfe mean if we can to keep the flag flyingparticulars of the suspensions and of the two companies concerned are given in the city section onpagek
