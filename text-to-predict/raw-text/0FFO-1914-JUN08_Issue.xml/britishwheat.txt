british wheat   ifproved methods of cultivation increased hotie supplyby rowland h biffenma piofzssorof agaigulturnal botay cambridge uliversrryalthough the present position of the wheat market is not friom the farmers point of view altogether satisfactory signs are not wanting that prices nill gradually improve and that wheat will once again take up the important position it held a generation ago it is unlikely that prices will ever reach the high figures of half a century ago the cheap ness of ocean freights has done away with this possibility but one can apparently fairly expect prices to rise to about s the quarter whatever the figures which will be reached before the end of another generation may be we are certain now that the days of overcheap wheat aro passing it is impossible for such a combination of circumstances as occurred in the nineties when wheat dropped to s a quarter to appear againrises in primprices though still fluctuating considerably show on the wvhole a tendency to rise and we may now reasonably hope to see the home wheat area beginning to expand againthe invasion of our markets by foreign wheats has had another important effect on the prices of the homegrown product many of the foreign sorts more particularly those shipped from caniada under the nanae of manitoba hards were found to produce especially light wellpiled loaves such bread quickly became popular in this country and it has practically displaced the heavier kinid with which one had to be content a generation ago xowadays it would be folly for a baker who valued his trade to attempt to ue flour made from english w heats alonetie facton of strencgtin any attemlpts to make the cultivation of wheat more general in this country this factor of strength has to be taken into account if it is possible to grow heavy croks of the finest possiblo quality it is obvious y more profitablo thain growing crops the quality of wvhich has to be raised by the expensive process of blendingthe gencrally accepted opinion hitherto has been that it is impossible to grow strong wheat in this country though when reasons are souht for they amount to little more than vzague generalizations on the supposed ill effects ot our ciimate on tho quality of the grain or again on the peculiar virtues of virgin soils in producting  strengtli to a cortain extenit these vienws are correct for many if not the majority of strong wheats deteriorate hopelessly under our conditions and give grain little if at all better in quality than that of englisi varieties this however is not true of all of them and after repeated tests of many varicties a few have been found which consistently produce strong grain under our climatic conditioiis one oi the best of these is red fife the wheat wlich forms the basis of the celebrated manitoba lards this variety apparently undergoes no deterioration when grown here ihe statement can be rnade with a considerable degree of confidenee for it has been grovwin here for sonme  seasons and in spite of a certain amount of admixture with other varieties the grain when milled and baked is verv littlo inferior to firstclass canadian samples the qualitv it is true varies a little from season to season and it varies some what with thie soils oni winch it is grown but given proper harvest conditions even the worst sample of red fife is far and away superior in qualitv to the best of the ordinary engrlish varieties the natural inference is that this variety will steadiiy drive other sorts out of cultivation sinee its grain is worth an extra  or  per cent per quarter this has to a certain extent happened in some parts of the country but on the whole red fife is too erratic in its cropping capacity to be relied upon the yield is often too small for fair profits to be made and its survival for so long a period lhas been largely duo to tne fact that it is an excellent variety for late sowingbuliixo ui parireties of wheatif strong wheats are to replace the varieties we now cultivate heavier yielding kinds than red fife will either have to be found or built up to suit our special requirements the world has been ransacked to find such varieties with such meagre results that one now despairs of finding suzch sorts ready made efforts are consequently being directed to building up suitable varieties the methods used are dependent entirely on crossbreeding since it is now becoming evident that no process of selection is likely to bring about the desired result the solving of the problem depends upon the possibility of two distinct features strength  and heavy yielding capacity being inherited and the possibility of combining these in a new variety a series of experiments far too lengthy and complox to be describedhere has shown that  strength is inheritable in its full intensity if for instance a wheat of known strength is crossed with one of our weak english wheats amongst the descendants of the hybrid plants are individuals showing the full strength of the strong parent further these individuals can be fixed as definitely as the oldest wheats in cultivation propagated year by year and retain their strength appa rently indefinitely writh regard to the second portion of the problemnamely the inheritance of yielding capacitylittle is known at present this is due solely to the fact that no inspection of single plants gtives any criterion of the amount an acre of them would yield at harvest time further it is impracticable to grow any large numbers of them on a sufficiently large scale to test their yielding capacities in spite of our ignorance of details however there is evidence to show that this feature is inherited this rests on tho fact that several hybrids have beeni raised between the lowyielding red fife and highyielding sorts such as square heads master and browick wheat which possess the yielding capacity of the english parent these hybrids still have to be grown on the commercial scale the results for the timie being being purely experimental in practice however the wheat known as bsurgoynes fife is found to give yields similar to that of its english parent rough chaff and not the smaller yields of red fifelqcrasng ymtdthe present position then is that our english varieties will provide one componentnamely tho yielding capacity of the new hybrid races of wheat we assume that this feature will be inherited to the same degree as it exists in the parent and consequently crossbreeding does not at first sight offer any possibilities of still further increasing the weight of grain produced per acre if ene of the parents is square heads master for irnstance the most we can anticipate is a crop of the same order of yield as square heads mastertihe farmer however always demands heavier and heavier crops wo know so little with regard to the factors determining yield that the problem of increasing it seems almost hopeless perhaps the simplest method of attacking it at present is the indirect one of saving the losses caused year by year by the attacks of variotus parasites it is difficult to express these losses in figures though we know they are considerable probably they are rarely below per cent and in some seasons they certainly rise to well over  per cent the heaviest of thom are due to the attacks of yellow rust a fungus closely related to the black rust which occasionally causes huge losses to the wheat growers of canada and australia and in some parts of the world makes the cultivation of the crop impracticable certain varieties of wheat have been found which escape yellow rust even when growna under conditions peculiarly favourable to the parasite unfortunately they arel useless for general cultivation in this country but by crossing them it has been found that the feature of immunity is heritable and improved races of nonyellowrusting wheats have been built up these after thoroughly critical test iiig have been found to produce lar ger crops than either of the parents for example square heads master heavy crop but rust susceptible crossed by club light crop but rustresisting gave little joss a heavy yield ing rustresisting wheat this has yielded on the average more than  per cent greater crops than its parent square hleads masterrbsrtvs proansingthe results described show that in practice it ha proved possible to add something to the quality and yield of the wheats grown here the experirental result are stiil more pro misiag and we can reasonably expect especi ally now that the rate of consumption is agaia catching up the supply that increasing profits will lead to an increase in our english wheat area anyone famiiliar with the vagaries of the worlds wheat crops will hesitate before attempting to forecast what this increase will amount to such uncertain factors as improve ments in yield through better cultivation the possibiity of extending the known wheat area the diminishing fertility of prairie lands the increased use of wheat by nations who do not at present use it as a foodstuff all have to be considered the data for the purpose are uitterly inadequlato we can only recognize that these and many other factors as well are closely connected with the increase of ourhome wheat supply and leave it to the plant i breeders to add to the value of the crop per acre by improving the varieties now grown
