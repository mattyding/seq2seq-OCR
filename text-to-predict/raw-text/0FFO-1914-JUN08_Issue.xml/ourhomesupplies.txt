otr home supplies how they benefit the railwaysspeaking generally the interest of a rail way company in food production and food distribution is twofold in tho first place the company wants to get traffic and in the second place the average railway company is concerned to a greater degree in the transport of home produce than it is in that of foreign produceas a mnatter of policy therefore railway comnpanies which encourage foreign imports in the interosts of traffie should be no less and even still more eager to encourage the growing of food supplies at homeit may be of interest to give a few examples of what has already been done by british railways to afford the same opportunities here for the transport of early products from south to north as are taken so much advan tage of in france and italy and also to assist in the development of districts possessing special advantages in the way of production the result in each case being to increase the food supplies of the countrytre cornish rivienathe fact that the broccoli seasonx in corn wall begins in docember or january long befoie the crops in the miidiands and still more those in the north of england and in scotland are ready has given a great impetus to broccoli production over an area extending for a distance of about  miles between lizard point and lands endthe industry was begun even before the railway reached penzance in those days  the growers carted broccoli to hayle sent it thence by boat to bristol and so on to london the eagerness of the london dealers to get the broccoli and the increase of transport facilities on the extension of the railway to penzanco combined to give much encourage ment to the business which has since expanded to such an extent that in the season of  the consignments of broccoli by the great western railway company reached a record total of  tons since then owing partly to foreign competition and partly to the abundant supplies of other vegetables on the market the production has declined the total for  being  tons of this quantity  tons were consigned to london the remainder being widely distributed through out england wales and scotlandan average of six special broccoli trains a day will be despatched from west cornwall stations in the season though as many as  specials in a day have been forwarded when the crop has been particularlv heavy the loading of the trucks begins at  pm and finishes at midnight complete trains of broccoli are run as far as creve where they split up loaded trucks being then attached to ordinary goods

glasgow c on the morning of the third daythe cornish broccoli season including the late as well as the early varieties lasts until about the end of march cabbages are cut from about the middle of march to the end of april the lifting of new potatoes begins early in may and continues until the end of june and the cauliflower season starts in october or november and lasts until about the end of the yearthe sussex rivmeauhile the cornish riviera raises its crops in the open the sussex riviera devotes itself mainly to production under glass and it has done so with such enterprise and success that from worthing the headquarters of the in dustry the productive area stretches out in either direction for a total length of about i  miles along a sunny coastline specially favoiurable for the

duction of early strawberries of an exceptional quality pioneered by a tinker who had grown a few strawberries near his cottage and had discovered thereby the virtues of the soil the industry is today spread over an area of about  square miles with swariwick as the capjital of strawberry land while the total weight of the fruit carried from the district in  by the london and southwestern railway company was no less than approxi mately  tons during the height of the season  special trains loaded up with straw berries only were dispatched daily from the district while the traffic to london is con siderable through trucks are transferred at various junctions to the lines of other com panies for such deestinations as birmingham sheffield manchester liverpool york new castleontyne carlisle glasgow and fdin burgh the bulk of the traffic is dealt with in the fortnight or three weeks which generally constitute the height of a very short seasonabout  vans are in continuous use during this period for the transport of the fruit and these vans all have to be specially prepared in order that the maimumn advantage can be taken of the space they afford tho strawberries are consigned in small chip baskets which have cross handles such baskets are a convenient unit for sale on the market and for customers to carry home but they are an inconvenient unit for the railway cempany since they cannot be piled up in the wagon on top of one another while each basket that goes to make up a big tonnage must be handled separatelythe plan adopted is to fit up each van with movable wire shelves so arranged that the whole of tho available space from the bottom to the top is used without any risk of the fruit being daaeat the end of the season thesewire snelves are removed and stored until the following year the fitting up the taking down and the storing of the shelves alone occasion a good deal of labour but as will be readily imagined there is much more involved in load ing up day by day

increasedrmlutr fmr blagowrmuclimate and soil in the blairgowrie district of perthshire are especially favourable to the production of raspberries the cultivation of which is carried on mainly by smallholders wvhose average holding is about five acres with i range of from two acres to  acres raspberries have been grown in the district for the last  vears or more but the great development in the industry has been brought about within the last  years or so among the reasons for this advance are  the in dividual attention which the smallholders can give to the growing of the fruit   their formation of a cooperative societv for direct sale which has enabled them to obtain better prices  the growing taste of the british public both for fruit and for jam and  the practical encouragement given to the industry by the caledonian railway companyunder these combined influences the growth of the industry has been most remarkable in  the area devoted to fruit in the district was about

farmers at girvan who lad found that their soil was well adapted to tho growin of now potatoes approached the glasgow and bouthwestern railway companyith a request ior a reduced rate to glasgow they thought thatb if a reduction weore granted they could work up a good business the com pany reduced the rate from s d per ton to s per ton and the businmess began to develop with remarkable rapidity subsequently the rate to glasgow was further reduced first to gs d and then to s d the company also undertook to carry stable manure from glasgow into the potatogrowing district at the nominal rate of s per tontodcay the district covers a considerable area with west kilbride monkton and girvan bs the principal sending stations the potatoes are despatched in large quantities not only to glasgow but

attained in  when the total was  tonsfrom the foregoing instances it is clear that in crrying bcme grown produce the railway companies gainm in the transport of the food supplies and  in the growtth of the population the needs and the prosperity of the producing areas wherea s in carrying foreign produce they would gain the first ad vantage only one thus sees the real com mtnity of interests which should exist between british railways and british growers while there is tho greater need for recognizing this faet becaiusn of the oxtreme desirability of every possible effort being made to decrease our dependence on foreign food supplies and to devolop still more of suieh prodcuctive areas at home as thoso here in qustion
