whitebait dinners memories of the old ship at greenwichcabinet ministers no longer celebrate the close of the parliamentary session by par taking of a whitebait dinner at the old ship or trafalgar at greenwich nor is it any longer possible to eat whitebait which has been netted in local reaches of the thames the fish served to modern diners at the ship are bought in billingsgate market the old days are dead both political parties are to blame for the dis continuance of a custom which dates from the days when pitt was prime minister occasion ally there was a break in the sequence of the annual functions and indeed after the year  therewas so long a lapse in the visit of ministers to the ship that it might have been inagined that the custom had been definitely abathdoned mr gladstone apparently frowned on such frivolities and they made no appeal either to lord salisburv or to that long tenant of the treasury bench mr balfour the only prime minister who in modern days had the courage to revive the old custom was lofd rosebery who in the year  sailed from westminster pier in the foam accom panied by many of his codeagues in the liberal administration outward bound for green wich that was the last time his majestys ministers gathered around the festive board at the shipthat ancient hostelry which is an admiralty structure dating from the middle of the th century has lost much of its former glory the garden approach from the river is now given up to more utilitarian purposes some of the fine rooms too are gone the best of them the trafalgar room has been demolished to give place to a row of unpretentious cottages but the eiardwick the nelson the bellot and the apollo remain the ship was itself the successor of a much older house built on a site within the grounds of the royal naval college and the original ship was intended as an adjunct to an old inn the crown and sceptro which belonged to the mr quartermaine who was closely associated with the palmy days of the shiprseal fise dmqmmsthe older ship is known to have been in existence in the early part of the th century and another greenwich inn famous for white bait was the greyhound in those days and for long years after greenwich was a fashionable marine resort and a visit to this famous riverside town to eat a whitebait dinner was a favourite expedition with those attached to the court even in the closing days of the th century it was still the fashion to drive down by fourinhand to greenwich and to dine off whitebait at the ship lord rose berys dinner was given when the custom of going to greenwich had begun to flagit was a real fish menu which was placed before the cabinet ministers when they went to greenwich and dined in one of the fine old rooms lighted with massive chandeliers

redbait blackbait a la diable or in other forms was the principal fish serveda living link with the past is preserved at the ship in the person of the caef to whom for long years has been enitrusted the task of preparing the whitebait for the guests of this riverside hotel visitors to england still come to dine in the rooms full of the memories of pitt and fox and the long line of their successors during the  months from december to september when whitebait is in season the outlook from the windows of the ship on to the grounds of the royal naval college has been preserved and there

before the correct answer is obtained to those engaged in the business the question is an important one the trade in canned sardines is of considerable magnitude the feature during recent years being the increase of norwegian imports into the united kingdom these having risen in value from a total of  in  to  in  the last year for which complete statistics are available portugal ranks second in
