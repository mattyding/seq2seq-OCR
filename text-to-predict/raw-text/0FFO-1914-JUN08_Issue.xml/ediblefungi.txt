edible fungi mrusirooms ohmpignons and trufflesa world in which the vegetation was of a different colour from the soothing green to which we are aecustomed would bo a trying place purple grass red trees and yellow hedges for instance would be to say the least somewhat tiring to the eye fortu nately we are spared the contemplation of so objectionable a state of affairs by the simple circumstance that without the universal green which naturo has lavished around us human and indeed animal life would be an impossi bility for it is by virtue of the chemical properties of the green substance known to botanists as chlorophyll that the plant is enabled to obtain its supplies of carbon from the atmosphere and so build up the large supplies of starchy or carbonaceous material which forms so large a portion of its bulk animals are unable to obtain carbon in this way and so perforce must prey either on plants or gn other animals if they vould live certain demoralized plants would seem almost to have taken a hint from the ways of the animal world and having lost their own supplies of chlorophyll have turned around and proceeded to live as parasites upon their green brethrenthese plants which include the edible mush rooms and truffles as well as many highly poisonous and even putrid and repulsive formns are known to the naturalist as fungi they are characterized by their loss of power to assimilate atmospheric carbon and so aro found only in association wvith organic matter animal or vegetable living or dead some dwell in the hollows of dead trees which thev speedily reduce to a decayinc mass others fasten upon tho living wood others again woould seem to hunt for the carcasses of dead animals and hasten to the spotwith mushroomlike rapidityas inevitably and almost as swiftly as carrion crowsas aaticles o foodmany of the fungia great manymore in fact than ever come to marketare highly appetizing articles of food those which are commonly eaten in this country include the edible mushroom both cultivated and gathered wild and occasionally the champignon or ring mushroomrepresentatives of the familv living above groundand various species of the trufflo which grow beneath the surface of the soilthe true mushroom grows in open breezy pastures generallv in places where the grass is kept slhort by sheep and cattle it never occurs in bogs or woods or oll the stumps of trees the season lasts from julv to october and during this time a great number aro gatherod in country districts and sent in to market another species frequently marketed is the horse mushroom whichl is larger coarser and not so wvholesome the part of the mushroom which appears above ground is the stallk bearing the cap or fructification the gills of the cap are covered with small brownblack spores from which the funguls is reproduced the spores borne bv the air fall upon manure or decaying substances and on germination give rise to a white felted fungoid growth the mycelium or  spawn  of musluioom cuti vatorsmusiroom cultivationthe cultivated mushroom is probably a distinct species it is grown largely in the neighbourhood of the big towns in hotbeds and dark sheds tlhe mushroom beds are composed of layers of manure and earth in which tho heat generated by fermentation is kept in by a covering of straw or matting iiito this thc spawin is introduced and the mushrooms make their appearance in the course of about a month they are gathered fresh in the  button  form not being allowed to expand it is not unusual for a big suburban grower to send in a cartload of a thousand or more pounds of mushrooms to covent garden of a morning the season lasts from october to june covering the period when the wild article is not availablein paris mushrooms are grown in enormous quantities in dark underground cellars at a depth of from ft to ft from the surface the galleries often extending over miles this method is a more scientific one than that obtaining in this country as equable tempera ture and freedom from draughts are assured a large amount is exported all over europe on tho continent generally many more varieties of fungus axe eaten in spite of this mistakes are seldom made and cases of poisoning arevery rare in russia japan and elsewherei great quantities of edible fungi are dried and sold in that state japan exports great quantities of mushrooms to chinatue chauriagxothmo mushroom has an important place in folklore fairies frequently sit enthlroned on the mushroom cap and the little peoplo have a knack of hiding bellind their stalks it is well known that the fairy rings ascribed by men of science to the growth of the little cham pignon are in reality the places where the fairies hold their midnight dances tho dryasdust explanation of this phenomenon is that the champignon fructifies round the edlge of the circular underground myelium and that this ring decaying manures the soil with the rich nitrogenous substances of the mushroom and so induces the grassy fairy ring amidst the surrounding short pasture the champignon is better known in france and italy than in england it is admittedly a much more delicate and appetizing morsel than the ordinary mush room and unlike the latter can be dried and kept for years withouit detracting from its flavour several varieties have a strong taste of garlic and are largely esteemed abroad preserves of mushrooms also take the form ofketchup or catsup said to be derived from a  chinese word meaning brine of pickled fish though shellfish cucumbers tomatoes and walnuts are the bases of different ketchups the most usual kind is made from mushrooms and other edible fungi saltedsome fungi notably two species of the genus coprinus are already much used in the prepara tion of ketchup but others such as the morel and st georges mushroom which appear in spring the parasol mushroom lepiota boletus and some of the bracket fungi should be known for their own peculiar meritsthero is of eourse no roughandready method of distinguishing edible from poisonous fungi but a short study will make ono familiar with the comparatively few dangerous sorts and also with those that are worth eating it is a common fallacy that mushrooms and other fungi are highly nutritive whereas they possess no greater value than ordinary fresh vegetablesteustlsmany spocies of truffle a subterranean fungus shaped liko a small tuber are used for food and are considered great delicacies three different species are characteristic of england france and italy respectively tho french variety is well known as a constituent of pcd de fie gras the italian species which has a strong odour of garlic is highly esteemed in that country whlilo the english truffle frequently found in woods generally in a cal careous soil is occasionally seen in the market it is the least delicate of tho three the odour of truffles is as a rule very strong and unmis takable and for this reason pigs and dogs have long been trained to search for them and dis cover tho places where they grow the french truffle is exported to covent garden market where it fetches a high price from s to s per lb many attempts have been made to cultivate the truffle for market in this country on the lines of mushroom cultivation but without success
