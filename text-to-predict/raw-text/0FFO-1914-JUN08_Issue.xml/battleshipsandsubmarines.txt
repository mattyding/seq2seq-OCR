battlesips and siubmarines a growing controversy ltiytations of tiie new types lord sydenhans viewswo print today a further selection of letters on sir percy scotts declaration that we should ceaso to build more large battleships opinions are widely divorgent some authorities con demn the very discussion of the matter others think that the time is ripe for tho reconsidera tion of the whole field of naval policylord sydenham considers sir percys theory a fantastic dream he points out that aeroplanes would bo useless for scouting and also for assistinig submarines at night or in foggy or stormy weather on the surface he says the submarine is very vulnerable while when she is wholly submerged accurate navigation is difficult and dangerousthe view of mlr john leyland editor of the navy is that we  must hasten slowly on sir percy scotts pathwayin germany little comment has as yet been aroused but the post asks great britain to adopt sir percys view and so to hand over her naval supremacy to germanywe print below the main points in sir percys letter which was published in tus times of fridaythe introduction of the vessels that swim under water has in my opinion entirely done away with the utility of the ships that swim on the top of the waterthe submarine causes to disappear three out of five of the functions defensive and ofecnsive of a vessel of war as no manofwar will dare to come even within sight of a coast that is adequately protected by sub marinesthe fourth function of a battleship is to attack an enemys fleet but there wil be no fleet to attack as it will not be safc for a fleet to put to sealifby submarines we close egress from the north sea and mediterranean it is difcult to see how our commerce can be much interfered withsubmaarines and aeroplanes have entirely revolu tionized naval warfare no fleet can hide itself from the aeroplune eye and the submarine can deliver a deadly attack even in broad daylightnaval officers of the future wilitherefore live either above the sca or under it it will be a navy of youth for we shall require nothing but boldness and daringnot only is the open sea unsafe ith a flotilla of submarines    i would undertake to get    into any harbour and sink or materially damage all the ships in that harbourwhat we require is an enormous fleet of sub marines aiships and aeroplaes and a few fast crossers provided we can find a place to keep them in safety durimg w ar timein my opinion as the motorvehicle has driven the horse from the road so has the submearine driven the battleship from the seathe apotheosis of thesubmarinielord sydenehams viewsto the edtror op the tymessirwe all know admiral sir percy scott as an extremely clever inventor who has rendered great service to the navy by develop ing improved methods of gunnery as an exponent of the higher and nontechnical branches of naval science he has not hitherto been recognized and his somewhat rambling and wholly unconvincing letter will not add to his reputation as a naval authority the idea that the automobile torpedo must involve the abolition of the battleship is as old as the invention of that weapon it has been advanced only to be discredited by experience i but it has entailed much waste of money and in the case of france somio dangerous aberra tions of policy the war expezience of the mwhitehead torpedo which is now considerable has been uniformly disappointing in the russojapanese war when the opportunities wore many and apparently favourable and the young japanese officers showed no lack ofi daring the results fell far short of reasonable expectation the torpedo has been improved and the submarine which has no war record has come to stay sir p scotts reassertion of views with which we are familiar appears to be based mainly on impressions denved from all recent naval ranoeuvres which have demonstratedto his satisfactionthatbattleships are of no use either for defensive or ofensive purposes now that our naval manosvres are treated as secret it is inevitable that false conclusions should be drawn from them if however the performances of the submarines were examined in detail by any competent and impartial naval critic i imagine that they would be heavily discounted in any case deductions from mancsuvres whieh cannot reproduce anl the conditions of naval war must be received with the greatest caution for the rest the views of sir p scott depend upon unsutported conjecture quite natural to a mind deeply imbbued with a sense of the perfection of modern mechanical contrivances but dangerous if translated into national policy his letter interests me greatly because it exactlv illutrates the conflict of opinion which may arise between the mechanical engineer and the student of naval varthus the brief and misleading discussion of the question of the defence of our commerce involves obvious confusion of ideas and incon sistenecy the straits of gibraltar being sealed by submarines we are told that turkey greece austria and italy could not get out of the mediterranean to attack our trade  but that trade in the mediterranean itself is very large and as on the submarine hypothesis no surface ship could keep the sea and the sub marine could not repel the submiarine the advantage to be obtained by sealing the straits of gibreltar or doverassuming these oporal tions to be possibleis not apparent sir p scott points out that america could attack our conmmerce but they w ould have a long way to come but elenrly if the allpervading potency of the submarine is admnitted the american attacking ships could not hope to keep the sea he does not appear to have grasped the logical resuilts of his theoriestho futture tactics of the submarines are briefly indicated the flotilla is to be accom panied by scouting aeroplanes always high ul if an enemy is sighted the gong sounds and the leali    will be slipped this is to happen in the open sea and apparently all over the world considering that the aero planes w ill be of no scouting vale at night in thick weather or in a gale and must have a surface shipcertain to be destroyed by the enemys sibmiminesclose at hand if they are employed far from land while the submarines in heavy weatner willhave no speed tlio slipping of the leashmay prove futile the sharp limitations of both aecroplanes and submarines appear to be disregarded and the fact that the former may provo dangerous opponents of the latter is ignored i admit that these limitations may be mitigated in the future but certaia disabilities will always remain and with increase of tonnage the submarine will develop new disadvantages notably in the groater depth of water which will be needed for submerged movementon the surface the submarine is a most inferior destroyer slow supremely vulnerable and unsuitable for long habitation when submerged it can be navigated only by the periscope the idea of whicli i suggested nearly  years ago in this positioin it is not whollv invisible and if caught by a destroyer it would be sent to the bottom on the othier hand in favourablo circumstances it might approach unobserved if wholly sulbmerged and com pletoly secure from attack except possibly by aeroplanes it cannot be navigated with any accuracy and would in confined waters incur the gravest risks the helplessness of the submarino in certain conditions is em phasized by the desire to provide it with a gun armament i agree with  a naval officer  that an attack upon ships lying in a defended harbour wotuld in all probabiiity entail disaster upon the submarine thus the only conditions in vwich it can secure the maximum of advantage is ono in which the use of its only weapon is attended with difficulty tho submarine will undoubtedly impose new risks on the large ships in certain waters and if favoured by chance it will secre occasional successes on the high seas tho chances will be few and submarines will requiro for their existence parent shipswhich on sir p scotts hypothesis must disappear this increase of risk is one of several reasons against concentrat ulg too much naval force in a single vessel tho loss of which would make a heavy deduction from the national strength if the whole question of building policy had beon thorouiglhly thleshed out the dreadnought would never have been constructed and present dimensions wvould never have been reached if sir p scott had pointed this moral i should have agreed with himto assume that while all the trade of the world must continuo to be carried in surface ships of increasing tonnage all naval warfare will be restricted to submarines which cannot effectively fight each other is to my nmind a fantaatic dream at least it is certain that submarines cannot serve all the many purposes for which british naval force is re quired thronahout the world and if thestood alone the recrudescence of piracy might be expected perhaps this is what sir p scott had in mind when ho included in his programmo a few fast cruisers provided we can find a place to keep them in safety during war timei am sir yours obedientlyjune  sydeneiaxmore experibnce neededto the editor op the timessirif sir percy scott has not opened a new vzista in the realm of future naval policy he has at least illuminated one already oponed with a powerful searchlight a combination oe supreme courage and rare caution is requiired in dealing with such a revolution as ho fore shadows many farseeing people have looked in the direction to which the gallant admiral has turned his gaze they have not expected to enlist on their side tho very officer who has been the chief exponent and practitioner of good gunnery it is wvell that the minds of the people should be turned to this complex matter though there is reason to fear that the sugges tions may be seized upon by politicians for their own purposes let it not be forgotten however that what is visionary today may be realized tomorrowsome ideas however fructify slowly as long ago as ls m saint aubin asked the very question which sir percy scott answers so confidently what would become of navies he said and whero would seamen be found to man ships of war whon it was certain that at any moment they might be blown into tho air by means of divingboats against which no human foresight could protect therm  to fultons pleadings napoleon endod by turning a deaf ear now we seem to be on he eve of the full accomplishment of the tlhings of which fulton and his successors have dreamt sub marine vessels have become possessed of quali ties which a decade ago few peoplo foresaw they have seaendurance and range which are still growing with every classyou have shown in the times today that the first lords active mind has become engrossed in the question whlichi sir percy scott has raised he also dwelt upon the subject in his speech at the lord mayors banquet last november when he paid a high and welldeserved tribute to that farseeing sailorstatesman lord fisher who gave us not only the dreadnought but the submarine but the first lord then seasoned his inspiring discourse with a salutary caution hle said the time had not comne for the revolution he dallied with the ultimate decision of naval warfare still rested with battle fleets and squadrons which in numbers and qualities in homogeneity rand organization in weight of metal and good shooting were superior to those to which they were opposed the submarine and its aerial comrade have not yet been tested in war they have hardly as yet been tested in manceuvres we require to know a grcat deal more about them and about the means by which they can be destroyed before we commit ourselves to a revolution in naval policywe may become possessed of what the french rather bitterly remembering their own experience call paussiere navale but we miust not sacrifice our battleships to the creation of this perishablo naval material on a great scalo until we have advanced much farther in our experience whon it seemed to admiral aube and his followers that the day of the flotillas had corne and when m goubet in his tiny submarinethe microbe of the sea navigated below water the flotillas were multiplied and the main elements of naval power vwere noglected the flotillas disappeared and tho fleet sank to impotence it may be that admiral aubo was a precursor of the full day which sir percy scott beholds but w e must bewaro of diverting resources from the great essentials theso essentials may be or may become the submarines but of that we can as yet have no certaintyit must not be supposed by those who see the prospect of large econormies resulting from sir percy scotts proposals that their objects will be attained we cannot build verymany submarines for the cost of a dreadnouglt and inevitably the power of submarines wiu grow with their development will increase their cost and the rivalry and advance step by step will go on wve shau probably roach in course of time a species of submerged battle ship in all tllese changes and in the com plex situation in which the admiralty find themselves wise counsels must prevail thero rnust be the most penetrating vision there must be marshaued the fruit of all experience there must be cautious and tentative develop ment until full assurance has boen gained and then the admiralty may take a bold sweeping and courageous course meantime we must hasten slowly on the pathway along which sir percy scott would lead usi am sir yours faitlfullyjune  joii leylandtorpedoes versus gunhss to me editor of the timessiri was intensely interested by the letter from sir percy scott which i read in tae tirmr of this morning it is i believe the first occasion on which a naval officer of vride experience and scientific attain ment has publicly declared his adhesion to the belief in the efficacy of that new weapon the submrine young brother olez frequtetly tll me tbat thepresent time there is no efficient defence or protection for the larger vesselsthe battleship and the battle cruiseragainst the assault of these novel engines of destruction they quote many experiences when battleships have been struck by the torpedoes of the submrianes dulring emercises and manceuvresit may of couse be said that the attacks which are made on british battleships are those of our own officers and men and i believe that our sub marine corps is second to none in knowledge efficiency and resource but that is no reason why when other powers have largely increased their numbers of submarines they should not also produce a corps equally daring and effective this is what we ought to count upon and wvhether sir percy scott is right or wrong in regard to the question of re placing battleships by submarines there can be no doubt that we should maintaia our superioritv in these scientilic adjuncts of naval warfare at the same time that we endeavour by every means possible to find a reply to themanother point has struck me has the torpedo beaten the gun as the gun itself is said to have beaten the armourplate the submarine lives but a short period of its life under water thero must surely be times when it will find itself as a surface vessel engaged in conflict with other vcssels above water are we to believe that in range and ralpidity of fire the torpedo now excels its rival  iw net it sims likely that in such conditions the wolltried weapon will onec again assert its superiority wve are now apparently confronted with the neces sity of finding a suitable means of defeating this new menace to our supremacy afloat is it too much to expect that sir percy having recognized this will also be able to suggest how it should be met and dealt with i am sir your obedient servantjune  ccaptain rna

subject of much valuable commnent one finds of course naval correspondents of radical newspapers not entirely unsymnpathetic and the big armaments pross highly contemptuous the post tells sir percy scott to press his proposal upon his own country gormany would not indeed followv the british example but she would gratefully inherit the supremacy at sea which would fall to her then without a struggletheoretical battles against bigship policy have been rare of recent years in germany and the controversies in favoir of defence by sub marnes and mines which were led three or four years ago by viceadmiral galster have almost beon foigotten thle discussion for the matter of that was always a domestic one concerning not vwhat was absolutely best or necessary for naval suprenacy but what was tha minirnum for a purely defensive navythe submarine question is always watched very closely here and the semiofficial naval annual nlvauticus every few years contains an exhaustive article in  nauticus while anticipating great improvements said for the present all practical experience goes to show that submarines can plav an effective part only by leaning on the coast they must leave to other classes of ship fartherreaching tasks especially the battle for control of the open sea no navy is thinking of limiting the construction of battleslhips in favour of sub marinesreturning to the subject  months ago fauticus admitted that submarines had ob tained a wider range of action and that technical progress would further improve their capacity to work in the open sea with other arms but it was still insisted that they must always remain a subsidiary aria especially fitted to perform bv day what the destroyer can do by night the mnain criticism of the submarine is its lack of speed it is argued that its torpedo can onlv be fired ahead of the target aimed at and from comparatively close range and that as the submarine has not supffcient speed for manciuvring itself tmder water into favourable positions it must have recourse to its speed on the surfaeo thereby relinquishing its essential merits of invisibility aud slight vulnerability so far from agreeing with sir percy scott that submarines can paralvse the enemys activity nvauticts declares that the employment of submarines on a neighbouring hostile coast is a very diflicult and perhaps an impossible task geiman opinion also believes strongly that in the language of your leading article flying craft maay prove to be as rmuch the submarines enenmy as its friendthe main recca why germany is paying so mnich attention to submarine work is not that she ias the least idea of substituting submarines for anything else but that she considers that superiority in this field will rest not with numbers nor wvith a  start  in construction but with technical and personal efficiencyan american hopermo our owi conimspowndenniew yore jux sir percy scotts letter has been the subject of widespread american comment the even ing
