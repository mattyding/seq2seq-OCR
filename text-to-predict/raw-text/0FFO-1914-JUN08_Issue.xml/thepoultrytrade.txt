the poultry trade statistics relating to importsin  the imports of dead poultry for consumption as food were as follows quanti ties cwt values  average per cwt s d which is a fraction over id per lb these included all classes of poultry but were mainly chickens and turkeys of the total years imports cwt of the declared value of  or in value  per cent were received in the month of decem ber doubtless consisting largely of turkeys as the weights enumerated were inclusive of packages the price per pound would be higher which would also be the case in the irish figures given belowuntil the year  only values of poultry wero given in the trade and navigation re turns in  weights were also recorded the following table supplied by his majestys customs shows imports into the united iking dom from all countiies in  and  to which have been added the average values per cwtthe main sources of supply are russia united states of america fraince and austria hungary of the supplies imported in  these four countries accounted for  per cent of the quantities and  per cent of the values british possessions are almost a negligible factor in this class of foodnamely  per cent of the total quantities and  per cent of the total values in whilst variations have taken place in the values of poultry imported from the different countries during the last  years there has not been any marked advance as in the case of eggs in fact if average prices are calcu lated there has been a decline in the volume of supplies the following table shows the values from  to  as the quantities were not recorded before  from the lead ing countriesthere are three points in the above table which call for mentionapart frozn varia tions which mav be explained by local oircum stances france and italy have apparently made permanent declines the united states wlhich in  had fallen heavily made a huge rise in  and china since  lias become a minor though an appreciable factor her supplies were lowest in average values though in  not so much below russian as might have been expectedas great britain is the great consuming section of the utnited kingdom it is of import ance to note the shipments to britain from ireland in   and  the figures for  are not yet published ireland in each year supplied britain with a greater value of poultry than all the rest of the wvorld combined the following

consumers of eggs and poultry advances in prices have been greater in the republic than with us owing to a phenomenal shortage of supplies in itself the result of an enhanced consumption during november and decem ber last what are known as  nearbv  or hennery eggs corresponding to our new laids increased in values in some of the e astern states to the  cent point that is a ftaction over s per dozen the effect was an abnormal demand upon cold storage eggs which in september were selling at  to  cents per dozen went up to  cents l two shillings per dozen for six months old eggs was a  per cent adce on previous years and a serious fact to householders that represented however a real shortage in the new york cold storage plants there were in november  cases upwards of c millions fewer eggs than in the previous year the same waes true to a much less extent of poultry turkeys of which north america s the original home were scarce and dear at thanksgiving and christmasat the time named the import duties were still in force that is no longer the case probably canada may contribute a little by filling the gap in the areas near the borderline the fact is however canadian demand has outdistanced her own supplies end prices have advanced rapidly though not to the same extent as in the states now the fiscal barriers have been removed unless there is a rapid increase of production canadian pric must riseeuopxn eggs ron aimncaas a consequence american buyers are looking to europe from december to february last  great hundreds of eggs were shipped to american ports

english chickens were bought in london for the states if the average consumption of eggs in the states per head of the population is the same as in britain the  million people there consume about

conditions a silxpenny egg in november is a possibility
