captain cmape injured  blow from a polo stick prospects of te test matchesi our sril co ondnnew yore jun captain cheapo is injured a most un fortunate accident that caused general dismay and may upset all arrangements happened before the close of this evenings practice game on mr john phippss private ground near westbury captain cheape was hit full in the face by a hard backhandor from mr hal phipps whose brother received a similar blow from mir milburn eight days ago fortunately the stick missed captain chenpes eyes but his nose is badly cut and there is a fear that it is broken in an earlier telegram our correspondent saidin discussing the prospects of tuedays international polo match it would be the policy of an astute prophet to declare boldly that all looks fair and bright at present but to hedgo with a mysterious hint that the dark cloud of uncertainty may appear upon the horizon at any moment even now there exists faint uneasiness in the chief council tent of the american polo camp though the cause of it is not generally knownit is this mr j lm waterburys left thumb was injured moro seriously than was at first supposed when the english mare gold leaf mr f m freakes old sylvia dropped dead under him a week ago mr waterbury thouglht that his thumb was only sprained bandaged it and went on playing as it grew more painful instead of getting better in the middle of the week it was submitted to xrays which disclosed a fracture of a smal bone on saturday in the final fast practice game of armericas team mr waterbury was playing with his thumb in a little plaster castthe rival teams compabedmr milburn is hitting as hard as ever but seemns to me to miss strokes occasionallv that ho would invariablv have made in previous years in saturdays practice game against substitutes he pleased the critics by his speed vigour and hitting captain barrett is a different type of no  but i think he will be quite as effective in his play whichi includes much clever dribbling in this captain barrett probably excols mr miilburn also at feeding his forwards in loose skirmishes but of course his hitting up to his no has not the length of mr milburnsbetween the two backs there is not much to choose if captain lockett plays as well as he did a year ago the challengers may have some little advantage ir lawrence waterbury is a polo genius good in any position and he certainly looks fitter than he did in last yearsi internationals but it is my opinion that he will find himself opposed bv a more skilful and more resourceful no i than he has been playing against in practice matches i do not consider that mr alexander brown mr wilson webb mir charles rumsey mr jolum phipps or yir c p beadleston are in the same class as captaia tomkinson as no  judg ing from what little has been seen of lhs form since the arrival of lord wimn bornes party some of his shots at goal at racing speed in last fridays trial game were such as i have nover seen any of the americans i have inentioned accomplish at top speed in good company captain tomkinsons display then and in this evenings game has caused the critics here to sit up and take noticevery con siderable noticebetween the rival no s comparison is dificult for one thing i had never seen captain cheape play in that position until friday and there is also his difficultv in the matter of mounts to be considered however captain cheape is captain cheape when he was here with captain hardress lloyds team in  it struck me he must be about the best no  in the world and i have never had occasion to change that opinionso too with ir monty waterbury thumb or no thumb if his team supports him well and does not give him cause for anxiety during the matches it is safe to predict lie will play remarkable polo on the other liand should the team let him down he will be apt to try to do too muchmar exlpmerrsrll a txmcac sidbto sum up the situation i regard the ameri can team as quite as great an experiment as the british team to be sure america is playing thrce of her renowned  big four and has recruited a fine player but even so it is quite a different team from the  big four  because mr j m waterbury is the only member playing in the same position as in the famous unbeaten team to be sure too they have enjoyed the ad vantage of much practice together as a team yet no close student of polo is sure and they thomselves are not quite sure whether they have ever  found themselves  vetmeanwhile it is my belief that there is a chance of the new american team failing to  make good s chance of an easy british vic tory if on the other hand the defenders play in the best form i have seen them show then tuesdays match should be just as hard fought and desperately exciting as eaeh of its four predecessors
