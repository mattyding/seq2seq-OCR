jamis claims of factorymade article methods of adulterationengland has for long been the chief jam making ecuntry in the world and the jam manu facturer here is one of the few men who does not fear foreign competition in his home market jam as we know it was not made on the conti nent until quite recently but the sugar con vention followed by the abolition of bounties and the cheapening of sugar in the beetgrowing countries has led to the foundation of import ant factories abroad in many cases english jamboilers are employed this country has also supplied the skilled labour and manufacturing plant for our coloniesit is rather curious to note how our jams are restricted to those made from fruits long grown in these islands english fruit so to speak though supplies mav come from all parts of the world oranges and lemons to a small extent have forced an entry but the grape fruit which yields a delicious proserve popular in canada and the ujnited states is here unknown the same may be said of melons in australia innate conservatism may have something to do with this as the loganberry a fine stewing fruit and excellent in the form of jam has no sale as yet on its merits but is sold chiefly in substitution for the raspberryvaries or sugar employedthough the past  years have not materiallv altered the types of fruit available great changes have taken place in our supplies of sugar in the eighties the best white sugar was in the form of lumps  dutch crushed simillar sugar is procurable today but for manufacturing purposes it has been practically superseded by crystals next in merit were various grades of soft sugar known as  pieces whilst dark cane sugars from the west indies were useful for cheaper qualities of jams today dark brown cane sugar is a fancy article often fetching more than its intrinsic value compared with refined sugars either cane or beet the best sugar for the jammnaker is a white crystal sugar free from blue colouring which is frequently added to give sugar a whiter appearance to the eyeglucose a sugar made by the action of an acid on starch in a hot solution is also used in jam and confectionerv invert sugar is simi larly made by the action of an acid on a hot solution of cane or beet sugar invert sugar is naturally produced to some extent in every jam by the fruit acids both glucose and invert sugar are useful for preventing the crystallization of jamsmietrods of boilingall commercial jams are now boiled bv steam in jacketed pans the pan is generally of copper and is set in a castiron jacket the steam is admitted ilto the space between and means taken to get rid of the water of con densation pans are mounted on trunnions so that they can be tilted and the boiling jam poured out into carrying pans whatever jam remains round the inside of the boilingpan is removed by the help of a rubber squeegee some makers prefer small pans turning out about bs of jam at a timethe steam pressure in general use is from b to b lower pressure lengthens the cooking process and darkens the jam at termpts have been made to boil jam in vacuum pans in order to get rapid evaporation at a low temperature conditions which should secure a bright colour in the preserve the probable result judging from analogy with sugarboiling by vacuum would be a very marked loss in flavour boiling by steam does away with the risk of burning as well as the needforconstant stirring when the sugar is dissolved and roughly mixed with the fruit the ebullition completes the process the jam is stirred with large wooden  spaddles to determine the exact time when the jam has been sufficiently boiled is a matter of ex perience and the professional wlho is constantly employed on the work has a great advantage over the amateur who only makes preserves at wide intervals of time in factories the progress of the making is seen bv the way the hot jam drops off the spaddle when the latter is raised out of the boiling liquid or the appear ance of the boiling jam in the pan is the guideas a rough guide it may be stated that the boiling point varies between deg and deg fahrenheit sour orange marma lade need not be taken higher than deg whilst most jams will not be finished below deg here jam has not to be transported but is only taken from the kitchen to the store room boiling might be stopped at a lower temperature but the jam would be liquid and of poor keeping qualityrapid boiling conduces to a brightcoloured jam  so does rapid coolingfactory or hoamemiade jam swhilst it would be too much to claim that commercial jams are invariably better than those made at home it would be safe to affirm that better jam can be and is made in factories than it is possible to make privately in the factory a jamboiler works year in year out under nearly constant conditions whilst the amateur employs her skllu but seldom and has no properlyorganized cooking plant boiling over a fire or gas is an inferior method to the use of steam for two reasons it takes longer or in other words there is more time in which the flavour of the fruit is dissipated in the air and the colour of the jarn even though no actual burning takes place is darker the housekeeper who can pick her fruit in the garden or orchard and straightway preserve it has a slight advantage over the factory in that the fruit is a little fresher but a town dweller buying fruit fromfi a shop will not get it in as good condition as the manufacturer who buys on the market still less when as is very often the case fruit is delivered from the farm right into the factorycrystallization of jamthe science of jammaking is unknown to the amateur and dimly appreciated by many manufacturers if jam crystallizes there must have been something wrong with the sugar if it goes mouldy the fruit was picked oni a wet day jam is liable to crystallize when the two forms of sugars pfesentcrystal and invertare unequally balanced slow boiling gives the acid of the fruit a longer time in which to act upon the crystal sugar and so invert a fair proportion of it but the propor tion as far as the amateur is concerned is always a matter of chance the manufacturer who boils for a shorter time effects the balancing of the two sugars empirically by the addition of invert sugar with starchglucose as an alternativethe amateur might with advantage vary the proportion of fruit to sugar for examplo if strawberry jam is found to crystallize when made of equal parts of fresh fruit and sugar a better result would be obtained by takingb of fruit to b of sugar a jam with good keeping proporties will be found to contain between  and  per cent of sugar the percentage of sugar in the final product is of far greater importance than the auspicious gathering of the fruitflavoua and ingb dieentsthough its colour is a consideration in a jam flavour is the thing that really matters the jambuying public relies too much on the appearance for example greengage jam made from the ripe fruit is a greenishbrown colour the ignotant suppose greengage jamshould be green and they buy it green butsuch jam is made from unripe fruit and has not the flavour proper to the matured fruit straw berry jam should be a reddish brown but a atrawberry jam containing apple or gooseberry is lighter in colour and will take a very pretty red with the help of an aniline dye as the bulk oif strawberry preserves sold nowadays are not made solely from that fruit the public looks askance at a pure articleprejudices are created against factorymadeo jams by journalists who recognize the fact that jams can be bought at a lower price than they can be made at home and rush to the conclusion that cheap roots such as carrots mangold wurzels and turnips must be used a moments thought would convince any man of sense that the flavour of these vegetables is an insuperable obstacle to their employment artificial flavouring another bogey could not remove an existing flavour as for artificial pips the man or woman who talks about these should be set to make them after looking at a raspberry tip through a magnifying glass the idea tat marmalade is made from peel picked up at theatres is ingenious but feville oranges are not edible raw and in any case peel gathered in this way would be more costly than the oranges themselves the public whilst it is aus picious of adulterants which have no place in commercial economy is singularly artless when face to face with actual adulterationadulteanoxthe chief points to be considered in a jam adulterant are cheapness absence of telltale flavour acidity and jellying properties or pectin apples the sourer the better are chiefly used but green gooseberries if they could be bought at the same price would be almost ideal roughly speaking the first cost of gooseberries is from twice to three times that of apples but as they make a good jelly at a lower concentration than the latter the pro portionate cost in use is not the same green gooseberries are obtainable at the same time as ripe strawberries and largely because of this happy coincidence are in chief favour as an adulterant of strawberry jamthe jammaker has quite a number of sub stances other than fruit brought to his notice as useful adulterants but to mention therx here would lend authority to further fables agar agar or japanese isinglass is certainly employed in some cases a very small proportion will make a jelly that is flavourless and though the material seus at about s per lb the cost of the jelly is negligiblemethods of detectionthere is no doubt that the passing of the food and drugs act in  had a very bene ficial effect upon the purity of jams it has taken a long time for the manufacturer to drive the proverbial coach and horses throughl its provisions at the outset with the help of the microscope the analyst was well able to cope with the manufacturer a small portion of fruit pulp of a cheaper nature was used and the clls of the fruit were easily found in the jam the manufacturer in selfdefence had to filter his pulp and put in the juice only filtra tion is effected through bags and the residues used in cheaper jamsthe analyst today relies chiefly if not entirely on microscopical examination and is helpless in the presence of scientific adultera tion where all incriminating fruitcells havo been removed there is no good in making a fuss about something that cannot bo found and this probably accounts for the more favourable light in which fruit juice is regarded as compared with fruit pulp fundamentally both are adulterants fruit pulp is cheaper but frliit juice on account of the difficulty of detection is well worth the extra cost agar agar is very difficult to detect as the por centage in a jam need only be minute a siuspected jam may be diluted and filtered the solids burned and the residue examined for characteristic diatomsthe colloidal investigation of jams offers a promising field for research insoluble salts are chemically formed in a filtered jamie a fruit jelly and the precipitates so pioduced assume different forms with different jams the process has the advantage that it is not impeded by the filtration of the adulterant and in this respect marks an advance on analytical methods hitherto employedthe manufacturees deexncejammakers are divided into two camps today the majority adds cheaper fruits in some form to costly jams and says that the addition is an improvement whilst the minority claims that it is quite practicable to make a jam of any of the wellknown english fruits without adding cheaper firuits or fruit juices to them and that such addition is obviously adultera tion the trade as a whole would admit that the addition of a large percentage of foreign fruit fruit foreign to the particular jam or fruit juice is an adulteration but individuals say that the infinitesimal amount added in their case is not done for the sake of profit but to give the jam a better consistency and that the addition is at any rate occasionally more costly than the proper fruit it may be taken as certain that a cheapening of the pro duct takes place and that the question of added profit is one of degree even though the addition may be small in the case of some manufacturers the practice must be deprecated as coiuntenancing adulteration and being sub versive of trade morality
