fishl british fisheries an markets neglect of a cheap diet its value as a foodmuch ignorance still prevails as to the value of fish as an article of food and it is curious that the greatest amount of misapprehension should exist in the minds of the poorer classes of the comxnuiaty who would benefit most largely by including more fish in their dietary fish regarded in the bulk is a reasonably cheap food even in great britain sometimes it may be very cheap but owing to its perish able character and the distances which separate the large centres of population from the principal fish ports a glut of herrings for example such as was witnessed on many days last autuxrn at yarmouth and lowestoft ean only benefit the consumer who is on the spot he can on such occasions have the fish for the mere trouble of taling them away and on many occasions owing to the cost of transport enormous quantities of fish have had to be disposed of as manurefisheating nationsfish has formed and still forms the prin cipal animal diet of many races that have shown no lackl of physical strength compared with meateating populations the japanese in the towns are no doubt eating meat to a greater extent than formerlv but they are a fisheating nation so are the chinesethe cheaper kinds of fish of which the plaice skate mackerel herring and haddock may be taken as examples probably afford more food value for a given sum than any other kind of food stuffs and yet the amount of fish consumed bv the working classes is generally much less than the weight of beef bought at mruch higher prices according to sir james crichton browne even the dearer varieties of fish are sometimes worth the money paid for them when regarded from the standpoint of food value salmon it is stated by this authoritv weight for weight contains nearly three times as much nutriment as codit seems a thousand pities that with an appreciable percentage of the population of our great cities always on the verge of starvation more is not made of our fish supplies the total catch of the fisheries of the united king dom last year nmounted in weight to cwt of which only a small propor tion was consumed inl the uinited ikingadomnot the least value of fish as a food is the fact that it is easily digested salt fish not being so easily digested as fresh and the lean varieties  being more easily assimilated than the fat lnfortunately much of the food value of fish is often lost by unskilful cooking and while this is not the place to discuss this important s ubject it is one to which all who are interested in the greater use of fish as food should give attention in ny educational campaign which may be undertakenyarmouth and lowestoftthe supply of herringsscientists know the herring as clupda harengus but a just appreciation of its merits entitles it to be regarded as the vagrant of the sea and the fishermen as the constables of our shores chasing it on a beat extending from orkney and shetland lewis and the hebrides to berwick to grimsby yarmouth and lowes toft westwards to the cornish coast and milford haven and thence north again to mallaig and lerwick the long patrol of our coasts for the herring fishery never ceases the reason for the migratory habit of the herring is by no means clear but the bulk of scientific opinion is in favour of the theory that the great catches which take place inshore at certain times and places are due to the propensity which varies at different parts of the coast for the fish to approach the land at the spawning season the great catch of the herring is made in the autumn fishing at yarmouth and lowestoft at this season not only the scotch fishing boats the most persistent followers of the herring but a large dy of scotch fisher girls from the east and north of scotland come down to yarmouth for the gutting and packing operations a visit to yarmouth at this period is a revelation of the extent and importance of the herring fishing industrythe popular famne of great yarmouth rests upon the drysalted herring called the bloater it the kipper the preparation of which is a mote complicated process including pickling and a long process of smoking at a hard chip fire and the red herring have an excellent reputation as a breakfast disha rucond catchthere were landed at yarmouth during last fishing season  million herrings a record for any herring port in the world and at lowestoft  millions of these less than  per cent are made into bloaters or kippers the bulk of the catch is put into barrels salted and exported they reckon in crans on the east coast a cran being a measure of  herrings last year the catch at yarmouth was  crans and a comparison with previous years is made in the following tablethe great sucoess which attended the herring fishery last season and resulted in a record catch was due to the fact that the herrings were taken comparatively near shore so that it was possible for boats to mako two land ings in the course of the  hours the huge shoal struck in the second week of october remained stationary during the whole of the fishing it was remunerative but hard work for all concerned for about  weeks and opportunities for sleep were at a premium the crews of the drifters often falling asleep at their work the drifters are now nearly au steam oropelled and in addition to the skipper and our or five deck hands carry engineers and of course a cook the herrings are not caught in the sense that a trawler catches fish  the net flo ats in the water extending over a range of a mile or more and the fish which swim into the net are unable to escape through the meshes which however are made large enough to release all but mature herringsfluctuations mn stllng peacesthe method of marketing the herring is not greatly different from that by which fish are put up to auction at the trawling ports but the fluctuations in the prices realized within a few hours are very wide during last sesson the range of quotations was from s to s per cran and it is est imated that the selling value at flrst hand of the catch landed at yarmouth was nearly one nioon pounds an estimate of the capital invtetedin

fishermen both at home and abroad have endeavoured to obtain protection from the damage to the fishing which they allege is done by the trawling fleet and an association wbich has its headquarters in yarmouth has been formed to take action in this connexion the trawling interests on the other hand claim that while it is true that the trawl may destroy a great many immature herrings it also destroys many of the enemies of the herring and is calculated rather to improve tlhan to damage the prospects of the herring fishermen the rapid increase in the catch of herringswhich has risen from a total of  millions in  to  mnillions in x certainly suggests that there may be some foundation for the statement theat trawling methods have improved the herrine fishing during recent yearsinshore fisheriesthe need for organizationgreat as are the supplies of fish landed almost daily at the chief markets of the united king dom it is an acknowledged fact that these supplies could be considerably augmented by the development of cooperative methods among tho hundreds of inshore fishermen around our coasts at present the bulk of the supplies are the result of deepsea operations and these mainly of trawlersthe past two decades have proved a very trying period for many fishermen the trawlers cut them out not only in the great markets but even in many homeports one of the most encouraging features of recent years has undoubtedly been the  installation in many deepsea boats as distinct from trawlers of motors this development however has merely made the position of tle inshore fisher men more difficult than ever unless they are able to keep up with the times and furnish thomselves with motorseven allowing for the strenuous competition which they have had to face however there is good reason to believe that there is still room for them especially as the shellfish industry is in their hands and might be largely developed the one thing that could have helped them to maintain their footing more firmly than they did and which today can improve the conditions of inshore fishermen is cooperation it is a regrettable fact that fishermen in general have been most unprogressive in the matter of marketing their catches this too despite the fact that the opportunity for cooperation among them  has been practically uniquo they use the same harbours live close together and congregate in the same meeting halls in no part of the country have say agricul turists had anything like the same opportunity and yet they have made more progresstxcnm fmsncnrsn coonaunomsome timo agowhen the fishermen of devon and cornwall were experiencing greats hardships and an application was made for a grant a committee was appointed to investigte the conditions one suggestion made by that committee on their behalf was that some sort of fisheries organization society should be formed to teach the fishermen cooperation subsequently a departmental commnittee wbich is still sitting was formed to investigate the conditions of the inshore fisheries atv round the coast if this committee reports in favour of teaching cooperation to fishermen it seems probable that a fishermnens organization society on the lines of the agricultural organizaton society will be formned under this experts on cooperation would be stationed at various p oints all round the coast these men would help the fishermen todevise ways and means for placing their supplies on the markets bulying their requirements and otherwise promoting better business in fishingit is a big subjoct and one in which many difficullties will have to be surmnounted but if successful the scheme should mean not only greater supplies of fish but a reduc tion in prices and the preservation of hardy populations of great value to the state
