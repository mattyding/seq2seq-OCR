baconctrling position of the lnited kiinngdoamthe fact that some  per cent of the meat consurned in the united kingdom is bacon is sufficient to direct attention to the baconcuriucz industry last year as shownin tho article on moat imports wo imported  tons of bacon that total represented perhaps more than the quantity of bacon annually produced in the united kingdom add to this the facts that priceshave reached an exceptionally high level that one of the chief complaints of baconcurers in this country is a continued scarcityof pigs and that principally by reason of scientific breeding and cooperation the iane rules tho market in this country and the importance of the baconcuring industry becomcs all the rmore significantthae scarcity of pigsas emphasizing the searcitv of pigs in the united kingdom it is only necessary to state that few if any of the baconcurers aro kill ing to their full capacity several reasons for this scarcity will be developed in the course of this articie but the one outstanding reason is the apparent unwillingness of tho average farmer to breed pigs scientifically and of the correct strain the difference between a bacon pig and a  pig that is to be idlled for pork is verv great in den mark the utmost care is taken to eliminate from the growinig pigs all that are not of the proper baconproducing kind atnd efforts in the same direction are constantly being made by people interested in the baconcuring in dustry of the united kingdom but not even the cooperative schemes inaugurated at bury st edmunds hitchin and at several places in ireland have had the results that the pro moters anticipatedthe question has sometimes been asked why do not the leoding baconcurers in the united kingdom breed their own pigs  in explanation of why they do not do so the bacon curers put forward some very weighty reasons of these one of the chief is the stringent manner in which the board of agriculture controls socalled swine fever some leading bacon curers estimate that were swine fever thoroughly understood and diagnosed and the regulations properly amended the swine population of the united kingdom would in crease by  per cent the serum treatment practised to a considerable extent in certain other countries has not been adopted here yet but rrunciman has promised to have experi ments carried outfactroms azm pxgnaelmlanother reason why tho baconeturers do not attempt to breed pigs is that they could nover produce theax m undtiient number to be of use the number of pip ona farm intended to keep a bacon factory going would have to be very high this can be better impressed by tho fact that for a factory such as that of leessrs harris at calne in wiltshireincidentally thi biggest in englandsomething like  pigs are required every week messrs denny the biggest eurers in ireland require even more while the cooperative factory at bury st edmunds were it working at capacitv wvonld require nearly  pigs per week were  pigs kept on a farm this would only provide for a weekly killing of from  to  it must be said however that several of the smaller baconcurers have tried breeding and feeding though withi only moderately success ful results another important point is that wvere the leading baconcurers to breed pigs on a large scale difficulties would arise w ith the farmers when the pigs bred by the former were ready for killing those of the latter would almost certainly also be ready for conversion into bacon thus a glut wotild resuilt on the other hand wvhen tho farmers were unable to provide a sufficioncy the pigs of the factory breeders might not be ready for killing all circumstances considered the open door policy on the part of the factories would seem to be the besttiir conrmol of pricesin addition to thle foregoing there are other circumstances which combine to render the position of the baconcuring factories sufflliently difficult wvithout the addition ot the worries of pigbreeding not only does the supply of raw material fluctuate very considerably the demand is even more variable moreover they are dealing with a perishable article which must be cleared in at least  days despite the prosperous conditions of many of onr leading factories they are on the same footing as the smaller concerns in so far as the regulation of prices is concerned prices art controlled by the number of pigs killed in denmark and the re ceipt of the weekly cable on fridays has a great influence upon the market if the danos kill only  per week the market is firm but if the numnber slaughtered is over  the marklet goes down and the danes are killing more and more pigs and at the same time ever increasing their hold on the markets of the united ringdom and especially of englandtee pfjxcipal areasas wvith most important industries bacon curing is largelv confined to certain prescribed areas in the united ikingdom in ireland the south is preominent great factories having been established in limerick cork and wvater ford besides other places for many years belfast dublin londonderry and other centres also possess baconcuring factories of import ance in england the most important area centres around wiltshire where the harris family were engaged in baconcuring in  a district w hich has given its name to bacon that is farnous the world over just as irish bacon is avshire is scotiands leading area a great part of the lrish trade is somewvhat akin to that in wiltshire hacon as the careases are con verted into wvhole sides in birmingham and district nvhere some  pigs are slaughtered per week they first of all remove thle hams  a great deal of the remainder is used as fresh pork while the balance is converted into  stafford cut  or  jackets an important trado is in the ayrshire roll here again the lhams are cut out the remainder being made up into rolls in belfast too a great deal is done in rolls and hams wvhile on this subject it may be mentioned that the trade in small porkpigs weighing from b to loolbhas been steadily increasing another factor and an important one in the pork trade whlich at the same time has a considerable bearing on the baconcuring trade is the comparatively recent regulation alloviring the services pork on one day por week the manner in whiclh this influences the baconcuring trade is that it tends further to restrict the number of pigs available for baconit may cost only a few shillings more to rear a good bacon pig but such a pig wvill yield perhaps s per cwt more as bacon than the pig reared indiscriminatelytine coorerativit afovserntthat tbero is need of greater cooperation in the rearing of pigs no one in the baconcuring trade denies let us glance briefly at hliat has been the experience of those who have put all their energies into tho cooperative movement with a view to fostering factories on these lines they have been no more successful in securing better bacon pigs than the leading private firms they can make splendid bacon but the chief difficulty has been in finding a market for it thousands of pounds sterling have been lost over cooperative baconcuring vontures and this despite the fact that the factoriesthat at bury st edmunds is a good examplohave mostly been equipped on the most approved linesamong a certain section of tho baconcurers there is a strong feeling that by proper direction the governrnent could not only strengthen the trade but enable it to go forward by loaps and bounds the united ingdom is the danes market and practivally his one great market danish bacon is cithler banned or only obtain able at an excessive price in certain continental countries the rearing of pigs is aclmowledged to be the most lucrative branch of agriculture putting these points together the policy that thesc curres wish the government to pursue is obvioustrbade secnpxrsthe conditions of baconcuring have vastly improved and thero has been no greater aid in this direction than refrigeration in the pro cess of curing many different methods are of eourse emploved to secuem the desired flavour for exainpi there are many different ways of salting and smoking many of whlichl are trad secrets one of the most striking facts associated witlh the baconcuring industrv however is the development of many other kindred  lines for examplo at some of the leading factories they now also manufacture brawn and sausages wlhile the blood offal bones and so forth are all utilized for various purposes chief of which are fertilizersa model bacon factorythe satisfaction that comes from being told that the conditions unider wlich much of our homeproduced bacon is cured are in every wav commendable is accentuated bv personal acquaintance with these conditions the equip ment and efficient running of a model bacon curing factory is a work requiring mulch careful thought enterprise and supervision all three qualities are available at certain factories in england ireland and scotland such a factory is that of messrs harris at calne in wiltshire which a representative of the timme had an opportunity of inspectingthis factory is really a combination of two factories each having a capacity of fully  pigs per weelk from the moment the pigs suspended by a hind leg go up the  joy wheel  to meet their fate at the hands of a skilled sticker until the various products are packed and ready for dispatch is a proceeding involving the use of much ingenious plant and skill on the part of the employees the firm however have made these latter specialize to such an extent that so far as manual labour is coneerned the whole thing goes as if by auto matic meansthe huge cellars where many thousands of sides of bacon are in different stages of curing are most interesting and scarcely less so are the smoking chambers the largest of wliich can hold  sides at a time brawn and sausages are made in separate departments the bread used for the latter being made in the firms own bakery where are also made pork pies the blood is converted into a fine fertilizer in a dry powdery form the unedible fat is boiled up refned to a certain extent and sold to soap and candle makers and the bones and any odd piecesof flesh o fat nally appear as another foa of fertlie thus has science revolu tihnized baconmb
