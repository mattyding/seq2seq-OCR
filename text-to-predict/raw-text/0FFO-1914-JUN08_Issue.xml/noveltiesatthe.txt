i noelties at time  zoo i rare antelopes and pygmy buffalotho zoological society has purehasod for the first time tliree examples of the soiuth african species of antelopo  gqazella two young males and a femalein this specics the males and females are almost identical in appearance adults stand nearly ft high at the withers the general colour of the neck and body is a greyish fawn but the head face and legs are white with boldly marked patches of blatck and there is a deep patch of black on the rump these animals inhabit desert land and it seems as if the pattern would stand out sharply from almost any background certainly the position of the black patches is such that they obscure the natural outline of the body and the result may be to make the animal appear less like a living creature when seen from a distance as however large carnivores are their chiof enemies and as they run most risk at night the suggestion as to the utility of the pattern is not very convincing the gemsbuck was formerly abundant in south africa in suitable localities but it is neither very fleet nor enduring mr selous mentions that he has himself run one to a standstill without firing a shot and the numbers are now greatly reduced it is strictly protected and the specimens obtained for the zoolomical society wero allowed to be exported under a special licence from the union governmentthe antelopes of the genus oryx are among the beautiful end charactcristic of the fauna of africa they are all rather brightly coloured have long tails with a black tuft at the tip and very long slender and nearly cvliudricl horns tapering to a fine point and running backwards cither straight or in a gentle curve thie horns being alike in both sexes among the beit known are the large sabrehorned antelopes  leuroryx or algazel very hght in colour and ranging across north africa from the sudan to senegal the bleatrix antelope from arabia  beatrix in which the horns are straighter and the colour is a dirty white with brown legs and face markings and the beisa antelope of northeast africas with straight hornls and a tawny coat with black marks the society has frequently been able to elhibit ropre sentatives of thesc species and at present has fine examples of the firstnameda pygy brffaiomr willoughby smnith has presented a young anoa noa depressicornis fom iclebes unfortunately a bunll as the ouly other example possessed by the isociety is of the same sex the anoa is the smallest of the ttuc species of cattle being even smaller than the dwarf domesticated gynce cattle of india they are slenderly built do not reach more than a yard in height at the shoulders and have small straight horns extending upwards and backwards in the line of the face the colouration is very dark with occasionaaly white spots they live in forested colntry high up in the mountains of celebes and very httle is known as to their habitsan outdoon exclosiul foy reptmesthe svstem of retaining animals by a moat instcad of a fence has been applied to lizards and snakes in a small enclosure just outside the reptilehouse an area of about four yards square has been surrounded by a deep moat lined with concrete the outer wall being undercut the central space hes been built up with rockwork planted with moss and shrubs and surmounted by a peak from which a little stream of water trickles over the rocks into the moat upon this there have been placed a number of common adders which seldom live or feed in captivity indoors a number of grasssnakes glasssnakes and many large green lizads and small walllizerdsalthough there has been little sunshine since these reptiles were put out of doors they have all dis plhyed great activity and the enclosure has been surrounded with visitors almost continullv the adders have moved about in fashion very different from their sluggishnesis in the old glass cases but have shown no signs of attacking any of their neigh bours although it is probable that thev somethnes feed on walllizards the grasssnakes took to the water from the first and spend most of their time swvimming rapidly round the moat twisting in hori zontal curves through the water and not as swimming snakes are generally depicted in vertical undulations the lizards rush all over the rocks and many of them are to be seen climbing up to the summit of a small fir tree on a small scale the exhibit is as attractive as the ymappin terraces and is of an equally novel kind
