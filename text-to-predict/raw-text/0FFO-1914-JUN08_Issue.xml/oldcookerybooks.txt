old cookery booes the earliest english coamplationthere is porhaps no matter of groator im portance in rolation to the food we enjoy than the manner in whioh it is prepared for the table and though according to the fathers of the church man during his shmrt stay in paradise was restricted to a vegetable diet there can be no doubt that very early in tho history of our raee meat was used for human food and that some form of cookery had to be practised in order to render it palatable and nutritious we read that according to petavius and le clere tho world was created in autumn wlhn the fruits of the earth were both plentiful and in the highest perfection and hence in edon there was no call for the cooks skill but in the age of the patriarchs we hear repeatedly of the employment of animal food tndeed primneval man had long ere this learned the use of fire in preparig his mteals and abundant evidence remains of rude forjns of cookeryit is not our intention to dwell upon fhe cookery of greece and rome though much might be said of the art in those days because we wish to discuss  cookery books or the writings of those who have given formal and precise descriptions for the preparation of articles of food ono such work of roman times has come down to us namely the treatise that goes under the name of apicius which according to some is the title of the compilation though other scholars have deemed him to be the real authorthee foirs or curycoming dowvn to medieval times the first english cookery book would appear to be that of neckam written in the th century but the manuscript entitled the  forme of cury  is the oldest practical work on the subject in our language the story of this document now in the british iuseum is extremely interesting lt is a vellum roll and contains  recipes it was compiled about ad  by the master cooks of king richard ii in its long historytho fact thatit was presented to qneen eliza beth in the th year of her reign  by lord stafford as a curiosity is perhacs tho most remarkable at a latcr date it was the property of the earl of oxford and was acquired at tlhe sale of his manuscripts by james west after wests death it passed into the hands of gusta vus brandler curator of the british lhuseum and here it attracted the attention of samuel pegge the wellknowsn antiquarian who pub lished an account of it in  we are in debted to his preface for manv interesting tacts about this early cookery book pegge prints a full transcript of the roll with numerous valu able comments and ho also gives a facsimrile of one of the recipes together wsith an index and glossarya memorandum in latin at the encl of the roll sets forth the fact of its presentation to queen elizaboth already noted and the roll begins with a short preamble
