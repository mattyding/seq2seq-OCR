paris fashions a hesitating return to virtueflob ouij fashion corbesprndentparis jue tii an old book the other day i fould a well known writer of his time saying our belles formerly overloaded themselves with dress of late years they have effected to go almost naked and are when unadorned adorned the most it was comforting to find proof of ones inner conviction that women are no more foolish now than they have always been and in spite of fashions present vulgarities we mtay keep up a brave heart and feel quite sure that she will return to patths of grace and virtue even though it may bo but for a brief wllile in the meantime the creature is doing al she dare to mako mrs grundy purse her lips and look virtuous as only airs grundy can she fashion tells us with a little air of defiance that black is only possible for evening wear when it is so decolleto tllat the effect is black and xvhito that all wlhite is quite the right thin but it must be of aphrodite filminess that a little dinner dress of taffetas in royal blue with one red rose on the shoulder should be sleeveless and slit under the arms in an utterly unbecoming fashion and that morning after noon or evening it is our duty to bare our necks and shoulders as if we were dressed for a perpetual drawing room under queen vietoriathe emorcyjs or agethe fashion of a bare neck is pretty enoigh for  sweet and twenty but wlat is  fair and forty to do especially if she be not fat she has either to wear a guimpe and not care about fashions disdain or be prepared to hear that kind friends have cornmented on the lines that the years have traced about that telltale member the throat i have always admired mine sarah bernhardtg fashion of swathing her neck in soft folds of lace or mousseline and i cannot think why  fair and fifty if rot  forty does not follow her example w e hlave all adopted her long tight sleeve reaching over the hand so why not the throat wrappings  boned collars mark the neck irritate the temper spoil the expree sion of the face if they fit closely enough and if they do not they quite destroy the pretty line of the throat and are the death of smart ness they are not therefore ideal but sot lace folds properly adjusted are channing and are no hotter than bones a very big dress maker in a kindly mood designed some gool models whieh i have seen worn by women who know how to combine smartness with comfort a difficult thing to do one shows a band of velvet with a light medicis frill of lace which wanders down the corsage and forms a v leaving the tiny dcollete which most womerncan stand and covering the throat just under the chinsome graces of poles apart fromr smart indiscretions in black or white and many leagtws away from roval blue rapidities are the dlinty gowns in lingerie and lace whici havo been prepared for summer weather and those manvy outof door gaieties which mark the month of june in paris there is one all lace flounces over a skirt of net embroidered rather heavily round the feet in style it is almost pure  without the crinoline it has a sash of pompadoir taffetas and another of white silk to wear in turn the sleeves are long and transparont and it fastens high to the throat but is only of cobweb substance above the bust a more stately modsl is in white silk with lace and linvgerio tunic long and full embroidered here and there with bunches of brilliant coloured roses which look as if t hey were bhunches of real flowers used to hold up rebellious draperies the corsage is a fschu of lace and lingerie with long trans parent sleeves and a bunch of roses hiding away at the waist whiclh is swathed with a white sash a very simple frock was in plain white muslin with a tumic bordered with pale green embroidery and there were several crepon dresses most of them made with flounces embroidered in white flesh pink isa favourite shade in crepon or passtel blue and nothing looks nmore charmning for a morning frock for the countrv big hats seem the only wear with these summer gowns and many of the shapes are very becoming they are rmade in leghorn in a mixture of straw and muslini in lace and in black velvet tho trimmings aro ahnost nothing just a wreath of flowers a band of vehet a tuift or two of feathers or corn and leaves and the whole thing set rather jauntily on the head a little to one side and towards the browa wobld of dpraildetail in dress is rather like detail in life it has to be simplified for the sake of the broad lines and the wise woman learns as quickly as possible to cut down both in her honse and her wardrobe thereby reducing their detail to a rnimum quantity it is an expertsive matter in the first instance but eventualy it pays no woman should have rnore clothes than she needs for a superfluity of anything smothers smartness engenders confusion and kills beauty too much lace too manv chains an elaborate coiffure shoes that obtrude bv their very smartness a hat that does not fall into line an embroidered collar that is not quite fresh the fittings of ones purse and the con folmlity of ones sunshadeal these are things which have to be taken into account wvhen smart simplicity is aimed at the only way to arrive at this goal is to reduce the number of ones possessions because to the average woman time is as precious as money and too many possessions waste both ones time and ones money to say nothing of ones temper wear everything that is in the wardrobe and when it is out of date give it away
