foods of anmquity sowme favouite disbes little chlncge in tastthe ancients by whom we mean the greeks and romans ate very muchi the same food that we eat today ancd wvith the same appetitoe they looked upon the process perhaps with an eye of greater ceremony in homeric times the gods took their share of every banquet and in a later age the placing of the guests the conduct of the symposium wero of equal import with the choico of tho meats end the wines  he dines not who eats alone  was a maxim wvhich never fell upon dishonour that we should notice similairity rather than difforences as we look backwards is but natural the craving for wellcooked food is wvholesomely human and if the palato growts more delicate as the appetite becomes less gross the change is not peculiar to this country or that as in poetry so in food the love of simplicity is the proof of a golden if primitive agothe heroes of hlomer for instance wvere not nice feeders they seem to have had the healthy appetites of savages they liked piain food and plenty of it they had neither butchers nor cooks tbey slaughtered their own beasts and prepared their mcat as well as they could they had little taste for fish wvhich thev ate only whlen thero wvas nothing else to be had and they looked upon geime as o better than the food of necessitv nor wvere vegetables pleasing to their sturdy palatos noat bread and nwine were their stople fare and they asked for no accessoiics pork and mutton and goats flesh they ate villingly indeed the boast which to some is still unclean was very much to the taste of the greeks and was higlhly esteemed at their banquets unto the end athensaus vwites in irical strains of a pig that once was served to him and his friends the half of wlichl wvas carefully roasted tho other half boiled gently as if it had been steamed and the whole stuffed wsith thrushes and other birds but best of all the homeric heroes liked beef cut inito pieces and grilled upon spits and it was onlv on occasions of sacrifice that their desires were wlholly satisfied though the gods to be sure claimed the daintiest morsels there was enough left to appease tho stoutest hunger nor did they demand any adornment to such feasts as these save fruit there aro few more beautiful passages in the odyssey than the description of thu garden of alcinous which nve quote in the admirable version ofmessrs butcher and lang iknd there grew tall trees blossoming partrees and pomegranates and appletreels vith bright iiit and sweet figs and olihes in their hloom the fruit of these trees never

the years passed the greeks grew daintier tnd more critical of their food theo three meals which broke their day wvere not unlike those which still obtain their first breakfast dxpdrtap was simple

nor napkins butb if their service were bad in tho fifth century luxury had alreadv invaded athens their dishes were then notdifferent from those which are seen on al modern table and the diners of atlhens were limnited onlv by their pockets they had overcome all the prejudices of the homeric age no banquot was complete vithout fish and game and vegetables the real spirit of gluttony ior

plentiful creels once more from copais to journey with eelsand the chorus of husbandmen demanded for their sustenance kidneybeans fried and inlxed with barley choice figs and fieldfare and finches indeed the dinners of the greeks differed from our own only in ono point the greeks did not drink while they ate the symposium came when the last of the food was removed from the table and wvas conducted with the gravest ceremonv the king or president chosen by a throw of thie dice accepted a heavvy responsibility not only did he decide in what proportion of water the wine of chios lesbos or naxos should be mixed but he directed the tabletalk and coin trolled the dancers and fluteplayers who were admnitted to amiuse the guests he must be thouglht plato a wise aid sober man and if the accounts of the symposia wvhich have como dowvn to us are trulo they wvere nights and banquets of the godsthere is no better proof of the delicacy of the greek palate than the honour in wvhiiei cooks

which was his chief happiness wvhen vo turn to rome wve find the same progress from simplicitv to gluttony the anrcient roman like the scot grew strong upon porridge puis was the staple of his diet but foreign victories brought foreign manners and luxury made an easy conquest of romewhich presentlv adopted the three meals of the greeks to divide the day in the earlv morn ing tho roman was satisfied with bread dried fruits and cheese then at noon came the prandiumwhich consisted in simple households of the broken meats from yesterdays dinner table with a pleasant addition of eggs vegetables and wino btut it was the cna to which the epicure looked forward as the very climax of his day when he might take his ease and indulge his fancy the cena indeed was an elaborate meal whiich followed a rigidly prescribed plan first came the guitu devised to stimulate appetite not to satisfy hunger it consisted of an elaborate array of what we call hors deutve and yet resembled the loadedsidetables of sweden and russia more nearly than tneo modest dishes of france there were shellfish and eggs and vegetables at the famous banquet of trirnalchio which it should be remembered is not merely a banquet but a burlesque and was given by a multimillionaire as we should call him today the gusttus would have served the most of men for a dinner a donkcey of corinthian bronze held two baskets of olives white on one side black on the other then there were dorrnice covered with honey and poppyseed hot sausages on a silver grill and beneath them dainsons and pomegranate seeds but a roman dined with trimalchio as rarely as with lucullus and the freedmrans fancy was separate and hiis ownaftor tlhe gustus came the regular courses fercula they are called which miaht be thrce or even sevenin the houses of epicures the satirists and historians as woe know condemn the extravagance which vastly increased under the einpire and which bade the wealthy romaus sendl fortheir priceless delicacies to the ends of thlie earth satire had no more effect than sumptu ary laws and the banquets of rich patricians and wealthy freedmen are legendary first came the fish for poor as for rich a necessity of the dinner seabarbel and the turbot of ravenna were the favourites and the haddock was not disdained oysters were as highly prized at rome as in modern london end were brought by the wvealthy from britain to be fattenecl in the lucrine lake of birds the chief in esteem were fowls and peacocks and fieldfares were as eagerly sought for ini rome as in the athens of aristophanes but no banquet at rome vas complete without a wild boar whose entrance upon the table roasted wlhole marked the highest moment of the ceremonial feast petronius has described the pomp of its coming with a vast deal of circinnstance  a tray wsvebrought in with a wild boar of thlo larget sizoe ipon it wearing a cap of freedomn with two little baskets woven of palmtwigs hanging from his tusks one full of drv dates tand the othelr of fresh round it lay sueking pigs mrade of simnel cale with their mouths to the teats therebv showing that we had a sow beforo us so valiaint a beast freed because the guests of yesterday had sent hxim away untested d served the ministrations of no mean carver and a big bearded man in a spagloed huntinug coat pluged a great knifo into his side and as thbo inife entered out there flew a lnrgo nurm ber of thrushes it was a fantastic spectacle and suggests niot the banquet of an epicure but what tho newspapers of today call a freak dcinnerand the reomans no less than the greeks proved their love of the pig bv the preference they showed for sausages and black puddings for the rest they esteemed a hare a goat or a dormoulse that had been fed on chestnuts as rare dainties and they finished their feasts with a fine array of pastry and fruit some there wero who praised the simple life bunt we may assurmo that horace when he declared his hatred of persici apparatus was expressing no more than the remorse of a jaded palate yet if we compare the luxury of mnodern times with the luxury of rome we shall observe but few differences wve do not like the rorans recline at our meals we do not observe the ceremnonies of the triclinium nve are more sensitive in keeping clean our hands and prefer forlks to fingers but the taste of tman has notgreatly chanaed in  years and if it could  be our good fortune to dine with luculluis histablo would cause us no confusion and but i small surprise
