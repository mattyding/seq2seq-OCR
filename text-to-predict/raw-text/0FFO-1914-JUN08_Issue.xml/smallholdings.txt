small holdings the movement in great britainthe modern small holdings movement in britain arose from a general desire both to check the rural exodus and also to enable townsmen who desire it to lead a rural life perhaps it has also been stimulated by the extraordinary success of denmark holland and belgiumall nations of small holdersin developing so large an export trade in farm and garden produce if it pays them to grow for markets abroad it should apparently pay small holders in britain to grow for markets a few miles away since the small holdings act was passed about six years ago some  acres have been secured for small holders they average about  acres each in size and the rent averages about s per acre twothirds have been secured by purchase and the rest are held on lease the official report is that the condi tion of the land has greatly improved since its conversion into small holdings and the propor tion of unsatisfactory small holders is reported as less than  per cent the general experience is that cooperation is essential to success cheapen ing purchases and improving the facilities for selling and distributing produce while pro viding expensive implements and apparatus for common use and acquiring pedigree stud animals for joint ownership success depends also on the ability to find crops suited equally to the district and to tho special conditions of a small holding for a small holding is rarely able to pay its way when it is nothing more than a minature farmcost of inthsmve cvationenormous capital outlay per acre is required for intensive cultivation as exemplified in the gardens of the paris maraicher and his annual expenses per acre for rent labour manure water and so forth may exceed  a common application of manure is at the rate of  tons per acre and in a few years the thick layer of artificial soil which accumulates is so valuable that on many holdings the tenant claims ownership of it and takes it witlh him if he moves the svstem attracted much tiotice a few years ago and some of the experiments in it proved costly failures chiefly on account of marketing difficulties on the other hand a number of private enterprises have yielded a fair return its essential features are not only to use space to its utmost capacity throughout tho year but to raise crops a week or two earlier than those grown under ordinary conditions obviously if the system were extensively practised it would defeat its own object in a more literal sense intensive cultivation means the effort to increase the average productiveness of the land and any practicable system or method wvhich makes this possible and so lessens the countrys dependence on imported supplies is unreservedly to be welcomed but it will be found that the efforts to increase production are not confined to any one class of eultivators and some of the most extensive farmers are able by their skilful management and use of modern resources to show what has good claim to bo called an intensive yield from their land
