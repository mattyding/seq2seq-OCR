concentrated food   various milk and meat preparations advantage for travellersmuch attention has been paid in recent years to the various systoms of food preparation hereby it has become practicable to secre the utmost possible amoumt of noturislhment in very small compass tho reasons given for these attempts to attain a high degree of con centration are not alone to facilitate or to cheapon tho carriage of the commodities in question by rendering them more portable though the growth of large tovns and the greater density of the population on certain areas would n o doubt prove to be one of the main factors for the encouragement of this praetiee in certain directions tho very con siderablo decrease ilt bulk and the convenience for cookery of highly condensed articles of liet present

enormous trade in meac extracts whose name moroover has perhaps become imore videly known in this coruexion than in anv other of his various activities was baron justus von liebig nvho in the year  became associated ivitli a company established in south ameriea to prepare an extract from the cheap meat fed on the prairies of argentinfa before that timo the manmer of obtaining tho extractive matters of nmeat had becn described by proust btut we owe to liebig the inception of the industry the method of producing the extract first known from the initials of his company as lemco was extromely simple freshkilled meat deprived as far as possible of fat and gristle was chopped up into srnall pieces and heated tnder pressure with a little water at a carefully regulated tern perature the extract was filtered and evaporated in vacuo and in the open unless great care wvas exercised in the process the rich golden brown colour of the preparation was to some extent lost and the sticky viscid mass if over heated became dark brovwn in colour and was partially deprived of its characteristic meaty odour owing to becomilg scorchedit was estimated by liebi that b of puro beef with all bone and fat removedwould yield i lb of the extract and he considered that this quantity might be made into  pints of beef tea it would therefore appear that one pint of beef tea thus composed would contain the value procured from lb of beef for the guidance of the factory staff the following proportions were laid down to settle the qualitv of the extract it was to contain in  parts from  to  per cent of moisture from  to  per cent of mineral matters and from  to  per cent of extractive matters liebig forbade the use of salt as also of gelatin in any extract bearing his name probably con sidering that the cheapness of this latter sub stance would favour its employment as an adulterant there is no doubt also that such an addition would render the extract more liable to undergo decomposition liebig was of the opinion that the use of gelatin would place the extract on a par with the clheap soups sold in tablet formn which ho regarded as little better than coloured gluefood value of meat e xactthe question of the food value of meat extract has been tbe subject of controversy and one observer found a large proportion of proteid matter and gelatin present but the accuracy of his methods of analysis was disputed according to professorkemmerich this extract contained no less than  per cent of such matters more recent analysis of one of these extracts given in the lancet show the following resultsper cent per cert moisture f  from  to o mineral salts   is   organic matter      containing total nitrogen     i albumose        peptoie     total proteids     these extracts contain from  to  per cent of creatin and creatinin together with small percentages of salt and phosphoric acid from the nature of its composition and the mode in which the extract is prepared it is certain that a proportion of the nutriment of the meat remains behind in the fibrous matters which are strained away in the course of manufacture it was natural therefore when the subject was fully discussed that attempts were made to restore to the extractive matters some of the elements of whiill they had thus been deprivedbeelrff ethe various elbims made on behalf of meat extracts have also been put forward from time to tinie for the socalled meatjuices pre pared by subjecting raw meat to high pressure and by this means squeezing out the fluid sub stance found in the muscle the liquid ob tained in this way is afterwards concentrated by low temperatiieevaporbtion in vacuo as itvvould tot bo possible to employ heat sincee heat would be calculated to coagulate the soluble proteids present it is on this account that in some instances mnakers of these pre parations use tho exoression  manufactured by the cold process  the amount of these juices that can be obtained fromn a giveni weight of raw moat is comparatively small while the plant used for the purpose is of an expensivo character and therefoto tho cost of similar preparations is relatively high it is esti mated that it takes from lb to b of raw lean beef to produce ib of beefjuice wvhich will con taiii upwards of  per cent of wrater from  to  per cent of coagulable proteids and from  to  per

these frag ments of meat should then be placed in a jar with about onie pint of water to a pound of beef and set aside in the cold for at least half an hour after thiis standing a somewhat dilute

when the beeftea is improperly made by boiling if prepared in the above way the quantities of beef and water mentioned should yield oz of good beeftea containing about i per cent of proteids and about

great distances using only b of pemmican daily perhaps bulk for bulk this is the most concentrated form of meat diet and it is somewhat surprising that a healthy man can be nourished with an entirely meat food of this character it has been estimated that living on pemrnieian alone the hunter partakes each day of  grammes of proteid and  granmmes of fat a better allroumd nourish ment is provided by
