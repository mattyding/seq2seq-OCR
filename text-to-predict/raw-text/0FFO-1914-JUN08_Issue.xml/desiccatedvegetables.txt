desiccated egetabls   le a concentrated food productthe preparation of all the more conmon vegetables roots and tubers by simply oxpelling tho moisture so as to obtain them in a dried state is an important branch of industry and seems to have become established in the first instance in germnany wvhere the stovesand hot chambers originally used for drying fruit were at a later date made available for the treatment of green vegetables peas beans potatoes and all kinds of roots used in the kitchen by this means the staff and plant could be employed at times when no fruit was available the process is an extremely simple one but needs care and skill in the various stages of the operation it was thought almost impossible at one time to avoid the production of a faint but lingering smell of hay in the case of the dried green vegetables but it was subse quently ascertained that this odour was due to the slow decomposition of the alburninous matters and that if steps were taken to coagu late the albumen by exposing the freshly gathered vegetables to superheated steam or boiling wvater for a short time before ex pelling the moisture this putrefactive process was arrestedred u ox m butltreated in this manner it becomes possible to conduct the preparation in such a way that the true scent and flavour togetlher witlh all the nutritive ingredients of the plants are preserved and by the expulsion of the water the reduction in bulk is very remarkable masson found that b weight of fresh green cabbage could be dried into about illb wlhile carrots and tturnips treated in a similar way can be reduced to onetenth of their weight whlien it is required to obtain the vegetables in an extremely compact form as in the case of rations for the army and navy the water is not wvholly expelled and the dried substances are submitted to hydraulic pressure so as to produce slabs or cakes by which means the rations for  men can be contained within the space of a cubic foot allowing  grammes per head these rations are in the form of slabs less than half an inch thick  rations being comprised in each slab indenta tions in the cakes made under the press enable the division into separate rations to be readily effected after compression the final drying of the slabs is completed by hot air and when thoroughly dry the prepared vegetables can be kept for long periods before usemiethods or wor gthe vegetables after being well washed freed frorn any injured or decayed portions and dried by exposure to the air are packed inlto wire gauze cages and plunged into boiling water where they remain for five or six minutes for the socalled blanching operation wlhich causes thio rupture of the cellwalls with some slight loss of cellcontents in certain cases highpressure steam in jacketed boilers or autoclaves is used in preference to boiling wvater as the loss in weight is then less than when the vegetables are immersed in water if the products as is generally the case are required in slices the vegetables are first passed through machines of the chaffbutter type to shred thieni and a ntunber of ingenious appliances are in use for preparing french beans cabbagescar rots and so forth and for the peeling and cutting of potatoes into thin slices after removal fromothe boiler the vegetables are dried in a currentj of hot air in special stoves heated by cokei or coal furnaces the products of combustion are led beneath and through these chambers in flues so as to prevent actual contact of the fumes witlh the contents of the chamberit is usual to construct the hot chambers in  paiis with the furnace between them so that by means of dampers they may be emptied and loaded alternately the chambers are provided w ith shielves or trays of perforated metal or canvas oni wvire supports so as to receive the vegetables to be dried packed in thin layers and the temperature is maintained at about deg to deg fahr it will be found that after  hours in the hot chamber the vegetables are in a fairly dry condition and can be taken out for compression or for packing in tirs the time occupied in the drying process varies somewhat in accordance wvith the nature of the vegetable under treat ment and the size of the slices miore attention to regulating the heat is necessary than in dryiig fruit because the vegetables scorch more easily than fruit does in order to preserve their colour tho water in whiclh the blanching operation takes place is sometimes rendered slightly alkalino with about  per cent of sodadiusm caulf lower az potato iif it is desired to obtain a very white product in tho ease of the desiccated cauliflower it is necessary to expose the heads for a few minutes to tile fumes of burning sulphur after blanching and to wash them thoroughly before they aro placed in the stoves owinig to the large quantity of water they contain b of cauliflower will only yield b to b wlien dried potatoes in slices can be made to assume a rich yellow colour after being dried if previous to the desiccation they are plunged for a few minutes into a bath of very dilute sulphuric acid after which they must be well washed potatoes are prepared both as slices and in the form of small prisms and dried potatoes thus treated will when well soaked and cooked produce as good a dish as fresh ones fried or prepared for the tablejtaraxlevery considerablo quantities of fresh vege tablescerrots turnips cauliflower cabbage and coleriacare converted into socalled  julienne namely a finely shredded mixture for soups the vegetables prepared in this way often consist mainly of the trimmings and parings of those used in larger slices for drying or tinning separately and on this account the article is sold at a low price the mixture is emade after the drying operation is cpmplete to prepare desiccated vegetables for consumption they require to be soaked for some five or six hours i water before they are boiled but this steeping process is not necessary when they are used for soupdried rerbsas the delicate flavour of many herbs can be maintained when they have been carefully dried and as it is only possible to obtain green herbs during certain limited seasons most of the varieties in common use for culinary purposes can be obtained in the form of a dry powvder in glass bottles among the herbs thus prepared mention may be made of basil mint sage thyme lemon thyme marjoram tarragon parsley winter savory and chervilthe mode of preparation is understood to be simple desiccation in hot stoves or ovens of the actual leaves rejecting the stalks and woody fibre certain of the herbs can be had in tho form of mixtures suitable for the flavouring of soups or broth this method of employing herbs for the kitchen is much superior to the old fashioned plan of suspending them in the shape of bunches to the rafters a practice which still maintains in country districts the chief difference made in the desiccation of herbs and that of vegetables is that the former are not blanched or plunged into boiling water or steam but go into the hot chamber direct in order to preserve the full flavour the drying is carried a little farther than is customary with vegetables or potatoes by employing a lower degree of heat but prolonging the stay in the stoves so that on completion of the operation the herbs can be crumbled into dry powder
