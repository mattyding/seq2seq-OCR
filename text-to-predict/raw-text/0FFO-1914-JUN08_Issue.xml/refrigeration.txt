refrigeration what bas been achieved possibilities of ftrther i growththe application to modern industry of the preserving power f cold has undoubtedly receivedl its greatest impetuis and development from food commerce conversely it mav be said with equal truth that no single factor has developed great international tradles of food suipply to the extent that refrigoration has done ihe riss of mechanical refrigeration has indeed been a wonderful spectacle and all the world has seen this because the application of this moslern commercial seience has been so bound up with pulblic needs ut probably few of those engaged in tho indtustry itself and ftwer still ofthe general public are aware of some of the directions in whieh mechanical r efrigerationiill develop during say tho next  years a period similar in length to that in which it has so far been commercially applied a brief risum of a few of the features of this great factor in modern food ecmmerce will prvido some foundation for the suggestions made in this articlemluch has been written and therefore little need be repeated here concerning the inception and rapid growtlh of the application of mechani cal refrigeration to the transport and storage of meat dairy produce fruit and so forth the foimdations of this commercial science were laid not a great whilo before the eighties and it is an interesting point to note that the earliest overseas trade in the carriage of mecat by artificially produced cold was instituted from the country vhich has now some  years later opened her own ports to the free entry of the meat that she must now find from with out it was the united states whose meat producers in the seventios so successfullv exported meat in ships chambers cooled only by the aid of tanks contaiuing ice and salt freezing mixture and today it would seem one of times revenges that thie descendants of those same firms are fast acquiring with their huge accumulations of capital the leading points of advantage in tho worldwide frozen meat trade which is now prosecuted from all the cornors of the earthmechanical refrigeration is now responsible for bringing to this country about threequarters of a million tons of meat per annum and this quantity representing rather more than one fifth of the total national meat consumnption ean be shown by statisties not to have displaced other food but to be an added supply from which it may be assumed the plhysique of the nation has duly benefited it vill be asked what charge has refrigeration made on this supply and when it is replied that argentine beef for example comes at a sea transport charge of d per lb and austraijan and niew zealand mutton at a charge of d per lb for sea freight the economy to tho public purso is apparent mechanical refrigeration at any rate has not prosereed its exploiters from the cheapenlingr intluenees of competition as the refrigerated sea freight from australasia and elsewhere was in the early days three or fotur tunes what it is nowilefyrignrating equraent in shirsthe vpst marine equipment bv which this marntifestly economical trade is carried on is in itself both expensive and elaborate and it is of

new quarters for overmeas meat is stimulating the search for and tlhse discovery of supplies in new reions all over the world involving the provision of refrigerating equip menit to meet fresh conditions of transportr aud storage  the necessity vet to devise means for protecting food by old storage in all its stages from the produecer to the ronslmlloor the inevitable recognition by the public in the near future of the fact thai refriceration applied to fooe in its latest stages namely in the hands of the retailer and in thle honme of the consumner is both economical and promotive of improved hygiene  possible development in the near future in the application of mnechani cal refrigeration to foecds and other c oin modities not alone for its effect in preventing decay btit because it preserves the moisture content of an article wlich when sold by weight wil thus treated realize an enhanced pricea few remarks with regarcl to eaeh of the above considerations may throw sorne light oin the present and future development of ineclani cal refrigeration as applied to food in the first place the changes that are proceeding very rapidly at the present tine in the frozell meat trade distinctly point to the inereased service that will be demanded of refrigeration for the wvorlds food supply of the future the united states as a newi meat importer is stimulating production in manv quarters argen tina and australasia are both likely to have their meat resources taxed to the iutmost to fill this new channel of trade and the opening of the panama canal will shortly have created new shipping routes from both sources of supply to the ports oen both the eastern and western american seaboardsthe linley systemin this connexion it will not be out of place to refer to a system of preservation used in conjunction with refrigeration which allows of beef being carried on long voyages at a tempera ture high enough to retain the softness of themeat and consequently to realize a ratboer higher value when it is marketed this is the linley system a process involving the admission into the refrigerating chamber of formaldehydo in a gaseous form which effectually sterilizes the suiface of the moeat against bacterial actioni vwhich wrould otherwvise ultimate at a chillinig temperature this sterilizing medium being practically imperceptible even to chemical analysis as far as its presence on the meat is concerned the linley system is now installed on  ships and last year  quarters of beef were borne from argedtina herethat meat carried under the linley system should bho

procluction and consumptioll it is eloquent testimonv to the overwhelming advantages of refrigeration that notwithstanding the fact that other preservative systems are able to make food impervious to bacterial action and decay for a long period cold storage is paramount todcia as a foodl preserver refrigeration talkes nothing from and adds nothing to the foodi it protectsiannv stages at which food
