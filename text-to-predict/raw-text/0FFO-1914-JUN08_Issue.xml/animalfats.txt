animial fats our dependence upon ieorts lard and other producmuch satisfaction should result from the statement by a leading authority that no country is better catered for in the matter of highclass edible animal fats than the united kingdom one of the reasons being that the people of no other country demand a higher or even equally high grade article con sidering the extent to which this country is dependent upon foreign countries and the colonies for meat supplies it is not surprising that the greater part of the edible animal fats used are also imported at the moment the united kingdom uses lard and other animal fats to the value of about  millions sterling per annum of this amount between  and  millions are represented by importsthis is not the place to discuss the subject of the shortage which is now becoming apparent in the worlds supply of fats animal fats dependent as they are on the supply of animals are at most remaining stationary if not actually declining as regards production as herds gradually give place to agricultural land so also does the mcat supply tend to fall off or at least to appreciate in price and with it the supply of animal fat tihe solution of the problem would therefore appear to be along the lines of securing an increased supply of vegetable oils and fats some authorities go so far as to say that in increased production of vegetable oils lies our only hope for the future be that as it may the manufacture of animal fats is a flourishing industry nowhere more bo than in this countrylatdof the animal fats used lard is the chieft while the united states has almost ceased to export meat to great britain the fact is worth particular notice that that country last year sent us lard valued in round figures at three and a half maillions sterling and this irrespective of other animal fats canada is making rapid progress in the manufacture of lard in illustra tion of which may be quoted the fact that our imports from the dominion in  were valued at  as compared with  in  the netherlands germany and den mark send fair supplies a considerable increase being recorded in the case of the formerlard is imported into all the big ports london liverpool southampton glasgow leith and hull a small quantity is landed at newcastle and several other ports the principal export of lard to this country from the united states is now a refined product which is generally shipped in wooden pails con taining b and boxes containing double that quantity the amnount shipped from the united states to this country in tins is limaited i and is chiefly for reexport from the various ports the lard is distribthted in the pails and boxes just as originally receivedthe rxrncnr ledustmyof the unrefined lard imported the bulk is refined in lancashire though fair quantities are dealt with elsewhere the english refiners generally put their products into small packages and earthenware jars for some years past there have been great developments in the lard refining industry in the united states there the large packers do thc refining in separate buildings speciallv erected for the purpose and adjoining the abattoirs a circumstance which ensures that expenses can be kept down to a minimnun the stringent covernmient insper tion enforced in these establishments as to the fats allowed to be iused for lard form a guarantee of the purity of the latter a similar remark applies to the chief refineries in this countrvthe absence of an uptodate consus pre vents the publication of statistics relating to homeproduced lard the annual output of this however is estimated at a value of fully a million and a half sterling though there are no firms in the united kingdom manufacturing lard on such a large scale as in the united states some of our leading producerschiefly baconcuring firmsturn out very considerable quantities their products mzorcover are pro duced under most admirable conditions in ireland which is a large producer the lard is still done up to a considerable extent in bladders a practice wluch is also followed though not on the same scale in england in denmark a large proportion of the lard is done up in bladdersthere is nowv a great deal of competition with lard and margarine and compoimd lards these compound lards whlichl aec used almost exclusively by bakers are mado either from cottonseed oil and oleo stearin in varvinig proportions o from cottonseed oil solely hardened by a new process to tho required consistencyoleo oil and preamier jusolen oil which after lard is one of the chief animal fats used is a solid haring an appearance somewhat similar to butter the prlparation of oleo oil from the fat of the bulloeks takes approxi mately six days during wrhich the oil is separated from the stearin when the separation process is finished the oleo oil is dranvn into tirrces in wlhich it is shipped this product is pra tically all used in the manufacture of margarine though a few bakers and especially the large biscuit manufacturers are usmg it to an in creasing extent the production of oleo oil in this country as compared with the united states is limited owring
