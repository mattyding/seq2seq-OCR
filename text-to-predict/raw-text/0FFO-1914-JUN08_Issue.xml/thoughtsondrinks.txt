thoughts on driinks geographical aftnities in liquors savage beverages and civilizeddrink my children  said dr sangrado health consists in the suppleness and humeetation of the parts drink water in great abundance it is a universal menstruum that dissolves all kinds of salts said that same authority again  if thou feelest in thyself any reluctance to the simple element there are innocent aids in plenty that will support thy stomach against the insipid taste of water sage for example and balm will give it an admirable flavour and an infusion of corn poppy gilyilower and rosemary will render it still more delicious the monks who in vented chartreuse improved on the spanish doctors recipe for we are told that among the ingredients of that most fragrant of liqueurs are bahm leaves orange peel dried hyssop tops peppermint wormwood angelica root and seed einnamon mace cloves tonquin beans calamus arovmaticu and cardamonms nor one may suspect is the basis of chartreuso mere water it is a beautiful mixture wlhich for variety perhaps has only been equalled by a certain beverage which was brewed at the close of the ashanti campaign when in the need of escaping from the feversmitten region it became desiraible to ditpose of a superfluity of commissariat stores and sir garnet wolseley gave the order to  use them up the order had plainly to be obeyed so the things wvere dumped together into camp kettles and cauldronspickles and sauces jams and sweet things out of tins beer and wines bandy and chlorodyne and liebigs extractoverything in ono awful witches potion it was all boiled together and drunk hot to the health of queen victoria and the glory of sir garnet and the british arms the drink was named coomassie some say that it was stirred with the famous umbrella but it has probably never been brewed againlit has more than once been maintained that when you start to mix a drink the more things you mix the better on the principle of the colours in oriental needlework one who was an acknowledged authority on both literature and gastronomics in london  years ago used to pride himself on his making of punch  if you get the basis right he would declare  nothing else matters the basis was always the samenamely a pint of brandy a pint of rum a pint of gin a quart of champagne and a quart of strong tea on this theme he would embroider lovingly a little soda waternot too muchand the juice of half a dozen oranges with another one sliced in and some sugar these would be matters of course thereafter came what might hap as a spray or two of mignonette a tumbler of strawberry ice half a bottle of euraeoa some juice from a jar of pre served ginger such odds and ends of wine as might be handy and a few crushed fruits from the dessert a dash of bitters a chocolate cream or two some eggs beaten up a sliced cucumberthere are men still living in london who even now recall those punches with a sighgeogaphy or darsa great contribution to science is waiting to be made by the man who will really elucidate the principles of the geographical affinities of drinks certain broad facts of course are obvious as that one beverage is suited to a cold climate and another to a hot but this is but a rudiment of the matter or why is a bronx or dry martinez so vastly preferable to a swvizzle in say new orleans and a swizzle so much superior to a cocktail in barbados  and why among swizzles is the  green  more peculiarly excellent in barbados than on any other of the islands  mint juleps which are so indisputably the appropriate and pre destined drinks in the hotter parts of the southern united states become intolerable in india nor can any waiter though pouring it from the same bottle and treating it with equal skill make absinthe taste in regentstreet as it does in the boulevard des italiens some liquors like some cigars and the manners of some people will not export and some drinks are as exactly adapted to individual palates as pineapple was to the palate of charles lamb but one is compelled to believe that this is only one facet of the matter a liquor holds certain affinities so subtle as to be beyond analysis to the soil and climate in which the plant from which it came has grown and the people who breathe the air of that same country are charged with the same affnitieswhen the celts in ireland first brewed usquebaughthe water of liic from which the name of  whisky  is derivedthey madle it over fires of peat from their own bogs since then irish whisky the irish peasant and the irish atmosphcre have all smelled of peat together and when pat sits down to drink all is happy harmony between him the potheen and the good turf smoke in another country another  water of life  is made but french grapes grow in a lighter soil and are soaked with sun like the frenchman so the air and alphonse and his cau de vie though he rarely calls it so are bright and buoyant togetherat home and aitoadsak in japan is quite an excellent drink because it belongs to the atmosphere it liarmo nizes with its environment of bright sun and flimsy houses and the little cups in which it is served but transport sak to the british din ing room and drink it brutally out of sherrv glasses and it becomes a thin and dismal beverage when you live in russia you may learn to like vodka though only a russian born perhaps can

rum with sea faring folk is something more than an accident good rum is made on islands within sight and hail of salt water from cane which grows in the sea air and long before admiral vernon  old grogram  from the  grogram  orgros grain cloak whieh he wore mixed water with the liquor and gave his nickname to the grog our sailors in the west india trade had learned that run was the drink for the sea old sailormen aver that they can actually detect the perfume of rum in a stiff sou wester in its proper home rum is a fact of considerable importance the man who would never dream of ordering a long drink made of rum in his english golf club finding himself stretched at ease in the shade of a broadjamaican verandah knows  planters punch lo be the one indicated and foreordained consolation

believe that the evil of drunkenness is a debt which savage races owe entirely to the intrusion of civilization as a matter of fact there wero few savage peoples who had not learned or perhaps remembered from some older  civilization  rude methods of brew ing or distilling without help from white men not that our sin in this regard has not been heavy enough but it is only necessary to readt the records of old missionary travels to learn how uiiversal was drunkenness over all the extent of unpenetrated afiica sir harry jolmston has recently dwelt on this fact livingstone has an illuminating description of the angola palmtoddy muloca which lie the mexican maguey juice  is not at all in toxicating when fresh but if allowed to stand till the afternoon causes intoxication and

it also crumpled the baloinda but it is to be feared that shinto has more disciples than mr kipling among iiilicd peoples there is probably more whisky drunk for professedly therapeutic pur poses as a cure for chills and fevers agues colds malaria and snake bite than is con sumed of any medicine known to the pharma copceia and things often happen with drinks in the treatment of disease which science has difficulty in explaining the present writer knew the case of a coloured woman in trinidad who was dying beyond any hope of typhoid and pleaded to be allowed a drink of coconut juice she was beyond the reach of good or harm so she had her coconuts and drank the juice not of one but of eight in succession perhaps a gallon of liquid and the orgie in disputably saved her life on hot and awful days in the tropics there are not many pleasanter beverages than fresh coconut water when a native boy has been sent up to knock down half a dozen of the nuts and a dexterous slice of the

comning in another and far distant part of the world tired and weary with a hot spring days trarping through the woods to a maple grove where the trees were tapped and drinking deep draughts of the

almost driven out brandy pawnee pawnee is only the hindustani word pani for water over the greater part of india but neither brandy nor whisky is native to hindustan scotch whisky has largely supplanted the indigenous rve in the making of long drinks in polite circies in the united states  but there is some plausibility in the view that that is owing to the popularity of golf between which

are all familiar wvith oceasions when the sug gestion of refreshment presents itself as indubitably pleasing but when the notion of pouring into ones self a whole long something andsoda is somehow
