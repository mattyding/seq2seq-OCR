foods for tile frugai e a dissertation upon economythe want of proportion between the cost of many foods and their nutritive value has been i remarked for ages and the virtue of frugality has been assigned for centuries to some races denied to othersthe chief form of waste which has struck foreign observers for at least  years is our pot au ft or stock soulp while our unsavoury dustbins bear witness only too strongly to the manner in which spare food is left to decay the systematic saving of the fragments of the feast the regard for the  trimmings  after the  swarry will possibly never be taught to our peoplestle hope of this form of frugality is not great but a fashion for soup at the popular meal might do something in the right direction it is rather surprising that the temperance party has done nothing to inculcate the use of soup among the classes where drunkenness is most to be feared almnost all soups may be said to be frugal but for young and active folk pea soup is par ticularly good prepared with rmixed herbs and seasoned with salt and pepper it is regarded as a luxury by those whom it benefits and it might advantageously be served in cold weather to children attending country schools it is never to be had at a railway refreshment room though it would often be just the sus taining diet most needed where time for a regulafr meal was lacking the meat extracts served in its stead are mostjy stimulants notfoods twenty years ago the cheapness of lentils led to thawt pulse being recommended but it is less palatable than peas and has stood for some years at an equal price the price of good peas sound maples is almost a penny per lbfrugality might be expected to show itself in the next course for we are a maritime people unfortunately the wastefulness of our fisheries is so patenlt that the very excursionists and trippers note it and comment on the anomaly cornwall makes something like a system of marinating fish and reaps as reward a steady and profitable trade with italy and the mediter ranean but speaking generally a large part of a heavy catch of fish is wasted at the port where it is lanlded wvhen sold to farmers for manuro it serves some future purpose of food indirectly but a frugal governmont would provide at every big certtre of the fisbing industry a preserving tinning and marinating factory ready to take a catch however large a price of a penny per lb would be sufficient to bless both the fisherran and the factorycomparison of foodsfew things are more opposed to frugality than the etiquetto of the fish course which is in some ways almost hopeless as a problem the middle ages had their ponds for carp and other freshwvater fish in almost every parishl and to this day the sport of angling attracts thousands of the quieter type of skilled work men and so forth to the banks of thames and severn and wye but not  per cent of them know how to cook the fish andieven if they taste them in private it would be the depth of meanness to offer them to a guest yet wvell cooked they are good eating even the humble roach and daee are not quite sotasteless as the whiting which being a sea fish is allowed a place in the best menus not all sea fish bowvever have as yet secured that honour oreger one of the most nutritious of all fish is taboo thougih we are told that in mockturtle it now plays that part which lewvis carroll assigned to tho calfs head in the last few years a praiseworthy frugality has succeeded in placing one fish on the table of the poor which was formerlv unknown cat and dog fish and all the tribe of which the shark is the chief are now sold as  flakle and at d to d per lb are really good food firm and whlite though rather coarsethe meat dishes can never be cheap except ns a concentrated form of food saving labours of dilestion and giving strengtth and caloric quickly the aniraal which feeds most econo rnically is the goat but english taste does not inclino to kid next in natural cheapness should come the pig but we have as a nation let our herds of swine dwindle to a dangerously low level and prices for more than a vear have been so high as to constitute a real trouble to the poorof bircds the goose is the most economical and can be sold profitably at sd per lb for a wellnourished and plumnp birdl in flavour it is of course excellent and its alleged richness  is in reality an economv as it makes other rich food at tho same meal un desirable the uso of eggs even at d each is on the side of frugality owing to the extremely conceiitratei naturo of the foocl and the absence of all waste of the products of the cow milk is the most economical butter the least while cheese occupies a medium position butter howevcr has to bo considered in rela tion to its making palatable the bread with which it is eaten such bread onlv costing ld per lb for the best quality in the eiarket oatmeal and rmilk is one of the most frugal as it is one of the best of foods wvith respect to vegetables frugality lies for the most part in their free use when in season and cheap they vary in a remarkable degree with rainfall and other climatic conditions and it is foolishto pay higlh prices at times of drought for the quality is alwvays inferiora choice of vegerablmsthe haricote bzanrs which sooften form an appetizing dish in france are not rearlv as nuch used in england

prevented ihe average person appears to look upon a tree as somethiag eternal some thing that will go on bearing so nmany bushels of fruit year after year in reality the period of full bearing is comparatively short and the difference between fuu bearing and average bearing is great no investmenat of capital shows a higher dividend than that in planting young iruit trees the horticultural world specialy favours dwarf trees which bear very large yields good fruit in season is alwavs a frugal food of recent years there has been a wise attempt to improve the blackberry and a replacement
