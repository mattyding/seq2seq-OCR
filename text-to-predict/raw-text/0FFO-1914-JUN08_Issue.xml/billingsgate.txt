billingsgate the oldest corporation marketwith the constant increase in the population of london and the spread of the modern city over a greater area billingsgate iarket is surrendering some of its old importance as a eenxtre for the sale and distribution of fish the volume of the trade there is not declining the lessened importance of billingsgato is merely relative to the growth of london as a whole the trade at the thamesside market is actually increasing and the accommodation at billingagate is taxed to its utmost capacitywegntr of fish handedthe amount of fish delivered at the market was  cwt in  and  cwt in  the total receipts from all sources were in   twentyfive years ago the total weight of fish handled was about  cwt a year and the annual receipts about  so that the increase of trade is not inappreciable yet it is difficult to see how the trade of billingsgate is to be increased probably any such ex pansion of trade as would enable the increase in the weight of fish handled at the market to correspond with the growth of london is undesirable the change in the current of trade whereby large purchasers deal direct with the coast is a convenience to many fish dealers and will probably continue another change wlhich has gradually been brought about is the increase in the percentago of landboine compared with waterborne fish reaching the market there was a time when the bulk of the fish handlod at biuingsgate was caught in the local reaches or at least in water not more distant than the thames estuary now over  per cent of the fish sold reaches the market by rail in spite of the fact that there is no direct rail connexion and that all the railborne fish has to be finally delivered to biuingsgate by cart or lorry the largest tonnages are sent to the market by the great northern which in  dispatched  cwt by the london and northwestern  cwt and great western  cwt the total of railborne fish to which all the trunk lines contribute having been  cwt in  and  cwt in  the landborne fish comes from a very wide area much of it having been netted in the white and icelandic seas but the water borne catch is mainly from the north sea being delivered to the market daily by the carrier ships of four of the principal north sea trawling companies in addition to the trawl fish there is often a large catch of norwegian herring landed at biuilngsgateax as cet fish marifless dominant in the fish supply of the metropolis than in past years the market has had a long reign the history of billingsgate has never yet been written but it is known to be the most ancient market belonging to the corporation it is mentioned in a proclama tion dated  and a charter of henry iv dated may  gave to the citizons of london the right to coulet tolls and custormsin billings gate a privilege subsequently confirmed by charter of charles ii and by the court of common council the first act of parliament relating to the market was passed in the year   and  william iii cap xxiv by which it was mado  a free and open market for all sorts of fish whatsoever and under this statute the dues to be taken at the market were annuauy set by the court of aldermen the toll charged at the present day is only id per cwt there have been various parlia mentary enactments from time to time but that of  conisolidated and amended the acts previously passed and enacted that on evory day of the week except sunday biuings  gate should be a free and open market for the wholesale and retail sale of any and au sorts of fish no limit being put upon the quantity offeredkklkny ymrrs on sae sitethe existing market buildings date from the year  but the market is known to have been rebuilt many times following the last rebuild ing the corporation at the request of the trades put up additional buildings on a site opposite the market and this auxiliary market is now largely used by those engaged in the dried fish trade partieularly by haddock smokers latterly this market has been fairly well occu pied but for a number of years it was a loss to the corporation which in the past  years has expended no less a sum than  sterling upon its markets it was stated before the royal commission of  that the corpora tibn had in a period of  years expended  on billingsgate market alone and it has expended large sums since that time an endeavour is now being made to con vert billingsgate into a six days market and the delivery of fish to the market on sundays for icing purposes has been materi ally reduced by the cooperation of the trade and railway companies curiously enoubh it is the sunday market for shrimps which is the main obstacle in the way of this reformosganizaronx o saxsit will repay anyone intersted in the food supply of the metropolis to spend the three hours from  am to  am any weekday at the market the huge carriers from the north with perhaps a norwegian herring fisher and a dutch eel boat have come alongside the market quay overnight and the work of landing the fish for sale by auction begins at  am from that hour onwards there is a scene of bustling activity which is only matched at the other great markets of the metropolis and yet in many respects billingsgate is different from them all the rail borne fish arrives to supplement that brought bythe north sea carriers and the streets in thovicinity of the market are crowded with the hundreds of carts ready to rush the fish off to the thousand and one retail shops which still depend on billingsgate for their supply the variety of fish is very large for in addition to salmon when in seasonthe sales at illingsgateo include all fish from halibut to skate from soles to shrimps white bait shell fish of all kinds and many fish that are often unknown outside trade circles the quautity sent to market varies but over  tons of fish per day are handled at the marketthe trading and distribution is all corn preesed within a few hours in the ordinary way the ringing of a bell at  pm announces the closing of the market for the day and the beginning of the cleaning down operations the real business finishes however at a much earlier hour thanks to the rapidity with which the fish is handled by the fine body of porters who run about with boxes which weigh between two and three cwt with an ease and nonchal ance which has to be seii to be appreciatedby  or  oclock tho rush is generally over and by tho early afternoon biuingsgte is  a silent and deserted market given over to the care of the cleaners and the custody of the small number of city police who are delegated to this special duty
