the swallows nesting there twitter youi cainnot see a glimpse even of the high mosques within i entered the city once mere lost myself in its mazes and was obliged to take a native cab in order to got

black but living and moving sil houett agp inst the sky to listen to the clatter of bills wvhnen the father stork suddenly flies down to a nest with foodrussia the masterbokhara is a sort of musulman perfection thlere is no progress to be obtained there except after tho destruction of old forms the bokhareso keep to the forms of their religion and its ethical laws they wear their clothes correctly they inow their crafts thoy are a great contrast to the russians who transgress tho forms of their christianity inventing new personal rites to the russians who aro careless and inoxact and in their worship often non chalant to their god to the russians who wear nothing correctly and come out in almost any sort of attire to the russians so ignorant and clunisy in their crafts yet russia has all before her and boklhara has all behind her the bokharese have no ambition civilization and mechanical progress do not tempt thenl they have a happy smile for everything that comes along but nothing moves them a russian motorcar comes bounding over the cobbles whooping and coughing its alarm signalsa score of dogs try to set on it and bite it as it passes and the natives sit in their cup board shops and laugh if tho car stops they do not collect round it as would a village of caucasian tribesmen for instance there was one bokhariana sart in full cloak and turban vho rode a bicycle an astonishing exceptionthe russians at present hold bokhara very lightly but will no doubt tighten tlheir hands on it later as they are taking the solidification of their central asian empire verv seriously at present there are tno passports and thero is mixed mnoncy but passports are coming in and the banks are taking up all the ancient sartislh bits they can get and giving russian silver in exchange thero are several russian banks within the city walls and they have a great influence the emir is friendly towards russia and is a pompous figure at the russiari court though it is rumoured that in his native palaces he whiles the long empty dsy awayv by playing such elementary card games as durak snap and happy families the russians have permission to build schoos in the city and the russian bricklayer is to be seen at work with trowel and line whist the native navvy carries the hod to and fro tho foreign goods in the bazaar are mostly cotton and if you exarnine the splendidly gay prints that go to form the clothing of tho natives vou find it is all marked imloscow manifaetulre thee bokhareso merehants go to nizhni fair not only to sel but to buy there are no english in the streets no tourists no americans indeed i asked myself once in wondermwere are tho americans  the onlv yeoplo in western attire are commercial travellors commernaats and they are mostly ruissians or armonians though germanns are occasionally to be seen singers sewing machines are of eourse installed they are m every town in the wide world tho cinoma also has come and a green poster announces that the tango will be shown after the presentation of a striking comedy called the suflrageuebut what does this really matter  let lus ask the deliberate stork standing on one leg on the height of tho mosque of lavakhedei the mosque tower has a clock and the stork seems to bo trying to read the time tlut he will give no answer nor will the mnsulmans below they also are scanning the wall to see if it is nearer the hour to pray and the clock be it observed is not set by petersburg time
