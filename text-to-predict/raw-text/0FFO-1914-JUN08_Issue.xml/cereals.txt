cereals      the prnxcipal varieties different ktis of grain as foods some neglected formsthe irmemorial antiquity of tlhe three cereals wheat barley and rye is evidenced by their nonexistence in a really wild state now and again botanists in their travels stumble upon plants which are at least worth investigating for their claims to be original forms but it is doubtful if any one case hals satisfied the impartial inquirer or may not equally have been a degeneration and reversion from the corn of an area once cultivated oats are somewhat different and the saying to sow ones wild oats is based on the fact that unlike the other cereals there are wvild oats to sowthe feeding of wheat to animnals in the unground form was probably never extensive its value for a higher use being early discerned the valuable horses of early greek assyrian and egyptian warriors seem to have been frequently fed on wheat as well as barley but this was an exception from tho rule it marked the exceptional value of the special animal today when wheat and wheaten bran have become so cheap there seems to be a sub stantial chance of direct feed use increasing both for cattle and poultryawveattoday the feed use of wheat is a growing problem canada is to keep more live stock and more fowls such things are the signs of an improving agriculture but wvill the poorer grades of canadian wheat be sent to england and feedingstuffs imported into canada the natural economics forbid the supposition nvith respect to poultry keeping in the united kiingdom the growth in the use of wheat as direct feed is surprising the matter hardly received any serious notice at all until about i  years ago when mr r h rew reporting onl the sales of british wheat at marklane showed that a material percentage consisted of b kinds sold avowedly as feed since then the expert poultrv journals such as the poultry world and the like have urged on poultry breeders for egg production the peculiar value of wheat especially does it seem to be the mainstav of egg laying from october to february inclusive the critical and trying monthsbabrleybarley owing to its beard its integument and general groowth and habit has a special call for serving in a prepared form ground torritied or pearled yet as a nude and pure grain it is oddly esteemed in the mhediterranean region and the stable boy to achilles shakes hands with the swarthly lad from andalusia whose head is set on his masters horses being the cyniosure of that wonderful rotten ro v which is the pride of madrid they shake hands for their secret is the same the horses of achilles and the prancing beauties of the prado are alike to feed off barley there must be something in the miediterranean climate for in our north barley is not a good feed for horses rather are the poorer qualities relegated to the pigs nor need this use be despised  indeed the faullt with us is the other way wvhv should we pay rmillions a year to russia forgrinding barley that ouir owni poorer lands could grow cheaply  of malting barley this is not the place to speak we salute the name of noah or another who first discovered that great secret the properties of pure barley when it is steepedoatsoats of all the grains are those of which there is the largest use in an xunprepared form to say of an english horse that ho is full of oats is to say all that can be said as a guarantee of health and spirits nor is the johnsonian cllt and tihrust to be despised oats said the doctor are the food of horses in england and ef men in scotland and where rejoined the scotsman can you find such horses or such men  recent vears have been filled with the husk controversy of which it may suffice to say that on the one hand a nearly huskless oat like gartons leader seems to be the ideal of the higher farmning while on the other the cheap foreign oats often  per cent husk have at tht very low prices accepted for thlen a vast inumlxer oi uses so that husks and husk meal are saleable separately and for mixing purpose hav iundoubted value the maize trade i still largely in the clear grain but cracked chipped broken and otherwise pre pared the staple sells with the greater readiness and we must esxpect to see this tendency developcanary seedwe have a formn of grain whien grows well in any fairly dry and sunny countysay betwveen the wash and the exe as dr fream showed in thc times now o years ago it is a true cereal and its value as food is very high yet it is scarcely ever grown its name is canaryseed if we called it by its botanical name oi phkrlani or if it was called african corn as maize is called indian corn it would probably be in large and steady demand but ttecause it is supposed to be the food of canaries it is relegated to the bird seeds at present owiang to the failure of supply from urkey it is at a very high price and would pay hand somely to grow in this country wvhether it would pay at more ordinary times is another matter but there is reason to supposed that its natural productiveness is high and that it may have an agricultural future before it not only in this country but in our possessions oversca wherein drought is a danger for it is more resistant to that enemy than any other cereal and it is fit for food use in any form a strange plant buckwheat in no way allied to the cereals has a steady sale for feeding to pheasants and it also makes easily digestible and attractive flat cakes which the people of france and the united states get more oppor tunities of appreciating than are afforded
