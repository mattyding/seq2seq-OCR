clubs and taverns celebrated restaurants and inns old british institutions  the french and italian ijasionby leuteatcolon newinat davtsinns have existed since the earliest eras of civilization thero were inns in the roman days in italy and horace has recorded some of their discomforts no doubt there were also inns on the great roads in the roman colonies the roman inn in britain was probably much like the resthouses which are scattered on all the roads of our indian empirein medieval days there were inns in the towns and at all the great shrines to which pilgrimages were made chaucers canterbury pilgrims started from the tabard inn south wark an inn which with its many galleries and carved wood was in existence within the memory of man at canterbury they lodged at the checkers of hope in mercerylane and in that picturesque little thoroughfare in which the threedecker housos almost bump their foreheads together there are still remains in some of the buildings of the old house of rest and refreshmnent there is a fine old pilgrims inn much as it was in the days when pilgrim ages were part of tho life of the people at glastonburyin the days of good queen bess the poets and the players and geatlemen adventurers soldiers and sailors frequented the taverns of london and in those days were the beginnings of clubs inowadays in our hurry of speech we talk of a clubhouse usually as  the club but the club is really only a gathering of men and not the house whlere they meet sir walter raleigh was the founder of the club in breadstreet which met at  the mermaid of which shakespeare is said to have been a mem ber ben jonson and his  sons that most exclusive literary club of those days met as herrick has recorded at  the sun  the dog  the triple tun and ben himself alluded with a touch of regret to the days when he drank  bad wine at the devilshakespeare no doubt pictured the inn of his days in the  boars head in eastcheap where old falstaff took his ease for in his happy carelessness he would not have been in the least likely to attempt to reconstruct in his play an inn of the time of henry iv fromtabard lyn soutbwakfrom an old printthe talk in the tavern we get some glimpses of the rough food of those daysjoints of mnutton and apple jacks and tewkesbury mustard as a relish but the drinks were of more importance than the meats or the bread and bordeaux canary and sack must have brought the hostess the chief part of her profit falstaffs bill in wvinch the capon was priced at as d and his sack at dinner at s d sup ports this idea the anchovies that the fat knight ate with his sack after dinner were the  savoury  of that day wvhat the  sweetest morsel left unpicked  by falstaff was shakes peare does not tell usduring the civil war the inns all over the countrv constantly come into the history of those times as the headquarters of the generals of the contending armies tho puritans during the days of t lie comrnmonwoalth preached against all the luxuries and it was not until the rostora tion that the taverns flourished again and that a man might feast without being donounced by praiso god barebones and his likethe days or pxrysif pepys does not give us many glimpses of the taverns of his day though we know that he ate a lobster and drank some mine at the cock before hie took mistress knipp for an outing on the thames and while he does notlhing moro than allude to woods  our old house for clubbing he gives some excellent examples of what were the dinners of those days there was in his  fine dinner  a great quantity of meat for a loin of veal and a leg of miitton were both on the table and that thoroughly english dish marrow bones hlis  pretty dinner with its division into  first courso  and  second course was dressed by a man cook and was quite an excellent meal though the chickens must have grown cold while the company ate their fish it will be remembered that it ran thus a braco of stewed carps six roasted chickens and a jowl of salmon hot for the first course a tansie two neats tongues and cheese the second i fancy that mrs pepys being frenclh may have accounted for the delicacy of taste shewn by the writer of the famous diary miany men since those days must have envied him that treasure of a maid who could make a frieassde of rabbits and chickens a dish which sturdy beefeating britons must have considered very unenglish the delicacies that pepys relished so much are most of them still obtainable i sometimes see botargo in the windows of a piccadilly vendor of provisions and i have eaten lamprey pie but found it rather too oily for modern tastethe countrv inns of the days of the stuarts changed but little i fancy during the time of their immediate successors travelling was slow in those days the nobility and great gentlemen when they came up to london from their country seats journeyed in their huge coaches with a team of many horses and doubtless set out provisioned for the road trusting to themoney than for any very fine taste in dinners though the english gentleman has always shown a pretty taste in the selection of his wines i believe that the first record of what woufd nowadays be called the club dinner is to be found in the resolution of the members of whites that  a dinner should be ready every day during the sitting of parliament at s a head this the members evidently thought was too high a price for half a guinea was the sum eventually charged hot suppers were provided for members of the club at s and oyster suppers at s the hour of dinner was still an early one and supper was a necessary meal the days of very expensive feasts at whites were to come later when lord alvanley prided himself on producing a dish as costly as any ever put before a roman emperor ordering the noixthe two little pieces of flesh from either side of the backboneof  different kinds of game bird to be served as one dish the cost of which came to  s perhaps it was as well that most of the soulth african millionaires at the time of the great boom had never heard of lord alvanley and his wonderful dish otherwise some of them would certainly have attempted to beat his  record that the members of whites had increased the subscription by a guinea in order to obtain a good cook may have urged lord alvanley into his extravagance amongst other early curiosities of club regulations as regards dinner was that of beadles that the expense of all wine drukl at the dinner table should be pooled amongst the men who dined this rule was only rescinded after a historic disagreement which ended in a  break away  of some of the older members of the clubda joiisoxthe taverns in london scarcely altered their ways from the days of ben jonson to the days of dickens their clients sat on the same hard wooden benches and rubbed their heads against the same panelling beer and spirits gradually ousted sack and canary and gas eventually superseded candles but the food altered very little the chops and steaks and lark and kidney pudding of the cheshire cheese of to day was much the fare of that tavern in dr samuel johnsons days dr johnson was the demigod of the taverns but he was welcomed for his conversation and for his great leaming more than for his nice taste in food or drinks mrs piozzi recorded that his favourite dishes were a leg of pork boiled until it dropped from the bone a veal pie with plhms and sugar and the outside cut of a salt buttock of beef the doctor however can be claimed as a fore runner by those strange epicures the futurist school of paris for he poured lobster sauce over his plum pudding which is quite in the futurist style most of the taverns that dr jolmson frequented have vanishedthe cook has crossed the road the rainbow has become a bodegbut his club is still in existencewas not likely to be satisfactory the new man was charles elme francatelli who so far from beinga failure was appointed maitre dhtel and chief cook to queen victoria as being the greatest cook of his day he resigned his court post and later in his career opened a restaurantsoyev nd nte refoszthe reform club retained the services of alexis soyer who had been a chorister in a french cathedral and but for his taste for practical joking would probably have been a priest re is perhaps better remembered to day as the inventor of a sauce than as a great cook but in his tiime he was a celebrity of the first water and the lunches and dinners he prepared at the reforzn were talked of and quoted as the perfection of great feasts soyer himself believed that the mnost recherchw dinner he ever dressed was one he prepared for a seleet party of connoisseurs at the reform club the giver of it telling hinrto spare no expense in proouring the  most novel luxurious and rare edibles obtainable in may i give the menu of this sampayo dinner which will serve to show the enormous mass of food it was still considered necessary to include in a good dinnero mal g dlner poor

bread and meat milk and eggs and food for their servants and provender for their horses the wits and the writers had their clubs and the rowdy young men about town also banded themselves together to annoy peaceable citizens for the mohocs of queen annes reign were just as much a club as were the gentlemen of the hell fire club of later daysthe coffee housesthe coffee houses were the great meeting places in those times of the clubs and many of the older clubs of today still bear the names of the coffees houses on the foundations of which clubhouses afterwards rose the thatched house the name of which the club of the men from the far east bears stood where the conservative club now is and both whites and arthurs owe their names to proprietors of the celebrated choco late house the burning of which was utilized by hogarth in his  rakes progress the earliest record of whites as a clubhouse is a list of members and book of rules dated october   the cocoa tree was origi nally the tory chocolate house of queen annes reign and when it was converted into a clubhouse it became the headquarters of the jacobite party in parliamentoliver goldsmith i fancy in she stoop to conquer gives a true enough picture of a village alehouse and inn in the days when people travelled in their own coaches or rode carrying their personal belongings in saddle bags when he put on the stage the three pigeons with the bumpkin young squire drinking with all comers in the taproom and i think that the dinner old hardcastle had pro vided to do honour to young marlowe may be taken as a fair example of an oldfashioned country house feast in the days when men wore coats with wide skirts a pig and prune sauce a pork pie a boiled rabbit and sausages a florentine a shaking pudding and a taffety cream were what the old gentleman had pro vided and the town bred young fop it will be remembered turned up his nose at the ifig and mocked at the taffety creampig roast pig has always been a thoroughly english dish though i do not remember in these latter days ever to have met prune sauce as its accompaniment lambs eulogy on roast pig occurs at once to the mind and when the old duke of cambridge the father of the ommanderinchief of victorian days was shown the list of dishes which had been prepared in his honour by a great french cook at belvoir and asked if there were any dishes in addition which he could suggest he mentioned tworoast pig and an apple dumpling which the men of his day considered a noble protest against french dishesearly ciunhousesthe rise of the first clubhouses in st jamess street coincided with a period of high gaming and the earlier history of such famous clubs asboodles brookss whites and arthurs isl more remarkable for losses of huge sums oflord rosebery and mr arthur balfour being two of its membersthe sublime society of beefsteaks of which george iv wvhen prince of wales and others of the royal dukes were members was the em bodinient of the britons devotion to beef its motto being beef and liberty the rough humour of its members was intended to contrast with the more delicate wit of the kitcat club just as its rump steaks were held by its members to be superior to the kitcat piespies which in their day were quite as cele brated as those of bellamy the present beef steak club though its cookery is chiefly from the grill is not the old club but took the dere lict name sir hienry irving when at the lyceum theatre used to give suppers in the old beefsteak clubroom which had become part of the theatrecoacng swith the days of the mail coaches came the great inns on the high roads of england and the improvement of the existing inns in the great towns dickens has pictured some of these old inns and faithful worshippers of the great novelist still pay visits to the bull at rochester which he immortalized in pick wick the york house at bath was another of the fine old inns of the coaching days and it unlike most of the old houses has adapted itself to modern requirements the white hlorse cellars from which mr pickwick started on his journey to bath has changed with the times  hatchetts hotel in the basement of which the cellars used to be has disappeared in its later days the rebuilt hatchetts was a very comfortable hostelry and the travellers room the discomforts of which dickens described had no counterpart in the new building the white horse cellar of today is a restaurantin the late twenties and the early thirties some of the largest and most beautiful of the clubhouses in pallmall and st jamessstreet were built and that the feasts in them should do justice to the grandeur of the surroundings the greatest french cooks of the day were invited to take charge of the kitchens when crockford  the fishmonger built the great house which is now occupied by the devonshire club and established his gamingrooms on the first floor he engaged as his cook louis eus tache ude the son of a cook in tho kitchen of louis xvi who after various adventures including a quarrel with mime letitia bonaparte whose maire dmlh he was came to england and was cook to the earl of sefton at  guiineas a year ude who apparently acted as maitre datel as well as cook found the ignorance on gastronomic sub jects of some of the members of crockfords very trying one of them took hin to task for putting onion in soubise sauce another one was very angry with him because he charged him d extra for sauce with a cutlet ude finally resigned telling the committee that he was worth many thousands a year to them and benjamin disraeli recorded this resigna tion as a calamity adding that the new manmodern restaurantsthe club coffee rooms had soon to meet tho competition of the restaurants for late in the sixties and early in the seventies some of the modern restaurants came into existence and ladies began to patronize them the caf royal in regentstreet was foumded as a little eating house by m nicol who had been in a
