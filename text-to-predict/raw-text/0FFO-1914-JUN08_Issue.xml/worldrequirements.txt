world requireents    wheat apreas still to be developedby h norman batitatiain dealing with the worlds wheat supply the seasons are reckoned as from august  the succeeding  months being known as a cropyear though much of tho wheat for that season is not harvested until sovoral months after the inauguration of tho cropyear for instance australia argentina chilo and ltruguay are cutting thoir crops during our midwinter while in india the harvest is being reaped when it is springtimo in this country therefore much of this iadian wheat does not reach our shores in any given year until the concluding months of what is reckoned as our own seasontho whole of tho worlds supply of wheat during the pasb four or five seasons has boen only about equal to actual requlirements this is proved by the fact that nio large reserves have been built up in any country omitting a few very minor countrie which are not ex porters and from whicl it is impossiblo to ob tain any accurato returns tho wheat crop of the whole world for the prosent season is approxinately qr assuming that no serious damage be incurred by tho alrcady deficient crop now growing in indiatotal consmmnirronthis season unless the indian crop suffer very serious damage it is likely that a small balance will remain over and above actual requirements for the  months it may be safely assumed however that the world as a whole will have consuiaed at least qr of wheat between auguist   and july   now according to recent statistics the population is increasing in wheatconsuming countries at the rate of rather moro than  per cent per annum consequently from that causo alone there is an increased consumption of wheat each year in an equal ratio or in other words the annual increased roquirements from the growvth of numbers is approximately qr but to this we must add at least another million quarters to provide for the fact that in certain countries increasing numbers of people are making wheatenbread a part of their ordinary diet where formerly it was either regarded as a luxury or else was simply not known or not held in esteem in certain european countries where the peasants and labouring classes formerlv lived very largely on rye and barley they are now able to afford wheat instead while in the oriont it is only in recent years that its value as a food has been recognized taking all these points into consideration we mav therefore conclude vith safety that each year the world will require an additional quantity of nob less than qr and in  years the increased demand will be over qr per annumwe thus find that within  or a dozen years the world will require annually qr of wheat this wheat will be raised in com petition with other commodities for as the population increases the wants of the masses are correspondingly augmentedundeveloped growing areasit is true that even withouit any additional area the volume of wheat can bo greatly aug mented but it is all a question of profit and therefore of price for the farmer wishes only to grow wheat when it will give him a better return than some other crop for instance in the more southerly american states wheat must compete with cotton and beet in the great corn belt with maize whilo in canada it com petes with linseed barley oats dairyfarming cattle ranching c in argentina and in australia the conflicting claims of flesh food versus grain have to be considered and so in almost all parts of the worldwe must not forget that there are still vast regions of undeveloped or partiallydeveloped land capable of producing wvheat by irriga tion australia will become a world granary north south and east africa may figure among the exporters at least until such time as the black hordes of that vast continent are con verted bv the advance of civilization into wvheatconsuming communities siberia and part of the chineso empire will figure as more important growers yet only perhaps for their own requirements while it is doubtful whether the ratio of advance will be so rapid in canada in the futture as in the pastin the light of present knowledge aad in default of some revolutionary discovery it would appear fairly certain that the price of wheat will be maintained at not less than its present level and that therefore there should be improving prospects for our own wheat growers at home it will be seen also that the margin of supply over demand being com paratively trifling the loss of any important crop in any season would greatly enhance the price of wheat for the whole world if for in stance russia the united states or canada were to drop out as an exporter for a season especially if at a time when crops in other countries wvere somewhat deficient tne effect would be startling and perhaps disastrous
