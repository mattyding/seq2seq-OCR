coffee   inportance of brazilian supplyindigenous to abyssinia and other parts of tropical africa the coffee plant flourishes to day in many tropical lands up to the frost line the wellwatered slopes of the higher altitudes proving the most favourable for the production of the finer qualities of berryearly in the th centuryit wasintroduced into java probably bv way of arabia and its subsequent introduction into surinam and jamaica led to its eventually spreading through out the west indies and thence through the tropical regions of the new wvorldthe dutch who introduced it into ceylon in  subsequently abandoned it but the efforts of the brntish who revivified the languish ing industry in  were so well attended that the value of the coffee exported in  amounted to over j millions sterling ten years later however owing to the disastrous incursions of the coffeeleaf disease the exports dropped to  and by  the value had still further dwindled to a paltry prodnuamr comnmiesijp till the end of the th century the whole of the worlds supply of coffee came from yemen in southern arabia where the true and highlyprized mocha is still produced though much that passes under that name originates elsewhere chiefly in central america later on however the west indies and then java took the lead in production till at the present day brazil contributes nearly three fourths of the total worlds supplythe state of sao paulo in brazil produces more than half the worlds supply of coffee the export does not depend on supply and demand but is regulated by the working of a valorization scheme which has for its object the raising of prices by limitation of supply the expedient adopted by the state was at first that of making a  corner  by buying up all the coffee produced beyond the quantity for which there was a legitimate demand and storing the sturplus to sell as occasion arose the large overproduction soon exhausted the purchasing power of the state and a loan of  had to be raised the coffee in stock being placed in the hands of trustees as a security a tax was levied on coffee exported so as to provide the interest and amortization while prohibitive duties were placed on all coffee exported above a certain amount no more purchases were made by tho state while the trustees were enabled gradually to markettheir supplies regulating their sales

continue bearing for  vears or longer the coffee tree is a highly ornamental evergreen with a pure white fragant blossom and the flowvers and fruit are to be seen together in all stages of development the plant produces two or three crops a year the fruit resembling a dark red cherry and containing two planoconvex coffeebeans enclosed within delicate parch mentlike membranes and embedded together

beverage has won a secure place in public esteem though we cannot be considered a coffee drinking people when com pard with our nieighbours on the continent it is a curious circumstance that in spite of an ainual consumption of some  to  million pounds of coffee ve as a people have never yet mastered the gentle art of making it aright anid this fact together with its relatively higi price has doubtless militated against its more extended use
