preservation of eggs  the principal methods eyloyedthe total number of eggs imported in  from british colonies and foreign countries was  representing inclusive of packages a little more than  tons of these upwards of  millions  tons or  per cent of the years total reached our shores in the months of oetober novem ber and december it is evident that the hens of russia and denmark of holland and italy did not lay these eggs at that period of the year but that this took place months previously and that they had been preserved by one process or another there is no means of discriminating from the returns how many were fresh they were all eggs we are not far frora the mark however when it is stated that  per cent of the imnports from october  to december  are  pickles  or from cold stores which would be about  millions and as the shipment of this class of egg extends from september to february at least  niions of foreign pre served eggs or nearly  per cent of the yearly imports are consumed annually in the united kingdom at present we could not do without them they fill a void that would otherwise be felt in every householdfor cooking pur poses the kitchea is the place for them as there the deficiencies to some extent disappear and the balance of the virtues remaining are utilized for boiling these deficiencies prevailin europe the chief methods employed for pickling  eggs are the use either of lime water or what is known as  water glass that is a solution of silicate of soda in one of these fluids the eggs are immersed for periods of from six to eight months usually within big cement tanks built in cool sweet cellars the effect is the same in either casenamely the lime or the soda respectively sterilizes the water as a consequence of which no bacteria can pone trate the shell by reason of the fact that they are unable to live in the liquid and cannot reach the eggs under such conditions everything there fore depends upon what is the state of the egg when laid by the hen or when preserved as a rule in most continental countries where opera tions are on a large scale the lire water process is used because it is the cheaper for smaler quantities  water glass  finds greater favourcharacrtms  ptesebved eggsmany other methods have been introduced and secret preparations are old ona the market for this purpose some of which have proved excellent these are mainly used by house holders poultrykeepers and smaller localtraders as the question of cost is not so serious as when large quantities are required water glass is a nonproprietary article and therefore competition keeps down the price at one time large quantities of eggs were received from canada the shells of which were coated with glycerine thus effectively closing the pores a system is now in use by some of the great english firms abroad by which the air or gas is exhausted through the shell which is after wards sealed with wax the results of which are very good it is only suitable for use on a large scale as the plant is expensivein america the principal method is cold storage and thousands of millions of eggs are preserved annually in this manner in europe it has not been employed to the same extent again such a system is more suited for large operations where the difficulties arise are that bacteria are very liable to develop and moulds to form at a low temperature which would not otherwiso be the case and that eggs which have been kept in cold storage must be consumed very speedily after they are taken out as deterioration is more rapid than if kept in lime water or waterglasswithout the supplies of preserved egzs either native or foreign winter prices would become prohibitive for  per cent of british householders who from michaehmas to christ mas would simply have to do without these have therefore an important place in the national food supplies they are not how ever and ought never to be sold as fresh nor should they be used for boiling a good quality of egg when put down in april generally comes out well in novembernot as good how ever as when first subjected to the process the fresher it is the better it will ultimately be but it does lose something a poor egg loses still more preserved eggs can be known by roughness of the shell if limed by the yolk losing its firm roundiness by the thin and watery albumen or white and by the odour wlhich is unmistakable
