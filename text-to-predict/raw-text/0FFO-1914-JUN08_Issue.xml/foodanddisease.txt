food and disease mlulnutrition and other maladies preparation of diabetic foodsthat the health of the body is verv closely connected with the naturo and quantity of the food we take is a statement in the nature of a selfevident proposition when we desist from eating food starvation sets in after a longer or shorter period according to the individual when wve eat too much or drink too much distressing symptoms as inevitably supervene ioreover the quantity of food or drink consumed is not the only factor the quality also is a matter of suapreme importance as in cases of malnutrition while the various forms of blood disease more or less loosely classed together as anminia appear to be associated to some extent with the qnestion of nourishment without going so far as extreme partisans do who would seek to prove that all diseases are ultimately due to the consumption of unsuitable food as witness for instance the views of the more advanced vegetarians and fruitarians who attribute cancer and other maladies to the eating of meat it is obvious that a very close connexion exists between the health of the body and the nature of our food supplvthat a healthy individual should be able to take any food with impunity is a statement which probably few will be found to challenge the difficulty arises when we attempt to define what we mean by food there are few subjects about which the opinion of manidnd is more dividedl as will be seen in tbe articles whlichl appear elsewhere in this issue strange foods are eaten with gusto and proclaimed as luxuries in one country which the inhabitants of another country regard with the utmost aversion the turkish habit of eating meat in an advanced state of decomposition appears loathsome to us though it is merelv one of degree as we ourselves testify when wte eat game the nick name which the englishman occasionally applies to his neighbour across the channel is a standing monument of his disgust at the idea of eatingl the frog an article of diet which is greatly esteemed in france examples might be mnultiplied but it is only necessary to refer to the fact that large numbers of persons are honestly convinced that vegetables and fruits are the only natural foods of maankind to show what a diversity of opinion exists on this subjectit might be expected that in this state of affairs science would come to the rescue define the word  food  for us and tell us plainlv what we should eat and what we should avoid in many ways science has been able to throw light on this obscure subject foods have been classified into proteids fats carbohvdrates and the like articles of food have been analysed and the proportions in them of these different groups of food established in cach case food values have been calculated and a whole system of dietetics worked out lhe old saying however still remains true that  one mans meat is another man s poison the human factor comes in and a scheme of food values which works out well in one case may be found anything but satisfactory in another moreover it is a wellascertained fact that people can actualy obtain more nourishmentfrom food they like than from that which theyi dislikediszases demdent on dretour purpose therefore is not to attempt an answer to the question whliat is food  but rather to make some remarks on the few typical instances in which it has been proved that a connexion exists between a definite disease and a definite article of diet the number of these diseases is not very great and their consideration is the province of a medical treatise rather than that of an article pro fessing to deal with food in other words there is a danger of writing about drugs instead of foods thus the treatment of anemia wvith preparations of iron and the employment of other remedial measures in certain diseases hardly comes within the scope of this articleone classical case mav however be cited therein it is certain that if food conditions do not indeed determine the disease the connexion is at any rate of the closest this is the disease of scurvy the old scourge of ships beleaguered garrisons and prisons scurvy is regarded by some authorities as caused by a microorganism but however this may be it is definitely established that the disorder is closely connected with improper and insufficient food and that it readily vields to treatmbnt with fresh vegetables and fruits another disease which is also claimed as due to a microorganism but which seems to be intimately associated with malnutrition is beri beri it has at all events been proved that this disease can be induced in arlimals by feeding them on decorticated rice while the symptoms disappear when a diet of ordinary rice is prescribeddrtaslso of all diseases in which special food treat nent plays an important part diabetes is the most noteworthy it differs in one essential from the maladies mentioned above in the fact that in its case a large class of foods has to be prohibited to the sufferer these foods are the sugars and starches which constitute the group known as carbohydrates sub stances containig sugar or flour as well as other forms of starch have therefore as a general rule to be forbidden to the patient diabetic bread and biscuits haveto be substituted for the original articles sugar has to be eax tracted from the diabetics milk and his jams and marmalades have to be sweetened wvith saccharine as the preparation of these foods is a business involving considerable difficulty the subject may be considered in some detaildiabetes is characterized by the inability of the tissues of the body to ulse sugar which collects in the blood and it is for this reason that substanees conitaining suzgar and starch which is readily converted into sunar have to bo excluded from the patients diet as one great source of energy is thus lost fats and proteids have to be supplied in larger quantities in order to prevent emaciationdiabticc breadbread is the most important item of food for which a substitute has to be found for the diabetic ithe first efforts in this direetion naturally lay in separatirig tho starch from the flour and making the bread from the remaining gluten which constitutes about  per cent of the flour the flour is made into dough and kneaded and the starch washed away i w ater starchless flotur of this kind is a byproduct in the manufacttire of starch and is purchased by the food specialist from the starch manufacturer bread is made from it in the usual way with yeast and an exceedingly light and airy loaf is produced a great deal of this bread is manufacturedthough it is not so much in favour with diabetics as formerly the principal objection to such bread and to bread made frorm bran is on the score of unpalatableness makers therefore looked around for some other substitute for flour and at length discovered it in a most unlikely article the great iimajority of diabetic breads is nowadays made from milk or rather from the casein which constitutes from  to  per cent of the milk bread made from casein cannot be leavened with yeast as the yeast could notow in such a medium and so baking powder a to be used it is evident from the emanlljalmotult of caseia present in milk that the manufacture of this kind of biead is a very wasteful and therefore expensive processother forms of broad and biscuits are made from xarious nuts ground into a fine paste butter and eggs wvhich contain no carbo hydrates are also employed but as the materials are liaited and as the diet is a trying and monotonous one the effort of the diabetic food specialist is to use his ingredients in varying proportionis so as to produce as great a variety as possible the soya bean has often been talked of as a suitable substance for the prepara tion of bread of this kind and many experi ments have been made with it but its extreme unpalatableness is very difficult to overcomemilix axd jaysone of tho great triumphs oi this branch offood manufacture is the making of milk free of sugar milk contains some  per cent of sugar which hai to be removed to be suitable for invalids of this kind the milk is first separated the creatm being placed on one side the separated miilk is then treated nwith acetic or hydrochloric acid the sugar deposited and the cream restored the milk is thus practicallyi broken up into its comnponent parts and then reconstructed jams and marmalades are also specially prepared the sugar being extracted and saccharine emiployed to restore the sweet i taste saccharine is one of the greatest boons to the diabetic it is one of the coaltar products and is  times sweeter than sugarthe number of firms engaged in the nmanu facture of diabetic foods is small there being not more than four or five in this country these firms do almost as large a business in catering for persons suffering from obesity andsitp is sometimles found amonest diabetics and many people believ e that some formns of it are due to the same causesthe inability of the tissues to use carbohydrates which are retained and stored in the body a non carbohydrate diet certainly seems of value in particuilar cases
