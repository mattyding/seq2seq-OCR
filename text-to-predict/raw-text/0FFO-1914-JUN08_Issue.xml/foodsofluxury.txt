foods of luxury delicacies for the wealthtyfoods of luxury should not be confused witlh foods that are expensive because they are out of season a strawberry in the winter may cost half a crown and pravns in a paris restaurant are sometimes a frnnc apiece but neither strawberries nor prawns are luxuries at the right time and in the right placocaviar oysters and plovers eggs are luxuries for they are all diffiecut to obtaini caviar becomes a superluxury when according to cubats practice in his paris restaurant a sturgeon is orought to table and the caviar is taken out of it on the spot turtles conveved from the w arm scas of theowest that aldermen may dino on thenm rank high amongst luxuries and so do their smnller cousins the terrapins tho birds nests that the chinese taught us to use in

of the straits settlementscaaxms of associationcertain hluxries depend to some extent upon mere association thus the dainty little agone of the north italian lakes must be eaten on a terrace overloolcing como and we can scarcelv believe that its reputation wvould be the same if we could enjoy it on a london breakfast table there is a certain flat cream cheese with just a souipeon of the fragrance of woodsmoke from the forest which seems little short of perfection if eaten at fontainebleau in the vicinitv of the chasselas vines bult we quest ion if it would ever seem quito the same elsewvhere lno doubt modem skill has brought within tho epicures reach well preserved in transparent glass many of the delicacies of foreign landrls but it is too often found that awav from the scenes where we once considered their flavour to be so admirable they lose much of their persuasive power to ticlle the palate wve can no more bottl up the sunshine thbtn we can bring away the haunting gracc of the surroundings that gave iuore than half their charrns to nmanv of these wellremembered dainties and so time and pllac must ever have their share in the subtle effect produced by their merits the tnush room gathered from the dewy pastuires in the early morning may challenge comparison with the hothouise product of the market gardener but to the irfined taste the chamrpignon pluclked from the rinas where the fairies have danced puts both into the shade by its superlative excellencetee oldti bre dayqrrra peacock roasted and then reclad in the skin with the superb tail feathers duly displayed no doubt made a goodly show in point of decora tivo effect but apart from that it would not command the epicures respeet the partridge the pheasant and the grouse have nowv become so common that we scarcely include them among luxuries but the larlk or mautviette care fully wrapped in bacon and served upon toast is a toothsome morsel tho snipe ainl the woodcock rank hligh among the smaller game birds and many of the ducks which visit this country are splendicd for the table though they should be eaten aluiost raw or ery lightly cookedthough it is not given in modern times to ulestroy the nightingale to obtain its tongue as a hlxurry there are many descriptions of tongues which might here find place from the ccarefully smoked tongue of tlhe ox to that of the reindeer or the tender tonguo of the lamb cunniingly enshrined in clear aspic sheep s tongues and russian ox tongues are amonig the choice viands prepared for the breakfast tableand several varieties of cooked tonpuc whether rolled in glasses or collared in tins may almost claim inclusion afmong the prscelt list of daintiesjjexyfits of cold storageihere are those uho scoff at the results of the cold storago system in the matter of luxuries and at the possibility of bringiung over by this means many delieacies from foreign lands in the ice ehamber sexcept perhaps in thc clse of certain fruits the success of this inode of transport is by no means froe fronm cavil but the plan has hardly received fair treatment from the epheures point of view for as yet little has been attempted with raro and choice morsels the ain of the importer is to convey meat and foreign produce in bulk and hitherto with the exception of butter dairy produce and fruit  the possibility of frcezing and transportingtable delicacies has received but little attention it is obvious that thore are difficulties to be overcome in the conveyance of the frozen pro ducts from the ships hold to the table and the case is very different from that in whieh com modities such as entire carcasses of animals are being handled in large quantities wve do not despair of the solution of the problem in the near future when it may become possible to enjoy the guava the mangosteen and manv otlher oriental fruits in their prime indeed judging by the success with which peaches nectarines and other delicate fruits bave been brought from south africa and australia the ultimate isue is no longer doubtfulconectiosyin no other department of luxuries for the table do we rely mnore implicitly upon the slill of the french cuisine than in the matter of sweeet mneats and confectionerywhether it be the delicately flavoured chooolate of marquis the parisian crystallized flowersthe acacia the rose leaves the orange blossom and the violet the glac fruits in rings and knots the lunettes and the tnirabelles the caramels h la vanilla or le rajah  the roarrons glaes vanills and a score of other delicacies all theso and a host of others too numerouas to mention have only to be nadled to remind the epicure of the freonoh capital
