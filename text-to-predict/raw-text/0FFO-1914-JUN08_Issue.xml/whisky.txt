whisky production in scotland and ireland the canadian industrywhisky is now such a universal beverage that it is startling to find that it was practically unknown outside the celtic races until quite recent times how or by whom it was dis covered has been lost in the impenetrable mists of antiquity it is more than probable that the art of distillation was discovered and rediscovered again and again and it may be simultaneously in different parts of the world certainly whisky distilled in a pot still from materials such as are now used seems to have originated with the celts of the scottish highlands the colts of ireland were also early exponents of tho art and it is known that they were producing usquebaugh as early as the th century the difference in language and racial antipathies stood in the way of the spread of the art until near the close of the th century when whisky began to be used as a beverage in the scottish lowlands even then the progress made was slow it wras not until the middle of the th century that whisky was being commonly sold in the taverns of the larger towns and it is only since  that the worldwide reputation of scotch whisky has been built upscotch weelskyin the race for the favour of consumers the scota have far outstripped their rivals not only have they shown more energy in push ing their wares as is indicated by the extent and originality of their advertising but tbey were quick to grasp the possibilities of blensding the product of different distilleries so as to obtain a beverage swuted to the varying con ditions and climates of different countie having converted the sassenachs of their own lowlands to a due recogaition of the merits of their beverage they proceeded to conquer england that accomplished without any undue degree of difficulty it was but a step to carry the war into the great colonies in the building up of which their fellowcountmryren wvere playing such a prominent part even foreign countries alien in tastes and differing widely in conditions are now being systematic ally and successfully exploited as markets for scotch whiskyprcise figures as to the exports of the prenier british spirit are not available but the ship ments of british spirits of which scotch whisky constitutes the greater part have increased rapidly of late years and now amount to over  proof gallonswvhat is waray scotch whisky is divided into five distinct categories determined according to the territory in which the distilleries are situated these may again be subdivided as for instance into orth country eiighland malts and speyside htighland maltns but the ve categories are elearly defined and may be described as ighland malts islays czampbeltowns low land malts and grains the first four are produced in pot stills the form of which has remained practically the same from time imme morial the lastnamed are the product of the patent still the title of the latter to the very name whisky was seriously challenged in  and was unequivocally vindicated in the report of the royal commission on whisky and other potable spirits issued in  an effort was made to show that grain whisky i was no more than pure alcohol and underwenti no improvement no matter how long it was kept but this was successfully rebutted and the right of patent still spirits produced from suitable material to the name whisky is never again likely to be questionedpaodtcitiot aim consjmptxonunfortunately figures as to the production and consumption of each category are not available from official sources the output in scotland during the last financial year ws  gallons produced in  distilleries in  as much as  gallons were distilled but that was the result of speculative inflation for which the industry had subsequently to pay dearly the consumption amounts to between  and  gallons per annum of which twothirds is grain whisky the remaining third beingmade up of the four categories of malt whisky the stocks in bonded warehouses at the close of the last financial year totalled  gallons on the face of it this would appear to represent little more than four years consumption but it must be kept in mind that whisicy is con sumed with a varying degree of age so that it is quite possible to have a redimoxncy ofmatured whisky although the aggregate stocks would not appear to be so very much out of pro portion to the total consumptionsince the collapse of the boom in  there has been more or less redundancy in the supphies of certain ages and makes old iligh land malts for instance greaty exceeded the demand with the result that they fell heavily in price and enabled the blender to raiso the quahity of his finished productvalue o blemdigthe secret of the worldwide popularity of scotch whisky is not far to seek at the first glance it would appear to lie in the energy and dogged determination of the scot unquestion ably those qualities have stood the scottish distillers and blenders in good stead par ticularly when associated as they were wvith enterprise and a keen business instinct but before even those qualities can coimnand success the commoditv nmust possess both intrinsic merit and qualities which commend themselves to the prospective consumer these qualities the first scoteh whisky had from the beginmnig but distributors soon found that the product of any one distillery no matter how carefilly matured was unsuited to the palate or the conditions of life of people follow ing sedentary occupations or liviing in a inilder climate than that of scotland fortunately certain enterprising distributors hit upon the happy idea of mixing or blending the products of various distilleries so as to produce a beverage wvith less pronounced chsracteristics than the spirit of any single distillery had experience showved that by the utilization of all of the five distinct categories wonderful resuts could be obtainedblenders having secured an even homo geneous and palaitable blend next turned their attention to ensuring uniformity the big blenders with an enormous turnover and world wide trade tako great painls to preserve the identity of their blends the usual practice is to vat the products of say a dozen distil leries of the same category and after letting them lie in butts for perhaps  months to make up a final vatting or blend composed of varying proportions of the five categories which have already been vatted by themselvesthe proportions in which highland malts lowland malts iflays canmpbeltowus and grains may be represented in tlle blend as sold to the consumer vary videly according to the practice of different blenders but speaking generally it may be said that the liberal utiliza tion of grain whisky has done more than any thing else to produce a beverage suitable to those leading an indoor life or living in a relaxing climateirish wiskyirish whisky differs materiallv from the scottish product for one thing the raw materials employed are different consisting largely of unmalted grain in the case of irish potstill whiskies the raw materials used generally consist of from  to  per cent of malted barley the balance being rye oats and unmalted barley then the malt is not peatcured as in scotland the process of distiltation in the cwse of potstill distilleries is also ontirely different from that in scotland being much more complicated the result is that irish whisky is round and sweet with a full bouquet as compared with the charac teristic dry clean flavour of scotch whisky although the irish product enjoyed no such  boom as took place in scotch some  years ago the production lias declined by nearly  gallons to roughly  gallons i last year the removals from bond for home consumption and export exceeded the output of  gallons by  gallons with the result that the stocks further declined to  gallons the statistical position may be described as satisfactory and welcalculated to maintain a steady supply of a highly palatable beveragethe art of distillation has been practisel in lreland for many centuries and is stated by some to have been introdueed by st patrick by the becinning of the th century quite a considerable trade was being done in the spirit and up till a littie over  years ago irish was the predoinwant whisky in the british market then it was that the scotch distri butors for reasons already stated began to forge ahead and as a verv cursorv comparion of the figures is sufficient to show they eaa maintained and even increased their leadlnceased dtthe output of irish whisky was heavily hbiby the increase of the duty on homemade spirits to s d per gallon and although there has been a recovery from the low ebb reached in  last year again showed a reaction distillers had a hard struggle for existence after the duty was increased but latterly they have been materiallv assisy d by a plentiful and fairly cheap s sipply of ramaterials cheaper coal and an absence of legislative troubles the export trade is being well maintained but it is doubtful if the home trade demand is making any great progra this latter circumstance is attributed by well informed judges to faulty methods of distribu tion and a lack of wellconceived publicity it is also alleged that irish is not sufficently protected from the danger of adulteration by alien imitations but in all probability this may be regarded as merely a branch of the publicity question last year a financecompany was formed with a substantial capital to remedy these defects and it may be reason ably anticipated that in course of time proesnt methods both as to distribution and adver tising will be improved upon irish distri butors are coming to value skbful blendig according to its merits and with a piftl supply of both pot and patent still whisky it is difficult to see why the irish trade should not enjoy a degree of prosperity and progress equal to that attained by its scottish eom petitorscanadian wbmyalthough canada appeals mainly to whisky distributors in this country as a market for scotch and irish spirits with great possibilities of expansion it has a distilling industary of its own of fairly substantial proportions the fifth census of manufactures in canada com pleted in  showed that there were ii establishments at which liquors were distilled involving acapitalization of nearly  but there are at most seven distilleries at whichany great quantity of whisky is distilled of these one is situated in the far west and the others in eastern canada acording to official figures the production of canadian whisky in the five fiscal years ended march   was  gauons this shows an average of  gallons per annum but the output is apparently an increasing ono asthe production for the ast fiscal year amounted to  gallons the aggregate consump tion for the samo five years is returned at  gallons showing an average of  gallons but that for the last yearamounted to slightly over  gallons included in that consumption are about  gauons which are sold for indnstrial purposes duty freethe exports average round  gailona per annum of a total value of approximately  but it is not an increasing quantity and in fact shows a decline of about  gallons as ompared with asi years ago cana dian whisky is mode mainly from rye and maize it has a higher flavour and more body than eitiher scotch or iish due largely to the materials used it contains a larger propoe tion of secondary or byproducts and taken longer to mature than the average pottill whisk produced in this country
