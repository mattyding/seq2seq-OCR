closed however leadenhall vas used as a market for divers articles both of native and foreign origin the following further testimony from stow that leadenhall was used as a granary is both interesting and instructivewhen roger achley became mayor of london in the year  there was not found  quarters of wheat in au the garners of the city either within the liberties or near adjoining through the which scarcity when the carts of stratford came laden with bread to the city as they had been accustomed there was such press about them that one man was ready to destroy another in striving to be served for their money but this scarcity did not last long for thc mayor in short tiime made such provision of wheat tbat the bakers both of london and strtford were wearv of taking it ip and were forced to make much more than they would and for the rest the mayor laid out the money and stored it up iu leadenhall and other garners of the city this mayor also kept the market sowcll that he would

but leadenhall is still an important factorin regard to food supplies leadenhall has ever marched with the times it gradually became a market for meat game poultry and so forth while adjoining were herb and hide market herbs and hides can no longer be bought there with the building of the central london markets the bulk of the business in meat was transferired to smithfield and now leadenhall is

and is free of tollltadeyall ad biltigsgatuntil well within living memorv a great deal of retail as well as wholesale business was done now however nearly the whole of the business in poultry and game is of a wholesale character the retail business began to decline simul taneously with the growth of the suburbs at one time it was a common thing for citv men of au ranks to call at the market and take away with them just what the fancy dictated suburban distributing centres how ever have almost caused this practice to cease but leadenhall is still a most important factor in the distribution of supplies not only for london and the united kingdom but for manv colonies and countries where there is a british community its proximity to biuingsgate moreover renders it still more important for
