cooperative dairjes in ireland    some remediable defectsireland ranks high today among the butter producing countries its total exports amounted in  to  but this figure large as it is falls far short of tho actual value of the butter produced as a very large and rapidly increasing proportion of the output now finds a good and profitabble market in the country itself the quantity expdorted is merely the surplus remaining after the demand for home consumption has been satisfiedthe main interest which a discussion of co operative dairying in ireland will have for british readers vill doubtless lie in the possi bility of making ireland the chief source of the butter supply to british markets and as far as possible of making those markets independent of impcrts from foreign countries in which year by year home consumption is rapidly increasing and now outlets for export opening it will bo seen from the figures given above that the butter trade forms a very large and important part of the irish agricultural industry lloreover a very large proportion of the storo cattle now bought by english and scottish farmers is pro vided by the surplus calves produced in the dairying counties of ireland and this source of supply of store cattle wrould very rapidly give out unless dairy farming were maintained in a vigorous and profitable condition when the co operative system becomes general irelancl will be in a osition to produce and place butter on the marlict more rapidly and economically than anv other country which is supplying any con siderable proportion of british roquirements this in view of the rapidly increasing cost of living is of the first importanco from the con sumners point of viewthat raret britain has other arid very real interests in the dvelonmient of the irish dairying industr cm also be demonstrated tho tax payers of theo united kingdom will have had to make thtrmsehes xsponsible for a sumr approach hic i o before land purchase is comn pleted in ireland and the solo security for the rm paymn ot of this enornious aniount lies in tlhe ability of the irish farmer to meet his annual instalments of prinicipal and interestjllirt vyers ago irelend whieh had hitherto been thc main souirco of great britnins butter supply found herself called ioll ltmost without warning to eoompee withi denmark and other countries whic h htd for some time becn developing their milk production and roforminig their methods of manufacture by the intr oducetioni of the erenmery system by which buttermranking had been transformedl from a homo to a fatctory indusitry irish farmers wvere utterly unprepared for this revolution they were without organization or industrial edueation and after a vain attempt to sell their homomade butter in competitioni with tho moderni maehinemade produet they either abandoned dairying altogether or resorted to selling their mill to the few enterprising cavpitalists wvho seeing their opportunity had started creameries in ireland in these concerns the interest of the ereatnery proprietor and that of the farmer had notlhing in common the sole aim of the proprietor nvas to earn as large a dividend as possible on ihis inveastment and the mnain objcct of the falmer speedily became to water his milk to the utmost extent possible without incurring detection and prosecution at that time dirv engineoring was in its infancy and the appliances for determining tho valuo of the milk were rough and ready aend as such methods of testing were carried out in secret by the prorrietor the farmer naturally had little confidence in tho justice mecd out to him so it came about tlat whio watered milk diminished the pro prietors profits he to protect himself lowered his price to a figure which tempted honest milk suppliers to become roguessint hoace plujitts voiait was at this stagein that sir hlorace llunkett began his cooperative crusade in ireland seeing the great need and opening for cooperation in dairying districts he urged farmers incessrntly to erect and equip creameries thlemselves and work them on the cooperative plan at fifty abortive meetings did he preach his cooperative gospel before one cooperative creamery was started but today tho co operativo dairying system holds the field in ireland the great majority of the pro prietary creameries have been bought by cooperative societies of farmers or have otherwise disappeared in the province of ulster not a solitary proprietary creamery xwith the exception oi a small group owned by the scottish cooperative wholesale society remainsby means of theso cooperative creameries ireland has laboriously regained to some eitent its former position in the british markets but it is still competing on unequal terms a inst those countries where the average milk yield of the cows has been graded up and where a system of alltheyearround production has been establishedthe irish creameries have revolutionized the methods of manufacture but so far the system of nilik production in ireland has undergone no change threefifths of the total milk supply being still produced from grassfed cows duringthe stunmer months moreover little hls been done to increase the milkproducing capacity of irish dairy cowsn inter dazyngto remedy these two defects the irish agricultural organisation society has in duced some of the most progressive dairy societies to experiment on the growing ofcatch crops a system of alltheyearround fodder cropping which is suitable to the irish climate and to the production of milk and is also economical it is hoped by this system to make it possible for dairyfarmers to keep a proportion of their cows in milk during the winter months and to realize for this milk as substantial a margin of profit as they now earn from their grassfed cows whose produce is marketed when the price of butter is at its lowest a very important result wlhichl rmay be anticipated from this development will be the extension of the area of butter production to districts now devoted to the feeding of store cattle and the fattening of cattle and sheepthe possibility of footandmouth disease becoming endemic in ireland makes this do velopment a very urgent need it will also tend to greater employment of labotur on the farm and to its profitable employment and thus contribute to the general prosperitv of tho country an alltheyearround production must tend to level up the general average price of irish butter as ihas been the case with danish butter and to imnprove the position of irish butter in the british marketsmmn contolsthe second and perhaps the more important step whicil ithe society has taken to bring the industry up to its proper level is to advocate the formation of cowtesting associations in connexion with the cooperative creameries on the lines of the danish  milk controls by means of regularly weigliing and testing the milk given by each cow it nill be possible in a short while to doublo the millk production of irish cows and raise the value of the butter trado of the countrv to  annually if as has been hinted above we are to be subjected to constant dislocation of our cattle trade owing to recurring footandmouth disease scares the gradual substitution of dairy farming for stock raising will become inevitable and in the opinion of the writer wtil be a chango for the better it can be shown that dairy farming conducted on the best modern principles plus cooperationwill pay far better than producing beef and mutton to compete with the rapidlygrowing clulled meat trade controlled as it is by trusts an extension of dairying will lead to an increase in the production of bacon and poultry while improved and increased production and an organized system of transit and marketing may yet solve the terrible problem of infantile inortality by providing an ample milk supply for towns and cities at a price well within the reach of the very poorest
