our egg requirements principal sources of supplythe wholesale egg trade of this country provides one of our more important itemrs of food supply the extent of which may be gauged from the amounts we send abroad for eggs nowv reaching many millions annually a total which is steadily increasing he demand for eggs has been continuously growing not only in this country but also on the continent and as the worlds supply is not increasing step by step with the demand prices have been steadily rising as shown by the alnexed figures ger many is rapidly increasing her imports of eggs and is competing with us in the worlds markets moreover the reduction of food tariffs in tho united states is attracting large quantities of russian eggs and these supplies are being diverted from the english marketour supplies from russia have been steadily increasing for many years both in value and quantity those for  were the largest on record but the opinion is held by many experts that this continued increase can scarcely con tinue in view of germran and amnerican demands in the following schedule the remarkable and steady increase in the value of eggs year by year is very striking since  the increase has been  per centforeign supplizswne obtaini our supplies from russia den mark germany netherlands france italy austria and maiy other countries large sup plies come from ireland and there is also the home production the home production now is relatively very limited we have also a small export egg trade the increase in the value of eggs shown by the figures given above is entirely duo to the remarkable prosperity and increased purchasing power of continental nations the provision of eggs necessarily depends on an efficient national poultry industrv which in many countries is now organized on scientific lines also on a carefullyorganized system of collection and carriage least progress so far has been made in germnanv wlhich is therefore a strong com petitor in the principal markets france has a mnore completelyorganized system but is still behind denmarkeegs for gepon nvthe extent to wlich german consumption affects the prices we have to pay to maintain our supplies may be realized from the fact that her imports very closely approximate to our own germany drawvs her supplies from miany of the countries on which we rely russia holland hungarv italv and the balkans our importers have long dreaded german competition for the danish out put and on a smau scale it has already commenced her supplies of poultry to in crease her egg output are obtained to a large extent from belgium it is probable that the eggs exported from germany to this country are not in fact of german origin but have merely passed throughthis country in its imports of eggs from abroad is at a disadvantage compared with other european countries to which supplies can be conveyed over shorter distances whilst ours in addition to longer distances have to undergo a seatranshipment wvith the arising increased freight at present our second largest supplies come from denmark up to now they have not to any great extent been diverted to germany but our imports do not show any marked increase of volume the total for   great hundredsis only slightlv larger than that of  great hundredsand it may be assumed that tho greatest possible level of the danish output has been nearly reachedalternatives to d enthe only visible substitutes for denmnark are siberia sweden and holland it would take years to organize siberia on a bufficiently large scale moreover the cost of carriage must be much greater the climate is also a difficulty during the sumamer which is short and very hot the eggs would not stand conveyance as the distances are so great and during the winter the comparatively few eggs produced would be frozen frozen eggs cause great loss to shippers as the frost causes the shells to crackholland is a country from which increased supplies are being received the dutch are very enterprising and the industry is well organized in  our imports were only  great hundreds  from holland and it is ex tremely lilely that during the current year they may exceed a millionoup iiforts of eogsat present our main supply of eggs is imported from russia whence we obtain more than  per cent of our supplies in ireland very consider able progress has been made danish methods have been introduced with success but much more could be done the irish output could be quadrupled and would still find a ready market in wales and scotland there has been a remark able want of enterprise and organization the output is smalltaking the egg trade as a whole there has during the last decade been great improvement greater care in the marketing system has tended to better the standard of quality at present there is no tendency noticeable that increased prices will reduce consumption wages increase the country is prosperous and eggs are a food for which no substitute is available an increased supply of eggs from ireland in spite of high prices does not seem pro bable our largest imports were received as far back as  moreover ireland imports eggs in considerable quantities the area of ireland is more than twice that of denmark with energy and enterprise the irish output should more than double the danish our imports from ireland during recent years are shown belowtlhese bgures suggest want of enterprise the irish supply is practically stationary in spite of increasing prices and a trade opening is being frittered away the demand of the united lates is a factor of importancesince the abolition of the duty on eggs entering that country the whole of the canadian output not required for home consumption is sent to the united statesthe following details of our canadian imports illustrate the continuous decline          packxin and transporta uniform system of packing is adopted by all countries sending goods to this countrv they are sent in cases containing  each arranged in layers separated by wood wool very fine shavings or straw or hay each case having a double central division so that it can be sawn in two they are so skdlfully packed that deterioration and breakage are remarkably small during the transport of eggs it is of the utmost importance to keep them perfactly dry nothing causes deterioration so rapidly as damp during the spring the pro duction of eggs is at its maximum whilst during the autumn and winter the production is rela tively very small in order to average the supply they are therefore preserved in the two most important producing countriesrussia and denmark the eggs being immersed in limewater or water glass those so treated being known in the trade as  pickled the exteint to which this is done may be inferred from the fact that one firm may have eggs for as manv as  cases in stock each containing  eggs wvhich aro storod during the spring and sold out later in the year to soino extent the supply is helped by eggs in different countries being produced at different periods thus cegyptian eggs come into the market at the scarce trme of the vear from november to march and also those from morocco a reference to the market reports shows a very considerable range of values or prices for eggs sold in wvholesale quantities that is due to the weight per great hurndred soene eggs such as egyptian are small  othersdutch austrian danish or russianare much larger the weights per great hundred may vary from b to b or lb and prices vary in proportion it is important to note that the food given to the poultry may flavour the eg gs laidstrict super vision is therefore essential for successful tradingextentr op the ecg thanathe importance and extent of the egg trade may be inferred from the following

lesser extent those from italv and austria the totals for this and next y ear will show whether those two coiuntries will be able to increase their available outputs or wvhether their home demand is overtaking their own supply in this case they may also in a few years compete with us abroad holland is the onlv country of those named which has been steadily increas inxg its egg exports to us but they are as vet on a relativelv small scale with our supplies from so many countries diminishing througb the demand for eggs increasing abroad in con sequence of continental prosperity our egg importers are making every effort both to find new sources of supply and to encourage an increased output wherever the industry is already establishedthe egyptian supply is an increasing one as shown by the following figures of im ports       the supplies from morocco fluctuate possibly due to the disturbed state of the countrylast year they fell to  but similar relapses have occurred before and it is probable that in the near future the imports may increase our varying supplies are shown below                   it is of importance to otur egg importers to encourage production in these two countries as the supplies become available during our winter when those from other countries have either ceased or are at their mninmum
