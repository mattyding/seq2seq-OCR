grivisby fish market metropolis of trawling industryit is nocessary to rise betimes to see grimsby the worlds great fish port in characteristic mood the trawlers of which there are about  supplying the port with fish begin to arrive about  oclock in the morning and to gain a true impression of grimsby it is well to be on the doekside at that hour it is better still to reach the fish quays before the activitiesof the day have commenced to walk along tho silent and deserted pontoons clean and ready to deal with the catch of the fleet which is racing from the north sea to reach the morning market and then compare the aspect of these early hours with those which follow the arrival of the boats best of all it is to be present on the fish pontoons on the days precedinig good friday on such days as many ns  tons of fish are handled sold and dispatched throughout the length and breadth of england and scotland in a single day and a large tonnage consigned to customers statistics for the wednesday preceding good friday show that  paclages have been dispatched from tho market to fish retailers and  packages sent direct to consumers four hundred railway wagons have been loaded with fish on this particullar day the yearly loading being  trucksthe aal catchthe annual catch which is constantly in creasing is now about cwt all kinds of fish are included in this huge haulsoles turbot brill halibut cod plaice haddock whiting  and in the autumn season the trawlers visiting the port are reinforced by a large fieet of herring drifters such as to the exclusion of everything else invade yarmouth and lowes toft on a normal day between  and  tons of fish are landed from trawlers whose operations extend not only over the prolific grounds of the north sea but also fish in icelandic and faroe fishing waters off the coast of spain and at certain seasons of the year in the white sea these trawlers make voyages in search of fish extending from three days to three weeks and large carriers are also employed to ply between the shore and the fishinggrounds a recent innovation at hull which will probably be extended to the grimsby fleet is the fitting of the commodore boat with wireless telegraphy by this means constant communication with the shore is maintained keeping the fishing fleet in close touch with the market and enabling the fish to be landed at periods when market conditions are favour ablethe manner in which the catch is dealt with at grimsby is a triumph of organization from  oclock onwards the trawlers are constantly steaming into the dock and taking their posi tion stem on at the pontoon quay soon in spite of the fact that the trawlers are moored as close together as possible the dock is full there is no delay the hatches are off and the fish is landed and displayed in readinems for the auction sales hundreds of willing hands hurry on the work the bigger fish being laid out on the pontoon and the smaller fish in baskets then when unloading is finished and the pontoon so crowded that it is almost impossible to walk without treading on fish the work of the salesmen begins it is not surprising to learn that it has been decided to provide a large new fish dock and that the market accommodation is to be extended and improved the new fish dock which will have a water area of  acres will double the existing dock accom modation and the additional quay space will extend over ftdaily fish salsthere are no fewer than  merchants doing business on the grimsby fish market the trade is generally subdivideda man is an auctioneer or a merchant or a trawlowner but some firms engage in all branches of the trade the beginning of the auctions is heralded by the ringing of a bell and the fish is sold with the rapidity which comes of long practice and familiarity with the trade the money value of the catch of a single trawler some times reachss a maximum of  a single large halibut will occasionally fetch several pounds at auction and the bidding for choice specimens is often keen it need scarcely be said that few of the fish remain in grimsby where indeed fish is by no means cheapwhen the sales are over come the cleaning and pcking and while this is going on the railway trains are being marshalled on the tracks which adjoin the market parcels are being rapidly made up and writhin a few hours the whole of the catch landed has been dis posed of special rolling stock is used for the carriage of the fish by rail the salt fish and that which can be packed in boxes barrels and other receptacles being carried in latticed vans simnilar to those used for the meat fruit or milk traffic within a few hours after landing the fish is on the way to distant markets special fish trains being dispatched at short intervals to london and the south to the west country to the north to leeds man chester bradford liverpool birmingham and a score of other towns there is a large traffic in small parcels the daily average being about  but in busy periods  small parcels may be dispatched in one day the average weight of these parcels is b and the average rail charge d in another part of the market the export trade which ranges between  and  tons a year is being dealt with the herring market is conducted in a covered sale ringsueszday industriesthe daily scene in the market which has been sketched in what precedes does not constitute the whole of an industry on which  per cent of the population of grimsby is directly dependent there are in the town large establishments for the smoke curing of haddock codling and herring and another important section of the trade is the salting and drying of cod ling and other fish then there are the ice factories which supply the trawlers with large quantities of ice it is estimated that the grimsby industry uses eome  tons of ice a year formerly the ice etnployed was largely natural ice from norway but owing to the uncertainty of the supply and the gradual increase in price of the imported ice factories were established in grimsby and the two existing factories each capable of an output of  tons of ice per day have enabled the demand to be met locally the manufacture of nets and sails masts blocks and other requisites for the fitting out of the fishing fleet is another branch of the fishing industry wliich has settled in grimsby and in addition to the abundant supplies of food in the form of fish which the port furnishes to the country a valuable medicinal food is manufactured at the codliver oil factories which conduct their operations at this famous home of the fish tradecarrral emiployedit is estimated that the total weight of fish landed last year at the ports of the united kingdom was cwt the modern fish trawler has become an expensive
