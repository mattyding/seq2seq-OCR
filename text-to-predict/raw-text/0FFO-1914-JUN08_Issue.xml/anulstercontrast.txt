an ulster contrast  rival volunteer forces a natio nalist hhantdicapfrom our specltl correspondentelfast june early yesterday afternoon two bodies of mea passed througlh the principal stroets of belfast ono marched with soldierly tread and bearing clearly they were trained men they voro belts rmnd bandoliers and haversacks they were clean smnart wellsetuxp as thoy went no way to join in a tunionist volunteer parade a party of nationalistss were going in the other direction to attend the first general muster in this eity of the i n v irish niational volunteers hero and there among themuv were young fellows who would do credit to any forco but it was impossible not to be impressed by and to pity the poor appearance of mnost of them their collarless necks and frayed suits tleoir shuffling step and almost apologetic expression struck me as i stood watcliing them i spoke to the man next to niei wvas careful about what i said one is obligod to be careful in a land where the use of party expressions is a misdemeanour for which a magistrato can inflict a fine i imlerely remarked that the did not look quito equal to the other lot yet he evidontly thought the  yet  indicated syrnpathy  alt  hc replied confidenitly itwl be different when we get hlome rulethat man really thinks as most nationalists think that bv somo occult charm a mere change of formula a mere mechanical readj ast mnent can affoct the icharacter of a race can deprive energy and enterprise of its natural aseendcency can give to those who bow huiibly before authoritv felfreliance and sturdy endoavourat once i mado up my mind to see tho parado of the netionalist volunteers it took place on a football ground sixponco was charged for admision mnless a membership card of the hibernian order could le shown come inyour thousands pleaded thho placards abouti the  inv but there were only hundreds j here even a wholohearted home ruler wlhon i consulted put the number at nellundler a llousand considering that there are sonlething like  roman catholics inl belfast this was not encouraging for mr i do vlin who rvieved tlhe troops their i appearance however wvas much better than a ragged company in tho street had led me to expect for the most part they were of tho sarne type as many of the men in the unionist ran ksyoung fellowvs out of shops and offlces witi a sprinkling of oldor recruits tho skilled axtisrn clecent which is so valuable to theuxv seemed to be lacking altogethertwo years behindfor men vho lhadl only just begun they showed sorco promisec they are just about where thc l nionist volunteers were twoo years ago sand they miiiht bv  be equal to them if thov were equally well led ut alreatdv in true irisl fashion a quarrel has been start d as to who shall dominate the movement jealousy is showing its tooth an order against the force taking part in political demojstra tions is furiously attacked teito chlief orgnizors are contemptuously asked by what right tbev act colonel moore and captain white are openly sneered at is it surprising that roman catholics of good position throiughout tho country are holding aloof  rifles mav be bought with american dolars alreadv the hat is going round but leaders jike the men all ever the provinee who have made thte ilster volunteers are not to be purchasod sony a burniing conviction ean indueo them so far as ronean catholic of good positioni have any conviction about home rule it is that whle its benefits are loubtful it will certamily cost them more they are naturally not anxious to fight fcr thatno cortrast eould have been more instructive than that botwen the raw recruits who saluted mr devlin and the lines of  gents in khaki  vith glittering bayonets on their new mlautsors who stood to attent ion hefore sir edwardl carson and generai sir eorge riehardsonl later in the afternoon the occasion was tho present ing of drums and band instruments to the west belfast regriment which paraded in full strength with colours the inea in uniformkhaki tunics with  if  on the shoulder stmrps khaki trousers and puttees service boots and capsand vith the fixed bayonots which gleamed and flickered in the sun belonged to the sneeial service corps which means that they are pre pared to go anywhere at any moment while the others would oily be callexd upon to defend their homes at aniother point  more of this expeditionary force vwere on parade in uniform but without their rifles seven or eight thousand people wrcnt out to the ialmoral agricultural show gromid to see this fine turn out and to hear sir edward address the men enthusiasm for the leader grows by what it fees on mnianxy kings would bo glad of sueh passionate loyalty as is offered to sir edward carson on satturday morning i went over the sirocco works with hiim and a few othters at the invitation of mir s c davidsonl who has given ibelfast a new and important engineering industry alnd who is one of the stoutest opponents of home riule on the ground that it would injure ulster nmateriallv and lessen employment it was exactlv like a royal visit lkgs were wavedthero was cheering long and lustya crowd gatherod to see the departure and sir edward  must add plays a royal part with exquisite grace and modesty and tactdevotion to the leaderwnlhen lie spoke to tho mon on parade all the sounds of a great popular assembly were silenced every ear strained to catch his words emotion was unmistakably betrayedl by the fierce yells of execrationi which went up when a foolish  votes for women  fanatic was carried screeching away to interrupt at such a tirne is isee ttjcssi as well as an insult to the cause the speeches were grave in tone but every passage which alluded to the rifles and to the ships which brotught them was greeted by an instantanieous roar of delight the gun running has certainly doubled ulsters self confidencethe nationalist volunteers had a green flag with  ireland a nation  upon it they call king george  a foreign monarch is it any wonder that loyalists have armed sir e carsons speechsir edward carson in the course of his address to the troops said  we have not very long until the climax is to coine in this great controversy therefore it is very necessary for you to go on and complete your prepara tions in every particular because there is one thing that we are determined upon and that is

our own correspondentdublin jun irish unionists attitude to the national volunteers is indicated in a leading article which the irish times publislhed on saturday it says that irish urnionists as sir edward carsoni has admitted can take no objection to tho new movement and that if civil disturb anco is to como in ireland it is better that the yoiung men should be trained and diilled than that the country should be at the mercy of mob lawthe freemans journal in an article on tho samne subject clearly indicates the nationalist partys intention to captture the volunteers it regards as  grotesque  the notion that the objects of the party and the volunteers are not identical ancl describes the latter as  a mighty reinforcenent  to the present rome rule billit is quite certain however that the founders of the volunteors do not accept the official organs views and that a grave crisis is at hand in the history of the movement up to the present its founders havo contented themn selves with repeating that the volunteers are above party polities ut they will soon be compelld to takle a more definite standin the meantime colonel moore ono of the leaders appeals for patience and tolerance he says that discussions in the press can only do harmn and that  matters will adjust them selves  if left alone
