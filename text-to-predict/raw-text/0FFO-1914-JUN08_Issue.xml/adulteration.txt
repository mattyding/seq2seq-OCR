adulterktion   examwples of fraudulent manufacture  inradequate legislation somt proposed reformsthere is an old saying to the effect that every one is destined to eat a peck of dirt before he dies so much is probably inevitable but by taking pqins in the selection of our milkmen butchers bakers and other purveyors by refusing to buy jams preserves potted meats and pickles manufactured by other than re putable erms and above all by giving support to the vsrious movements which have for their object tle improvement of the law relating to adulteratiion of food we can at least see that wo are called upon to swallow no more than the maximmn provided by the adagehuma a nature being in ultimate analysis fmmutable it is inevitable that we should find that adulteration of food and drink has existed from the earliest times mr wynterblyth in hds valuwible work on foods has collected some very interesting details of the history of adulteration he reminds us that wine was adulteraed in athens where they boasted an inspector comparable with those appointed under olar own food and drugs acts in bjome also as pliny records adulteration was practised a white sweettasting earth was added to the bread and the wine was coloured with aloi ilu england from the th century onwards the bakers the brewers the  pepperers and the vintners were the most frequently accused of corrupt practices but it bas been reserved for our own times to see adulteration and sophistication brought to the condition of a fine art the reasons for this are not difficult to analyse the industrial revolution which has transferred the production of certain articles formerly made in the home to the faatory the decline of interest on the part of the housewife in the tasks which onececupied her attention the growth of the large cities with their incessant cry for cheap food the strides of science the handmaiden alike of the just and of the unjust helping civilization orward with one hand while stretching forth the other to aid the rogue along his devious paththeso are some of the factors which are scountable for the increased amount of adulteration nlow practised amongst ustzm pusrc resronsrbryivhen our grandmothers moved from the country to the town the making of butter bacon bread and other staples of life passed from the control of the family circle and im purities and uncleanliness crept in as surely as shoddy did into the cloths which took the place of our oldfashioned homespuns when our mothers ceased to make their own jams pickles and preserves sophistication found a new field for its activities and now when our wives anxious to show how much they can save out of the housekeeping money allow themselves to be cajolled into purchasing cheap end inferior tinned and potted goods of all kinds put forward by the obsequious salesman as  our own make it is no matter for sur prise that the unscrupulous manufacturers should meet the demand for such wares by supplying decomposing food artfully masked with boracio or other preservativesno campaign against impure and adulterated food should omit to state that in some cases he public is the chief offender if it will insist on cheap goods it must be prepared to get them but it should bear in mind thatcheap  in many cases connotes nasty this however is only one way in which public opinion offends examples might be multi plied to show that in many cases preconceived ideas as to colour and other qualities of food force manufacturers to produce by fair means or foul the characteristics desired butter for instance is naturally somewhat variable in in colourr the public becomes suspicious if this article of food should suddenly show any departure from what it has got to regard as the normal colour it cannot therefore legiti mately complain when the dairyman to pro duce the desired effect adds annatto root or  annatto substitute one of the coaltar dyes of which we shau havo more to say later the process of baking inevitably colours the flour used if we desire that unnatural pro duct a white loaf we must be prepared to pay for our whim by consuming flour bleached by means which may or may not be injurious cocoa and chocolate are frequently given a richer and darker colour by the addition of iron oxide and aniline dyes especially in cases where the article has been adulterated with starch miaking all due allowance however for the part played by the public in unconsciously aiding and abetting adulteration it cannot be denied that a great deal of fraud prevailaprstm statre of tra lawbefore proceeding to a consideration of the most flagrant of these abuses it will be convenienf to outline briefly the present state of the law in this country as to the sale of adulterated food to show some of its more glaring defects and to point out the reforms of the necessity of which all disinterested persons are agreed the existing law in this eoumtry dealing with these matters is embodied in the sale of foods and drugs act  with the amendment act of  and the subse quent sale of food and drugs and margarine acts of   and  the administra tion of these various acts is in the hands of the local authorities who appoint food inspectors whose duty it is to collect samples of articles exposed for slel and submit them for examina tion to the public anlysts also appointed by the local authorities the public analyst has to issue a certificate based on the results of his anslysis and must decide whether in his opinion the sample submitted is  genuine or  adulterated if the former his certificate need only say so if the latter he must state the nature and extent of the adulteration on this information the authorities may proceed to prosecutebefore stating some of the innumerable loop holes which the present state of the law leaves open to the unscrupulous tradesman two important considerations should be mentioned in the first place it is necessary to point out tht thouuh the appointmnent of a food inspector has to be ratified by the local governrnent board his employment may be determined by the local authority it is obvious therefore that an energetic inspector may make himself objectionable to the strong vested interests he is sure to encounter and if these vested intereststhe butcher the baker and so on have seats on the local council the enter prising inspector may find his position a very unenviable one the position of the publicanalyst may be made unbearable by appointing another analyst and depriving the obnoxious official of all samples with the accompanying fees for testing them the  other important fact to bear in mind is that the whole burden of advising the local authority as to what nit  it is dulteration in a given sample rests with thl ijublic analyst it is quite unfairand most unsatisfactoty to lay such a burden on this officials shoulders adulteration of each particoular article of food and drink should be specifically defined and its composition determined and the public analysts duties should be confined to testing samples for the purpose of seeing that they possess these stated constituents the laws of the united states and of certain of our dominions are much more precise on the point of what does or does not constitute adulteration and it may be remarked in passing that a significant reference is made in the eode of the united states to the adulteration laws of other countries it is laid downthat no article shall be deeraed    adul terated    when no substance is used in the preparation thereof in conflict with the laws of the foreign country to wbich such article is intended to be shippedthe authorities of that country very properly evince no concern as to the state of our laws and it is our fault if adulterated products forbidden in the united states are shipped thence to this countryevasox or the lawsome of the ways in which the law can be evaded may now be noticed in the first place the food inspectors very soon become known to the tradesmen of their district and purchases are not easily made without exciting suspicion as to their object the case of the milkman who possessed a twoway tap com municating with two compartments in one churn one of good milk for the edification of the zealous inspector the other of a watered product for his customers consump tion is perhaps an unusual example of ingeniousness but it is obvious that a pur chase of the article actuauy sold to the public is a difficult attainment when the officer is known to the tradesmen in some cases the local shopkeepers jointly employ boys to keep a watch on the inspectors movements spy out his route and report when he is coming so that the inferior article may be hidden away and a good and wholesome product submitted to him the inspector retaliates by hiring children and old women to make his purchases such a system is bad on the face of it though it is not perhaps easy to suggest a remedyother ingenious devices arise from time to time a few weeks ago a prosecution fell through beccuse the inspector failed to obtain a sample of suspected milk the pur veyor had a jar labelled pure milk  on his counter but by representing that he sold only soda and milk he was held by the court to be justified in refusing to seu a sample of milk separately it was thus possible for him to adulterate the milk to any extent he liked with wateranother difficulty is encountered in eases of butter sampling instances have been recorded in which the grocer having cut off a portion of butter for a customer has surreptitiously added a block of margarine to it when such a sample is divided bv the food inspector into three parts in the usual way one for the public analyst one for the grocer and one to be retained in case of disputeit is obvious that the composition of the three por tions may and very probably will vary that forwarded to the analyst may consist of mar garine while that retained by the food inspector or by the grocer may be pure butter a dispute arises and under cover of the storm raised the nefarious grocer escapes yet another means of evading the law is provided by what is known as the warranty system the purveyor pro duces a warranty from the general dealer from whom he got his goods guaranteeing their purity the prosecution breaks down and afresh prosecution has to be instituted against the i general dealer when a fresh warranty will i probably be producednotices or adultzatroanother means of escape is provided by the chaotic state of the law as to giving notice of adulteration a card hung in an obscure corner of the shop a few words in minute characters upon the package a socalled fancy name and the tradesman is held in law to be sufficiently protected a case or two of this kind from the many instances re corded bv those engaged in food inspection may be given a package of coffee was sold at ls d per lb which on analysis disclosed  per cent of chicory and  per cent of coffee the real value of which was about d or d per lb the words  sold as a mixture  in small letters were held bv the court to constitute sufficient notice similarly the words  a mixture but does not contain anything injurious  were held to be legitimate notice of the presence of  per cent of sago and sugar in a brand of cocoa sold at the full market price if adulteration is permitted and that is a question upon which we have no desire to dogmatize however strongly it may concern individuals we should at least be permitted to know what particular form of adulterant we are consuming for these two cases taken at random are character istic of an important difference lvhile sago is quite wholesomethough not of course on that account worthy of being charged at the price of cocoachicory in such large doses may be harmfulbefore dismissing this branch of the subject the question of fancy names should be mentioned these have been sanctioned by the local government board in the case of margarine where an article is not specifically called butter but is given one of these  fancy names there is nothing to prevent margarine or a blend of butter and margarine being purchased under the impression that it is butter although such cases may not be frequent as mentioned above potted meats or preserves with some attractive title which does everything but describe their contents are supplied in large quantities to the general grocer who not infrequently recommends them as  our own make and instances might be multipliedrfloets to amend the lawfrom these considerations it is apparent that mnch remains to be done to make our food laws adequate to the protection of the community that this fact is recognized is shown by the efforts of various official and un official bodies to educate public opinion as to the present unsatisfactory state of these laws and to carry on a campaign for their amendment the principal reforms urged concern the position of the food inspector and the public analyst and provide for the establishment of a  court of referencethe food inspector should be made more independent by removing him from the in fluences which the local councils may bring to bear upon him and transferring him to the service of the local government board whichshould alone have power to determine his appointment the invidious duty of deciding what is adulteration and what is not should be taken away from the public analyst and effect given to the recommendations of the foods products adulteration committee of the house of commons in  as regards the establish ment of a court of reference such a court of referenceshould be empowered to rnake sch orders as they think proper respecting standards of the quality and purity of food and furtherthe proposed court of reference should be entrcsted with the duty of collecting and comnnunicating to public analysts and others information as to new and unrecogzed forms of adulteration and also ofexamnicng and pronouncing upon new methods of analysisthe advantages of such a court of reference are apparent there are many processes which are considered by manufacturers as harm less while others regard them with raisgiving the fact that such differences of opinion exist is an additional argument for the establishment of a tribunal of this kindthe prohibition of all chemicals and drugs as food preservatives is often strongly urged whether such a prohibition is practicable or notis a question into which we shau not enter here i but at any rate it would not appear to be too much to demand that a frank and bona fide notice of the use of preservatives should be made compulsory and that the loose and evasive methods which the law now recognizes of advising the public of the existence of re sorvatives and adulterants should be abolisfed the system of warrauties outlined above is also one which deservedly comes in for con demnation the advocates of reform would bring in legislation to do away with this system and enable the one prosecution to bring all the parties concerned into courtdinrrio or adulteatrolrthese are the principal objects of the re formers it wiu be seen that a great deal depends on the definition given to the word adulteration it will be neoessary therefore for a right understanding of this question to look more closely into the meaning of this word strictly speakingthe term means the admixture to some article of a foreign substance or the addition of an extra amount of a substance already present in the article the former is the more ordinary method of adulteration the latter is also a common practice as in the case of adding water to milk an extended meaning of the word includes p third form of adulterationthat is the abstraction of some valuablei ingredient from the article in question as in the i case of the separation of fat from milk other fraudulent methods allied to adulteration include the actual substitution of one article for another and the addition of preservatives and colouring matters it would be a weari some task to enumerate even the principal articles which suffer adulteration but some of the more interesting general methods may be mentionedthe most important item of our diet is milk on account of its enormous valie as a food for children for sick persons and for the aged mtilk jadulteration comes principally under three of the headings given ahove in other words milk may have water added to it fats abstracted from it or preservatives mixed with it the present standard of milk under the food and drugs acts provides for  per cent of fatty solids and  per cent of nonfatty solids in good dairying counties such as dorset devon or hereford such a percentage is greatly exceeded but in a county with a clayey soil like essex for instance the margin is not so great it would be quite practicable however to insist on a higher standard of fatty and nonfatty solids as it is the sharp farmer is careful to see that his milk does not exceed this standard by toning his good milk with separated milk so as to attain this percentage and no more an even mbre scientific method is to have the cows fed down systematically a poor diet consisting largely of brewers grains and hot water has been found to produce a large yield of milk of low quality the defence is then made that the milk is not actually adulterated being the best that the cow can produce as indeed it istha usz or pzresexvativrsfinally there is the serious subject of the use of preservatives in milk the commonest pre servative employed is boric acid the objections to which may be briefly stated it retards the decomposition of milk and so permits of stale milk being sold as fresh it interferes with the digestive functions for it is urged that a drug strong enough to retard decomposition mayo also prevent the metabolism or breaking up processes of digestion lastly the consunmer of preserved milk has no control over the drug which he is taking fifteen grains of boric acid is a medicinal dose the milk may be subjected to the addition of preservatives by the farmer and again by the purveyor and ma thus contain a double amount it should also be remembered that boric is so universally used that one may take it not only with ones milk but also in butter bacon tinned meats and some fresh meats the overwhehning objection to its use is therefore that it contitutes an un controlled slow steady and surreptitious form of druggingboric acid is of very common oecutrrence in sausages as bread which is a large ingredient decomposes very quickly the worst offenders are what are known in the trade as returns these sausageswhen stale are collected from the small i purveyor and brought to the sausage maker i wvho so to speak rejuvenates them by the addition of more boric recooks them and i refills them into the skins extra doses of boric are therefore certain in this class of trade the pity of it is that the poorer districts suffer most in respect of preservatives as goods con taining them are cormonly sold unblushingly over the counter in the betterclass districts goods sold over the counter are usually fresh the boricdusted goods being reserved for clients who order their food to bo sent to their doors other preservatives such as forrnalde hyde have an injurious effect in irritating the skin and in aggravating skin diseasesm ods of the r foodraxf it is not to be supposed that these are the only preservatives used boric acid is so well known and so constantly looked for bv the analyst that the wily  foodfaker  is con stantly experimenting with new preservatives or with other drugs to cloak the presence of known ones in this he is helped by the text books written for the guidance of the analyst which serve him as an inexhaustible store house of inspiration an interesting example of this is given by dr monierwilliams in his report to the local government board on the subject he mentions a newv preservative which came under his notice this preparation known as  mystin was very widely advertised for preserving milk and cream and trade circulars of the most barefaced description were sent broadcast to farmers and others it was stated that mnystin could not be detected by analysis end that it was free from preservatives of any kind on analysis dr monierwilliarns found that mystin contained sodiumn nitrite  per cent formaldehyde  per cent and water  per cent the formaldehyde was the preservative in this case but the advantage of sodium nitrite a dangerous drug with a powerful action on the heart was not at first apparent the riddle was however successfully solved by dr monierwilliams who found that the admixture of sodium nitrite was used to cloak the presence of the formaldehyde which could not be detected by the usual reaction for which the analyst would naturally lookbxmmn ad t onmr foodsas regards butter the principal forms of adulteration are the addition of water and the substitution of foreign matters the maximum amount of moisture allowed in butter is probably excessive irish butter generally honestly con tains more moisture than english butter and owing to the pressure brought by these legitimate interests together with the powerful support of the buttersubstitute class the amount of moisture now legally recognized is  per cent while the socalled  millsblended  butter may by the act of  legally contain  per cent of water butter of this kind atls or is d per lb though perfectly whole some is dearer than good butter at is dthe other inportant aspect of butter adultera tion is the substitution of margarine mar garine which is made from fats of all kinds stearin and dripping is of course a good food and as long as it is not sold as butter no objection can be urged against its usethe list of articles which suffer adulteration of various kinds is a lengthy one in addition to the cases already enumerated it will besufficient to mention the use of sulphate of copper a dangerous poison to impart anrtificia green colour to preserved peas beans and other vegetables the addition of wheatflour and turmorio to mustard nzd the abstrac tion from it of the vegetable oils the presence of sandy matter in pepper of saccharin and arsenio in beer the coating of rice with powdered tale and the contixination of canned foods by tin and leadfnaut essecesthe most typioal cases of substitution are afforded by jams and jellies apple pulp coloured and chemically flavoured is the principal material substituted a couple of representative analyses may be cited a sample of strawberry jelly was found to contain  per cent of corn syrup  per cent of apple juice  per cent of granulated sugar and i per cent of colouring and flavouring matter this was an american preparation a sample of rasp berry jam yielded on analysis  per cent apple juice  per cent svrup and sugar and  per cent colouring and flavouring matter these colouring and flavouring matters belong to the group of aniline dye products any colour and any fiavour can be imitated by them while the basis of the various jams remains the sameapple pulp or something of the sort like the pies manufactured by sam wellers frien of whlich cats formed the staple basis it is so to speak  the seasonin as does it but though the colour and the flavour can be thus reproduced bv svnthetic fruit juices we have no means of determining if these products about which little is known are wholesome some of them indeed are known to be harmful aniline dyes are also used to give beet sugar the appearance of the old brown demerara sugardismsim foodenough has been said to show the prevalence of adulteration in almost all branches of foodproduction to complete this review somel reference should be made to two allied subjects diseased food and the contamination of food by handling in transit they do not properly come within the sphere of this article but they must be faced by anyone desirous of dealing with the general subject of the purity of our food supply and may be briefly mentioned diseased meat and diseased milk are mostformidable enemies of the community much has been accomplished by legislation to copex with the evil but a great deal remains to be done the few private slaughterhouses which still exist should be abolished and the use of public slaughterhotuses made compulsory ondy in this wav can the killing for consumption of tuberculous and other diseased animals be absolutely checkedas regards milk much miglht be effected by the passing of the milk and dairies bill introduced by mr burns in  tho bill provides for the more effective registration and inspection of dairies and the consequent prevention of the sale of tuberculous milk though the wider question of milk adulteration is left where it iscontammated foodthe whole subject of the contamination of food by dirty handling exposure and so forth is also an important one as sir frederick treves has said if a nonmeateating being from another planet eould see how our meat was thrown about handled by dirty hands and exposed to dust and germ contamination he would never dream it could be an article of diet the proper wrapping of meat in transit from the slaughterhouse to the shop its pro tection from flies and other sources of infection are objects to secure which it might be thought it should only be necessary to direct public attention expense is of course ani important factor nothing but the pressure of public opinion will induce the butcher to add to his expenses the heavy costs which the adequate wrapping of meat involves an educational campaign should be entered into as regards other important details in meat handling how seldom does one see meat wiped as it should bein order to remove the seunm which continually xoozes from it and is a perfect curltural medium i for the growth of bacteria  similar remarks applv to the handling of bread bread is one ofthe few foods which undergo no process of cook ing on the part of the consumer in the case of other foods there is an opportunitv by boiling or baking of killing bacilli in bread there is no such opportunity it is important therefore that bread should be wrapped as is done inamerica by a few firns in this coiuitrv and on i some of the railwavs both on the continent and at home in america bread is made generally of one standard shape so that wrapping machi nery can be employed in this country the varying shape of the loaf prevents an economical use of such a rmachineadulteration disease and contamination these are the three principal lines along which a campaign with the object of improving the i conditions of our food supply should be con ducted the foregoing romarks have been written with a view of setting forth as tem  perately as possible the more usual frauds i which are practised on the public it should be borne mn mind however that as much harm mav be done by an excess of zeal as by in difference in these matters the association of the  modern  disease of appendicitis with the modern practice of using boric acid is a case in point exaggeration of this kind can only give occasion to the enemy to blaspheme and result in setting back the hands of the elock of pro gress the fact that honest differences of opinion can and do exist as to the propriety for instance of using a smnall amnount of pre servative far from being a weapon in the hand of the enemy is perhaps the soiundest argpument for the creation of a court of reference where such questions could be threshed out and determined
