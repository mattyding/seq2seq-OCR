the irish mieat trade export of fat stock and store cattlethe cattlo exported from ireland to cross channel marketing centres consist for the most part of fat cattle ready for butchering and store cattle which go to supply the requirements of english and scottish graziers and feeders the irish annual production of stock for export and home use is about one million head fully fourfifths of these are sent across channel each year the normal export of live cattle from ireland to scottish and english ports ranges from  to  yearly and of theso it may be taken that by far the largest proportion are store cattle the fat cattle exported in an average year approximates to  the bulk of which are shipped to liverpool and glasgow and form a large hasis of supply to butchering concerns in the industrial centres of north england and scotlanddead meatthe established natuire of tha trade in fat stock witlh its composite factors of cattlebuyers or shippers on the one sicle and salesmen or butchers on the other as well as the shortness of the seapassage betvween the two countries has hitherto precluded any necessity to consider the establishment of a tradel in dreswsed beef careasses further in the past the qualitv of irish fat cattle shipped was for tlie most part below the standard requisite to bring paying prices in loindon however iuithin the last five vears as the result of lsing purce shorthorn and aberdeenanguis bujlls subsidized by the ldepartment of acricultnre irish fat stock hare becomne vstlv improved in quality and are very little inferioer to the bet scottishfed beasts this fact coupled with the nlexpected outbreak of footandwn outh disease in   whiech for several mnotllihs paralysed the whole live sock trade hetwncn the two coutntries has brought into prominence the feasibilitv of erecting abattoirs at suitable centres for the slaughter and dispatch of dressed carcasses to england two such abattoirs exiist at wexford and drogheda and a number of others are in eontemplatinthe idea is not to supplant theo present trade in the shipping of lrish fat cattle buit to provide an altfrnat ive method of marketing for the primer sorts whose full value can be best realized at smithfield as well as to esta blish a provision against a complete block in marketing fat stock when thc outbreak of disease compels the closiug of ports and feeders have no means of disposing of stock reacdy for saledimcvirtis to bsf fac rdsmithfield salesmen are fully alivo to the fact that tlie disproportion hebtrecn the home killed supplies of beef forwarded to inarket and the imported coummodity is yearly becoming of serious consequence and would gladly wel come ireland ns a contributing source even slhould the technical requiremnents as regards manner of dressing which smnithfield dernands be fully comnplied with and transit arrangenments as well as freight charges between the killing centre and london satisfactorily arranged the establishment of a dead meat trade from ireland sinilar to that which exists in scotland is linited on the one hand by the numbers of cattle which are sufficiently well finished to meet the moust remunerative market viz smithfield and on the other by the prices smithfield can offer in light of the bulk of the argentine and other oversea supplies and the hold which the large american companies rmain tain in the regulation of demand and supply and consequently on current market ratesmutioxnthe average sheep stocks in ireland for the decade  totalled  the num bers in  reached  but since then ireland in common with nearly all mutton producing countries has shown a steady shrinkage in numbers the rise in mutton prices during the past few years has however counteracted the contraction of the numbers available for export so that though the total sheep exports in  were  or  less than the number sent across channel in  the total value of these  represented an increase of  on the revennm derived from this class of stock in the preceding year the quantity of mutton exported in the form of dressed carcasses repre sents on an average fromn  to  sheep yearly or approximately onetwentieth of the live sheep supplythe same causes are operative in deciding the proportions of the live sheep and dressod tnutton trade as those indicated with respect to beef the closing of the ports during the sunmmer of  gave a compulsory fillip to the export of dressed mutton most of this how ever was consigned to liverpool and aian chester and other industrial centres in thonorth of england though a fair proportion was marketed at smithfieldfoimgn competionqias in the case of beef irish mutton carcasses sent to smithfield come into competition vith the top qualities of prime scotch mutton as well as the finer qualities of the new zealand australian and argentine supply and unless the quality and finish as well as the freshness of condition when marketed are up to the standard reached by the competing sources prices per smithfield stone slb rarely exceed current rates paid by honeo butchers or by shippers for export alive to the north and midland marketing centres in englandat some junctures of the season the trade in dressed mutton with snmithfield has been un questionably extremnely profitable to irish pro ducers and consignors but the market is open i to much fluctuation and is to a great extentdependent on the foreign supply still with the provision of more abattoirs and eloser experience of the requirements and conditions of the london market it is probable that a llarzer and larger bulk of the finer qualitiesof mutton sheep will bo marketed at smith field the provision of sfafe and satisfactory conditions of transit are of less difficulty than in tho case of beef carcaseos and

crosschannel markets and  for homo slaughter to be consumed als fresh pork or in the homecured stato on farms the first of these objects takes by far the largest bull of the available supply the
