droitwich a centre of the salt tradesalt manufacture is carried on in many parts of england while a recent interesting develop ment is the attempt to open up rock salt mines at carrickfergus in the north of ireland in england the most important deposits are in cheshire and wvorcestershire in the first named county thi centres of the trade are northlwich middlewich wvinsford and sand bach a typical centre of the industry mav however be selected in droitwiclh the oldest town in worcestershire t he salt vells here are believed to have been worked since prehis toric times evidence of the ancient character of the industry is to be fournd in the old salt ways which connect droitwich with other midland centres and whicl were the main highways of the salt traffic in the days before canals and railways provided other means of transport and superseled the pack horse many of ths old worcestershire manors possessed the right to evaporate salt from wells on their own estates and there are entries in domes day book which bear upon this domestic in dustry the salt deposits at droitrieh belong to the marls of the newr red sandstone and there are similar deposits at stoke a few miles distant where the saltt union hias estab lished works itle ells at stoke are known to have been worked for niearlv a centurv it is claimed that i he brine obtained froim the wells at stoke and droitwich is the purest in the world containing oer  per cent of plre salt  pevoxratxon pnocessat one period almost all the salt for commer cial or domestic use w as obtained by i he evaporation of sea water several new pro cesses have been introduced during recent years but thle common method of working is the evaporation process in wiorcestershire shafts comparable in diameter to an ordinary colliery shaft and lined with cast iron are stnk to the necessary depthl which at droitwich is less than ft and at stoke is nearly ft the sinlking being continued as a borehole a further ft to ft to tap the brine tihis rises in the wells at droitwich to within ft of the surface and is thence pumped into a reservoir having a capacity of about  gallons at stoke the brine has to be pumped from a depth of over ft the process at droitwich is the old method of evaporation the brine is run from the reservoir into pans wlhich are of various types for different pro ducts and subjected to the necessary degree of heat required for coarse and fine quaelities of salt ranging from  deg f for broad salt to deg f for fine salt coal is now the fuel used for the furnaces but it is said that in earlier years the local forest of feckenham was largely drawn upon for wood fuel for the fuirnaces during the process of evaporation the crystals are collected and the commercial salt is dried in bulk or in blocks the best table salt is produced by a special process of mechanical agitation in enclosed pans this having the effect of causing the salt to be de posited in the form of very fine crystals the frnal process is the grinding one reason for the long persistence of the droitwich industry is the high percentage of pure salt yielded by tho brino whiclh averages loz per gauon by the evaporation method definite figures as to the production of salt in great britain ore not easy to obtain but the output which is an increasing one is about  metrio tons a yoar
