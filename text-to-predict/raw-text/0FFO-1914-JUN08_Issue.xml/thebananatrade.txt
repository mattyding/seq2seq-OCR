the banana trade american and british importstho growth of the banana trade is one of the most marvellous of the many romances of modern maritime commerce in the middle of the last century a banana was never seen in this country except as occasionally growvn for its noble foliage rather than for its fruit in the hothouses of the rich or as a subtropical rarity brought home by a traveller from madeira or the canaries today there is scarcely a towvn and hardly even a village in great britain where bananas sufficient for a hearty meal may not be bought in excellent condition for a few pence given adequate facilities for trans port from the tropical or subtropical regions in which it flourishes and of storage and dis tribution in the countries to which it is exported it is perhaps the fruit which beyond all others is best adapted for commercial exploitation on a large scalelt is of very rapid growth the fruit being ready to gahqr within  months of the firsc planting of the parent stock it is wholesome palatable and though not so rich weight for veight in nutritive matter as other foodstuffs t is quite amazingly fertile as is showvn by the following almost incredible figures which we giveontheauthority of the wellinformed writer quoted bblow banana  ibs of food per acre potatoes  lbs wheat  lbs it is immune to bacterial infection so long as its outer skin is intact and bv a suitable adjustment of the conditions of transport and storage its ripening after severance from the parent stock can bo accelerated or retarded within limits varying from two or three to  or  days or even more indeed it suffers nothing from this severance and even in regions where it grows the bunches of fruit are always cut before they are ripe the individual bananas being cut from the bunch for con sumption as they ripen in due courserise of the thadeyet with all these claims to be reckoned as potentially one of the most important of food staples the banana only began to assert its importance in tllat capacity within the memory i of men still jiving somewhere in the sixties of the last century captain bush the master of a schooner trading between the united states and the west indies shipped as an experimont a few bunches of bananas in jamaica for sale in the united states the venture was so successful that in  he was ablo to employ seven vessels in carrying the fruit to amlerican ports from port anvonio which is stijl the principal seat of the jamaica banana trade with the wvestern continent captain bush was thus the pioneer of the export banana tarade in the west indies but its real founder was captain l d baker of boston us who at first followed bushs example in an individual venture but very soon discerned the possibilities of the trade and founded the famous boston fruit company with capital sufficient to purchase large tracts of land for the cultivation of bananas and to provide steam vessels specially equipped for the transport of the fruit in bulk and in good condition to ports in the united states as far north a s bostonthe urr fsrur cosrawin  the total export of fruit from jamaica was valued at only  then came the pioneer efforts of captain bush followed by the more highlv organized enterprise of captain baker in  the value of the fruit export had risen to  the chief staple of export being now bananas ten years later in  the value of the export had risen to  and by the end of the last century it stood at very little short of  even then however the trade was still in its infancy early in the present century the boston fruit comnpany became the united fruit company with larger interests and more extended opera tions in  the total number of bunches of bananas imported by the operations of these companies from all parts into the united states as  for the united iruit companyand  for other companies making a total in all of  the esti mate for  was  bunches imported by theunited fruit companv and  bunches imported by other companies or a total of  in all we take these figures together with much other valuable and authentic information or the subject froian exhaustive monograph or   lhe bat na lts cultivation distribution and commercial uses written by mir william fpawcett fls formerly  director of public gardens and plantations in jamaica and published uader the auspices of the west india committee by lmessrs duckworth and cote caaay bananain s the total importation of canary bananasthere was at that time no other source of supplyinto england amounted only to about  binches in the first nine nmonths of  the import into the united kingdom from the canaries alone amounted to sorne  binches out of a total im ported from all parts of nearly  bunches sir alfred jones was the real lpioneer of of this gigantic development tthe west indieshaving regonerated the canaries by means of tho banana sir alfred jones next turned his attention to the west indies in  ab the instanco of mr chamberlain then secretary of state for the colonies he founded tho imperial direct west india amail service with fortniglttlv sailings of shipsspecially constructed for the convevance of bananas in good conditioni across the atlantic ho was to receive for  years a subsidy of  half to be paid by the imperial government and half by the government of jamaica one of the conditions being that each ship should carry at least  bunches of bananas but as the subsidy was not renewed by the jamaica govermnent xvhen the  years expired the direct senice is now at an enddevelopment i eunorzwe tako from mr fawcetts pages the follow ing account of its development in kluropethe total number of bunches exported for the year ended september   from the canary islands to all parts was nearly j millions of which nearly  a millions went to england while the rest was divided up between germany france italy and a fair pro portion went to egypt during the winter months germany takes a largo proportion france is taking at present  bunches of west india bananas weekly tia liverpool and dunkirk and this trade only commenced at the end of the year  the rest of the bananas sold in france all come from the canary islands the consumption of bananas on the continent of europe is incresing fast although mosb of the countries protect their native fruits by means of an import duty for instance in  only  bunches oi bananas were imported into france this rose in  to  bunches and in  to  bunches the bamnaas sold in the south of prance and in algeria under the name of dahomev bamanas as a role all corne

the following figures giving  number of bunches of wvhich about  in each year were reexported and  allowing an average of  for each bunch number of bananasthat the ripening of the banana in transit and storage is now being done on a vastly growing scale and with everincreasing success is shownc by the statistics we have quoted above
