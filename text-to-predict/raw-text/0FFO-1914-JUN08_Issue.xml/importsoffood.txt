imports of food variations in the last twenty years diagrams and explanationsthe imports into this country fromn all sources of our principal items of food during a period of  years to the commencement of the current year have been spread over two diagrams to avoid overcrowdinig and confusion values are given in millions from one to  and then to save space in  amounts these food imports may be divided into six groups as follows i beef mutton bacon  tea coffee cocoa sugar refined and the total sugar imports  eggs butter cheese wheat and flour  fruit fresh and dried  miscellaneous consisting of fish and lardbeef muiton and baconthe first group indicated by the contour lines is a very important one our imports of beef mutton and bacon have inereased more thanimportant food import it is notable that wviilst thosa imports ere continually increasing the land under whent in creat brittkin he con tinuously dininished thus in ireland not very long go tihere were  acres undler wheat now there are only  te contour line for wleait otl tie diagram witli some mrinor reductions of imports shows a steady increase from thn sx lovel of  to the  level of  an inereaso of i the  ontour line for flour and wleptimeual is tho only one on the diagrnmi showing a serious drop in our imports it commences in  at the level of  and rises until s to the   level it then drops wvith somo minor fluctuations to the  level in  there is a sharp rise to last year wvhen it reaches  the marked drop in the contoiur line of wheat during  is due to a decline of imports which during threo su ecessive years wereoooct cwt pnd again coowt tho fluctuations during the years  to  are eniplained bhy the following figures lmports r     n   sl i  i the fail inthe value of flour imported indicated by the contour line from  onwards is due partly to diminished supplies  but to a greater degree to the fall of prices during  it was s d per cwt and during  s lid a difference of s d equal to  per cent whilst the imports only fell off to the extent of  per cent the two combined account for the drop of the contour line the fall in the imports is entirely due to the united states requiring their owvn output our imports from them filling off from cwt to cwt in the course of a fewyearsfrarr fish and lastlhe imports of fresh fruit have nearl y doubled in value and those of dried fruit have irncreased nearl  per cent in  tho fresh fruit imports barely reach the  level during the last three years they have been above e  the dried fnrit contour is a much lower one indicating much smaller imports in  the line rises into the  level and then remains below it for five years in  it reached the  level the fish contour on the dia gram showvs occasional fluetuations but on the whole a steady rise on the diagram lard commences on the  level and finished last year at  after several fluctuationsdlairam of values of some of the main articles of food stppily impoirited duringc tihelast  years per cent during the last  years of these three items our imports of beef have show n the most striking increases amountingr to  between   and   it may be interesting to note that whlilst the imports of beef increased to such an enormous extent our imports of cattle fell off from  in  to  in  the diagram indicates a nriom gradual increse of our imports of mutton which have more than doubled  in  they amotnted to  and last yoar to  an increaese of e the diagram indicates violent fluctuations in our imports of bacon after remaining stationary for some years they inereased with great rapidity to  and then fluctuated repeatedly increasing rapidly to the end of last year as shown our bacon imports in  amounted to  and last vear reached  it will be apparent of course that the imports of this group compete with british and irish beef mutton and baconunited states ilnluencethe deviations of the contour lines for beef and mutton arc inainlv influenced by pricesdiauraimi of ealus of some of thle main articles of food supply liported during thelast  yearsand suppl last vear when the diagramn shows the highest levels wholesale prices for meat were the highest on record as the demand was in excess of the worlds supply that was accentuated bv the alteration in the united states tariff which placed meat oln the free list a verv considerable proportion of our beef supplies formerly came from the united states now they are not able to supply their own requirements and have been competing with us in argentina australia and new zealand the deficiency of the united states supply is due both to the decline of the number of cattle and sheep and the increase of the population that deficieney and the increased demand will continue to influence british consumers dturing  the aggregate quantity of beef and mutton available for eonsumption in this country was less than  per cent more than during  the demand was well maintained throughout the year while home supplies were even lighter than during  these are the influences wlhich send the contour lines on the diagram tup the prices of frozen meat have advanced steadily taking the average quotation of meat during  at the arbitrary figure of  the relative increases haire been as follows            united states competition is indicated by the highest of theseaccording to the diagram do not fluctuato below the  level or above the  last year they just exceeded  the first time according to the hiogram since  cocoa reachedthe bighlest level last vearour imports of siigar are shown under two headingsrefined sugar and otur total imports of all classes the diagraim shosn that our imports of sugar of every variety are on a verv large scale far exceeding those of tea coffee and cocoa combined the fluctuiations are very considerable duiring  thev dropped to the  level the higlhest point shown is in   since then the diagramn shows a fall to  last year if the contour line for refined sulgar is compared with that for total sugar imports they will be seen to fluctuate together but the former verv mulch more violently the lowest levels were during    and  the highest level reached in  was  the diagram shows a rapid decline siicebounties and drocgrtsinu order to appreciate the great flnctutations shown by the two contour lines for sugar sorrieknowledge of the trade during recent years isi necessary this is supplied by the article on sugarrefining in which the rise of the beet sugarindustry on the continent the crippling of the refining trade in the united kingdom and also of cane plnters in certain parts of the worldby the system of continental bounties and the brussels convention with its effect npon the i sugar trade are dealt with it is to these in i fluerices that the movements in the contour lines are chiefly attributable the high level of the sugar contour lines shown for   is explairiedj by the long drought in europe which reduced tho beet crop by onefourth it is probable i that the price would have been still higher even i if we could have imported larger quantities from russia but that was averted fortunately byv the increased output of cane sugar due to the convention the low level of the sugar contour lines of  is due to the low price of sugar during that year when it fell to s d fob hamburg the lowest price ever reached that arose from the unlimited production of sugar encouraged by the bounty system and that price had no relationship whatever to the cost of production it was in fact only threefourths of the cost the convention put a stop to overproduction and the rise in the contour lineon the diagram indicates the return to naturali prices due to supply and demandthe rise in the contour line for tea from  to  is due mainly to increase of price as the quantity imported only increased to a limited extent the englishspeaking nations are the largest consumeis of tea together they consume over b the second largest consumers are the russians who import about  per cent of the quantity we dojhe drop of the tea contour line in  isf explained by the followving import figures b    b  rho low level of tho coffee contour line in  and in  arose fromi smaller inuortseggs rrrer and cheesetho imports of eggs butter and cheeseshown on the diagrams are fromn abroad a reference to the contour lines for eggs and butter shows almost continuous increases the lowest level the diagram shows for eggs is for   tlho rise is then continuous to last year the contour line for butter rises generally to  in  there wvas a slight drop to last year the con tour line for cheese does not show the same tendeny to riso as some of the others thus the levels for  and  are just over  the marked drop of  is due to a fau in price and the drop of  is due both to smauer imports and low priceswvieat and flourthe diagram has wheat at the top as our mostfigures it would have been still higher if excep itionally large supplies had not been received from i australia the upward trend of the beef con tour line from  onwards is partly due to increased quantities imported during  they first exceeded cwt the rise from  to  is due to increased imports which increased from cwt in s to cwt during  the diagram shows a marked drop during  for mutton thatarose from a fall in prices the drop in the contour line for bacon luring  arnses from diminished iniports which fell from  cwt during  to  during  the remarkable rise in the contotur line from  to  is due entirely to reduced im ports for imports over that period showed a decline while the value rose from  to  the total weight fell from cwt to scwttia coffee cocoa and sugarn i the second group tea coffee cocoa and sugar are entirely oversea products our imports of tea are shown by the diagram not to have fuctuated in amount to any great degree for many years in succession as shown they remained about the  to  level but during recent vears the diagram shows a rapid increase of imports from  in  to  lsst year  our imports of coffee are relatively small anid
