cattle and beef      i the upward teendency of prices the future supplyit will be generally admitted that beef constitutes one of the worlds most import ant food products its importance has steadily increased with the allrouniad advance in the standard of living of civilized peoples and it is safe to say that in the future it is likely to occupy a higher rather than a lower place in the qstirnation of consumers as a staple article of diet its growth in popularity has been so fast that the demand has tended to outdistance the supplyprices have advanced steadilv if not rapidly practically tlroughout the workl in certain f the principal consuming countries this advance has amounted to between  and  per cent in a period which might almost be compassed by the past decade  naturally this advance has caused a great outcry aimong consumers and various expedieints have been suggested or adopted with a view to bringing about a eaction these expedients had their founda tion in the belief that the rise in prices was to a very large extent artificiel having been brought about by a combination of tlhe big meat packing and distributing companies particularly on the other side of tho atlantic careful consideratioti of the whole eircunistances howevor points irresistibly to the conclusion that at the worst they did no more than talke advantage of a movement wlhich had its origin in much more widespread conditions than could be artificially created by any known aggregation of capital the naturalincrease of population and its concentration in the cities and large towns are factors which have had a powerful influence on the price of meatmhia picnsin considering the present position and future supplies of cattle it is advislble that the high price of meat should be as far as possible disregarded on the ground that factors which may affect the one are to some extent extraneous to the other there can be no question of a monespoly in cattleraising that would be an undertaking the magnitudo of which might daunt the most enterprising monopolist other factors which afect the price of meat are the cost of handling and of transportation these all come into play after the cattle have disappeared into the abattoir so that the price of meat is useful to the cattle raiser chiefly as an index to the state of the demand no doubt it is generally true that high meat values mean big prices for catlic and may indeed be to some extent a result of these but on the other hand it is quite conceivable that cattli raisers might not be getting prices conimonsuiiio witlh tiho advance in meat prices the hiigh priees of cattle are attributable to a combination of circumstances among which may bo mentioned the higher standard of living as reflected in a larger per capita consumption of meat the enormous inerease in the number of meat consumners and the lack of expanlsion in the number of cattle raised partly owing to the difficulty of finding suitably located grazing land at a moderate price and partly due to the lesire to market beef cattle as soon as possiblo in order to take advantage of tho high pricesgaocauipnicai dtstrburronauthorities from tihme to time

considering these figures allox ance must be made for work and dairy cattlo thus in the case of british india a very small proportion would fall to be enumerated as beef cattle and in sich countries as denmark verv substantial deductions would have to be made for dairy cattle the worlds totil of btef cattle may be placed at approximatelv  of these the united states isestimated to possess a proportion which if i the size and type of the animals be taken into account would represent onefourth reduced to terms of beeffigures which would show whether the wrorlds herds are increasing and if so by what percentage are not available but there are few authorities wvho venture to hod that on the best showine the numbers have been mnore thani maintained for a number of years pastcattle and poptlationit has long been an accepted axiom that population is one of the factors which deter ine the number of cattle in any countrv it is obvious that as population increases more cattle will be necessary and it is true that up to a certain point the herds increase wvith the population but then comes the time when the population is so dense that the availablo land must be utilized for the raising of the most profitable food products and pasturage has to give place to cultivation  consequently as the population increases bevond that point the number of cattle per capita declines but this cannot be accepted as an invariable rule although it may be near enough to the mark as regards beef cattle in denmark with its dense population the number of cattle per capita is estirnatedat  wlhichl is much larger than that of any other eurodean cmintrv but that is easilyaccounted for by its preerninence in the dairying industry on the other hand south america and australia top the list because they have hugo areas of land which meanwhile can be turned to profitable account by cattle raising alone argentina can boast of  cattle per capita australia comes next with   brazil with l and

beef now the teeming industrial populatibns of germany austriahungary france and bel gium are demanding that the outside supplies of frozen meat at present or until quite re cently excluded should be mado available to them it is estimated that the granting of this demand would add at least oooo to the consumers of frozen meat and as britain already absorbs  per cent of the supplies it is not difficult to foresee a much more serious shortage than has yet been experienced for years the united states was the only exporter of frozen meat but for some time past the shipments have been gradually dwindling until last year it became an importer happily just when the shipments from the united states began to  fall away argentina completed extensive refrigerating plant and came to the front as an exportei that counttys contri bution to the worlds supplies iicreased rapidly and now it is easily the largest shipper canada at one time appeared to hold out considerable promise of becoming a substantial exporter but the population increasedso rapidly and the herds grew so slowly that theexportable surplus soon disappearedsorh a mait is clear that it is with south america that

year roind constitute conditions for cattle raising which are certainly not ex celled anywhere the present stock of cattle is far below the capacity of the country on the whole breeding has been carefully looked after and the yield of beef in proportion to the number of animals is likely to increase rather than decline even although it be admitted that argentina is now slaughtering up to the capacity of its herds the conditions are so favour able that it is only reasonable to look for a considerable increase in the course of the next few yearsbrazil is also an important cattle couhtrybut tho animals are much below those of argentina in point of quality urtjgtay seems to come next to arpentina in the matter of perfect ranching conditions and althotugh the herds are still comparatively small and the beef qualities of the animals rather inferior to those of argentina it is forging ahead as an exporter paraguay venezuela and bolivia all have distinct prospects as cattle producersaustnamua and soru atcathe only other country with anything approaching immediate prospects of bcorniing a substantial beef exporter is australia the australian herds at present onlv comprise

refrigerating works more rapid development may be looked forsouth africa and particularlv rhodesia are spoken of as having great possibilities but here also the work of building up herds has been little moro than begun the total cattle in the country is estimated at less than  and it will bo years before south africa can hope to attain amy degree of eminence as a meat exporterfue of thie

ranges have been gradually pushed to the limits of the avail able country and tho time has come when it mav be said that there is no new ranching land available what is known as the  range country  is

the locline appears to have been steadyl if not rapid but nevertheless it is worthy of note that moic recentlv the beef production has not declined although the number of cattle has a circmstanco which is accounted for by the grcat improvement in the grado of the cattlo as beef producerseven recoanized authorities differ as to the future of the ranges it is probably in evitable that the need for closer cultivation will gradually curtail the area of tho ranges but it does not necessarily follow that the number of cattle will be correspondingly re duced as it is believed that by moro efncient management a greater number of cattle could be supported this applies particularly to the open or frce ranges the present condition of wlich is very unsatisfactory it must not be assumed hlowever that the number of cattle is the real criterion on the contrary more beef might be produced from fewer cattle as already indicated there has been a great improvement in the beefproducing qualities of the cattle on all wellconducted ranges and in all probability the limit has not vet been reached then tlero is the qulestion of how far the deficiency in rango cattle may bo made good by the general adoption of cattle renring on a moderate scale by the small farner it is obvious that it will take years before the small farmers vwill be able to produce n many cattle as they previoivly displaced on thio rpnges it has also to be borne in mind that with the increase in tho ponnlation there is an evergrowing need for milh cows bnt after every allowance is made it seerms onlv reasonable to conclide that by the careful utilization of all his advantages the small farmer may be able to malko good no mean proportion of the beef production on the ranges which he may have displaced
