tinned meat amd fish   excellence of the potted articlethe idea of preserving food is one which must havo occurred to mens minds in very primitive times there are seasons when food is abund ant and times when provender is scarce there are moreover fat years and lean years such as occlurred in egypt in josephs time to store food when there is plenty and so make provision for the rainy day is almost an elementary instinct and one that man shares with rnmanv of the lower strata of animate beings sach as the squirrel and the beewithout special treatment however there are surprisingly few foods which lend them selves to preservation by such an ordinary means as drying or even smnoking so in course of time other methods were evolved the em ploymeent of a preserving mediuma such as brino or vinegar led to the making of piclded goods while other articles such as fruit were found to defy decomposition when boiled in the form of jam it is along the latter and at first sight more vnpromising of these two lines that the greatest advance has been made in preserving foods though tho theoretical basisthe bacterial causation of decompositionwhich mderlies the priaciple of sterilization by boiling is a fairly recent conception in actual practice tlhe preservation of food by this method is by no means newit is not easv to fix the precise date of the first preparations of food sterilized by boiling in tins and marketed in that form the pioneer seems to have been one francois appert who intro duced the process early in the th century one of the earliest records in this country is that of an irish firmr which supplied soup pre served in this wvay to the franlin expedition  the idea was taken up by the other branch of preserved food makersthe pickle and sauce manufacturersand pickles and saucestinned and potted goods are now generally made by the same firmsmaxvyactvdijg processesthero is not much to describe as regards manufactuiring processes the cooking was formerly done in large open bins filled with cold water through wlhich steam was allowed to percolate it is now accomplished in closed retorts where the stean is let in tunder pressure and a higher temperature thus secured the food to be cooked is packed in a tin the lid of which is soldered on wvhen the cooking is finished the lid is punctured to allow the heated air to escape and the hole soldered up the contents sterilized by boiling are thus kept airtight required within recent years packing in glass has largely comne into favour for many special articles in this caso the lid is secured by a rubber band and has to be held in position by a couple of clips until cook ing has taken place when heated the air is driven out through the rim where the rubber l band is and a vacuum being created the cap issecured by atmospheric pressure there is a tendency for the acid present in most foods to corrode the tin when kept for a long time but as a general rule there is no special virtue in glass as compared withl tin coods thus preserved lool better and tho customer is able to see what be is buying for export purposes tins are o course stronger and saferadvtxtaces of tuned foodsmany varieties of potted meats and fish paste and so forth are put up in this wvay lhe meat is cut up by revolving knives ground between rollers and treated by the usual process all sorts of meats and mixtures of meats are so treated and the larger firns place on the market quiite an astonishing number of blends such as chicken andl ham turkey and tongue salmon and shrimp and bloater paste as well as pastes many other kinds of meat such as tongues fowl hares pressed meat sausageks and almost every conceivable form of animal produce are also canned fish are t inned on the coast where they are landed sardines smelts and other fish are canned in the country of origin and taken by tho english firms wlho inspect samnples to see that they are up to standard befrre labelling thcm vith their name in this way it is almost certainly the case that tinned fish are in many instances fresher thaa tho product wlhich is bought from the retailer the canning being done wvithin a fewv hours of the time wlhen they are causght tie sainm nay be said of meat products the big firms employ their own experienced buyers in the smithfiell and other markets and all the rmeat is cooked and tianed on the day it is boughtmateais usedthe goods are tinned at different periods of the year accorling to the tiram when they are in seasont llhe aim is to make as much as possible in the winter when conditions are the best for preserving purposes and for this reason these establishinacnts are most active ati that t ime of the year mock turtle soup for instance is pre pared chicevy in spring when calves aro available and turkeys are tinned in large quantities at christmas turkey tinned in this way is used by the makers throughout the year when the fresh bird is unobtainable to make turkey and tongue paste the fact that the maker him self uses the tinning process to preserve what a loose metaphor compels us to call his raw material is a good advertisement for the ad vantages of tinning as a means of preservationthe preparation of tinned soups and of tinned meats are in a sense complementary as the bone is used for the soup stock wets there not available such a means of utilizing the bone an inferior quality of meat would have to be employed on the score of expense the best firms never use such inferior meats and the products of the american packing houses preserved in brine are only employed by makers of lowvgrade tinned meats nor are preservatives of any kind used by goo d firms there is no neeessity for them when the meat is prepared in a fresh state and indeed makers of the best tinned goods some times actually receive complaints of the ab sence of flavouring matter spices and so forth they are not neede i with fresh products and those who like such flavourings can easily add themthe most important branch of this business is the export trade as a result of the tinning process the englishman can now bring his native foods with him to every corner of the earth in a compact and portable form thealso is no longer at the mercy of the foodof the countryoften scanty lacking in nourishment and perhaps positively dangerous but whether in chilly northern latitudes or under the tropical sun can enjoy the variousinds of meat and vegetable to which he has been accustomed at home nor do these firms confine themselves to suclh perislhable products to meet the demand of their customers abroad they put up in tins suclh other articles as salt mustard pepper sugar tea coffee suet flour rice curry powder grated cheese and plum puddings
