the pure food act in america  how the law is enforced an advance on englise methodsmon oub wasoton copurespondntin no branch of social and economic manage ment has the united states made greater strides of recent years than in the administra tion of what are commonly cailed pure food laws ten years ago there was practically no effective regulation of that kind today the sale of adulterated or misbranded commodities is an most dangerous occupation that this should be so is natural it is in accord with the spirit of democratic paternalism which has lately been so marked a feature of american progressthe movement was inaugurated dramatically in  by the meatpacking scandal which followed tho publication of afr upton sinclairs book  the jungle  the jungle  gave an exaggerated picture of the chicago packing yards but it was pounced upon by mr roose velt who was then president with charac teristic energy and a comprehensive pure food law was passed that law knovwn officially as i the food and drugs act of june   is the basis of the present administrative fabric it forbids the import or export the intro duction into interstate commerce the manu facture in the district of columbia and the territories of misbranded and adulterated foods and drugsdeyrrtrion or adflterationthe terms of the law are fairly compre hensive adulteration covers a multitude of trade sins a drug is adulterated if  it differs in strength quality and purity from the official staiidard and does not have the fact clearly stated on the container  if it fails to come up to the advertised standard confectionery is adulterated if it contains any mineral substance not specifically allowed as a harmless colouring or preservative food is deemed to be adulterated if  anvthing has been mixed or packed with it so as injuriously to affect its strength  if any substance has been substituted for the advertised article  if any valuable constituent ias been in whole or in part abstracted  if it is prepared in such a way as to conceal its inferiority a if it contains any deleterious ingredient  if it consists in whole or in part of unfit animal or vegetable matter decayed meat or vegetables and so onif drugs and foods are held to be misbrandedtheir advertised description is misleading as to ingredients or origin drugs are held to be misbranded   if sold under a false name  if the original package has been tampered with its contents altered c or if the package fails to state clearly that certain specified drugs are used in its contents if the package con tains false or fraudulent statements as to the curative power of contents food is held to be misbranded l if deceptively labelled as to constituents or origin or if the label fails to state that various specified drugs and pre servatives are used in it  if it is an imita tion offered for sale simply under the name of the genuine article  if the quantity ofcontents is not given with reasonable accuracy  on the package  if the package presents any false descriptionajmanistation of the lawthe admninistration of the lanv is vested in the department of agriculture it is enforced by i the following agenciesl inspectors who procure samples for analysis and information regarding the manufacture and sale of food and drugs   the laboratories of the bureau of chemistry in wvashington and in the branc laboratories of other cities which do the ex amination  the board of food and drug inspection whose duties are to consider all questions arising in the enforcement of the act upon whichi the decision of the secretary of agriculture is necessarv and to conduct all hearings based upon alleged violations of the act violations are reported by the chief of the bureaii of chemistry to the board of food and drug inspection which when the charges appear to be sustained makes recommendation to the secretary of agriculture about the exclusion of adulterated and misbranded food and drugs offered for importation and about prosecutions persons chlarged with violations of the law are given a hearing this hearing is usuallv conducted bv tho board of food and drug inspection or by the chiefs of branch laboratories but may be conducted personally by the secretarv of agriculture dealers pro tected by a guarantee cannot be punished and in enforcing the law the department attempts to protect the retail dealer who may be acting in good faith and to place the responsibility upon the shipper or manufacturercase of importsin the case of imported foods and dnrgs no prosecutions are made tho import of dis qualified goods is merely refusod each invoice of foreign foods or drugs has to have attached to it a declaration bv the shipper as to the country of origin by whom and when they were manufactured and the city from which they were exported a statement regarding the presence or absence of colotiring matter and chemical preservatives is also required together with the name of any artificial colour or preservative that may be present it must also be declared that the goods conform with the laws of the country of origin invoices of meat and food products imported into the united states must also be accompanied by a certificate of official inspection of such a character as to satisfv the secretary of agriculture that they are not dangerous to health when there is doubt about a consignment a sample is sent to the appropriate branch laboratory if in the opinion of the chief of the laboratory a con sigrnment is in violation of the law the importer is notified of that fact and is given an oppor tu iity to present evidence regarding the matter at the same time a sample of the consignment is sent by the branch laboratory to the bureau of chemristry in washington where a check analysis is made this does not delay the delivery of the goods to the importer re takes immediate possession of them under bond to deliver them to the collector of customs on demandor forfeit the full value of thbe goods together with the full duty thereoninspection of doftomstic foodsthe method of inspecting domestic foods and drugs is necessarily widely different from that employed withimporte goods inspectors are kept travelling over the country their duties are to investigate the wholesale and retail market and obtain samples of food and drugs shipped in interstate commerce to inspect manufacturing establishments and secure other information regarding the adulteration and imisbranding of food and drugs special in vestigations are also made by inspectors con cerning important questions of sanitation and processes of manufacture one inspector isstationed at each branch laboratory samples oured by the inspectors are forwarded to the bureau of chomistry at washington or to the branch laboratory most convoniont to the point at which they are taken they are there examined and if found to be in viola tion of the law the dealer or shipper is given his hearing either in washington or at thobranch laboratory most convenient if itappears that the law hlrs beon violated the board makes tho appropriate recommendation to the secretary of agriculture who certifies the fact to tho proper united states attorney through the attorneygeneral togother with the necessary information regarding the casethe law provides that adulterated or mis branded food may be seized and disposed of by destruction or sale as the court may direct no information relativo to any case is given out except to the manufacturers and dealers concerned until the judgment of the court has been secured when notice by publication is authorized neither is specific information regarding any particular brand of goods made public except such as is involved in the publica tion of the judgment of the court in cases that bave been decided to be in violation of the law nor is a list of adulterated or legal foods or drugs published although there is a large popular demand for such a list it is felt that such a publication would be a dis advantage rather than an advantage because in the enforcement of other laws it has been found that some firms having secured the publication of the names of certain brands in a list of products designated as complying with the law have subsequently so altered the nature of their goods as to make them illegal though they still use the previous list for advertising purposesarendyents to e acrthe above is a summary of the official description of the act presented by the depart ment of agriculture during the past year the work of the bureau of chemistry has been greatly stinulated by two amend ments to the act the first amend ment is called the sherley law it ex tends the provisions about misbranding to medicines labelled with false or fraudulent statements as to their efficacy and effect the second prevents short eight sales during  a change was also made in the executive rules under which the act is administered bv whiclh the power of seizure of unsound meats and meat products can be exercised outside the federallyinspected establishraents this has greatly increased the power of the govern mentto onforce the law there were during   itinerant inspectors at work they collected about  samnles of doubtful goods and visitod several thousand factories to note violations there are now  branch labora tories besides the main one in washinzton no less than  cases of alleged violations were brought before the department of justice in  cases criminal proceedings and in  cases seizures were recomnmended altogether  cases were terminaterl during  of these  were criminal and  civil in  criminal cases fines were imposed  of the civil cases  resulted in decrees of con demnation or forfeiture the variety of the work entailed is proved by the fact that the shipments upon which the cases were based contained such diverse things as vinegar dried fruits cannod vegetables extracts syrups eggs temperance beers flour wines been and other alcoholic liquors cocoa fish mineral waters coffee coconut malt tonic gelatin stock feeds cheese oranges catsups salt chestnuts oysters nuts maraschino cherries mushrooms mincemeat butter patent medi cines candies olive oil and turpentinework still to be donin his current report the secretary of agriculture complains that too much atten tion has been paid to the economic side of the question though one finds from the govern ment chemists report that his oflice during the past year has been conducting a campaign for pure milk as well as special investigations into oyster beds methods of bleaching flour the grading of olive oil the misbranding of malt products and has gone fully into the canning industry the secretarys complaint hits perhaps the weakest spot in the law as so far administered while much time and nonoy are spent in factory inspection there is still according to the secretary much to bo desired in the administration of such factories thus food that is prepared within the law is sometimes vitiated one of the reasons for this is that much of the factory inspection ought under the federal system to be done by the stateto awaken the states to their responsibilities and to encourage uniformity of state pure food legislation ie for food not used in interstate commerce  there was held here last autumn a pure food conference it was unanimously agreed by those attending the conference that effective cooperation was desirable and agree ments were reached as to specific measures which would aid in bringing this about the conference made clear the necessity of establish ing witlhin the departmnent an organization to be charged with thle dissemination of infor mation concerning the sanitarv conditions of food production violations of the law and new methods for their detection the establish mnnent of such an organization is expected to do much to prevent duplication of research and investigation and rpake food and drug control far more effective it is hoped also that with increased cooperation will come effective control through state agencies of conditions under which food factories manufacture their products and better control of such foods as milk eggs oysters and fish whichl can be contaminated with microorganisms and may communicatn diseaee under the conditions of the federal law the department can exercise no policing control over tho actual factories and dairies and detection of contamination resulting from unclean or undesirable conditions is most difficult in the finished product many of the measures recommended at the conferenee call for changes in existing federal statutes and the state officials have appointed a number of committees to prepare reports and practical suggestions as to measures that will tend to unify state and federal work in this field
