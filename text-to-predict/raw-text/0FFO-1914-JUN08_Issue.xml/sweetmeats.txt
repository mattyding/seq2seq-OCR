si eetmats a comaratively modern industiry ingredients and methodsthe majority of children who sze the prin cipal patrons of the confectioners art woulld probably be surprised and perhaps alarmed to discover that the manufacture of sweetmeats is historically a part of the druggists trade no less disconcerting to the childish maind would be the statement that his ancestor the child of little more than a century ago was forced to look upon  candies  and  goodies as a decided luxury there never was a time when mankind was without a sweet tooth and sweet things of various kinds have always been in favour with children as well as with their elders but it is only within recent years that sugar now universauy looked upon as one of the necessities of life has become cheap enough to be used except a a luxury or a medicine the medicinal value of sugar was insisted upon by the writers of the middle ages and bee masters compilers of cookery books and physicians alike gave great attention to its curative properties sugar purveying conse quently became the business of the druggist who was indeed in many other instances the predecessor of the modern grocer and when the commodity became cheap enough for general use tho manufacture of sweetmeats naturally passed into his handsfrom the earliest days the inhabitants of europe were dependent on honey almost exclusively as their source of sugar supply venetian traders introduced the produce of the sugarcane into this country in the th century shipping sugarcane here in return for wool in the middle of the th century marggraf dis covered the presence of sugar in beet and his pupil achard laid the foundations of the beet sugar industry in the beginning of the th century the increasing use of tea and coffee as beverages brought about a larger use of sugar and the growth of the beet industry and the elaboration of manufacturing and refining processes gradualy brought the once expensive product within the reach of the many with the cheapening of the basic material the manufacture of sweetmeats on a large scale became possible in the first half of the last century while the introduction of the factory system with its extensive and often com plicated machinery the cheap marketing of the legion of other materialsnuts chocolate fruit marzipan vanillaand the chemical production of essences of various sorts caused a further cheapening of the processes of production the manufacture of cheap sweets turned out by the thousand became possible and the hand manu facturerthe artist of the craftis now em ployed only to produce goods for the consump tion of the wealthythe nrustiy in eygalandthe english confectionery industry received its first impetus at the date of the great exhibi tion of  but the factor which had the greatest influence in building up the trade was the system of continental sugar bounties whilo these bounties fostered the beetsugar industry on the continent at the expense of the wvest indian canesugar growers and the english sugar refiners they struck a blow at the continental confectionery industry for the amplo supplies of bountyfed sugar dumped into this country considerably below prime cost soon enabled great britain to become the chief supplier of sweetmeats and sugar products for every open port in the worldthe quality of the english goods has also become at least equal to that of continental makers fifty years ago british sweets were of the crudest kind and very limited in variety while higherclass confectionery was chiefly imported from france today all this is changed and for excellence of finish as well as for their high standard of purity british sweets are unrivalled as is evidenced by the fact that british firms secured the grand prix at the recent exhibitions in brussels and turinin recent years two factors have added to the price of the raw materialthe entry of great britain into the brussels convention in  and the placing of a tax on sugar at the time of the south african war a tax which has not yet been remitted the dimensions of the industry may be gauged from the figures given in the returns of the census of production  according to these returns the production of sugar and chocolate confectionery in this country for that year was cwt of a value of  of this amount cwt was exported while cwt represented the net importsthat is to say imports less re exports it may safely be said that the total output is now very much greater than the figures disclosed by this censusconstrruits of sweetsthe variety of sweets as regards shape colour constitu snts and flavour is endless though sugar is the principal ingredient it is by no means the only one nor is the sugar employed necessarily of one kind both the refined and the unrefined articles being used the sugar is also boiled at temperatures varying from  to  degrees fahrenheit the soft and creamy sweets known as fondants and the clear hard barley sugars being at oppo site ends of the scale sugar candy is formed by allowing sugar to crystallize around strings stretched in the syrup while many sweets principally the soft fondants are subjected to a like process of crystallization which improves the appearance and prevents the gradual hardening of the sweet from exposure to the air jellies and soft goods are made from sugar boiled at a lower temperature and mixed with gelatine in the case of sweets belonging to the lozenge group the sugar is not boiled but is finely ground and mixed with dissolved gumnext to sugar chocolate is themostimport ant constituent entering as it does into the composition of a very great number of sweet meats marzipan made from sugar and al monds is the basis of another large group fruits and nuts of all sorts are employed as sweet centres vanilla and other flavouring matters are also in request while butter is used in the manufacture of caramels toffee and butterscotchcofits and pan goodsbesides the various sweets mentioned above comfits and pan goods containing a central core of a different materiala lozenge a nut or a fruit of some kindform an important class such are the various bonbons ahnonds and others which constitute a large and in creasingly popular branch of the confectioners trade nllt centres are of a great many different kinds and come from the mediterranean districtsbari almonds from

copper pans heated by steam or hot air which are geared to rotate at an angle so as to keep the contents in motion sugar syrup is added from time to time until sufficient has been deposited when the sweets are removed and allowed to hardencobxs n sweetsin a great many cases another method is adopted of inserting a core into a sweet theparticular compound which is to form the centre of the sweet is laid on a layer of sugar coating which is then wrapped round it the plastic mass kept warm on a table heated from beneath is carefully drawn out and when it has been attenuated to the required thin ness is cooled and cut into convenient sec tions or if small shaped sweets are to be made the narrowed end is inserted into a stamping machino consisting of power driven brass rollers much as meat might be fed into a mincing machine the mass is quickly cooled by a draught of cold air which plays on it as it passes through and issues forth at the other end in a line of sweets breaking away from each other like peas shelled from an inexhaustible podsome of the cores have an intricate design varying in complexity from a simple device such as a triangle or a star to a more com plicated figure such as a flower or a word which appears on a section of the rock when broken across these designs are mado from strips of coloured sugar on a scale many times larger than the size required they are then enveloped with the outer covering and pulled out much as wire is drawn to the small dimensions of the finished articleotaxa mprodsanother interesting process is that of sugar pulling the sugar in a plastic condition is puiled out in the form of a rope the operation was once performed by hand on a metal hook nowadays machinery is used and the rope of sugar stretched over the eccentric arms of a  puller may be seen changing colour by the effect of aeration which alters the structure and induces an opaque and granular appear ance in this way the sugar covering of different sweets is made fondants are also subjected to an aerating process the sugar being  churned  by revolving bladesa great number of sweets are made in moulds impressed in a starch surface these moulds are filled from funnels charged with the molten sugar and when dry are broken up leaving the shaped sweets behind rubber moulds are also very generally in use in the same way are made the sweets known as liqueursthat is to say those which have a liquid interior variously coloured and flavoured on coming in contact with the mould the exterior coating hardens while the inside remains liquid the  buttering  of almonds and walnuts is done by band the nut is dipped into the molten sugar carefully coated and often ornamented with a complicated pattern by the deft mani pulation of the plastic massbesides their use for centres nuts are in demand for other purposes being ground down into a paste and used as a constituent in sweet makingchocoltschocolate is of course a large constituent of many forms of confectionery its prepara tion from the cocoa bean is similar as far as the first stages are concerned to that of cocoa but whereas the manufacture of cocoa demands an abstraction of part of the fat from the cocoa bean for chocolate making more cocoa butter has to be added for this reason firms carrying on cocoa manufacture generally make chocolate as well the fat taken from the former being used in the preparation of the latterthe cocoa beans are roasted shelled and ground sugar and vanilla or other flavouring added and the product passed through a system of rollers until a very fine consistency is obtained chocolate centres consist of nuts and almonds of various kinds and  cream  in the form of a cream fondant uncrystallizedamid such a bewildering array of form colour and flavour it is somewhat difficult to find ones way and it is not claimed for the above attempt to classify the principal varieties of sweets on the market that it is more than a tentative ope
