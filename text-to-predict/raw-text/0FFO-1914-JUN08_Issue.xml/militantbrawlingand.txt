her vitality by refusing food to take on the paper was written i have had great dificulty in getting this the person i saw was very loth to give them remember that you must never take more than one at a time whatever happcns ask for marshall again at once i will send vou in more say you must see him about your private affairs if you have difficultyvi i hope it will be all right we were glad to get

iolloway gaol produced it to the oliciais and requested to see roe it was a rtule of the prison that all persons going there on the pretence of professional business should give an unlertaking and make a declaration that their business was purely professional and for the purpose of the defence of the prisoner mr barnett signed such a declaration and an interview was arranged it took place in a small room enclosed in glass and miss cann the supervising official was outside barnett was seen to hand something across to roe miss carun at once went in took hold of roes hand and found in it a paper packet containing six tablets of apomorphine hydrochloride on the paper was written i only got your note late last night there is nothing more drastic to be had you mav take three at a time and if that is not effective fouir but on no account more four is a little risky ask to see mir barnett again tomorrow i will send in more i am afraid to give you too many at a time we cant hear to think what you and roberts are suffering we mulst get you out we are doing all we posisibly an on thc back of that note was written destroy the noteobject of the dnanothing was said to mr barnett at that time except that he was requested to leave he prison at once inder the prisons act of  it was an offence for any person to convey into the prison any document or article not allowed by the prison regulnations anai it was in respect of the document in which the sin tablets were wrapped and also in respect of the tablets themselves that he asked for process against mir barnett the operation of the drag was well known to medical menand the notes showved there was a difliculty in getting the tablets their object wt to prevent the food given to this woman among others from remaining in the stomach in order that in pursuance of a concerted plan she might be released fromn prison at the earliest possible mnonmcnt under the temporary discharge of prisonin act of last yearit was a veirv serious matter when deliberately fale statements were made and a person who came to a prison with all the sanction and freedom of a professional inan or a professional muans repre sentatlive was found lending hinmself to such aboinrn able behaviour as this it was therefore thought right that at tho earliest moment that this as discovered an application for process should be made publicly in order to refute so far as was possible the false statements wlhicll were being deliberately eirculated with a view of arousing feeling against tlel authorities wleo had their duty towards the public to perform on the one hand and towards prisoners in eustod on the otherthe aiaustrate granted the sunmmons which was made returnable for saturdaypopular resentmentdisorderly scenes in public
