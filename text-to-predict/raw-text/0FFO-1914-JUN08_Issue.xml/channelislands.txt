channel islands vegetable and fruit productionfor many years the channel islands hav mado a valuable contribution to the food supply of the iunited kingdom tho im ports during recent yoars have approximated in valuo to a million and a quarter sterling per annum consisting almost entirely of vegetables and fruit they may be classed to a large extent as luxuries by arriving in the united ingdom at a season when there is no glut in the markets the vegetables and fruit from thg channel islands command comparatively hilgh pricesthe clhannel islands make but slow pro gress in so far as exports to the united kingdom are concerned a number of contri butory causes are responsible for this such as competition from holland beelgium and various counties in the south of england and the lack of adequate transport facilitiespotatoes peas and benspractically every available square yard of land in the channel islands is under cultivation this means that in ono direction development i has nearly reached the limit mlodern methodsof cultivation however afford the possibility of further increase in productionof our food imports from the channel islands potatoes are an easy fist in  we imported no less than cwt valued at  the soil is particularly suitable and the climate is such that thev are readv for market early in the year the first consign ments are generally received in the united kingdom in may and efforts are made to bave the whole crop marketed before the english earlies  come on otherwise the export trade would not pay earlier in the year potatoes grown under glass arrive in fair quantities at covent garden these are the choicest potatoes on the market in i january and february apart from potatoes a a very large trade is done in other varieties of i vegetables among these peas and beans  large quantities ov which are  forced  under glass are worth special mention guernsey in particular is a great grower of peas and beans a large acreage under glass being reserved for the purposetomatoes grapes and frgsa verv large supply of tomatoes cornes to the united kingdom every year from the islands the v ale of the imports in  was no less than i but even this figure had been exceeded in the preceding year especially in guernsey there is now a verv large acreage of tomatoes umder glass these begin to arrive in the united kingdom in january or lebruary and are thereafter in supply lutil november apart from the  forced  tomatoes however a large acreage is grown out of doors both in jersey and guernsoy from the plants grown in the open the growers can invariably rely upon a fairly good crop these tomatoes are much in evidence in this country in september and octobernext in importance are grapes of which in  we imported  worth for several years the grape trade had shown marked de velopments a great many new vineries had been built but when the owners realized that it would be more profitable to use their  glass  for the growing of tomatoes peas beans and other vegetables they did not hesitate to make the change further belgium and holland were beginning to compete keenly in the grape trado in the autumn very good pears and apples are grown in the islands and of the former some varieties find much favour in this country of these the farnous  doyenne du cornice is perhips the best the climate is very suitable for peargrowing but such quantities of pears now arrive at the same time from california and france that the supply from the channel islands is some what insignificant one of the most choice fruits which the islands send to this country is the fig both under glass and out of doors figs are grown successfully they are so dolicate however that they are very much affected by the transport service those grown under glass fetch very good prices during the london season a considerable number of melons are also grown under glass in the islands and a good proportion reaches the english marketstriysrobtin regard to transport jersey is rather awkwardly situated the boats leave early in the morningabout  oclockcalling at guernsey two hours or so later this means that in many cases vegetables and fruit from guernsey are often a day fresher than from jersey the boats run to both weymouth and southampton and thence the cargoes are transported by train to the london and other markets when both boat and train are up to time the produce can be in covent garden by  or  oclock in the morning but sometimes there is delay and what arrives during the forenoon has often to be held until the follow ing day in regard to potatoes this does not matter much but when it comes to figs it is another thing from the beginning of june until the end of september the great western and london and southwestern railway com panies each run a boat daily to and from the islands but during the remainder of the year they run a boat on alternate days during the potato season additional cargo boats are run transport facilities are better and freight lower to the continent and it is because of this that the dutch and belgians are able to compete so well with the growers in the channel islandson an average nearly  head of the famous jersey and guernsey breeds of cattle are sent to the united iiingdom the majoritv of these are for dairy farmers while many area merely for showv purposes
