margarine   preparation of butter substitutesfor many years there have been attempts to introduce cheaper fat products which both in appearance and flavour shall be adequate sub stitutes for butter these bodies are known legally as margarine and may be classified into two groupsoleomargarine and vegetable margarine both of these are formed from mixtures of animal or vegetable fats and vegetable oils specially treated in order to obtain the flavour consistency and colour of butter that these have now largely taken the place of butter for use with bread and also for cooking purposes is clearly seen from statistics the board of trade returns show that there have been imported into this country during the years  the following amounts of margarineit will be seen that there has been a steady growth in this industry the chief home of which is in the netherlands as over  per cent of the total imports are obtained from that country there are no published statisties of the amounts of margarine produced in the united kingdom but it is estimated that the home manufactureis about equal to that imported on this assiuiptioni the above column headed  double quantity gives approximately the total annual consurnption of margarine very roughly thispproximnates to b per head per annum for the whole populationmiargarine was invented by mi mgemouries in  in order to furnish for the poorer classes an article cheaper than butter his method of preparation was to melt bullochlc fat with water at a low temperature to which had been added a little carbonate of potash and the stomach of a pig or sheep under thzis treatment the membranes of the fat were dis solved by the pepsin from the added stomach and the freed fat rose to the surface of the water this fat was then collected and further treated at a somewhat higher temperature with a solution of salt which was said to give it the flavour of butter on cooling the fat was pressed in order to eliminate the stearin or harder fat present and the resultant product was then ready for consumption from that time for vard there has been little if any fundamental change in the nature of the materials em l ployed the fats that have happened to be the c cheaper have naturally received the first prefer ence but the oleo of mge is still the base of lmargasines of the oleo typeole oagabiuzat present the chief materials used in the manufacture of oleomargarine are clarified beef fat oleo neutral lard cottonseed arachid and coconut oils skimmed milk coloturing matter boric acid and salt oleo is the chief constituent of this type of margarine and is prepared by separating the stearin from clarified beef fat by means of hydraulic pressure neutral lard consists of lard of the best quality so treated as to remove the somewhat pronounced flavour of pork cottonseed and arachid oils are of vegetable origin tjhe crude oils being refined by treatment with alkalies coco nut  oil  is in reality a solid at ordinary tem peratures and by modern methods of manu facture is obtained in an almost perfectly neutral condition being either tasteless or with only the faintest nutty flavour the margarine acquires its desired taste from speciauy pre pared skimmed milk this is used as a culture medium for certain varieties of bacteria which are thus introduced into the mixture of fats and impart a butter flavour to the fuiished product the object of the addition of colour ing matters is obviously to render the material as similar in appearance to butter as possible boric acid is used as a preservative and salt for a double purposeit helps to preserve the margarine and also accentuates the butter flavouraverage oleomargarine has approximately the following compositionlb  oleo   skimmed milk   neutral lard   snit    premier jus  water   coconut oil  boric acid    cottonseed oil   manvfacturrdg pxoceissesthe fats and oils are put into a churn together with the prepared skimmed milk the water and the coloilring matter the churn consists of a waterjacketed vessel in which two vertical blades revolve so as to emulsify the mixture on the completion of this process the mixture is drawn off by a large tap and is next  sprayed  by driving a powerful jet of icecold water on to the fats as they run from the nozzlo of tho churn tap the fats thus cooled form a finely divided soft powder insted of  granules as happens whon such types of fats are cooled slowly the objection to granulated  in reality crystalline fats is that they spoil the tex ture of the finished margarine the next step in the manufacture is that of allowing the fats to ripen  for a period in which the  butri fying  bacteria of the skinuned mnilk develop antd impart a butter flavour to the margarino lvhen properly ripened the fats are  blended by being pressedl between corrugated wooden irollers revolving in opposite directions this i operation is continued intil the excess of water has been got rid of and the margarine has acquired the consistency desired tho salt and boric acid ro added to the margarine during the process of  blendingvegetable majgariixevegetable margarine consists of a specially treated mixture of vegeteable oils the chief rawn materials are coconut cottonseed and ara chid oils skimmed milk colouring matter boric acid and salt coconut oil is the principal ingredien t of vegotablo margarines as may be seen from the following general recipecoconut oil   saitcottoesccd oil   boric ac  kirimmed milk  in making vegetable margarino a portion of the oils and ell the skimmed milk are first churned together when this mixture has attained the required consistency the rest of the oils are added and cltined tntil flniohed the subsequent processes are carried out in the same manner as in the manufacture of oleomargarine margarine is usually packed in wooden tubs lined with either butter muslin or greaseproof paper it is also sent out in the form of  pats  of various weiglhts wrapped up in a simlar mannerlaws regulat g saeethe law relating to the sale and manufacture of margarine is very stringent in consequence of the numerous attempts made to sell this product as butter avnong other things it is enacted that the manufacture of margarine shall not be carried out in the same premises where butter is made margarine must not contain more than  per cent of added butter  per cent of water and  per cent of boric acid all receptacles in which margarine is exposed for sale and the wrappers in which it is packed when sold miust be labelled efficiently with the word  margarine for further pro tection of the public the following laws are in force on the continent more especially in denmark margarine must contain at least  per cent of sesame oil in order that its presence in butter may be detected both by taste and by analytic testing any colouring matter whatever is absolutely prohibited in denmark where the lastmentioned enactment is very strictly enforced the vendor generally gives to the purchaser a small capsule of colouring matter containing sufficient for the colouring of the quantity bought so that the buyer can himself add the colour after making his purchaseomee fatsclosely allied to margarine are various cooking fats which are prepared from much the same ingredients several of these are almost pure coconut oil either white or coloured in imitation of butter another series consists of mixtures of stearin and cottonseed oil several of these are of american origin though con fectioners fat mixtures with these as a base are now largely manufactured in england the homemade products have the great advantage of reaching the consumer in fresher condition than is possible with those which are imported as these are not got up in irnitation of butter they are not compulsorily labelled margarine taken as a whole these are perfectly wholesome in their origin and mode of manufacturethe modern margarines are distinctly superior in flavour to inferior butter in the best ordered butter and margarine factories bacteria cultures are used as  starters in atten tion to sanitary requirements the manu facture of margarine leaves nothing to be desired in nutritive value and digestibility butter and margarine are almost identical for those of lirmited means margarine provides a healthy and appetizing substitute for butter
