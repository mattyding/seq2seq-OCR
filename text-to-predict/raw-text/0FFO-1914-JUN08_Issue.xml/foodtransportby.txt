food transport by road motor traction versus horse and railfrom an early period in the history of london the dwellers therein must have been accustomed to seeing the almost nightly procession of far mers carts and lorries bringing in vegetables fruit and other foodsupplies from the outer suburbs for disposal in the city markets in the prerailway days road river or canal transport was of course alone available yet with all the expansion which has since taken place in the railway system in and around the metropolis the same nightly procession is still to be seen on the suburban highways more especially in middlesex and kent or is to be met in the streets of london in the early hours of the morning wending its way to covent garden market or else wherewhere withini the mile radius of london the farms or market gardens aro situated at a distance of from one to four miles from the nearest railway station the produce is gencrally sent all the way either by horse and cart or to a smaller extent by mechanical conveyance instead of two eartages and a rail journey at stated times a single cartage suffices anid the loads leave the actual sending points when convenient to the sender with the further advantage that there is a certainty of the arrival of the produce at market stand or pitch by about  am in time for the earliest buyers in many cases also the produce is sold direct from the vehicles which are then available for the msnure picked up on the retaurn under these conditions there may well be a saving over the alternative combination of road and railmotorn tlassportwhen road transport by motor or by traction engine began to undergo its great development some six or eight years ago much was said as to the advantages likely to result therefrom both to the country producer in sending supplies to the great towns and to the urban trader in sending goods into the country not only were heavier loads to be forwarded to the market by road but thev were to come also at a cheaper rate from a greater distanceyear by year the urban area of london and also of other centres of increasing population is entrenching more and more on the surround ing rural area streets of houses and new suburban districts are talkng the place of the fields and market gardens of only a few years ago and the belt within which vegetables and fruit can be raised to meet the needs of such areas is being steadily and continuously pushed further and further out from the central narkets hence the forwarding of supplies to the towns by horse and cart offers greater difficulties today than was the case a few decades ago and tho possibilities opened out by the motorlorry the motortractor and the road engine appeared to be especially opportune there were even those who predicted that selfpropelled traction would soon siup plant not only the horse but rail transport as wellit was soon found however that while the big growers might adopt the innovation there could be no hope of each and every farmer or market gardener having his owxn road motor ihere was not only the question of initial cost and cost of maintenance but there was the consideration that unless the motor lorry or the motortractor and trailers were in constant use they could not be made to payin ono or two instances it was sought to overcome these disadvantages by the formation of cooperative societies of producers for the purposes of organizing road motor services one of the most successful efforts made has been at brandsby yorkshire where the farmers first formed themselves into a cooperative society with a view among other aims to bulking alike their orders and their consign i ments they arranged with tho northeastern railway company for the running of a motor service in connexion with that line and have since worked up so good a business that themotor service is now being succeeded by thel construction of a light railwayadmvantaes anfd dissanvatraecsas regards the possible saving on roadover rail transport where both are available a common practice on the part of the motor traction companies is to offer to carry the produce from door to door that is from farm or market garden to marketat the same rate as the railway company would charge from station to station what is saved therefore by the grower is the cost of cartage from farm to station at the one end and the cost of delivery fromn station to market at the other end against this must be put the difficulty tho grower may experience in regard to returned empties and stable manure while if he should want to send say three tons anld a half of produce to market and the loading capacity of the motorlorry or of the trailer is only tlhree tons he must still probably send the odd halfton to the station for carriage by railthere is also the prospect of a further diffi culty in the motor not being able to get near to the gates of the market owing to the block of vehicles in the streets in the immediate neigh bourhood while even when it does get there it may be unable to effect speedy delivery under present conditions drivers often have to wait outside a market from two to four or five houirs before their carts or lorries are unloaded bad enough as such delays are in the case of a horse they would be fatal to the economic use of a costly machine such as a motor the position is thus quite different from that of the retail trader and his commercial motorwthatever the possible gain in the substitu tion of motor transport in the conveyance by road of a comparatively small tonnage of com modities vithin a given radius it is certain that for supplies carried in bulk and especially when they are carried a considerable distance the locomotive is a better economic unit than the motor the detail as to whether a loeo motive hauls  wagons instead of  and goes  miles instead of  makes no such differ ence in working cost as wvould arise under like conditions in the case of transport bv road to substitucte road motor traction for the locomotives which take such quantities of broccoli from cornwall strawberries from swanwick fruit from kent vegetables from evesham or butter from hull and grimsby to northern and scotch mnarkets would be unthinkable though no one would of co  propose to do somea coxulrxss i stersthe chief intorest of the consomer in all these things lies in the questiorl as to whether or not the substitution of road motor transport for horse and to a limited extetnt rail transort would effect such economies as to lower the retail cost of the commodities carriedlooking at the position as a whole little hope is to be cherished of any really material and general saving from such substitution of road for rail transport as falls within the range of economic practicability yet apart alto gether from any question as to the compara tive merits and costs of the two modes of traction wvhere they are brought into direct competition one with the other there are many districts and more especially districts with at present inadequate transport facilities where the introduction of road motors would be of great local advantage in getting supplies con veyed more readily from farm to railvay or to market always provided that the cost ofsecuring such advantage may not be unduly raised through the imposing of increased taxa tion on s elfpropelled vehcles of the heavier type in order that they may make furtherprovision for the upkeep of the roads  j
