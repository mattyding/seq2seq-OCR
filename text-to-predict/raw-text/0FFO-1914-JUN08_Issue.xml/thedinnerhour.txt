of daily meals so marked is this that there might be ventured the thesis that the higher or at least the more complex a soeial organization the greater the number of feeding times per diem in support might be cited the evidence that it was only with the th century that three meals a day became the accepted custom of the country dinner and supper are what may be called the two primary and statutory
