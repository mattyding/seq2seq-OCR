partisans of the established church and of the union between chureb and state thoge who maintain the principle that the state ought to possese a conscience like a private individual will say with sir robert inglis that the british institutions are based upon protes tantism that it is an offence against god ad against men to encourage the propagtion or error and of idolatory that it is to betray the constitution and to give itrength to the enemy on the otber hand will come the diesenters par ticularly the wesleyasw who form the best organized body in great britain it wms they who in  defeated by their petitioni the factory bil in which they discovered an interference of the state with public education never thelewe we believe that sir robert peel will on this oecasion triumph over the united opposition he is still too indispen sable not to be master of his position he alone is possible were he to quit the ministry today he would return to power taaorrow borne on the arms of necessity the whig party does not conetitute even a compact minority it is a mere cipher tlhe tory party at the lks election be same incarnate in the person of sir robert peel ibea enveloped in mystery they abandoned themselves body and son to the political magiolae and now in viin endeavour to break a compact which they detest but which they endure he tory party aces each of its principles each of its interestb each of its traditions abandoned in succesion to its hereditary enemies it is in vain that it resists the muter which it hu adopted carries it with him through the current this man has absorbed all in one wordmysdf if the duke of wellington were dis engaged how the tories would rally round him  if even lord stanley tha proud and fiery champion of the church had his hands free  but ala  the old duke has  yielded to the toga be has abdicated into the hands of a more skilful and inore eloquent po litician whilst on his side the impetuous champion of protestanlisrm alows the flame of that eloquence which had so often animated the house of commons to be otifled under the cloak of the peerage obh tbe great tacticianthe con snieaate politicianhad anticipated every contingency he took care to annul or to neutralize beforehand every force which might constitute a centre of attraction beyoni his sphere for these reacons he will again triumph but it is not with impunity that a minister triumdba at the ex pense cf his party parties like individuals may sometimes suabmit to an huriiliation but they neither pardon nor forget during four yeaus since they restored sir r peel to officelthe tories have advaniced from deceptior to deception every time that they wished to resist their leader compelled them to bend under his inflexible authority and their futile at tempts at revolt have only exposed their imdotency anhis omnipotence to all eyes but it is an inedicient union which is founded on necessity alone sir robert peel how ever appear to seek no other connexion between himself and his party but that of fear it may be said that he disdains those sympatbetic instincts which form a moro solid founda tion for an alliance thaa mere force he affects to make a parade of his power and to drag after him his refractorynajority according to the manner of the ancients but in the mean time the gall is accumulating in thdir ulcerated hearts knd publicly compared io those sagacious dogs who perform evolutions under the fear of their masters whip lhe tories impatiently wait the day when they may throw cff their chains it is not we who wish to blame what sir b peel is at present accomplishing on the contrary the mes sures wbich he proposes are conformable to the principles whlcs vfe baveeirer maintlned btt we consider his poeltioa in a parliamentary boiut of view it is oiyby ite means of parties that government is conducted and sirro bert peel is at this moeaent strikidg the most violent blow at his party which it ever received we have often observed that two united forces have elevated sir robert peel to powerthe agricultural interests and the protestant menu ments well  of those two forces one nlone at present sup ports him the agricultural interests notwithstanding the radical reforms which he has introduced into their tariffs see still in him the man who preservees them from the abso lute liberty of cpmmerce and the breakwater which opposes the overthrow of the last prohibitive barriers but lot sir robert peel zot imagine that lie can manage the pro testant feeling to easly whatever may be seid respecting england we shau never cease to render that country justice when her religious principles or oven her prejudices are ag stake she sacrifices her interests witbout hesitation sir robert peel might revolutionize the laws which protected the great proprletora and farriers without any injury to hbs cofiocace but at present he places a sacrilegious hand on the religiots enstitition of eaglanqand he will tsee the
