reigion were somethinig real and practical and of paramount importance and defi nitehe meant if religion involved necessarily certain great essential doctrines and if its essence consisted in the truth of those great doctrines he could not but feel that althooszh it was manifestly the duity of a state to tolerate and protect every subject in the free exercise of hi owrn conscientious opinions whatever those opililons might be and however contrary to the religion of the state yet that it was most in conisistent and al aroes dereliction of the homsce that vwas due to truth in religion for a

it would not he thought be denied that the protestsnt reli isgon was the religiont of the state and aa such held by the state to he true  that the british empire and british coanti tution were an empire and a constitution protesting against the errors of the church of rome  and this being so he mr hlamilton did not see how it was possible to make it consistent to endow the roman catholic church or a romsan catholic ecclesiastical college without affirming the oppoite principle from that which he had been assert ing namely the principle of the mnember for bath that states had nothing to do vwith reliion or religious truth or error  and it that principe were sound and true wshy it would follow that the british empire ought to be anpro teetantizedthe coronaltion oath was an invasion

and meat prdlpetly seek to have that re ligion recognised and endowed thnre wats no inconsistency on their part  but believing as he did that the protestant religion wan the religion conformable to gods revealed will and the romin cattholic religion opposed to it he mr hamilton could not reconcile it to his comscience he should feel he was gailty of a great tin and that he was aetiagzmost inconsistently with bis own priniciplesif he gave bin vote for a measure expressly designed to encourage the promuilgation of whalt lh cominon with the state he considered error es sentialerror on the meat important of all subjects the bon and lealrned geatleman the member for batla had ar gued asif there was some grealt degree of arrogance and pharisaical oaauihption on the patrt of those who holding their owni opiuldons in religion to be true acted upon the belief of their being so ho mr hamilton could not see that this was the case  he could not see how opinions in relfrion differed in this respect from oplaionns on any other subjectthe hon and learned gentlemun beld and no doubt most honestly very strong political opinioans he was never very backward lm avowing and urring them and certainly he iwas not very sparing of those who ireaumed to driffer from him erear hear he mr hanailiton did not at all com plain of that  he was a great admirer of truth whether in politics or religion andl he felt certain that great and essen tial truth in either one or the other would be much more likely to be advanced by every conscientious man matintain ing and upholding what he believed to be true than by that false llbiraliam which by confounding what were thought truth sad error placed truth and error on the same fgoting hlear it was ohvions he thought that the observations he had made asad the principlesbe had laid down were aplicable only tothe edlcouragement of relioons bya statewhnicdffered from each other in essential points it was therfore not necessay for him to show that there was no inconsistency in voting for the dregiumonuea to presbyterians or for the established church in scotland neither should he enter upon the case of the colonies which formed an exception though he felt bound to add that ho thought it the duty of the state to form branches of the established church in every one of the british colonies there were many other consi derations which inflaueced kim to oppose the measure most of whichl had been adverted to in the debate he had stated that the endowment of msyootls amounted in his opinion to a virtual abnepation of the protestantism of the emnpire  hear hear the right hon genitleman the late presidenit of the reard of trade had admitted that it involved the whole principle of theendo wrment of the roman

that he thought was a serious conaderatlcnit was a serious thing to consider that while means were refused for the education of tbe childrenof the eitabliahed church in the principles of that chnrch while disfavour in that respect was shpiwn to the protestants the oly clergy for whose education as such any provision was made by the state were the clergy of the kibman caholicandlh bat at the

free cours of religious op nion by nmeans the most unjustifiable and unwarrnatuble the last objection he ghould state was the extraordinary state of ignorance in which parliament was called offon to leelilate on this mst inimprtant subject ndthu total want of control one the part of the state in re sbet of the system of education rci the principles lecul cie ntecollege which thoy were about to

numberin those mineritiias  go btrong was the feeling aad the impression on the minds of hn members that to abandon the college after having so long made it this parliamentary grsnt would be unadvisable and dangerous that notwithstanding what had eubsuquently arisen to indisposo some minds to grant the roman catholics increased relief there could wet be founu  members in the houie who were prepared tp go the lungth of abolishing the grant it was theintention of pitt and burke ard those other great men under whose auspices the ecoege was founded that zufficient means of education in literature and science should be given to the students to enable them to fi with respectabity the offices to wbich they were to be caled from circumstasce to whichi have already adverted the grant hoa been found insufficient lor that object we ask you to make it sufficient for itc purpose if you are not prepared to agree with us you cannot plead conscience as the reason you can only argue on the impropriety of liberality in this cae as affecting the interestz of parties in ireland who olject to the measure some hon gentlemen bave objected to the time at which this measure has been brought forward sow to me it appears that if ever there was a time at which it was desirable to make some little pecuniar sacriice forprouuemg ia grattucation whibch the offer of the presetigrmat has already produced in these who are interested in the matter it is tho present we have seen a popular ex citement of an unusual kind kadingc to large assemblages of people a nd threatening confusion we have been compelled as a government to proceed by law against those wbo had violated the law and to bring to judgment those who were principally concerned in those traneactions  but now that agitatioa was sabsoded and thanks to the fiucal condition of the country eapital is flowing into ireland and the minds of nen tbere are engaged in improving the means of communi cation and are for the time diverted from thofe hostile con troversies religious or political wbich have so lone prevailed in that country this then is the time when without ap prehension of disturbance and without imputation of timi dity you may give the roman catholics that which they have to long desired i ak the house to give them that which cannot endanger existing intereetswhich cannot do injury to that church which the noble lord has called a mihionary church i say that church depends on its own exer tions for its success may lave it its authority and its pro perty and it need not care whether the prietst of the roman catholic persuasion are educated or not i know the in trinsic value of the doctrines of that church and on them i rely for the promotion of the missionary objects for which it was established if the debate bad not extended already to so great a lengtb i bhould have wished to refer to some othe topics i sbould have liked to have been at liberty not to confine myself to the points whisli more immediately bear on the subject but after what has been stated by the riht hon member for edin burgh r macauley casting as he did a serious imputa tion upon the government i cannot close what i have to sa without making some allusion to those matter that alusion r should have been glad to mnake in his presence but for his absence i am not responsible and i cannot sit down without adverting to what fell from the right hon gentle man he objected to the course pursued by those who he said arrogated to themselves the exclusive right to know whbac was religious trutb and he applied to then the epithet of  religious bigots but the right hor gentlemsan when he made this remarh did notappeartohave adverted to this that there might be poltical as well as religious bigot and when he asiumed for himself and his party an exclusve claim to benevolence towards irelard and whe he asumed tbat no mnstry but thae of which he had been a member could beh niicsl blotrye dl omia es ppoidmainner that the mleasur was a good measure  asbut said he it ough fot to be broughtforwardby youl there is something inlbsiltuatlnol the government syhich ought to have prohibitea them from bringing in this ineasnreyl sir is that ay great proof of the right hon gentlemtns benevolence towards ireland i tent yesr his party were in poeseasioa of the guvernment and yet li no period of that time did they show any initention of making any ad ditionk to the grant to mayootb but the fact was that during all that time they felt they were asseciated with a number of perasos who were voluntaries in re ligion as they had been celled in the present debate anxd therefore they fell they could not propose an increased erarit of public money to reayooth without encoanmering the op postio of agreatbody of their eupporters if on the otherhad they proposed to take the necessary gum from the funds of the established cburcb tkey felt they were likely to meet with the opposition of those who like myaself cont eidler the property of the charch to be exclusively ap licable to the purposes of the charch and not to be diverte to the accomplishment of other objects they were placed there fore in a dilexama and they did not see what good it could do to incur the hcstility and opposition of so large a body of their own supporters as they would have had to enacounter it they had propeosed an inacreased grant from che public funds they left it undone because they did not dare to face the opposritlion that they would havte raised the right hon gentleman then in effect sad that there was one p rty who dared not ena counter the difficulties besetting the measure when they hadculies ouht t o hve rouht t frwadwhere sir is relnd o lokforsuportrsin he imeofneed if this is he as if te ongenleen ppoit daednot maketile aeteinpr gag we whxen we dare make the attempt are ttigmatized at persoas who are making an a mttept to cd that which we ought not to do  sir the right hon gentle man made many remarks on my right bon friend at thc head of the government with respect to which it is per haps unnecessary for me t make any defence of him re is zuaciently known to the house not to require that hi colleagues or hit friends should riht his battles but it th rgh hozz memnber for edinburgh were here i should have reminded him that when he taxes the government with in consistency he is boand to have tome little consistency of lii own and when he speaks in language apparently intenaded te kold up my right hion friend to the contempt and obloquy of those by whom he is generally supported the right hon gentlemae is boundi to sho w that he se not r peaking in con tradiction to what he bas stated before the rieht hen gentleman stated that my right hon friend  made use of while in opposition passions with which he had not the slightest sympathy and prejudices wbich ke regarded witb prfound contempt he charged may right hon friend with profeesing prn ciples whlen oit oppoltion with re ference to thisb sgessure which are entirely differenr from those on whichk hefounds the course which he is nowpursuing sir i am willing to rest the tindicaltion of my right hon frienid on the speeches of the zight oion gentleman kimself thi is not the firat time he has mgae a spech consiisting partly of euloglum and partly of attack when we were digcussing the subject of vote of confidence in the inistryt the right bon gentleman made a remarkable peech which was utterly at variace from the terms he ured on the late evening it was directly contrary in every word of it ifear hear on the th of aauar  the right bon gentleman stated respecting my righ t lon friend it being his object to endeavour to disatisfy the ualva supporters of my righthon friend by shting what would be the conse querces if he were raised to power which he did by refer ring to what took place in  the right hon baronet had been raised to power by preindices and by passions in which ho had no share his followers were bigotshe was a statesman he was calmly ia lancinr conveniences and inenvanienoe whilst thavwere ready to prefer confiscation proieription civil war to the gmaulest concession the right hon gentleman also salid  i must be permitted to may it has been his mis fortune and the misfortuneaio of the public that it has bee ht fate for a ibng tlune to beat the head of a party with whom he has lety fyinpathy than any head tier had iith any party yet the ight hon gentleman who theh charged my right honl friend with havin no iuympathy with his party comes down to the house in  and does not scruple to charge him with haying profesed principles with which he had tnot the dligbtest sympathy and prejudices whih h reardd wthprooun cotemtone of two alternatives follow for both statemata cartnot bo correct it the right

i have quoted goes on and enumerates other instances of my right hon friends goi�g beyond his party he states of my right hon friend that he chose the good pathhe performed a painful in some sense a humiliatiocg but in point of fact a most truly honourable partj ana yet on the former evening the right hon gentleman did not scruple to attribute to my right bon friend a line of conduct inconsistent with the honour for which be then gave my right hon friend credit lagrec witithe rht hon gentle matn in the remark he made in the speech fhve quoted  the right honbaronet is still the eame he in stii
