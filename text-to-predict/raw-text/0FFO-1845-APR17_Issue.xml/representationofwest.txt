toemorow as the friends of the three gentlemen who he bea as yet named for the representation are expected to be present it is supposed that some deï¿½ itive resolution will be come to with respect to

only conjecture upon the subject i that it is mr frewens wish to retire rather thun divide the conservative lnterest am impression which is favoured ba be evident reluctance with which he sufiered himself to be put in nomination on the other hand it is said that lord hlolmecdale has not absolutely retired but ia preparer to abide the result of tonmorrowa meeting when the feelig of the electors upod the subject of maynooth wil be more di rectly tested the more general op iion however is thai there viul he no contest and that colonel austen wiu be the unopposed candidate the day for the

to whether on this one point for on all others there could be none his lordship was a proper repregeetative of the senti ments of the freeholder and electors of weatkent at thae moment nd other candidate having been mentioned many gentlemen equally opposed te the maynooth rant an those who had openly expressed their objections felt that the had no choice but to support the candidate who had been requested to come forwardand who indeed this question alone excepted was so every way worthy of their supportor to snbnnt to th e probable alr natve sthe re ation ofthe counr y ba r ried off by a radical tneiderstions of this kind hone ter were not oufficenty powerful to reconcile oters to any participation in a proceeding which at thie particular juncture right have been considered anup prova of the ministerisl proposal and it was determined b tbem to put in nomination a gentleman who in addition to holdine conservative principles was entirely epposed to the maynootb grant the objection to which daily increased ire intensity and was doubtless not a little heightened by tke intimation that it was only a firet step to the establishment of romanism the gentleman applied towas mr thori

of the conservative candidates could have been returned while the future interests of the party naign have betn irretrievably damagedin thisdilemma lord hohmesdalewhose only desire as he had previously declared was to support the conservative caute with a generous disregard of self which while it in only what might be expected from his nolie and highmirded character does him the highest possible honour at once in timated that he would not stand in the way of the welfare and unity of the conservative party if any gentleman could be indaced to come forward who might be expected to re ceive its undivided support this disinterested conduct was met in a corresponding spirit and both the csndidates have withdrawn from the field in the hope and expectation that another gentleman wiul be presented to the electorswho will receive as he most entirely deserves the undiviad confidence of the conservative partythe gentleman we allude to is colonel aneten of kippinigton sevenoake
