dukg of stussex wve wvere preventcd from noticing as fully as wve could have wished the specch of his royal highness thc duke of sussex on thursdlay last at presentittg the petition of tho faculty of physic in london as there were many points of considerable intercst al vanced by his royal higlness we shall now give his speecl more in detail his royal highness spoke to the following effcctlly lordsi have the honour to present to your lord ships the hurnblc petition of the president and the com muonaty of the faculty of physic in london praying your lordships serious and immediate attention by enacting some legislative rocasure for the promotion of the study of ana tomy and which they humbly submnit may be materially aided by the repeal of the act for the disection and anatomy of murderers and by alowving the opening of the body of any individual provided lie sbould not have expressed any wish to the contrary previous to his death or that his rela tiods should not evince any objection on thie subject the petitioners assure your lordships that in applying to your hionurable house they are not promptedl by any motives of interest either in their individual or corporate caacity but solely by their wish to promote the objects of humanity and the welfare of society lfrom the great nxiety that has been expressed by the public on this most interesting subject i do not conceive that a petition of greater importance could come before your lordships ner one in v hich society in go lieral is snore particularly interested your petitioners state and they state it rightly that towards the improvement of physic and saurgery no ctudy can contribute so mufch as that of anatomy that in their examination of applicants to prac tice it is one of the peculiar branclhes in which they are most strictly examined indeed such is the advantage which has already been derived from the improvement of medical sci ence in this linc of study that comparing tae value of life as it is now calculated to what it was  years ago it has abso  ilaely doubled in proof of this argument i have only to refer your lordships to the books of the various insurance offices not only my lords is this study and scicnce en joined by the faculty and similar institutions in various parts of this empire but the law of the land visits with punish ment any person who may mismanage his patient through ignorance of his art and yet at the samne time that it thus obliges the student to make himself thoroughly acquainted with his profession it by another liw prohibits the means by which he may acquire such information for by the common law of this country it is a misdemeanour for any one to have a dead body in his house unless the person had died under his roof i am glad to have my noble and learned friendif he will allow me to call him solord eldon listening to my statement as i de layed presenting the petition untu there was a fula attendance in the house asd that i might be assisted by tbe know ledge of learned lords as far as to set me rightif i make any erroncous statement i repeat then my lord that there are several trials upon record which show that practitioners as well as students have been prosecuted for having dead bodies in their houses and have suffered the panishment either of fine or imprisenment for such misdemeanour as to that part of the petition which goes to repeal the statute against mur derers i cannot say i go the full length which is prayed forin the petitiod but i am most anxious my lords to go along with the feelings of the public and i donot wish to wound those of any man and  respect she motives of those who may think differently with me on the subject but stiu i do think my lords that all classes of society especially the lower will be benefitted by some legislative enactment on this most impor tant zubject which imight be passed after due consideration and bearing in mind that no one is to be subjected to any act which militates against his feelings and is at variance with a due sense to decency and propriety in the year  the surgeons were separated from the barbers company by royal charter and from that time the science has gradually improved and the members who now compose that body ate persons of as high education as in any other profession many of them possess every qualification suited to a gentle man and a scholar to such persons rny lrd it is a subject of deep regret that obliged as they are to prosecute their stu dies fer the benefit of inankindthey arereduced notonlyto ct contrary to the laws but also to come in contact with persons of the lowest and vilest classsuch as those who in the vulgar appellation are called  bodysnatchers who proceeding from one crime to another acquire such total disregard for all moral propriety that for the sake of lucre they commit the crime of sacrilege and robbery and at last finish by the worst of crimesthat of rnurderfbr the sole purpose of turning the body of the sufferer to their own private gains indeed my lords i cannot conceive a more dreadful state of things  and recollecting what i myself heard on the trials of certain individuals on a late occasion i cannot conceal my own feel ings while presenting this petition which permit me my lords to observe is presented for the benefit of the p sor much more than of the rich your lordships as welus myself if we are in want either of surgical or medical advice would no doubt be able to pay persons wed instructed in their professioa and who for want of the means in this coun try bave been compelled ro pursue their studies abroad  while the poorer classes of socloty and your army and navy would have to seek for assistance at the hands of ignorant and ill educated persons who would tnangle their bodies and in jure their constitutions from want of that scientific knowledge of the art which from the present system they bave been pre elutded from obtaining and yet i have been startltd by an observation which an individual made to me that there was something disgraceful in a member of a scientific body taking share in the sentence pronounced againse such a criminal but my lords  do think that the public at large are not fully aware of he object of that statute which was passed ir the reign of george  and which was intended specifically te prevent any chance of christian burial to a murdetcer in all other execations a part of the melancholy ceremony con sists in reading thie burial service to the criminal previous to his being launched into eternity after which his body is de livered over to his fricsd or relations who bury him at their own pleasure in the case of murder this service is totally omitted and with criminals of that class after execution they are sentenced to be dissected and anatomizedin other words the body to be separated and made into anatomical pre pration which precludes any possibility of its receiving christian burial and this i take to be the meaning of the law to show your lordships in what little esteem surgery was generally held i have only to quote an act of parliament passed in the reign of henry ill when the barbers and sur geons were classed as one company and when they cre al lowed four bodies a year which they might obtain o felons who were executeda small number indeed in those days and which now would be considered totally insufficient when we have upwards of  students learning the profession in this city alone i therefore pray my lords that the prayer of the petitioners may be taken into your lordtbips most serious consideration to the end that measures may be adopt ed under the sanction of the legislature to secure the means of facilitating the study of anatomy in particular and the science of medicine in general
