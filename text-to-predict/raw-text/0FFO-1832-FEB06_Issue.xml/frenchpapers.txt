for granting a complementary credit to the mlinister of war vwas resumedgeneral lafayette took the opportunity of alluding to the late events in the papal states lie maintained that the french government had been guilty of a breach of faith to wards the italan patriots it had undertaken to see that the promises of free institutionswere fulfilled and yet when those promises were grossly violated it had shown approbation in stead of indignation in conclusion he called on ministers at any rate now to interfere to prevent new eruelties following the successes which it appeared the papal troops had ob tainedthe president of the coundl said that the chamber had a right to impeach mslinisters bat that it had not the right to beperpetuallymaking violent reproacbes unfounded on a single fact negotiations have he said been commenced on the subject but in the present stge it would not be proper to give any further explanations on the point except to state that the french ambassador had acted according to the instructions given to himm deludre said that he was not going to enter into ques tions of general policy he had to examine the propriety of the expenses which had necessitated the application for the prezent grant the hon deputy then objected to many of the items particularly the amount of pay allotted to several general officersm alartineaudeschenes commissioner of government defended the expenses in question which lie sald were strictly in accoredance with precedentsml maaiguin said that on the belgian question he should only remark that when the inister so indignantly repelled the accusation of lord grey as to the desire of the french government for a restoration in belgium he forgot that lord grey would feel bimself called en to prove his werds in order to justify himself to the english parlisment with respect to lyons he thought that the alinister of war would have done better if he had waited for the praises of the chamber instead of praising himself if his longpromised report had been laid before the chamber it might probably have thrown some light on the causes of the breaking of the engage ments entered into by the civil and military authorities the hon deputy then readan extractifrom a letter writ ten by general reguet in which he said that he would use his influence with the manufacturers to induce them to maintain the tariff and would also recommend relief to be afforded to the wounded from the commercial fund neither of these tbings had been done numerous voices irom the centres called for the date of the letter  the extremni ties accused the centres of perpetually interrupting and said that the opposition would be driven in selfdefence to inter rupt the ministerial speakers in the same manner at last al illauguin said that the date was the d of november he then continued by protesting against the faveurs and decora tioni conferred en the soldiers after the events of lyons com paring them to the rewards bestowed by the restoration on the soldiers engaged in the affairs of colmar and the rue st denis and adding that it was by such rewards that the sol rsts were excited to hostility against the citizens loud criesof  order lthe presjdent incuired to whom the hon deputy intended to apply the last sentence of his speechml mauguin to the government whose conduct i bave a right to examinethe presidentl such an accusation is unparliamentarv i call you to order loud applauseiv mauguin concluded by observing that if the inister of war had laid his report before the chamber there would have been better infbrmation to judge upon than the mere dictum of a single ministergeneral demartay said that the days of lyons could not be compared to the days of july in the former the soldiers were acting mncrely against misled fellowcitizens in the latter the whole nation rose against oppressionml fulchiron deputy of the rhone stated that the dis turbances at lyons had no political airn whatever and could no therefore be in any respect assimilated to a civil war the artisans he added were not excusable as they were well aware that they were violating the laws and that the tariff prevented the manufacturers from giving them work with respect to the rewards distributed be said that he should make no remark as the minister of war had ex pressed himself on that subject like a true friend of hws coun try in conclusion he complained of the perpetual attacks made on the army which tended to divide the soldiers in opinion and prevent them doing their dutygeneral jacquseminot as chef detat major of the national guard repelled the imputation of any hostility existing be tween the soldiers and the citizens on the contrary lie said that the national guards and the troops of the line were always united in their endeavours to maintain public orderthe minister of war said that he acceded to the amend ment of the committee granting only the extraordinary ex pesses at present and should apply in another form for the sums necessary in consequence of some heads of expense having exceeded the estimatesthe chamber therefore proceeded to ballot on the grant of fp only which was adopted by a majority of  against adjournedcihahber of deputies sittiitg of feb previously to the opening of the sitting the deputies present were assembled in animated groups discussing the events of last night but nothing transpired publicly on the subjectaf passy brought up a report recommending the adoption of the bill for definitively regulating the accounts of the bud get of  as amended by the chamber of peersordered to be taken into consideration on saturday nextthe discusston of the budget of  was then resumedthe article next in tum was the th chapter of the first division of the budget consisting of the following item floating debt  francsau amendrnent proposed by af alexandre genin to this chapter was postponaed until another period of the delibera tion after a discussioa which was wholly uninteresting as faras it related to the point under consideration but which gave rise to an episodical renewal of thc scenes of recrimina tion and violence which wve have so often had occasion to lametit i jolllvetin supperting the amendment took occasion to protestagainst the  irritating recriminations and injurious insinuations directed against the opposition of which he formeda partgefieralderisargay explained that the opposition in the re marks tmade in the precedingsitting onthe affairs of lyons did dld not mean to deny that all revolts against the govern ment of whatever kind they might be were properly punirhable but it was intended to drar a distinction between the events caused by the intrigues of the supporters of the power of charles x after the revolution of july and those of lyons which were destitute of any political character and which therefore ought not to have heen treated in the same severe tanner as a conspiracy to overthrow the government more particuarly as the tariff on which the disputes between she atlsans and manufacturers wrere founded had been ap prdved of by the constdtuted authorities he made these remarks he added without at all wishing to decide who was right or who was wrong in the affair the hon generals speech was constantly interrupted with loud cries for the  order of the day from the centres replied to by cheers and cries of  go on from the extremitiesm dnpin aind with great vivacity this question must be stt at rest and in a few words i cannot consider it as settledwhen we are told by an hon deputy that he does not know who was right or who was wrong those who revolted were wrong and the government which repressed the revolt was right this is the trutb and it must be plainly spoken we must not have revolts excited by hearing that deputies do ntknow who is right or who is wrong justifications are found  for every emeute intentions are quoted in opposition to acts and accordingly the unfailing result is that we find that certain speeches delivered from this tribunte have invari ably been followed by fresh emeutes loud applause from thecentres from the opposition benches were heard cries ofthlis is gross calumny it is libelling the oppsitio m dapin in coutinuationi do not calumniate the op position  on the contrary i am fully sensible of the advan tages of a fair and constitutional oppositionthe object of which is to enlighten the government and prevent its falling into error nt an opposition ought to confine its attacks to the ministers and the system of policy adogted by them and not violate its oaths by attacking established order and suwp portingopinions which tend to excite the passions create trouble in the country and desolation in families and plunge

liberty of the tribusne spoken ozr by melode tr ay meant thast ihe opposition mnembere were to be allowedto shy anv thing and every thing they chose but that any repsy to them was to be rendered inaudible by constant in teriuptions as to naming individuals it was unnecessary to raise fresh caimg by doing so since thc facts on which hisstatementwas fondedweretoo fresh in the recelection ofthe chamber to need particular mention fresh inter ruptions in conclusion the hon deputy said that the real constitutional opposition could not be wounded by what he had said as when the speeches to wbicl ho had alluded were delivered the first signs of reprobation cmanated from the opposition benchesthe dmarquis de mornay said that he belonged to the op position and avowed it frankly asd independently but he did not belong a that systematic opposition which sought only to overturn existing powers that it might assume their place applause he then vindicated the intentions of himself and his political friends and called on the opposite party to act hdnourably by them and not represent as anar chits men who were the most devoted supporters of the royalty of july and whose constant device was  honour and our country applausedil diauguin wished to say a few words as a summing up of the discussion wbich had been so unexpectedly re newed he conceived that the two parties were not so widelv different in opinion as was supposed both were agreed that government was bound to protect public or der and to repress any attempt to violate it in whatever manner it might be made the only difference in opinion was as to the recompences uhich ought to be awarded to those who were employed for that purpose he perfectly agreed with government that the military ought if necessary to be called on to repress disturbances and that if so called on they were bound to obey but he must persist in thinking that when it was necessary to shed the blood of citizens the coun try should be covered with a funereal crape  and then continued he  what are the recompences to be accorded  the hon deputy then entered iato the financial question sup porting the ameudment of ini gouinthe whole of the foregoing discussion took place in the midst of a perpetual tumult and the agitation created by it pervaded the chamber a considerable time after its termi nationafter the amendment of al gonin and also an amend ment proposed by n laffitte to the same article had with the consent of the movers been adjourned until the conside ration of another part of the budgetgeneral bertrand moved a reduction of d francs on the article on the ground that the mlnister might borrow the fund to the interest of which this grant was devoted at  per cent which would reduce it by the above amountap above all concluded the hon general  demand the unlimited liberty of the pressloud laughterthe president of the council opposed any alteration being made in the amount granted for the floating debt as he said th t the sum fixed could only be approximative and whatever might bo the amount of it the minister musr ultimately be guided by circumstances as to the rate at whtch any loan re quisite should be contracted and consequently what demand must be made en that fund the sum asked for ws that which was considered the most probable to be wantedna laffitte also opposed the motion on similar groundsthe amendment was then rejested and the chapter adopted as proposedchapter  granting ooor for the payment of go vernment life annuities was adopted without discussiaschapt er  relates to the grants for various pensionsthe presideut stated that as several amendments had been handed in which related to the pensions generally it would be proper to dispose of them before the items were brought under discussion the most extensive of them was the fol lowing proposed by m bousquet all pensions granted during the reigns of louis xviii and charles x under whatever title or name shall be re vised in the course of the year  the new rates sball be founded upon the laws and regulations itn force on the day of their first liquidation reckoning nevertheless only the services rendered to the french governmenr in par ticular all pensions or parts of pcnsions granted for the fol lowing services saill be annulled i in fofeign armies  those of la vcndee the emigration or any other corps not legally recognised by the established govemment of france  for particular services rendered to the princes of the elder branch of the bourbons  finally those which founded on the law of september   have nevertheless been granted without regard to the conditions fixed by the same law this revision shall be made by acommitteeotnnemern bers four of whom shall be named by the government the five others by and from the chamber of deputies the final result of thie labours of this committee and a summary of the motives upon wbich it was founded shall be printed and distri buted to all the members of the chambers m bousquet in developing his amendment accused the chonans and vendean soldiers of being generally nothing but brigands whose only object was plunder and maintained that at any ratc the france of july ought not to be called on to pay pensions lavished on those who earned them only by stirring up civil war on behalf of that family which the revo lution of  had forever driven from the countryn lepelletier daulnay considered the system of pension ing as having been carried to a most objectionable extent but he vwas of opinion that any revision of those already granted weeld be not only nnjust but impolitic as tending to revive extinct dissensions he therefore oppesed the amendmentdi de ludre supported the samendment observing that at least the pensions of those who had bome arms against their country ought to be suppressed he would not go so far as to say with ft lameth that all who bore arms against their country ought to be hanged but on the other hand he would not nave them pensionedm lameth explained that his opinion applied only to those found engaged in a foreign service against their country civil war he considered rather as a misfortune than a crime loud murmursal thiers objected to the anmendment as being found ed on a system of reaction wholly contrary to the spirit of the charter he defended the cause of the old pensioned soldiers reraasking that most of them who constituted the army of cond had served in the imperial army and that it would therefore be cruel now to inquire whether men who had served  years in our ranks had afterwards served two or three years on the rhine where indeed they were fight ing against france but only in support of a cause which they had sincerely though erroneously embraced mlurmurs he added that when there wvere two camps in a country it could not be denied that in whichever of them a soldier bore arms he did in fact bear arms which was sufficient to entitle him to his pension as the th article of the charter declared expressly that all the ranks honours and pensions should be preserved te them and even if it were not so the lrevelution of july ought to imitate in that respect the conduct of the re storation which continued to pay even pensions granted to men connected with the first revolutionfrenche futnds paris feb five per cents f loc r c f t c c sf f c sf sf c f r c  f c f f c f f c
