for yesterday but in consequence of the una voidable absence of the attorneygeneral wiho was engaged in another court on an important case and which circumstance we stated in our report of yesterday and the regret expressed by his lordship at the inconvenience of another attendance of the special jury when it was put off till today and atthe same time we notice this we also feel it our duty to correct a slight error as to an expression we attributed to air jervis in that report arising from our indistinctly hearing the words for they do as they like with the revenue in this court read  it is our duty to take care of the revenue in this courta caee of a similar nature which also took place at batb was decided against another defendant on wednesday last the present trial occupied the

descendant by his own representation of the great sir matthew hale wlho in his efforts to recover property of his ancestor hall involved himself in sorne legal difficulties which compelled him to secrete himself for a time and the defendants premises was the place selected whilst in this hidingplace he became ecqusinted with thefacts forming the grounds of the present charge and on his credibility in a great measure rested the ease he gave his evidence in  manner so perfectly original and with a humour so peculiarly his own that the court which was crowded to cxcess was highly amused we pro pose giving his evidence as full as our limits will allow he was in some points corroborated by the testimony of his wife and circumstantially so by the officers of excise whose duty it was to examine into these matters these however were in some points contradicted by a namber of witnesses who appeared on the part of the defendant but mere particularly so as to the flooring of a room where some of the facts were said to have occurred a loose threat was also attributed to hale of shooting the judge who had decided against his claim in chancery and who happened to be the present presiding judge lord iyndhurst but this was received by his lordship with his usual good humour and considered as a loose obser vation made in accordance w ith the character of the individual

suit in chancery came the quantity of soap seized was i ton cwt b the wife swore she fre quently saw the materials put into the copper the charges were various the first was for fradulently concealing soep the second for putting materials in the copper during the absence of the officer they had heard the whole of the evi dence on the part of the crown there had been some acts proved beyond the possiblilityofadoubt in lay  when shearn had said he had not any thing to do with the premises ated when bright was in posscssion of them the discovery was made by the three officers who had given their evidence it appeared there was a concealed room adjoin ing these premises and that there were communica tions mrade by apertures in the wall secured by lime and it was stated by the officers that they cffected their entrance through one of these holes and they there found a frame contalning soap in a liquid state taking that evi dence as correct the next step on the part of the crown was to produce as a witness a person of the name of halc he said that it was necessary for hin in eonsequence ot his being threatened with proceedings that hie ghould get out of the way and that from the th of muay  to the th of june he was concealed on these premises  during this time he slept on the premises and during the night he was em ployed in assisting the workmen to remove the soap from the copper into the frame if they believed hale he had made out a case against the defendant on both charges in addi tion to the evidence of hale his wife was called and she con firmed the account of hale as to his residence with sheasr she alsb statcd that whilst there she beirg employed to su perintend the workshop she saw materials put into the cop per in the absence of the officer she said she one day came in suddenly and saw hollis there hollis had not been called to disprove this face for the purpose of confirming this witness one of the excise officers was called and he said be had looked over the returns of the excisewith great at tertion and that is eventeen instances there was a variation from the usual calculation they would find that on the llth of june  the quantity of materials set down was b and the return of soap b that was a differ ence of  in  or to the amount of  per cent in another instance there was a greater difference mr gibbs a soapboiler was caued who stated that there was sometimes an increase but never knew it carried beyond  per cent in addition to that he had stated a circum stance whicb had been much relied on by the attorney general which was that to catry the business on properly  ton per week should be manufactered for every workman em ployed in the business but that if five men were employed and only that quantity produced it must inevitably lead to a loss on the other sidc maagg was called to contradict hale who had stated there was a floor in the long room the two first witnesses state there was no floor in that room whilst in the occupation of defendant miaggs was employed by shearn and said there was no floor in that room that there were only  joists  feet apart bat that in consequence of the badness of the roof he was employed to make a ceiling but there being no floor and in consequence ofthe rain coming lt fcom the roof it aftevewads fell dovwn he went into it from timi to time and there was no floor that in ocrobcr  he put in a floor the second witness was pace a stonenmason who said tbat he was employed for the purpose of raising a wall on the roof on which occasion he saw the condition of the room and there was no floor the next witness called was the supervisor of excise david jones whom they at first thought had been dismissed from his office but it appeared that on being ordered to go to bristol he resigned he stated as to the condition of the candle house but his statement did not correspond with that which was given by mlagga he said that the celllog did not extend oyer the room te did not mention the circumstance of a hole over the ceiling he was examined as to the attention of the officers on duty and said there was an assistant appointed to watch the process that assistant was ehanged from month to month and was absent only for short perieds when there was always an officer appointed to relieve him therefore they would perceive it was difficult to put tallow in the copper in the day time bale said that the loch of the copper was opened by an iron barthat the staple was fastened inside by the hand with a nut which was secured and rivetted and consi derable force was required to force off the lock the materials were put through a hole in the wall and afterwards the copper was closed and the staple put into its proper position reid always felt that the wall was secure and never found it other wise he never saw such violene used there could be no doubt that during the night the copper was epened and ma terials taken out and it might have been done as described by hale in addition they had the evidence of the workmen george hubbard hollis and overn joseph beames and thomas beames who contradicted hale as to what was going on node was subpoenaed by the crown but had not been called by either side there was then begby who had been described as  the lawyers cad and apperley who was connected writh a person of the name of lzazarus this was the evidence for the defendant it was a case of conflicting evidence and it was for the jury to say which side they be lievedat  oclock on sunday morning the jury were at their own request discharged by the consent of all parties
