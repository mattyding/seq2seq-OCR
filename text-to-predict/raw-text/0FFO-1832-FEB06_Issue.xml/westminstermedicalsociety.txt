westivifntbr medical socubtyat the meeting of thia society on satuiday cvening the a tention of the members was directed to a recently discovered mnthod of teaching anatomy by means of an artificial human body the invention of dr azoux of paris the learned and ingenious foreigner was present on the occasion but beng wholly uzable lo express himself in english the de monstration of this artificial subject was undcrtcken on his part and very clearly performed by one of the members of the ociety mlr costello the anatomist this prepara tion which undoubtedly ftrnisbcs one of the most extra ordinary specimens of ecicntific and laborious ingenuity that has perhaps ever becn witbessed exhibits a complete articial human body modelled upon that of a strong athleic vwellformed man of great muscular developmenst and when whole its appearance is thpt of such a subject merely stripped of the skin and with the rnuscles and other parts immediately undermeath exposed toview all the ex ternal muscjes of the body and the extremides arc to be seen modelled with surprising accuracy after nature placed precisely in their relative positions with the super ficitl arteries and veins by which they are intersected showing their origin from and tber insertion in the bones to wvhich they are attached the direction of thcir fibres the connexiln of their fascia or tendinous sheaths not a muscle is omit ted or out of place down to the minute flexors and extensors ofthe fingers and toes and altogether the preparation viewed in this state furnishes a most extraordinary coup evesil if it may be so called of the human subject when de prived of the oater integuments but the wonder of this curious piece of art only commences here all the parts of which it consists and they amount to not les than  can be removed one after the other and in that way the muscles of the trtunk and the extremities can be regularly demonstrated the relative position of the exter nal and intcrnal muscles exhibited the transit of the arte ries reins and nerves clearly shown and in fact each muscle and each orgn can be removed from the skin down to the bone and replaced agaln in their natural position with the greatest facility ilr costello taking the arm in the first instance and commencing with the deltoid muscle at tbe top removed all the muscles down to the bone demon strating them accurately as he went along to tic surprise and admiration of a crowded room next removing the muscles that connect the sbhoulder with the neck and head lie drew the attention of his auditory to the very beautiful aud correct view which tkc preparation furnished of the rclativc position of the parts immediately underneatb an accurate knowledge of which is indispensably necessary to the surgecn in the great operatisn of tying the subclavian artery he then removed the muscles of the cbest and abdomen and ex hibited the contents of those cavitiestec heatt lungs and other viscera which were modelled with most astonishing truth to nature the heart presented a perfect triumph of this ingenious foreigners szill it is divided into two pieces which wben separated exhibit its cavities with their valvu lar processes and the connexion of the large blood vessels which arise from it and which are continued with their numerous anastomes to their tcrmination many partr most difficult of demonstration in the dead subjcct surh as the absorbent systemn with its final termination in that of the vcnous the various portions of the brain with the origin of the nerves tberefron the bratiehing off of the nerves from thie spinal cord the course of the great sympathetic nerve the mechanism of deglutition c c are here exhibited with wondrful fidelity in short withont going into further de tails it may be stated that this artificial sabject approaches as near perfecdon as any thing of the kind could possibly be expected to do the muscles and other parts of which it consists are mnade of some peculiar paste which in its recent state is easily moulded into any variety of forms  and which subsequently on drying assumes a degree of hardness and solidity nearly equal to that of wood lt has cost as mav be supposed its ingenioas author  or  years of assiduous attention but his successful labsurs have not bcn thrown away they have earned for him the unanimous approbation and applatte of the leading scientific and medical societies in his own country and a great number of his subjects have been already disposed of to vari ous schools in ditferent parts of europe andamerica the great object which dr azoux aimed at in this invention and which it appears adamirably calculated to achieve is to faci litate the study of anatomy and to render a thorough knor ledge of it through the usual means of dissection morc speedily attainable on the pert of the student while at the same timce such a preparation would serve as a most usefulmap to recall to the memory of the more advanced practitioner the topography of the human body but m azoux has too much good sense and is too well acquainted with his profession to suggest for a moment that such an invetition even though the most perfect in its way could at all supersede the necessity of dissection or that any surgeon would obtain not to say the science of a hunter or a bichat but even an ordiaary prac tical knowledge of his business sufficient to prevent him from being a mere empirical slayer of his kind without going through that indispensable process in his education dr azoux merely proposes his preparation as an useful aid to the student and the fbllowing extract from the vcrv complimen tary report of the royal academy of mtedicine of paris with respect to this invention is a tolerably sufficient answer to those writers in this country who taking it into their very wise heads to dogmatize on a subject of which they know about as much as the great cham ot tartary would persuade the public that anatomy can be learned without
