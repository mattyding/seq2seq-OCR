 piiva tb correspondenceparis feb  txxursday eveninga conspiracy was last night discovered and at the moment of its breaking cut stifled it is described as having for its object the assassination of louis philip the proclamation of  republic by some and the precaring of the return of henry v by others the carlists and the republicans are stated to have been the originators of the plot each for their particular purpose the exact details are not yet known the following is all that i hitherto have been cnbled to gathcr anmidst conflicting runioursa party of the conspiratemr collected at  oclock in the morning in the place of the bastile having for their object the seizure of the powder mcagsine on the south bank of the rlvcr t orchcs vere lighted and signals given but within  minutes after the conspirators appeared on the square a party of the uunicipal cavalry guard drove into theplace antlseieed all  persons were arrestedits different other parts of paris where divisions of the conspirators were assembled the police and municipal guard attacked them and made many prisoners the great point of union is said to have been in the rue de prouvaire near the halle or cornmarket where the police and municipal guard attackzed a large body of the conspirators and after a conflict in which many were wounded some say  persons and a serjeant of the city service shot through the head some prisoners were niade the total number of prisoners of all ranks and descriptions is said to amount to it is rumoured that the meastires of the conspirators were so taken as that two officers of the army had contrived to obtain admission into the hall or saloon in which the king gave last night a grand ball to upwards of  personswhen they were arrested by the dukc decazes and of course con signed to the custody of the policei have this day traversed a great part of paris and find all quiet the inhabitants seem not alarmed by the discovery of the conspiracv ard are attending to their business as usualon the stock exchange the discovery of the conspiracy waa treated as a matter of no great import but the funds did not recover the panic of yesterdayparis febs the conspiracy discovered on the night before last is siid to bave had four interests to forward viz principally of the friends of a rcstoration in the person of henry v of confu sion and plunder under the name of a republic of military governmnent and glory under the name of napoleon ii and of the  juste milieu who wished to crush the spirit of insubordination of which thc growth has been encoarzged by the factious press and by the turbulent and in a great measure unprincipled opposition that would sacrifice the peace antd welfare of their country for the mere advantage of having place and power for some months there is an other interest accsed of fomenting disorders occasionally and for the base purposes of profiting by them in their speculations on the stock exchange to their advances to those conspirators is attributed thc large sums that were found on their persons during the searches of of the police perhaps this charge is unbunded it is to be hoped so for the honour of the paris exchange but the charge is spoken of too openly to be passed unnoticed  and it is well known that rumonrs of the conspiracy were circu lated from the beginning of the week this is settling time onchangethe extent of the ramifications of the conspiracy cannot yet be stated fo n some persons assert that they were consi derable throughvthe departments but that they reere much more wide in parts tkan they as yet appear suspicion bas fallen upon some foreigners of various ranks and stations and even at a grand entertaimrnent lately given to the carlists by an englishmen there were as it is reported some young men who wsore white insignia at their buttonholes to re semble the order of henry v and who pubhcly teasted the safe and speedy return of their young pretender lhere are persons who say that although this coup failed another is likely to lake place sooni this ntorrine passed through different districts of paris and found all qutet  the streets thronged as usual with persons on business and no sign of alarm no news of any moment has reached us from the provincesthe sienographe a mlinisterial evening paper of yesterday contains the fallowing details a serious event took place last night in paris an attempt at tevolt had been some time in preparation but government having gained previous in telligence took all the necessary measures to seizr the con spirators before

under the command of m vincent a peaceofficer took that direction on arriving at the top of the rut denfer they werc met by a crowd retiring in disorder who being deceived by the disguise of the policeefi cers entered into the following colloquy with themoa be ing challenged by the leaders of the insurgents and asked if he was ef their party the policeofficer answered  to be sure  give the password then  honneur   pa trie   but where are you going   wve are surround ed there is cavalry behind us  come with us then and we will show you the way the officer then led them to the place st imlichel where a sufficient force was stationed to secure the whole of tbem the police having foreseen that communication might be held between the different parties on each side of the river over the pont neuf and that stragglers and runaways weuld probably take that as their best means of escape cs tablished on the bridge a strong picket of peace officers and serjean s with orders to stop andl examine all carriages that might pass this order proved to have been most judicious for it led to the arrest of nearly  persons some carrying firearms some swvords or daggers others moneyand others with isnt acg the number taken into custody is said to exceed  on the pontneuf there was some firing one of the conspirators wras killed and several were wounded amongst the latter it is said was a valet of mi delavan who had about him a quantity of linen for dressing wounds in fine the governmnent has obtained possession not only of some of the mosc marked of the conspirators but a quantity of arms ammunition considerable sum s of moneyj and alto doctsments wrhich will he sufficient to prove the authors and object of the plot in addition to the foregoing detail we have learned the following circumstancescat a quarter past  in the morning eight voltigeurs of the st battalion of the lth le glon of shr national guards under the comnmand of orpo ral luegrand passing by the troli rouge perceived at the en trance of the rue dnu four a group assembled towards which a patrol of the line fromn the post of the abbayc was moving when at she same moment cries of  to arms l to arms t  wsere herd in the rue du dragon on coming up he found a pwerson named kiersausie struggling with twvo police agcntswho had seized him and w hom he threatened to shoot with two pocket pistols he had in his hands but one only of whichwas charged kersausie was accompanied by several other persons who however had advanced before him some at the entrance of the rue do four and others in the rue de gre nelle allof whom flied ais soon as the soldiers took the di rection of the rue du dragon kersausle stoted himself to be a captain oefavalry on half pay hie was taken to the post of the abbayethe followiny are some additional particulars from other evening papersfor nearly a fortnight past a youngman gentcelly drest hod been in the habit of coming every day to breakfast or dinntr at the restaurateurs attached to the hotel des prouvaires sornetimes accompanieed by two or three end sometimes by as many as six or seven compa nlons on wlednesday afternoon he informed the landilord that he shouhld want a supper for  persons that night the latter replied that hto hadno rooms large enough nor could he get so large a supper prepared in the time the young man ho weverinslsted and the la nd lord ansio us to declinecif poasible said that he did not feel safe in giving so large an entertain ment to comparative strangers without some security for the payment on which the young man immediately gave him a bank note of  francs and told himn that the rooms would do perfectly well and that as for the supper a few sub stantial disheswrere all that w as wanted the landlord then went o th comissay ofpolieno h urtr nwent to tbe commissary of police of the quarter and in formed him of what had occuered the latter told him that the police were already aware of his house having been select ed for a treasonable rendezvous and that proper measures had been taken he accordingly prepared the supper and sbout  oclock the young maan came accompanied by between  and  individuals in every variety of costumehats jacketsblouses and shirt sleeves sbortly after their arrival a hackneycoach filltd with arms drove up to the door the land lor objected to their being brought in but the young man told him that though no harri was intended to hirm he must for the presentceese to consider himself the master of the house the guests accordingly took possession of all the keys and werepreparing to secure the doors when the police entered and captured tnem in the manner above stated it appears that the police were aware that part of the plan of the conspirators was to mislead the authorities by having false patrols parading in varlous parts of paris in consequence of which orders were given to most of the commanders not to send out the usual patrols at all by which means thetroops cmployed were able to seize all they met with withoutfear of arresting their friends a variety of reports of differ ent shadcs of improbability were of cours in circuladop  amnong others it was said that illarshal bourinont was inparis ready to take the command of the insurgensamongst the persons arrested is it is said a nephew of ll mangin the late prefect of police an evening paper also names al delauney treasurer of the society of the amis du penple and the person called  le lmenton dargent of the firm of lacroix and co it is also an nounced that the porter of the louyre has been taken into custody for having delivered usa the keys of that palacegeneral dufour a secretary of iii castelbajac the son of m couseille and an aidedecmp of iu de lsoehejaquelin are likewise reported to he among the number arrestedit appears that a variety of clrcumrtasnes had for some days past put the police upon the scent of this plot many of he old gardesdugorp were observed to arrlve inparis whilst on the otber hand a bust mask of robes pierre was ordered to be made by a popular society and plaster images of him wereedistributed in sereral quarters of paris medals with the effigy of henry v and libels against louisphillippe and his family were also scattered abroad some were thrown into the guardhouses indivi duals known to be partisans of the late dynasty bad it is said been noticed in coffeehouses predicting a movement for the end of last month otbers of a different opinion were beard to say you think that we shall draw the chestnuts outof the fire to let you cst them but we will rather cut your throats finally it wvas positively asserted in the lobbies of the chamber of deputies that an act of association between the carlists and the repablicans lhad been seized rite following are said to be the bases ofit  to unite in destroving what is established convoke primary assemblies and leave them to decide on the mode of government to be adopted theec details read aloud in the salon des con ferences were received with the utmost indignation by the deputiesthe following anecdote is also in current circulation an honourable member of the chamber of deputies al d g n was warned a few days ago that his life would be attempted for having been onz of the  tbese intima tions were renewed en wednesday evening by a man to whom m d g n had rendered pecuniary assistance and who offered to repay the debt with money which he had re ceived to induce him to join the conspiracy it is stated that one of the plans of the conspirators was to stir up the printers to an attack on all the printingoffices in which mechanical presses are cmployed and by that means prevent any of the liberal journals from appearing this would spread alarm in the departments and be a signal for a rising of the conspirators in various plrts of the kingdom some journals also pretendl that the fixing of the day for the first comnmunion of the duke of bordeaus about which so much has been said by the quoti dicnne and which has been so often changed was no other than the concerted signal for the breaking our of the plot in fact the d of february rvas the day last announced for the communionat  oclock yesterday morning the president of the council went to the prefecture of the polce and remained till  it is a singular fact that the qrrolidienne of yesterday morning mentioned a report that  warrants of arrest had been issued and another journal ofthe same party annonaced that the police were preparing fresh conspiraciesthe preceding account is extracted from the principal merning and evening papersthe government does not appear to consider this affair as of high importance it is however to them of great utilitv for it yesterday contributed to break up the system of the opposition in the chamber of deputies by causing those who really are attached to their country to separate from the fac tious leaders of contfusion there are some who fancied heretofore that the system adopted by casimir perier was in jurious to france but they now are convinced that that likely to he pursued by the pary of the alovement is calcu lated to produce far mnore evilthe moniteser states that provision has been already ar ranged for the w idowv and children of the unfortunate serjeant who lost his lifebrussels friday eveihg fnn yesterday at  oclock in the forenoon a courier from london arrived at sir robert adairs hotel sir robert having scarcely allowed himself time to glance at the des patches proceeded to the office of foreign affairs to call on am de aleuleneere and ehaking him by the hand said i bring you goo news and i congratulate youat the same time he presented to him the th protecol by which the courts of france and england have ratified the treaty of the th of novemberthe chamber was that day engaged in settlibg the kings civil list the debate was drawing to a close when al de mculenaere entered followed by his secretarygeneral m de nothomb from the joyful expression of tbeir countenances it was easy to guess that they were the bearers of favourable intelligencelvhen the minister was preparing to address the chambert eager curicesity was manifested and the reading of his report waslistened to in profound silence you will find it literally inserted in the journals which i send you the reading of tho report was followed by unequivocal proofs of satis faction the chamber ordered it to be printed and circulatedyesterday evening and today i have seen a great many re presentatives and all have expresscd to me the satisfaction they feel at seeing france and england concur on this import ant point it is a certain pledge of peace to europe it is supposed that france and england united will make the ba lance incline to their side and at all events the ratification of the other powers is regarded as merely a matter of secondary interest the truth is that many persons here if they were certain that nothing would occur to create a rupture be tween france and great britain would prefer a formal refusal to a ratification because despotism would then be really left to its own resources face to face with free nations and if in this state of things the conflict should ensue it is believed that it would neither be long nor doubtful the majority however would be better pleased that the solution of all remaining difficulties should be announced by the accession of all the powers to the treatythere is now to be decided an important question to which the attention of the represenstatives in the chamber has al ready been tslletl according to the treaty the citadel of antwerp was to be evacuated  days after the ratification will then the evacuation he delayed until the treaty shall be ratified by all the powers  this is probable but if it should happen that all the powers except one ratify the treaty will its executionbe suspended indefinitely if so the phy sical condition of belgium wonld not bemuch improved for what would belgium be without antwerp in reference to this question i must acquaint you with the following fict the city of antwerp notwitbstanding all the difficulties with which it has struggled for  monubs has maintained a prosperity relative it is true but much greater than could have been expected commercial transactions are doubtless mnore cautiously managed than they were before the revolutiod hut when amidst events such as those we liave witnessed that port has been frequented by vessels of all nations what may we not expect when the citadel shall be eva cuatedand when there will be no longer any thing to fear from the king of hollands enterprises  this is well understood by the dutch gavernment and accounts for its resistance how ever this motive is by no means reasonable and proceeds from very narrow views the port of antwerp may prosper and holland also there is room enough in the world for both the dutch and the belgiansthe courier despatched by a van de weyer did not arrive till this moming at brussels and brought nothing with him but the ratifications some persons thought that the departure of this courier had been delayed bv jii van de iveyer in the hope that the plenipotentiary of prussia would ratify the treaty and thereby enable him to send three ratifications at once but whatever may have been the cause of the delay it is certain that the courier brought only the ratifications of france and englandnews received last night from holland but the authority of which is doubttal attributes very hosdle dispositions to king william it is said that he has ordered the go vernors of the provinces to organize the secondban of the schut tery and to keep those troops in a state of readiness for marching on the other hand you must be aware that im portant communications were a few days age expected to be made to the states general it is asserted that the object of these communications is to render the states the judges of what is to be done in the question of ratification mieanwhile we are every day becoming acquainted with fresh facts which prove that the partisans of the expelled house are sparing no efforts to embarrass the government of king leopold secret enlistings are actively carried on in ghent every mneans of seduction are employed among the soldiers to induce them to desert and these means are often successful a cavalry soldier is offered from  to  florins to desert with his horse and equipmentms lsst tuesday three chasseurs de serted in this way for the sas de gand where deserters are regularly received and forwarded into hollandat the beginning of my letter i mentioned the civil list for king leopold the law which fixes it was voted yesterday by  to  it wvas proposed some days ago to make tho amount  florins and to charge the department of the interior with the furnishing and maintenance of the royal residenceswhlch are the palaces of brusselslackenand ant werp the sectionsofthe chamber however did not thinkit advisable that a discussion should take place every year on the budget with reference to the kings residences they hd present to their recollection the scandalous debates which have lately taken place in france on the civil list they therefore determined to arrange the mst ter so that the maintenance of the royal residences should be a burden upon the civil list itself the amount was therefore raised to  fdorins and this sum was adopted some members and mere particularly mm gendebien and de robaulx urged very strongly yesterday that the discussion of the lav should be delayed on the ground that it had not been sufficiently examined but the great majority of the chamber would not hear of any ob struction to the final settlement of the business one member even proposed to vote the law without discussion and by a secret ballot so much was it feared that some bel gian cormenin might raise irritating questions on the subject of the civil list more with the view of casting discredit on what the belgiau people revere thaw of gaining any thing in point of economythe alarm was perhaps exaggerated for i do not believe that w e have a corrnenin in belgium either as to talentor as to perfidy the orangists certainly are not more partial to king leopold than the oxviscount is to louis philip butthey at lcast speak out pretty openly wvhat they mean i have never observed that iv cormenln has said in his wrtings what he means in tteittete he is more explana tory i know but if france knew that he wants a republichis writings would perhaps produce even less effect than they now do and i do not think that they produce much
