correspondent telegraphed last night  a curious application and one that excited very consider able interest was made to the queens bench division of the irish high court of justiee today mr macdonough qc moved on behaltf of mr philip cauan mip who is a member of the english and irish bars for a conditional order for a criminal information against alr john adye curran a member of the irisi bar mr callan complained that in september last on the occasion of an inquest on a policeman at which both of them were professionally en gaged lr curran addressed him when they were leaving the court saying  you are drunk sir if you had not taken so much whisky it would bh better for you a gentleman present asked air callau if he would not resent such language but that only niade mir cmrran worse in fact counsel said that gentlemans conduct was maried by offensivo threats and insulfs while mr callaas conduct was marked by the moset gen tlemanlike demeanour lir carran repeated the of fensive words bringing his face into unpleasant proximity to mr callans facu evidently with the view of provoking a breach of the peace but still mr cauan remained qjuiescent saying he would bide his time lord chiefustice may asked whether mr cahan did not make any other reply mr macdonough eaidyes he certainly replied  you are a  liar and a low ruffian to say iuch a thing and if it were elsewhere i would break your face tke lord chief justice asked whether mr mac donough bad seen the cae that had been recently before the queens bench in england of a military club where oue officer told another he was not sober and that officer a major retorted you are a liar and the club expelled the major in tho morning thinking as the court did the retort worse than the charge air mlacdonough said no doubt the english court of queens bench had decided with the club committee but the master of the rolls decided the other way the lord chief justice in delivering the judgment of the court said they always exercised a discretion in granting an appelcation of this nature and latterly language of the description used here had become more rare than in more chivalrous times they thought mr callans retort and retaliation were in exaggerated terms and if the court were to weigh these two gentlemen in the balance of justice they would zather hold that mr callan on the occasion sonsider ably preponderated this interchange of amenities oc curred in september last and after such a lapse of time end bearing in mind the fact that mr callan had called his learned friend not only a liar but a liar and not only a rufflan but a low ruffian they thought he now came into court with very bad grace and bo refused his ap plicationhull ate sigowthis annual exhibition of fat stock poultry and farm
