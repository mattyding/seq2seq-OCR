baistbrr roumelia commulzsothe following is a translation of the programme according to which the eastern roumelia commis uion is working it vas presented by ml de vallay and adopted by the commission   tho general discussion shall be divided into two parts the first theoretical upon the principles which shall guide the work of the commission  the second practical in which we shall determine the order of the subjects which the fundamental statute of eastern roumelia wiu embrace the principles upon which i should wish the work of the commission to be accomplished are the following pabar igeseral prmciplesa the arrangements of the treaty of berlin articles  and  shau find their strict application in the work of the commission which prohibits beforehand pro posals for changes in the text of the said articles and im poses upon itself the task of having the abovementioned trticles constantly in mind with a view to the elaboration of the fundamental statute of tbe province b conformably to article  of the treaty of berlim the laws upon the vilayets as well as the propositions made in the eighth sitting of the conference of con stantinople shall serve as a starting point for the work of the commission witihout however imposing upon it an obligation to abide strictly by them the commission considera itself on the contrary entitled to modifv them in all respects in which in the opinion of the commission they may not answer to the condition or needs of the country c the commission will esert itself to give to eastern roumelia an organization answering so far as the cir eumstances permit to the spirit which has dictated the in stitutions of the countries of western europe in order that the province may be able to associate itself with the move ment of modern civilization and participate in its advan tages consequently the commission will apply itself to in suring to the country in the most liberal manner   the security of persuns and property  independent justice prompt and impartial  a system of imposts and a financial administration agreeable with the ideas of modern economic science  institutions of credit as well as an industrial and commercial rqime suitable to the development of public and private prosperity s improved means of communication  the liberty and perfect equality of creeds with ax equitable xettlement of the relationships between the various religious communities and the state  a system of public education which respects the rights and interests of the various religious communities and guarantees at the same time intellectual scope to the population a liberal settlement of the questions of the press a just participation of all lasses of the poptlation za public life as well as a popular representation adapted to the needs of the country an executive authority strongly constituted but tevertheless under effectual controlil a civil administration which reconciles in an equitable measure the interests of the state with those of individuals d considering however that the politic institu tions of a western state however perfect they may be would be suitable neither to the needs nor the historiz de velopment nor the customs of the population that they would doubtless not even be understood by them and would consequently run the risk ef remaining a dead letter in many respects the commission does not mean to in troduce as such in eastern roumelia the institutions of any western nations but will apply its efforts to realize the programme developed in paragraph c by creating a work which should answer to indigenous wants and intellectual conditions e the berlin congress had for its mission the crea tion in the east of a stable balance by conciliating as much as possible the interests and conflicting claims of the various nstionalities who inhabit it and the creeds which are there professed inspired by its example the commissionwhile taking into account the legitimate rights of the majority
