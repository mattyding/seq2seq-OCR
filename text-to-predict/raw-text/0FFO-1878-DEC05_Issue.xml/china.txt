chinafro our coresrondbntshangehi ocr   the mixture of comnmerce and governmcnt of i jointstock capital and government loans of merchants and mandarins wlhich foimed the basis of the chinese steam navigation companvy seems to bo the model system adopted by the viceroy li and his party of progress in their attempts to introduco the scientific appliancos of europe into chinn why this should be so it is difficult to see for in the one great experiment made of the system it is fast leading to commercial ruin in a country likethis where oicial jobbery and dishonesty have ruled for centuries where the supreme efforts of the state are so to order and control its services that honesty in them sball be impossible the tradi tions of governmeent tee practicesof public offices and the morale of the oflicials are all thoroughly bad it is little to be wvondered at in these cir cumstances that tlhe assistance of the chinese government in any matter beyond its own proper sphere acts like a blight upon it to all official chinamen however tbe government is perfection and when li hungchang calls in its aid to further his pet project there is little doubt lie thinks it a mighty enginei his project of the great governorgeneral and of the clique of chinese officials who are knowvn as the party of progress is to develops the resources and wealth of the country by european methods and mechanical appliances above and before all however their cry is  china for the chinese and as far as possible they mean to pursue the end they have set before them with chinese capital chinese brains and chinese hands wvith their aspirations for their country one cannot belp having sympathy and this one can tender them without theslightest fear for the fate of englishmenin china in the fiuture for lhe manipulation of  chinese capital by chinese mandarins produces results which are fatal only to the subscribers of the capital the mainspring of lis dolicy and of the party wbich imay termi rbeyouni china party is not dislike of the foreigner but dislike of the rights which conferred upon him by the exterri torial clauses of the treaties hedge him in wherever he goes and whatever he does from the jurisdiction of the native officials these rights they hold tend to impair the sovereignty of china and tbere fore the sphere of forelgners action should he con fined as far as possible to the treaty ports to allow railways to he made by english capital and under english supervision li holas would be simply to allow little sections of england to pierce the empire where the rights and duties of the railway company and of its employes both english and chinese would be oenforced by english law admin istered in english courts whethier such a foot hold as that would it al eventually to what has happened in india no one knows or even speculates about but that it would infinitely increase the friction in the relations between the two countries and seriously impair the prestige of china as a power sovereigu within her own borders is the firm belief of even the partyof progress among chineso officials these fears are not groundless but the weak part of the position talken up by the young china party is their assurmption that the sovereignty of china would be more impaired by the introduction of enelish industrial companies holdingr material guaraniees or concessions than it is at present china has always been held to be unfit to have jurisdiction over british subjects residing or travelling there on account of the chaotic and barbarous condition of her laws that jurisdiction has never beon allowed her and although in all international dealings it is expe dient to assunme the fiction that she is a perfectly sovereign state as a matter of fact she is not and has not beon since the date of the treaty of nan kin be that as it may if the second section of the chefoo conventioni were loyally carried out anid mixed courts of chiinese and british officials appointed the extended intercourse with england which the introduction of english companies would induce would make little or no difference in the present relations of the two counitriesthe different schenaes in furtherance of the pro ject i have indicated wliich li and his clique of promoters have in hand at present aro an attemnpt at a monopoly of the cast and river navigation by a chinese company with steamers of foreign type tho scientific education of a large nmilnber ofchinese youths in the united stats  the opening i by a chinese company of coalmineos ironmines and ironworks the gradual introduction of rail ways and telegraphs  and the establishment of a postal systemn similar to that in eiropean countries the iron and coal mines are to be opened in tihe province of chihliat a place souie seventymiles from tientsincalled kai ping an appeal to the chinese public full of patriotism promises of at least  per cent and hatred of britisb trade has been issued asking for  taels and asay contributor of  taels is to have the privilege of nomi nating a clerk to be employed and paid by the conipany the most interesting and noteworthy event in connexion with this mining company is tho connexion of the mines by  railway  miles long with ihe river system of the province pre liminary surveys have been made and three english enpineers engaged so that li means to keep his word that when china wished to introduce railways she would do it her self i have it on good authority too that other lines in the north of china are in contemplation lis brother ii hanchan thel governorgeneral of hunan and hupei is also aiding in the work he has recently had the hupai irontields surveyed by competent british engi neers and intends to set up blast furnaces on the southern bank of the yangtze half way between hankow and einkiang the engneers and their escort wore pelted andabused by the oountry people wherever they went and finally after some nine months hard work robbed of all their oees and plans the hupei rustics seem determined to have nothin to do wvith foreigners and their machinery and liyanchang will have much trouble in carry ing out his share of the schemo of developmentthe latest of these schomes is the establishment of a chinese and foreign postoffice even in this apurelygovernmenttmatterthe conibinationofamer cantile comnpanywith official supervision is adopted asthe

but the foundation of our postal systeml weo have yet to oxtend it the ports along the great river the ports in the south and the cities and markettowns of the interior will have by degrees to be brouglht into the system our reputation being now widespread extension will be a simple matter japan and otber neigh bouring countries may one day be included and going even further aeld our offices may yet be found in america in eulrope and in every country of the west the inuence and the profit of the postal system will then belong to our own china and there will be no further fear of our revenues being filched or our influence diverted our hope is that our country will speedily be enriched our people benefited and that the prosperitywhich the chinese government postal system may attain to in future days will be based on the foundations we are now layingby the establishment of british postoffices at hongkong shanghai and other places it is asserted that the profits and influence attendant on these are diverted from china  an opportunity is now afforded to patriotic chinamen to further bhe in terests of their country and at the same time get  per cent for their monev nay more every subscriber for  shares will he allowed to nominate a postoffice clerk in england after centuries of appointments to the civil service by nominationwo have taken to open competition in chinaaftor  years experience of competition her modern statesmen have taken to nomination the value of the privilege of nomination can ozly be fully understoodby thosc who know the importance ofthe part in govornmont offices in china played by tho relatives of officials to commence operations withthe modest sum of taelsis askedforand the bylaws of the now postal department nalvely state that if more than that sum is subscribed the excess will bo distributed among the more import ant postoffices in order to bo used for remittances by monoyorders no attempt at improvement in ommumcationbetween the metropolis and thn pro vinces is to be made immediately durinr the summer correspondence between pekin andjien tsin is to be carried daily on donkey or horse back and during tho winter the mails are to go overland from chinkianz a journey in cood weather of atloast  days at all the ports and at pekin the foreign staff of the tmperial customs are to lend their aid to the scheme and this is the most bope ful side of it if reforms and improvements are to be introduced into this country there can be no doubt that the best channel for their introduction wouild be the foreijn cuxstoms staff its perfect organization and discipline would he a guarantee of eficiency its careful supervision a gunarantee of bnusfides nnd the intinacyaof its leading men with the chinese mlandarins would insure the reforms being carried out more for the benefit of china than to fill the pockets of foreigners
