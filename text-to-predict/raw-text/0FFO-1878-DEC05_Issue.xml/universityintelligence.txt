for a money payment thie commissioners allege in supdort of the uropiu to tal e away the priviege that the university and other bodies to wvhom the libraries belong are possessed of coliderall means and are well able to purchase anysiks which they naiyreouire the syndicate state that so far froru this leing the case ivth the university litrart the syndics have recently found it neces sary to appeal to the university commissioners to secure rn alditional grant of not less than ï¿½  year in order to maintain the library in a state of efficiency the privilege of obtainirg books under the copyright act is regarded by the university as one of extrwme valse inasmuch as it contributes to the formation of a liblrary perfectly general in character and unrestricted by the partialities of individual taste  aud as the aiumber nf books published every year is rapidly in creasilg it is obvious tbat th privilege is so great that it caunot be adequately represented by any compensation woatsoever by the evidence given bafore the copyright oummiiieers i appears to be admitted that the public will not relp ady advantage from the abolition of this pri vilge for mlr longusan in his evidence savs in pro portion to the cost of the edition the additiol five copies do not add much to the cost although they certainly tale away a cettain amouwt of the receipts  but the giving up of the delivery of four of those five copies could not have any iniluenee on the price at which a book is sold the syndicate are therefore of opinion that it is desirable in the intvress of the public both for the facilitation of research and for the doe preservation of copies of all works pallished in this country that the university sbould not bz deprived of a privilege which it has solong enjoyed and they recousmerd that in the prospect of ithe report of tho conyright jommissioners being made the basis of legisla tios the university should petition against any measure wlhich shtdl bave for its object the abolition of the privi tege in question the report is signed by the vicechan cllor tne master of emmanuel professors lightfoot newvton cowdell colvin skeat deivar n mi ferrers cais

present mode of keeping law terms at the inns of court report tihat they havo uade representations to the autborities of the several ins of court as to the inconvenience and evils arising to students of the university from the existing practice of keeping haw terms the syndicate also communicated with the authorities of the university of oxford who coneurred with them in maldng similar representations the syndi cate however regret to say that their efforts have not been attended with success and they are reluctantly obliged to abandon the hope of receiving a more favourable asmwer from the authorities from the correspondence it ap pears that the syndicate asked the benchers of the several inns of court to relax the present rule as to keeping terms which requires of members of the university to dine three times in every term and placed the following suggestions before the bencherst i in the case of a student of the university three or four law terms night be accepted instead of  and the number of days on which he is required ta dine in the hall of his lma of court during each of such terms increased as the benchers might prescribe the result of this would bo that a university student would keep his law terms durin the fint year of his residence in london after he has talen his academical degree and had really begun his legal training from such an arrangement he might derive both social and educational benefit especially if he were re quired while thus keeping his law terms to attend one or more of the courses of lectures given in the course of the law educational year see consolidated regulations  the imnits ol time for keeping the easter law term mnight be changed and made to exted from the th of april to the th of april so that the biilry and easter heqw terms might te irept in what is practically vacation at the ujniversity and a student by dining in the hall of his inn of comrt for an additional number of days during these terms be allowed to reckon as kepthisfour law terms in the year on the production of a certificate of his having kept by residence the academical terms during that yearpithe hat suggestion is strongly preferred by the syndi cate as they believe that its adoptiosn wouldbe of consider able advantage in the legal education of the studentsa joint committee was appointed by the four inns of court end unanimnously agreed to advise theorespective benches thae it is unadvisablo to accede to either of the al ternative suggestions submitted to them on behalf of tbe universities the joint committee added that those suggestions appear to assume that keeping terms at an inn of court is a mnere formality which in the case of students at the universities might ba almost entirely dispensed wvith this assumption is incorrect especially since the inns of court have established a course of legal education under ordinary circumstances a residence and study of the law for three years in london and an association during that period with fellowstudents preparing for the bar is desirable for every one who intends to become a barrister the committee are of opinion that it is not desirable to give students for thebar while in residence at the university any further facilities for keeping terms or to alter tho period during which they are now required to keep terms or the numrber of such terms this report was confirmed by all the inns of court and the syndicate attempted to reopen the question they stated that they  failed to perceive how the keeping of a term at an inn of court is incorrectly described as a mere formality or how the incorrectness of such an assumption is shown by the observation that the  inns of court have established a course of legal education they do not see how any  course of legal education  can be pursued by a student residing in london for only three days in a term at four different periods of the year one of such dsya beina generally a sunday the syndicato fully admit thatunder ordinary circtumstances a residence and study of the law for three years in london and an association during that period with fellowstudents preparing for the bar is desirable for every one who intends to become a barrister biut this is an advantage which the existing system has no tendency to secure after again press ing their previous representation the syndicate think it right to mnake twro remarks  it is for the advan tage of the legal profession not less than for that of the general pubil that candidates for the bar should be encoolragedi to obtainx university education  the inns of court like the unliversities themselves hold their great privileges for public purposes and the leading principle of their rulb n ought to be the advantage of those afficind by them this additional reportof the syndi cate was considered by the inns of court when the folow ing resolution was arrived at on the st nit that after considering the letter of the vicechancel lor and syndicate of the university of cambridge the joint committee are of opinion that st is not advisable for the inns of court to relax the established practice of re quiring the keeping of  terms for the bar in the accus tomed mode or to give any additional facilities for the keeping of terms by undergraduates at the universitylonbdonthe following are lists of the candidates
