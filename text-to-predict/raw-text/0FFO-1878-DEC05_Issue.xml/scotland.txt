scotlandedinbmurgh dzo ail blows the wiud tthat profits nobody whoever may lose by the fall of the city of glasgow bank the lawyers are likely to be large gainers by the catastrophe this seems to warrant the claim of law to be classed wvith medicine and perhaps also with divinity among the professions which profit by the ills that humanity is heir to it cannot be doubted that some at least of the lawyers who have accepted business in connexion with the extensive litigation which has already resulted from the failure must have done so very much on trust and their conduct in this respect certaialy entitles them to credit the agents of the imprisoned directors it seems havo claimed to rank as creditors on the estate of the bank and it is very doubtful whether this claim will be recognized ihe chaucesof the counsel and agents of the numerous petitioners who are asking to have their narmes deleted from the register of share holders being remanerated for their services with more than retaining fees must depend upon their being successful in their suits and that to all present appearances is a doubtful point but tbere is a class of cases in which the lawyers are perfectly safethose for example in which the petitioners are creditors of the bank and in which the bank or the liquidators are the respondents in these cases the gain to the lawyers will simply be an addition to the expenses of liquidation and will therefore increase the burden of the already overburdened shareholders it is well understood thac it is this consideration mainly which has led the liquidators to acquiesce in tho proposal that their delicate and laborious work should be carried on  under the supervision of the court they hope bv this means to check the vexatious and expensive litigation which at the very commencement of their labours has wellnigh paralyzed them a simple reference to the court for direction will now settle authoritatively many points which otherwise would have led to protracted and costly debates of the latter course there have been several strilking examples during the past few days it is not clear that all the points at issue in these cases could have been settled without resorting to legal process  but there is noreason to doubt that most of the minor cases which now await decision will be disposed of summarily under the powers of supervision which the court is now asked and authorized to exercisefour important and crucial cases have been dealt with by the court within the past week er two to the first of these casesthe demand made by the imprisoneddirectors for the acceptance of bail a demand wvhich was rojectedreference has already been made the second case that of  shaw v the city of glasgow bank turned on the question whether a trustee could divest himself of his responsibility as a cnn tributory by simply resigning his trusteeship and that after the bauk had stopped payment the third case that in which brightwen and co were the principal petitioners had reference to the demand for the appointment of an english liquidator the fourth case the petition of lalir and others for the rectification of the register is a testing case intended by arrangement to ascertain toe nature and the extent of the liability of trustees in several of these cases the same agents and the same counsel appear and reappeara proof of the allegation that the business of the scotch bar is praclically in the hands of a few favoured and successful advocates indeed it is said that the multiplied and cross edgagements of certain p leaders who could not of course be in two courts at the same time caused the postponement of the hearing of one of the most important cases for either one or two days another interesting feature of the scotch bar and bench was revealed by the second of the cases noted abovethe petition of shav the feature referred to is that of family connexion in that case the presiding judge of the three who constitute the division was lord moncrieff the lord justice clerk the leading counsel for the petitioner was the hon h y moncrieff lord aloncriefis oldest son the agent for the petitioner was the hon j w moncrieff vs another son of his lordship and tho leading counsel on the other side was mr balfour his lordships soninlaw in the brightwen case in which six different interests were represented six different legal firins were engaged as agents and  barristers as counsel at least ore half of these advocates rank as leading counsel at tho bar and every one of them i believe holds one or more briefs in connexion with the other bank cases before the courtin resisting the petition of shaw to have his name removed from the register on the ground that he had resigned his trusteeship hmessrs balfour and kinnear were led by their argument to anticipate the discussion of the general question of the liability of trustees their defence was that under the terms of the banks contract with its contributories the position and liability of a trustee did not differ in any respect from the posi tion and liability of any other shareholder and they quoted specific articles from the contract in support of this allegation the only way in which an ordinary shareholder can divest himself of his responsibility is by transferring his share or shares to some one else the bank does not regard such an abstraction as a trust as a shareholder it regards only individuals the fact of its refusing to contract with any but individuals makes it it was urged a matter of indifference to the bank whether any particular shareholder contracted with the bank for his own interest or for tiat of others whom he represented in short the capacity in which shareholders acted did not come within the cognizance of the bank if they were representa tives that was not an arrangement between them and the bankl but between them and those whom they represented the resignation therefore of a trusteeship or of an execatorship might cancel the latter arrangement but it could not in the slightest degree affect the former this line of argument it need scarcely be pointed out involves the whole question of the liability of trustees if trustees are liable personally it follows necessarily that the trnst estates whilch they represent are not liable escept by special and private arrasgementl if this view were affrmed by the court the pre vailing notions on this subject would be entirely upset the view generally held is based on the decision of the house of lords in the case of  lamsden v buchanan during the western bank liquidation and that view is that the trust estates are liable in the first instance and that trustees become personally liable only after the estates which they administer have been exhausted if the cuntention of the present liquidators be sustained it will be a bad case for trustees and a bad case also for the other shareholders of thebanlkbut the judges of the second division declined to give judgment in the case of shaw until the other eases involving the question of trusteeship shall have been debated before them this important question is therefore still held in eyancent least until the fourth of the cases noted above has been authoritatively adjudicated uponin the meantime the third test case that of brightwen and co has been decided adversely to the petitioners certain english and foreign creditors of the bank asked for the appointment of an english accountant as a fifth liquidator or alternatively as a liquidator in lieu of one or more of the scotch liquidators nominated by themeeting of shareholders held on the d of october this demand after the hearing of counsel on both sides has been rejected by the first division of the court of session at the same time it has been determned with consent of the liquidators that the voluntary liquidation shall be continued subject to the supervision of the court this it iscontended on the part of the respondents ought to satisfy the petitioners because it gives the court power on need being shown to do all that the petitioners now ask and even more for the court may not only appoint an additional liquidator butmay displac any or all of the existing liquidators and appoint others inl their place on the other handit is argued that thointerventionof the court in this way could only take plac on the appeal of adissatisfied crditor that thiscourse would beboth precarious and unduly expesivo and that itb woudbo emore satisfactory for all parties if this procedure were made the rule instead of the accidental exception this is a point on which much may be said and actually was sad on both sides but the decision of the court may te fairly accepted as proof that the arguments urged againstthe view of the petitioners wers the stronger in pointboth of law and of expediency one point which materially influenced the judges in their decision was the circumstance that the demand for an additional liquidator not only camo from a single section of the creditors of the bank but wa gqtually qpvosed by the bulk of the swotccreditors another important consideration was that the gentleman proposed as english liquidator thugh unexceptionable in other respects would have been without the jurisdiction of the scottish court more important however than either the petition or the verdict of the court upon it wvas the main gronnd on which the petition was su  orted as revealed in the speeches of counsea lir tra ers argument for the chief creditors messrs brightwen and co especially as elucidated by the lord advocates reply for thecontributories amounted in fact to a condemnation of the conduct of the liquidators in making a first call of no more than  per ï¿½ share thhis it was urged or was very plainly hinted was a temporizing policy it pointed to liquidation in the interest not of the ereditora of the bank but of its debtors its object was to give the debtors whos nominees the liquidators undoubtedly are an opportinity to vwork out their commercial salvation even though it were with fear and trembling why it was asked by mr trayner should a debtor who was worth ï¿½ and who might he liable for that amount not he required to pay up at once to his last sixpence i debtors of smaller means would of course bo ruined by a call of jï¿½ or of ï¿½ but they will be equally ruined by a call of ï¿½ per share there is much to be said for this contention from the point of view of the debtors every one knows of cases in which contributories will be able to meet the first call of ï¿½ and even a second and probably a third of the same amountcases in which it would be a positive relief to have this exicuse forgoing through the bankruptcy court at once in order to clear the decks for subsequent action what the ruined shareholders wishto do is to make a fresh start  snd in that view the sooner they are ruined out righlt the better for them since they must die they woiild naturally prefer to take their quietus at one blov to the prolonged agony of death by nches they might therefore with good reason plead for the summary process which mr traynor recommends but what the liquidators maintain and what the petitioning creditors do not seem to see is that the creditors as a whole would lose more by this course than the contributories would gain the lord advocate characterized the proposal as a counsel of  wreckage he meaut of course tbat if the shareholders were forced to rozlize their vhole assets at once the depreciation of stocks inevitable in any case would be much greater than it would be if only a fractionsay one fourthof their holdings were thrown on tlhe market at one time the best defence of the action of the liquidators is that by making a first call whicii is absolutely enormous though relatively small they have in fact consulted the best ultimate interest of the creditors while appearing to regard only or primarily the interests of the contributoriesthese were the views which chiefly influenced the judges in the decision at which they unanimously arrived but these were not the only views that weighed with them they attached nuch importance to the fact that the patitioners represented only one twentyfourth of the outlying debta of the bank while the representatives of the remaining  twentyfourths were either hostile or indifferent to the prayer of the petition another point on which their lordships gave forth no un certain sound was the iplea that the liquedators from their positions and connexions might be tempted to favour the interests of the oher scotch bank the lord president was of opinion that that was  not an illegitimate interest  this was said let it be observed not so much in the interest of the scotch banks as in that of the creditors on the ground that it was for tho benefit of all concerned that property should not in a case of th is kind be sacrificed by forced and hasty sale one of the most satisfactory results of this case is that it elicited from the lord advocate speaking for the liquidators a strong and unquali fied declaration that they were confident of their ability to pay every creditor of the bank in full but this confidence as both lord ldeas and lord shand pointed out depended on tho liquidators being left free to carry out their work on the same lines and under the same policy on and under which they have started it and at this point another difficulty arises the liquidators have so far been unanimous and harmonious but the demrand for a fieth liquidator a fifth wleel to the coach as the lord advocate described it means nothing if it does not mean that it was desirable to introduce a disturbing and opposing element into the liquidating council if the new blood thus infused were to represent anoverwhelm ing interest much might be said for it  but that cannot be said in the present case  and their lord ships therefore would not take the responsibility of introducidg what might possibly be disastrous discordno sooner has this matter been settled than another attempt has been made to change the present settlement i refer to the notice whlich has been given of a private bill to be introduced in the next session of parliament authorizing the settlement of the banks affairs by arbitration and appointing as arbitrator one of the judges of the court of session lixch may be said in favour of this proposal as a means of settling sunimarily and expeditiously points which are likely to give rise to much and perhaps protracted discussion it is plain however that it will be useless unless means are taken at the same time to arrest the ordinary course of litigation on the matters referred to the question of the liability of trustees for example is likely to be pronounced on by thn court of session before the proposed bill under which that question woold be referred to the arbi trator can possibly be paased the opinion is also entertained here that on so important a point tho declaration of the law by a court of judges would be more satisfactory thai the ruling for the nonco of a single judge however eminent there is some curiosity in edinburgh as to the real promoters of the new scheme  for it is not supposed that the london solicitors or the parliamentarv aaents aro mnoving on their own behalf anv scheme which would secure expeditious liquidation is entitled to fair consideration every saving of delay and of litigation will be a saving both of money and of suffering
