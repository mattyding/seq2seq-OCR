law reportsuprefie court of judicature deq court of appealsittings at lincolnsinn aefore the fastr of the doiasand lords justices jsues and thesgepsday v bowiggthis was an appeal from a recent decision of vice chancellor blalins the question being whether a man has any exclusive right to the use of the name by which he calls his house the plaintiff mr thomas day and the trustees of his marriage settlement purchased iu the year i certain property at ashford in middlesex caued the ashfordiodge estate consisting of a house with out buildings and pleasure grounds and  acres of land and tiiis estate has as the plaintiff alleged been imown as  asbforllodgo  for upwards of  years tho plaintiff alleged by his statement of claim that shortly after the purchase by the plaintiff and his trustees the defendant general brownrigg acquired from his father nowv deceased a small estate adjoining and in parts bordering on the ashfordlodge estate which consists of a villa together with the appurtenances and about nine acres of laud that the defendants property has for the last  years been called and known as  ashfordvilla snd hasen so described in all the legal documents relatingto the property  that in the course of the year s the defend ant for the first time without the knowledge or assent of the plaintiff wrongfully unlawfully and improperly changed rbe name and designation of his villa and estate and proceeded to cau it  ashfordlodge which name he had persistently used ever since notwithstanding the plaintiffs remonstrances the plaintiff then alleged that by reason of tho change of name by the defendant and his adoption of the name of the plaintiffs house the defendant hlas caused considerable expense and damage and extreme personal inconvenience and annoyance to the plaintiff and such inconvenience and annoyance was increasing that the defendant has by his conduct damaged the means of identifying the house of the plaintiff and his title thereto and the value of the property has thereby ceen greatly de creased the plaintiff therefore claimed an injunction to restrain the defendant from continuing to style or describe his villa or bouse as  ashfordlodge to this statement of claim the defendant demurred on the ground that the plaintiff had disclosed no good cause of action the vice chancellor overruled the demurrer and in delivering judg ment saidl that the demurrer admitted the truth of the statements contained in the statement of claim and pro ceeded tu condeam the defendants conduct as highly im proper the defendant appealedmr glasse qc and mr cozens hardy were for the defendant imlr higgins qc and mr seward brice were for the plaintiffthe masteps of the rolls said that so far as he was aware the vicechancellor had held for the first time that a man had an exclusive right to the use of any name which he chose to affix to any part ofhislandedproperty whether it was a house on the land or the land itself such a right was not known to the law but it had been suggested by the respondents counsel that the court had a power of legisla tion and that it would be a beneticial exercise of that power to create such a right his lordship disclaimed the power if such a right was to be created it must be created by the legislature independently of this his lordship could find nothing in the statement of claim to create the alleged right it was not stated that the de fendant had done the thing maliciously or with an intent to injure the plaintiff some epithets were employed which under the present system of pleading vere useless ind redundant they were merely epithets of abuse the statement of claim came only to tliisthat inls the defendant for the first time to the knowledge of the plaintiff changed the name of his house and had thereby caused inconvenience and annoyance to the plaintife and his visitors and friends but it was only alleged that this was a consequence of the change of name not that there was any intention on the part of the defendanr to cause it it was also said that the means of identifving the plaintiffs property would be damaged this was mere rhetoric but at any rate it was a mere consequence of the defend ants act it was admitted that the defendant had not attempted to slander the plaintiffs title no represen tation but the change of name was alleged the vice chancellor proceeded on the ground that the demurrer ad mitted the fact that the alleged act bad diminished and would diminish the value of the plaintiffs property with great deference to the learned judge an auegation of damage alone was not enough in our law in order to support an action there must be injury as rell as damage if a man built a wall on his ounland so as to destroy his neighbours view he might cause very great damage to his neighbour but if he had a legal right to build the wall there was do injury the two things must coexist damage and injuryto give a cause of action the plaintiff could change the name of his own house if he chose he might cal it ashfordhotse or ashford castle or the  old  or  original  ashfordlodge no authority had been produced for the alleged right and there wvas no good ground for it the demurrer must therefore be allowedlord justice jamezs was entirely of the same opinion damaze was alleged but no legal right was alleged which had been invaded the court ought not to interfere merely because it thouglt somebody was doing something not quite right towards somebody else and when a defend ant was advised to stop the oaction in limine as he had a perfectreight to do by demurrinlg to it and thus saving expense it was not proper that he should be exposed to the consequence of having allegations which he admitted to be true for the purposes of the demurrer taken to be true de faco so as to lay him open to moral reprehensionlord justice thesigssuj was of the same opinion hee thought the viehancelors judgment was founded on a misapprehension of the doctrine that where there is a wrong there is a remedy no legal right had been in vaded it could not bereasonably contended that the case stood on the same footing as that of a trademarlc there was neither principle nor authority for saying that there was any exclusive right to tho use of the name of real pro perty and if there was a legal right still there was no cause of action for it was not alleged that the defendant had acted wvith the intention of injuring the plaintiff or fraudulently or maliciously even if there was a slander of title it was necessary to prove malice his lordship could not see the smallest principle or foundation for the judgment of the vicechancellorlord justice james thought it right to add that the pover given to the court by section  subsection s of the judicature act s to grant an injunction in all cases in which it should appear to the court to oe  just or con venient  to do so did not in the least alter the principles on which the court should actthe masraz of the rollsit must be  just  as well as  convenientthe demurrer was allowed with costs and leave to amend the statement of claim was refusedlivem s v peachthe selstoncmixoo casethis was an appeal from a decision of mr justice hlawkins acting as vacation judge for the iaster of the rolls the plaintiffs are the occupiers as tenants to lord cowper of some allotments forming part of the common of selston in nottinghamshire which on the inclosure of the common wore allotted to his lordship on the th of july last the blaster of the rolls granted an injunction to estrain the defendants respectively from entering uon or damaging the surface of the allotment no  in t ie in closare awvard and from committing or inciting any other person to commit any other acts of trespass upon the same allotment or upon any other allotments men tioned in the award and in the occupation of the lain tiff on the th of october r justice hasvlins made an orderfor thecommittal to prison of william stop pard the elder one of the defendants for an alleged breach of the injunction the defendant is a labourer living in a cottage at selston and the evidence went to show that ho had incited other persons to trespass upon an allotment no  in the award the judge directed the order not to be drawn up for a fortnight and not at all if the defend ant within that time should make an apology in writing to the plaintiffs and pay their costs of the application it was admitted that the defeodant was unable to pay the ccsta the defendant appealedmir oswali for the defendant took two technical ob jectionsi that the order granting the injunction ougtlt to have specified all the allotments to which it was in tended to apply by their distinguishing numbers inthe award  that the injunction only restrained the com mtting or inciting to  other  acts of trespass on the auotments other than lno  c acts other than entering and damaging the surface and the evidence only went to showv an inciting to enter upon no the couvrt overruled these objectionsyxr oswvd then contended that the evidence was in sufficient to prove the alleged actsmr davey qc and mir elton for the plaintiffs wvere not heardthe mastvms of the rolrs said this was as vexatious and groundless an appeal as he bad ever heardvexatious because it was admitted the appellant wvas usable to pay costs and groundless recaise be had made no affidavit in eenial of the alleged facts and had submitted to the injunc tion in the first instance and theu he committed a most deliberate breach of th inijunction for which he had been very properly sent to prison by the learned judge the eviaence wvas direct cogent and clear and such as ought to have satisfied any judge as it did satisfy the learned judge from whom this groundless appeal was brought it was the duty of the judge to vindiuate the authority of the court in the only way in which it could be done the appeal must i e dismissed with costslord justice jaes was entirely of the same opinion tbe defendant had been proved by the most conclusivo evi denee to have been guilty of a most outrageous contempt of tlhc court the only fault of the order was that it did not order the defendant to pay costs as well as commit himlord justice tillsiger concurredthe ilssteu of the roltsi am afraid the arm of tho court is not long enough to reach the persos who are reaily moving in the matter
