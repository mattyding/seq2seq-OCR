professor monier wmlnxs on asonx vtanoprofessor monier villiams the boden professor of san senit deliveredl a lecture on afghanistan before the uni versity of oxford yesterday afternoone pre faced it by an accountcof the panjab end the cause whc ae to its annexation he stated his belief that our possession of the puajab made all the difference in the present position of affairs when our armies were sent in  to avenge the treacherous cabul massacre of the previous year they bad to pass through a turbulent country wbich did not belong to us now our supremacy was estaolished to the very entrance of the passes nay we could mse our former enemies the sikhs against their hereditary foes the afghans as we used them against the heahomedan mutineers at delhi trained by us the sikhs madethe best of sll soldiers addressing himself to afghesiistiin the professor said that al common name for the country was pasht or pashtbn whence the natives called themselves peastfitus and their languago pashtu those who settled in indiawere called pathfius for pashtfins afghanistan had been called the switzer land of asia but it presentedl a great contrast to switzer land albeit the ruins of great cities provedl its former grandeur it was at present an extremely poor moun tainous country with a sprse population of ive or six millions divided and subdivided into a confused medley of heterogeneous tribes wholly destitute of al national co hesion of townstherewereonlyfourcabulqft above the sea with a far colder climate in winter than that of englandcandahar so caled not from islkandar the great but from the gandharas ghazni and herat the people were partly nomad partly agriculttual there was no sueh thing as nationality patriotism or even real govern mnent every tribe and almost every man didl what was right in their owneyes the population was acongeriesof wholly or partially independent clans nominally subject to the ameer ofcabalbhut more under the control of their

vindictiveness brother rose against brother and olood feuds were rerpetual the right of avenging wrongs belodged to the individual the late bishop huilman was once examining a class of afghan children he told the best boy to choose his ownupon which the child asked for a tuiwar or sword every afghan was a born soldier trained from his childhood to the use of arms and from his youthl to rapine outwardly frank and hospitable he was at heart passionate v ndi y tive and treacherous no confidence could he placed in his word like all highlanders the afghans were in tensely proud and thought a great deal of pedigree thera vvere no good grounds for believing them to be of jewiss origin tohey were not more like jewts than the bombaypar sees their language pashtu whichvwasaryan end a kindof middle term betwseen persian and ilindi didnosupr the notion of their semitic origin mlet of nth better classes spokepersianaud the language of their religion was arabic the o tlahomedan reliion a t l tie which bound the medley of tribes together thsunnis like the indian ahomedans it was a mistae to suppose there were only twn passes from afghanstan into mdia used by armies the kuram pass had probabl been used by alexander the greetanth gouhiahmud of ghazni military authoritie mainainthattoprevent disturbances in india we should have to command the great gateways on both sides to do so we should have to occupy jellalatad as we have done quetta every advance seemed to in volve a pushing forward of the political as of the natural horizon no sooner swere we through the khyber and the bolan than we found ourselves confronted with the passes leading into afghanistan from turkestan that great central plateau wvas as little known to englishmen as the centre of africa yet it had been the nursery of the greatest nations of the earth what most concerned us was that already the whole of tuirkestan was practically underflusslan domination already according to pro fessor vambery has russia pashed her frontier to a point within miles of our territory already she occupies the ulpper oxus the lower course of which she is said to have just changed to its old bed and made to flow into the caspian sense as to enable her ships to navigate its waters almost to ths very borders of afghanistan already she is creeping onvrda from the south shore of the caspianin tent on occupying eerat and ultimately absorbing persa frusi ie s ao ssmio itentaal if noxt ra fsemibarbarous power her syvstem assimilates itself far more readily thanorto the present condition of the asiatic mind it is not overjust it is ne overpure it is not overvirtuous yet it brings with it the nanifest advantages of organuzed government and security of property hence russias ad vance is often welcomed in asia as a boon where ours is deprecated as a grievance and let us notbeblind russia is advancing true she has not yet permanently occupied ehiva and bokhara yet the khans of those places are as much under her thumb as the protectedstates of india are uder ours russian troops have already occupied samareand and will soon be pushed to lhtv and balkh once at lrerv it will be easy for them to march on herat through the pass formed by the herirud river once at balkh it will be casy for them to enter cabul by the bamian pass do we wonder that the voices of mas terly activity are foundat present to prerail  reams of paper may still be wasted on attempts to solve the centralsiatic question but one point must stand out sharp above the cenfusion of conflicting niews one stubbom fact must always be faced by every statesman who dreams of the final adjustment of scientifio frontiersnamely that nothing can prevent afghanistan and persia from crumbling to pieces between the advancing forces of two gigantic em pires like england and russia as soon might you expect two bushels of loose grain to withstand the pressure of two massive milstones the wvhole question realy resolves itself into one simple problem are we to occupy afghanistan and meet russia at the hindu kush oni the one side and then advancing into persia from the persian gulf on tho other draw a lino from the caspian to a point north of herat and say  thus far shalt thou go and no farther or are we step for ever at jellalabad quetta or perhaps candabar  vithout attempting an ansvrer to this question we may be allowed to express our fears that it will be found impossible to applythe fawsof social morality as between man and man and even the laws of political and international morality as between nation and nation to two mighty empires each gravitating towardls the ether with irresistible force and each intensely conscious thatsefpr ryatioldldsgv yogceas
