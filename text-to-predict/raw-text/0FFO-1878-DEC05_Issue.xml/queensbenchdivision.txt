qijeens bench divisioni btings sn bbaneo before iur justice mellor a ndi mr ijustice iaistytme new qay smutual insurance compay v jonmsthis case the arguments in which extended over four days was at length concluded it aroso out of a ques tion which has been for nearly two centuries not only a source of litigation but a subject of conflict between tho legislature and the judicature and latterly of great controversy among tho judicature them selves the question was as to the validity of one of those conditions which are common in insurances of mutual insurance societies and indeed havo long been common in au mercantile contractsthat au disputes shall be referred to arbitration the object of course is to avoid litigation and for that very reason as lord campbell said in the house of lords in the  leading case  on the subject scott v averythe judges who down to our times were partly remunerated by fees payable to them or to tneir officers were very averse from such conditions and declared them unlawful as tending to oust the jurisdiction of thocourtsin other words to deprive them of their fees so long ago as the reign of wiiam i a statute wvas passedat the earnest instance of the mer cantile community declaring that references to arbitra tion wvere very beneficial and ought to be encouraged anad enforced and making provision for that purpose the judges however notwithstanding this legislative measure put such a construction on it as to render it nugatory with reference to the most important class of referencesthat is stipulations to refer to arbitration disputes in future arising out of any contract or transaction jalf a century agoshowevertbheoldviciouspractice ofremunerating jndges partly by fees was done away with by ample provision for fixed salaries and pensions and some years after wards the judicature no longer having any interest in dis couraging these seferences the act of  and  william iv called  parkes act having been drawn by baron parke contained a general provision for enforcing all references to arbitration and as the judges of this court observed in s  there is nothing in the act to exclude future controversies such clauses  ie such conditions as in the present case to refer future disputes to arbitration  are very common and there being a prospective agree ment the act applies when a controversy arises and lord st leonards when chancellor in ireland held that the statute bad got rid of the old rule of law what ever it was worth nevertheless when some years after wards the question arose in the leading case already alluded to  scott v avery which was carried to the house of lordsthese decisions leing curiously overlooked both by counsel and the courtsthe judges still held fast by the old rule though some of the judges tried to evade the application of the rule by holding that the particular stipulations in question were not such as to oust the jurisdiction and of all the judges and law lords there vsas only one lord campbell who boldly denounced the rule itself and declared it to have been the result of selfinterest in the judicature when the common lavw procedure acts were passed in  there was a kind of compromise by an enactment that wherever there had been an agreement to refer future dlifferences and an action w as brought in violation of it the courtmight enforce it hy staying the action which left the old rule itself vwhateveor ts forec not in terms abolished so that judges were stillat libertytoadlbereto it of late years che quiestiou has often arisen as in the present case upno conditions so common in mutual  society insurances that losses shall be settled and adjusted bythedirectors and that no action shall be brought until such settlement with a provision in case of dispute fora reference to arbitra tion ltho last case on the subject three or four years ago wbich was in this court and which went to the court of lsrror and which we fully reported at the timethe case of  edwards v the aberyon mutual assurance society  the judges were very curiously divided in opinion in this court three judges mr justice blackburn mr justice leuor and amr justice lush held that the old rule of law did not apply and that the condition was valid and in the court of error though the judgment was re versed it was reversed ordy on the particular facts of the case and the majority of the court constituted of five judges cncorred on the main question vwith the judges of this court the lord chief baron and imr justice brett held by the old rule of laiw and nvere for reversingthe judg ment mr balron pollock and mir justice archibald were for supporting it and dir baron amphlettwhile con curring with this court in their views of the question was forreversing the judgment on the particular facts in this curiously perplexed state of the authorities the present case which was similar to the other came last week before this court constituted of the lord chief justice and mr justice mfellor and they having regard to the conflicting state of the authorities thought it fit that she case should be reargued if possible before three judges it was not however found possible to have three judges and the lord chief justice being unwell the case wsas reheard before the two judges who now constituted the court and had already occupied a part of two daysdir menelm digby was for the society who set up the condition for arbitration her brymner jones was for the defendant who contended that it was invalidin the result after a long argumentthe couret arrived at the conclusion that it would be better to abide by the opinion of the majority of the judges in the previous ease on the main question end to follow the opinion of the majority in the court of error rather than on their actual decision which turned upon the particular facts whereas their opinion was in favour of the former judgment of this court on the main question in controversymlr justice atretor observed that he adhered to the opinion he had declared in the former case and as it was confirmed by the majority of the judges he thought it best to adhere to it and to decide this case in accordance with the former judg ment of this court which had been reversed only on the particular facts the majority of the judges of the court of error approving the view taken by this court on the main question at issuejudgment therefore in favourof the societyrossiteic v pikethis was a case of some importance under the enactment in the salmon fisheries act of  section  that the proprietor or occupier of every fishery for salmon shall duringthe close season from the st of september tothtist of february  remove all obstructions to the free passage of fish the question one of very great importance to all millowners was whether this applies to obstructions caused by ordinary milldau  not put up for or used for the purposes of a fishery the case which has been repeatedly beforo the court bad arisen thus the appel lant afr rossiter is occupier of a w atermill called the teownmml at topsham in devonshire over the river dart where there is a ishery which however under the lease is reserved to the owner the wvater of the river is diverted into his mill by meyans of a weir constructed so many years ago that its origin was unknown in connexion with which there were  fenders or planks to be raised or lowered so as to regulate the quantity of water to be sent into the millrace this had many years ogo been used for the purpose of a fishingdam for many years however at all events since the milldam had not been used as a fishing apparatus or to assist in fishing and the ques tion was then whether it was a fishing milldam creating an obstruction within the cmeaning of the enactment the magistrates found that there is afishery at the place that the dam is an obstruction to the fish and that the miller is the  occupier  within the act and so they decided against him stating however that as theelfect of the decision was that he must close the mill for the greater part of theyearthe result wvouldberuinouslyto affecthim he appealed from their decision aud the arguments of the case lasted the greater part of the daymir c russell qc with him mr pitt lewis argued for the appellant the miller mr bompas qc with mr j paterson argued for the informanton the side of the miller it was urged that parliament never could have intended that millers should be ruined in order that salmon might be preserved and that this was not a fishingdam within the acton the other side it was argued that the act was passed to promote agreat object in ushich the public wore in terestedend that private rights must gtive wvayto the public interest tbat this was a dam capable of being used as a fishingdamthough it might not be so used at present and that so it was within the act in the course of the argumentmir justice biellor observed that according to the view of the justices a dam which had once been used as a fishing dam coulld never be divested of its character as suci and could never b restored to its character as a milldam in the present case the dam had ceased for  years to be used as a fishingdam and had been used only as a mill dam and ib was not denied that it was intended to con tinue so to use it and when the court considered the con sequences which would result from a contrary viewthatis that the miu would be  ruinously affected it woula dbe extraordinary legislation to effect such a result and the terms of an enactment must be very plain and explicit indeed to be held to have such a resultat the dose of the argumentsthe coupt gsve judgment in favour of the appelant setting asidle the convictionir justice muor said it appeared that ever since the act the dam had ceased to be used as a fisbingdamr and though he agreed that the object of the act was to preserve the salmaon lisheries he could not believe it was intendled to enact broadly that all milldams shouldi be treated as fishingdamas especially when sin the present case the resultwol be to ruin the millers the milfler here had for  years abandoned the use of the dam as a fishingdam and there was nothing in the act to compel the court to regard it as a fishingdam nor did the publio interest appenr to require it for if it should prove injurious to the fish it would he easy to apply under the act to the home secretary for an order to make a fish pass  to let the fish through on the whole therefore he thought the order should be set asidemr justice mbmsxsw concurred and so the judgment of the court was in favour of the miller the appellant to set aside the order of the magistrates
