sgyptfrom our coresondrntalexandria nov gmr rivers vilson arrives in alexandria to mnorrow and will at once proceed to cairo to take up his dutes his colleague m de blignieres has preceded him  ho arrived last week the khedivial decree of his nomination as minister of public wllorks has boee published in the lfuwiteur gpfiere and he has already called togother the government engineers and rmade them a meat littlo speech upon their duties it now eeems as if we were to havo other european ministers besides mr wleson and his colleagtue rumour persists iu stating confidenty that italy ccin tinucs to press for the pprtflio of justice and austria is said to be ready witlh aomodest request for the public instruction department as soon as italys claims havo been recognized these new deaands are looked upon with local disfavour the anglorench combination ia acceptod but any further extension of the international element is opposed mr wilson and his colleague knowv the oountry and have already worked together but in the other case wve should have mien new to egypt each convinced that his owvn principles of administration are right each eager to carry them out and neither inclined to give way to his col leagues representatives in his eyes of their respec tive oountries whom it wou d be a diplematic vic tory to oppose and defeat in order to carry their views into execution those newv men would want a small army oe emnplbos from their own country and it wou d be years before they would arrive at the experience already acquired by mr wilson and m do bignieres which makes thoso two gentlemen prefer to utilize native talent at mioderate salaries rather than get people from europe at higb rates totally strange to the lan guage and customs of tho east so we hope italy and austria will fail in their effort at influence in egypt their coming would only realize the truth of tie vulgar saying that  too many cooks spoil the broth as regards the two posts which are said to be asked the first the nministry of justice is under the direction of nubar pasha and it is no exaggeration to say that all italy could not furnish a man e competent to extend to the whole of egypt and all its inhabitants that judicial re form whichl the pasha has already applied to all mixed suits by the introduction oftheinternational tribunas three years ago as regards public in struction dor bety a swiss gentleman of great ta ent an admirable arabic scboar and an en thusiast for education is the director of public in struction and what he wants is plenty of money for his schools not a european chief who would only absorb a large salaryleaving aside the question wvhether mir wilson and mi de blignieres will or will not be ham pered by these proposed european colleagues it is worth while to consider a little in detail the work that lies before our two aidministrators very little is done at present european journals write in sanguine strain of the egyptian revolution and the great reforms that have been eifected i might just as well say that i havo written a letter to the yimes because i have on my desk a neat little pile of elean white paper tho path of reform has been cleared for these gentlemen no doubt the country has been emancipated irom turkey the endless calls from the bosphorus for backsheesh  have ceaede the palace intrigues of constantinople no longer dshike the mimsters at cairo the tribute is perhaps the sole link that remains the power to reform as well as the will is in tho hands of those who rule the state who aro not only backed by the public opinionl of europe but also by the fact that the two great wvestern powers have officially stated in the correspondence on the angloturkishconvention theirintention to urge w th earnestness the prosecution of those reforms vhich alone can rescue the khedives people froma misery and his financo from its present condition of profound embarrassment this hearty co operation will no doubt facilitate the work but the public must not forget that the work has still to be done and must be patient with those who have to do it many centuries went to the making of fnglish freedom and prosperity we must not grudgo a few single years to the egyptian revival fortunately though the subjects of reform are numerous the country is smal and compact the people are eminently docile diligent and intel ligent and the party averse from change has lost mnuch of its old conservative powerthe mere enumeration of the reforms of a press ing kind will justify my plea for patience i will take the recent budget the first budget of purely european authorship as a guide in the first place we are told there mtist be a deficit in  while the receipts are only eight and a half millions the expenditure must be close on ten and a half low prices and bad trade an excessive nile a wretched cotton crop barely half it was last year and very poor in quality aro unfortinate facts for the new regime butstill the egqilibrium must be found somehow in the future between receipts and ex penditure then we como to the details the first two entries on the receipt side are mouabalah and landtax which together furnish even in these bad tinmes four anu a quarter millions sterling the moukabalak is as readers of c times wellknow an aunal payrent by all landowners ivhich ceases in ss when at tho same time the landtax now paid will be reduced by onehalf a loss of revenue of between two and three millions will then have to be provided lor it was intended to be met by a decrease of public debt certain loans will no doubt be wvholly extinguished but the last coupon of the unified debt was only paid by an advance of a million and a quarter and bh the suspension of the one per centt whichl ought ta be paid for  the sinking fund we pass on to the landtar proper the grreat tax of the country it is notorious that at present there is no efllcient cbeck on the amount collected and the manner and time of collection on the contrary it might be said that the insertion of a  not in adam smiths great canons of taxation would give the best de scription of the egyptian system the suliectb of every state ought at to contribute towards the support of the government in proportiun to their respective atilities the tx wbich eaci individual is bound to pay ought t to be fixed certain or rell known to the contributor tames ought nit to be leied at the tiue or in the manner mosr convenient for the n tributor a taxiought not to be so contrived as both to take out andikeep out of the pockets of the people as little as poseible over and above what it brings into the public treasuryin this matter of landtax lies the most pressing need of reform it is melancholy to think how in season aud out of season these poor fellabs are harried and driven bad crops and falling prices low niles and excessivo niles cattle plagues and exhausting warsall these calamities hare visited the country but nothing seems to stop the rounds of the collector who comes armed wvith powers of persuasion that are well symbolized in the ancient hieroglvphics by a wliip of rhinoceros hide it is almost inoredible and yet it is fact that recently with all our liuropean controllers at the time when london papers were celebrating the salva tion of egypt the very peasants who were driven ont of their homes by the recent iloods whose animals and implements and houses were washed away wero persecuted for their arrears of taxa tin and byv way of contrast the day this in formation reached me there came also tho news that colonel gordon had remitted taxation wherever the river had not allowed the usual cul tivation the reason of the difference is not far to seek the territory of the english proconsul of central africa is not weighed down witb debt hungry eager manyvoiced bondholders do not weary him with their claims great banks have not jeopardized their very existence by advancing large sums on his bonds the credit of which they must now maintain at any sacrifice it is for these boudholders that the poor fellah has to bear his many burdens he has benefited little or nothing by the loans a few millions would have paid for the public works that have done him real good the money he pays away does not even stay in the country who can wonder therefore if he finds it difficult to understand that government is a great machine which all cheerfully maintain because it works solely for tbe common good  the changes which the new administration has to make in the landtan may be summed up as follows a careful survey of the land with an accurate estimate of the various powers of its production an equalization of tenure fair assessment an honest collection a vigilant and efficacious inspection and when all this is done a fair land settlenment at a low rate this is the measure of reform oar new constitu tional rulers must dispense the interest of the bondholders must be subordinated to the good of the country and both interests will be best served by this change in our politics our natural weaith is so great that we can pay fiveper cent on our debt and it is better in the long run to make that secure than to kill the goose which lays the golden eggs in the effort to get more i will go further and say it is even better to suspend for a time the payment of interest partially orevenaltoether rather than to incur fresh debt for the sake of a punctuality wfhich cannot be maintained out of honest revenuepersonal taxation comes next it realizes nearly ï¿½ but it consists of many vexatious im posts aind in a country so purely agricultural in its wealth it is worth consideration whether tlo landtax should not stand almost alone as the source of revenue one reform is absolutely mecessary the europeans who come here to make their for tune are eempt from all direct taxation some means must be found to bring them within reach of the revenne officer iu theqry they are bound to pay landtax if they are holders of land but in practice tbey often evade the charge while they are not liable to any other claim even in theory to effect this change the capitulations must be modified and it is a question whether those ancient conventions are not like some old houses where the best modification is their complete destructionthe heads of cnstoms rnilways and telegraphs i need not discuss they are already in the hands of european administrators and although the re sult of the new rgime is not as vet wbolly satis factory to the public we hope time will establish the permanent benefit of their changes as it has done already in tho case of the post ofice justice offers a formidable head of reform in the budget there is an excess of receipts over expenditure which ought to be devoted to a cheapening of law and an extension of the present courts at present foreigners and natives in all mixed suits have a good judicial system but natives in their disputes w ith each other and the pashas have only the old remedy of the village cadi and a native court of appeal where the influences and practiceos of the east are said to be as strong as ever one of the duties of the new administration will be to bring justice to the poor mans doors throughout the laud and to give him judges who will pronounce without fear or favour against pasha oficial or peasant and whose sentences will be fohowed by a rigorous erecution equality before the law is a condition precedent to any sense of citizenship and the habit of combination selfrule or orderly remonstrance cannot at present be looked for while our chlamber of deputies is a simple farcethore is one entry n the budget which is pain ful on account of its smallness it is the item of public instructionï¿½ when i tnrn to the details i fiid that ï¿½ goes to the expenses of the ministry ï¿½ to a aluseum of antiquities and yï¿½ to what is known as the egyptian mission by which xt few younm men are educuted it europe thus the miserahe sum of ï¿½ ia left fot the great work of education in more civilized countries where the value of education is recognized the people would find the means to buy tlheir own schooling but in egypt state aid for educational purposes is alimportant i should add that the whole of the grant is expended in the two capitals and the five millions of peasantry are left to shift for themselves the meagreness of this allowance for what is the truo foundation of all progres is brought out into the stronxest relief by the two preceding items of war and marine the first claims the enormous sum of ï¿½ and the second ï¿½ here are two just objects of retrenchment but the next that follows public works for which about ï¿½ is spent will not suffer any economical reduction and the saving on the army and the navy might all go profitably in the establishment of schoo s for the people large economies might however be effected at the various administrations ech of which maintains a smal army of einployes whose meagre pay is too often suppletfented by irregular perquisites which infallibly lead to the defective workim of the de partment the reduction of the civil tist
