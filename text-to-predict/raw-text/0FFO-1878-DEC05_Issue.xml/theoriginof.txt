tes oxuign of cometsin is theory of the development of the solar system kant derives tho comets from the substance of the condensing solar nebula he regards them as really planets which through some dis turbing cause have been forced out of their normal orbit od the other hand la place in working out his nebula hypothesis supposes comets to be formed of matter dis persed throughout the regions of the fixed stars and that their origin has no relation to the solar nebula are we in possession of facts which may warrant a positive de cision between these two theories  this inquiry has re cently beea studied by professor newton who in a recent number of the american journal of science and arts first indicates the consequences of the twvo theories with regard to form and distribution of the cometary paths and then compares the actuaby observed paths of  comets the former are represented by the author in two graphic curves ansd when the results of observation are put into the same form it is at frst found that the curve thus had differs from both the theoretical ones as howvever the known comets all have their perihelion that part of their orbit nearest the sun within the orbit of mars and axe exposed to planetary disturbances professor newton calculates the influence of these disturbances and arrives at the result that the carve corresponding to the actual cometary paths is thus brought into good agreement with the theoretical curve deduced from la places hypothesis whereas it does not so agree with the curve from kants hypothesis thus the origin of comets it seems must be placed in interstellar spaceearthquae in scotlnqdan earthquake o curred on tuesday mnorning at balnacara and other parts of the districtof loch alsh on the west coast of tho county of ross opposite the iie of skye the shock was very marked the tremulous motion of the earth being distinctly felt and the houses shaking violently at bal macuna the shock occured at  clock and at pllcton five miles distanlt betwveen l and
