pablrliaabnvj out of sbssiovmlr j g talbot mp speaking at the edenbridge fat stock show last evening said that we were now for the first time for many years actually engaged in wara war which if it was mot right must be very wrong of course the question whether this wvar was right or wrong was one which he felt partook somewhat of a political character he was sorry that it should be so e thought he had better not go imto its causo nor seek to enlist their sympa thies in any way on either side of tho ouestion but this much he might be permitted to saythat it would be un wise of any one however strodg by his political feelings might be excited to suppose that the government of this country composed of wvhoever it mightg bs i would voluntarily eater upon any war unless the justificalion of the cause seemed to be overvwhelming to suppose that  or  gentlemen who were charged with the lugh offica and the responsibility of advisers of the crown would rash into wavr merely for the sake of their own selfaggrandizemeet seemed to him as preposterous a statement as could well be made mr talbot also spoke of the condition in whichwe found the agricultural prospects of this country it was tolhim ratherremarkable that tho countyof kent should have been selected as tha arena for this particular contest for ho had always felt that there was no part of the south of england where the condition of the agricultural labourer had been so satisfactory as in kent it was not the fault of the labourers themselves but because they had been taught by others that their interests were nut being con sidered if the labourers had been left to them selves they wvould have been in the great majo rity of instances satisfied he would be the very last to vish that the vages of the agricultural labourer should go down one penny below that which they fairly couldfiearn  but he felt that in times of depression the labourer shouid share the depression vwith the farmer the same as when profitsl where high he received higher wages he would like any of those labourers or their sup posed friends to try and farm at a profit at the present day sir charles mills and lord lewisham also spoke supporting the views expressed by mtr talbotmr holt blp speaking last night at nelson said that ho looked upon the afghan wvar as a deplorable necessity but we must secure our northwest frontier in india he did not think that the government had exceeded their duty or overrated their responsibility he believed that they had done right in calling parliament together and that they would obtain a large majoritymr bulwer qc and blr cobbold the members for ipswich attended last night the annual dinner of the ipswich and suffolk licensed victuallers protection as sociation mrbulwerreplying to the toast of thearmy navy andauxiliary forces said we hail forces upon which we could rely to keep our glorious possessions secure but he had read aud it made him feel ashamed to think that in this country there could be found men who whatever their opinions as to the justice or injustice of the afghan war could stigmatize as assassins the brave men who had gone forth from this country to perform their duties and obcy orders andcould prayto thegod of battles that those men might not be successful in their erranld against the enemy he hoped that such sentiments would receive no response and no encouragement among his countrymenat a dinner last night in connexion with the opening of the new conservative club at scarborough sir charles iegard mp proposed a vote of confidence in the govera ment in seconding which mr denison mp said the point they bad to keep in view was whuther it was possible for the government with the nowledge they had to permit russia to go on intriguing
