appointment of khaireddin pasha more particularly is an event of some importance by birth he is a circassian but of what tribe he does not himself know he was brought at an early ago to constantinople

express himself in arabic or french when he speaks the latter tongue his hard foreign accent does not pre vent great iluency and remarkable lucidity of ex pression ho was formerly prime minister to the bley of tunis and first became known to the sultan by a small book recommended to his majesty by one of the ulemabs in which he endeavoured to prove that modern ideas of liberty and progress are not at all incon istent with the cardinal principles of islam as contained in the koran and expounded by the most learned doctors of the law and that contrary opinions on this subject proceed from ignorance or errodeous interpretation of the sacred writings lie thinks that if turkey is to be regenerated it must be done by mlussulmans themselves in accordance with the principles of their own religion and that the clergy must be induced to take an active part in the work once in the course of conversation with him i ventured to suggest that it might be difficult to reconcile reforms conceived in an exclusively mussulman spirit with genuinely liberal principles in a country containing a large nonmiussulman population his excellency ad mitted the difficulty but considered it by no means insurmountable for islam enjoins iustice and good governmmet for men of all creeds and does not prevent men of other reli gions being placed in those positions of adminis tration for which they are peculiarly fitted the reslization of lhaireddins ideas would necessitate anincrease of the politicalinfluence of the ulemahs but this would not be at least for some time such in serious danger as might be imagined for theupperranks of the clergy here are farmore enlightened and liberal than is generally sup posed whatever we may think of his views khaireddin has at least individuality and energy and thereby forms a strildng contrast to his imme diate predecessors in choosing him in spite ofstrong opposition among the official classes the sultan las shown considerable personal initiative and firnness of purpose the cabinet will doubt ess take its tone from the grand vizier all ithe more as be is known to possess in a very high tdegree the confidence of his majesty and we may now expect a vigorous effort to inaugurate a period of important reforms an imperial ratt contain ing theprogramme of reforms is expected to be promaulgated in a few daysturkey and englandpeste dec important negotiations said to be going on between the british ambassador and the porte or rather the sultan form the subject atpresentof town talk in constantinople forsome timepast a rumour hasbeencurrentthat thegreatbarracks at scutariand ilaydar pasha are being swept and prepared for the reception of british troops according to the on dits the diecovery of a miahomedan conspiracy was to serve as a pretext for this measure which was devised for the purpose of meeting the possible emergency of difficulties arising about the with drawal of the russian troops it is scarcely neces sary to point out the futility of these conjectures based on the fact of the scutari barracks being put im order the two regiments which could be quartered in those barracks would hardly count much either in case of a mahomedan rising in the capital or as a means of pressure on the russians these reports however indicate the general feel ing onthe part of theturks that england is carefully guarding against ail possible eventualities and that negotiations in view of certain contingencies  are in course that the turks themselves are notaltogether reassured about the futuro is proved by the activity with which they have set to work to complete the defences of the tchataladja and bulair lines and to arm them for which purpose the siege guns brought down from the quadrilateral are mainlyused it may be one indicationthat the nego tiations between england and turkey of whatever nature they be are progressing favourably that a turkish loan of � under english guaran tee is being talked of as security for this loan the tribute of egypt the revenues of cvprus and a portion of the revenue of syria would be pledged the first however being already pledged for the guaranteed loas of  and  a por tion of the loan would be employed towards re deeming this pledge by a sinking fund the rest being applied to withdrawing the paper money to paying the first instalment of tho indemnity to rnssia and the first costs of the reforms to be introduced in asia in this direction again con jecture may be far outstripping fact the leading idea howevernamely that a disposition exists on the part of the english government to lend a helping hand to enable turkey to take tho first step out of her financial difficultiesmay be quite correct it would only show that it had been con sidered

have been dropped altogether or reduced to the actual coststhat is about f as for the terms of paymentthe sum of  roubles is to be paid in yearly instalments of  the first payment being simultaneous with the complete evacuation of turkish territory the evacuation is to be carried out at once and completed with the shortest possible delay and at latest within the tbree months stipulated by the treatyof sanstefano thepointstill pending is that concerning the territorial cessions to montenegro in connexion with this russia wants to have in serted in the definitive treaty a declaration binding the sultan although in answer to repeated im portunities on the part of russia and to friendly advice tendered by the other powers the turks have already often declared their willingness to comply with the demand as soon as that can be done without risking a collision with the albanians they would probably not have much objection to repeating that assurance again one misgiving however which the turks may have about making a special declaration to this effet in the convention with russia is that it would be conceding to the latter power in this matter a kind of exceptional position in comparison with the other signatory powers which is somewhat at variance with the fact that the territorial cession to monte negro is recognized in the treaty of berlin as one of the points in the treaty of san stefano wbich are of european interest and which therefore russia is not competent to deal with separately still the fact that the turks have entered into negotiations on this point with russia seems to indicate that they do not anticipate any objection on the part of the other signatory powers provided the declaration demanded by russia is couched in such terms as not to prejudice their rights all the other powers indeed are not less anxious than russia that ontenegro should get the terri tories assigned to it by the treaty of berlin podgoritza spuz and zablajak on the lake of scutari should especially be surreadered as soon as possible not only becauso thereby another stipulation of the treaty would be fulfilled but russia would also at the same time be deprived of the principal grievance she has to urge against turikey mluch of course must depend on the form in which the declaration is given and it is on this point that the negotiations do not seem to proceed harmoniously the matter at issue is whether the declaration is to be given simul taneously with but separately from the treaty or whether it is to be annexed and incorporated with it as an additional stipulation and further what tho precise wording of the declaration itself is to be no doubthowever seems to be entertained that this last difficulty will somehow or other be over come and the hope
