cypr usfrom our corresrondpniptnicosia nov the jumna sailed yesterday from larraca with the d reiment on board for gibral ar i he regiment was brought from kyrenia to larnaca by the uunmber in two detachments the first detach meot upon reaching larnaca being landed and en camped to await the arrival of the jumna and the rumber in her second trip calliug at papho and bringing on thence the two remaining com panries oi the regiment this fine bodv of men soems to have found little better he lth in the in terest arid excitement of preparing for embarca tion than in tho most monotonotus days of their encampment  and i fear that the predictions of those nwho said that the pleasurable bustle of depar ture together with the setting of the eyes towards a change of scene was all th lt was required to re vivify the men and enable them if necossary to march to larnaca would have encountered had the trial been made a fatal falsification on the morn ing of the embarcation of the first detaclnient tht is to say last thursdav fresh cases were sent to the hospital thc men even the sufferers wvere in happy spirits and the day was beautifullv cool and bright and so this fair and strange spoteautiful wvith a blue frontage of mlashing sea and des ahle above all others for its dark green shelter of clustering carob trees and the equable coolness of its constant breezes bade the d regiment a farewvell as it bade them a welcome mingfing themystery of an invisible poisoll with the open sweet  ness and serenity of its parting smileit is understood that the st regiment which with two companies of royal engineers now forms the garrison of cyprus wvill be removed within a few weeks the orontes bringing the st battalion of the th from halifax nova scotia to take their place and conveying them to gibraltar where they will bh stationed for a short while before their return to ngland the garrison of english troops in the island willhereducedit is be lieved before long to a single wing of a regimenmi think it cannot be doubted that questions re garding the international staus of cyprus in its relations with the ottonran government must soon arise and call for definitive settlement the sovereigutv of the sultan over cyprus has it would seem from lord salisburys despatch of the th of mlay last been left unimpaired it might be hard to define the precise signification of the term sovereignty in this respect but a coextensive range of legislative and judicial power wnust be estimated as an attribute of sovereignty the sultan has certainly divested iiimself of legislative powers over cvprus hut i imagine he would less readily grant that he had dorne so in regard to the judicial authority of hs government theo ttrks owing in part to circumstances connected with their customiis and their laws seem to be a litigious people the equal division of property among the children and the perplexed sort of tenure by which the land may belong to one owner and the trees on the land to another are causes which alone tend so strongly to the generation of family difficulties and contestations at law that a peaceable partition of inherited property aniong the children of a family would seem to be exceptional before england assumed the government of cyprus a person resid ing in constantinople who desired to sue his brother or sister residing in cyprus would have proceeded with his suit in constantinople and a court of law in constantinople would have issued a citation to the opposing party to be served in cyprus i bear that this practice has not ceasedand although i beliove no difficultv of contested jurisdiction has as yet directly arisen tne creation of such n difficulty in the circumstances must be merely a inatter of time it seems quite certain that in reardto this question a wise provision for the good government of cyprus will require a re nunciation by the porte of any desire for the exe cution of judicial authority from constantinople over inhabitants of cyprus turkish subjects though they ipay be any one in cyprus imovws by what means favourable judgments are obtained by lexterous suitors from turkish courts of law anl there is further that faimous ipstrument a vizirial order issiiing from constantinople used to arrest proceedings to annul judgments and to cancel executions in the provinces the efect of which upon the administration of justice throurhout the empire has been as calamitous as its validity has been doubtful the success of a law suit or a petition at constantinople has been accustomed to depend not upon toe predominance of any legal points or upon proofs of fact or upon the reten tion of clever counsel but upon the sagacious sse of meaus made either in a personal expedition to constantinople or through one of the many agents who arrange these matters for their provincial clients it is a constantly occurring plea in peti tions for justice a plea of blind good faith unconscious of its utter moral obliquity that an order or a judgment obtained at constantinople which was afterwards overthrown was obtained only at such or such a heavy cost the plaintiff will piteouslytell you how he left his wifo and family and journeyed to constantinople and spent two months there around the offices in company with a valuable armenian agent and secured at last an expensive piece of justice when lo  some time after his adversary went on the same voyage and then ibi oemiseffusus habor atque immutis rupta tyrarn fnedcrayit is unnecessaiy to point out how impossible itis that any rude powvor so illfamed so distant i and so uncertain as this judicial authority at con stantinople should bo permitted to inteifere with the delicate balancing of the new scales of justice which the british government is seeking to set up in cyprus before the eyes of the wotld for the benefit and education of the turkish peoplethe ease or the trouble of the solution of such questions as these arising in cyprus will not only command attention on account of their intrinsic importance but will attract many eyes that care to apprehend in small examples some sign of pro phetic import touching the future of the reforms ofsia minor turkish pride is very loath to let loose from its hands any part of the reins of power and the first evidence from the sultan of a sin cere desire for the practical effectuation with out reserve or hindrance of the changes which havo been accepted in theory will be anxiously awaited and gladly welcomed it cannot bo doubted tpat tho main motive power which is wanted to introduce satisfactorily and to keep in efficient workingorder thopromised machinery is not the formal expression of tho will of the sultan or any number of his majestys jimperinl orders or any vizirial instructions to governors of vilayets but theosilent and less showy evidence of a spiritof goodwill towards the new method of admninistration and of a desire that all the officials in the empire should be loyal to it without the diffusion of some such feeling as tbis all the formal forces of govermment will be of little avail in any circumstances turkish officials from the highest to the lowest will be placed in a posi tion of extreme doubt and difficulty uinder the new system it will take some time to assure them of the permanence of the altered administration and the safety of relying upon it they will require some clear certain and constant expression of the sentiments of the sultan before they will recognize the chadgeas acceptable tohimandbanish fromtheir thoughts all idea of seeking to conciliate the affec tion and please the pride of their sovereign by secretly countermining and opposing the authority of those whom without good assurance to thei contrary they will be disposed to regard as usurpers of his authority it has been possible to perceive in cyprus signs of this sbtat of mind of doubtfu and divided allegiance among turkish officials and i do not think that the influence of any word oract of reassurance coming from constantinople to quiet it can be so easilytraceditoldyousometime ago of the attempt at interference nith a turkish official in our service giving evidence before tho land commission which nas made by an official wsho was present in cyprus as a personal agent of tho sultan to look after private property of his majeosty i have also told you of the purchase by thae sltan of a niece of property in thle district ofd ppho near chrysokbou the sultans agerntirig ssistance in the management of affairs relating to this property instructed a turlkish clerkl in the english service in the iand registry department to leave his office for a time ancfvislt the property and the clerk aunounced to the civil commissioner of nicosia that his obedience being owed to the sultans agent he was about to folowv these instructions ia such circumstances there was of course no alternative but to dismiss the clerk aud to fill his place with an official wvho was prepared to obey the english government in whose service he was and from whom he drew his pay it is needless to point out how small cases of friction snch as this may be either exasperated and increased until the machine of honest government ceasing to work must be taken to pi ces and built ni afresh in atuother form or how easilv the trouble may be smoothed awvay entirely by the wise exercise of the authority aind injuenoe of the palace and tho porte surrounded by crowds of official whohave fattened upon misgovernmuent the sulian and his advisers hve a work of incomparsble magnitude to master but there is reason to hope that with reasonable time and honest endeavours they will prove equal to the burdenit is proposed by sir garnet wolseleyto establish in the districts of the islaznd dispensaries for the psor where medical advice and assistance may be obtained freo of charge and drns may be served out at as cheap a rate as possible at prasent there are hardly any medical practitioners here at all one or two in xicosia and one or two in larnaca and limnsol complete the supply and he people m consequence undure an amount of suffering from ailments which might easily be prevented affec tions of the eye are in some parts of the island notably it is said in the district of kyrenia very comluon and are attributed by the peaple to the excessive glare of the sun and the prevalence of dust throughout the long summer the concern which will be shownforthe welfare of the people in the appointment of medical officers to aid them will be a polverful influence in establishing the popularity of our rule aulong the poorer classes and wvill in other ways be of immense benefit it will be made the dutv of the tnedical officor of each district zo see to the vaccination of the inhabitants and to keep a careful watch for the abuse of sanitary arrangements and their time swill also be most usefully occupied in collecting statistics upon aul subjects conneeted with their professionit is undurstood that sir george hlcliot mp who recently visited cyprus in company with the first lord of the admiralty and colonel stanley wvill send engineers to famagusta to report npon tfhe prospect of dredging the harbour and adapting it to the accommodationi of large shipsthere are still no signs of coming rain and uneasiness at the prospect of a drought or of an insuficient or too late rainfall is beginning to make itself felt a prayer for rain is hung out on a large placard from the minaret of the mosque of st sophia in nicosia and the price of grain has already risen considerably the present moon has but a few more nights of life and it is hoped fhat the new moon will be a rainy one should it be otherwise the hopes of the people will grow slenderer and the miahomedars will resort to their final invocation they will go out together in smuall bodies from the town and will gather little pebbles and cast them into water into the wells and aqueducts hoping thereby in some mute way to bring down rain tlere is still time left for the rain if it comes before long to do good but should its fail be much delayed it will come it is said too late to be of service
