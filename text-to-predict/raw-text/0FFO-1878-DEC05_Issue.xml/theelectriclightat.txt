giving alternating currents and single lights for lighthouse use secondly he referred to the dynamoelectric machines producing singlo lights for gencral industrial purposes as well as for light houses and including the siemens and the gramnme ma chines ia his third group the anthor included the machines usedaor producing dividd lights each group in dicating a marked period representing a clearly defined stage of progress in electric lighting wvith regard to cost mr shooltred stated that in every instance his figures and particulars were those afforded by the users of the various lights and not by the inventors or their representatives in the case of thio holmes machine the annual costperlighthouse was about � inclusive of interest repairs and wages with the siemens mactine the annual cost was about � per lighthouse including interest and the other expenses yith the lliance machine as used at ha re the cvst was about � per annum per lighthouse interest re in cluded the singlelight gramme machine has been in use in the paris goods station of the northern of france rail way for two years six machines have been keptgoing wvith one light each and the cost is found to be fi per light per hour or with interest on outlay at  per cent sd per hour tho same light at the ironworks of mlessrs powell at rouen wvas stated to cost dpvr light per hour exclusive of interest and charge for motive power the latter being derived from one of the engines on the works in  a series of experimeuts vere carried out with thelontin lightat theparis terminus ofthe parislyons and lieditorraneannrailway the passenger stationwaslightedand the resultswere so satisfactorythat the company havo entered into a pernmanent contract with the proprietors of the lontin light for lighting their paris goods station with  lights at a cost of d per light per hour the western of france railway company have had six lontin lights in the goods station at the paris terminus st lazare smce liav

f per hour the electric illumination hoe over is considered as equalto gs gas jets or about duuble the original illuminationthat is to a cost of tf per hour as against sef for the delctrio light the cost of which therefore is  times that of tho gas the contract for lighting by electricity was ter minated by the city of paris on tbe th ult and the authorities have declined to renew it except at the price paid for gasnamely f or about gs per hour and that only until the th of january next these terms havo been accepted by the socit so that the price paid to them will be at the rate of about lad per light per hour mr shoolbred stated that the socid place their expenses at oolf or just lid per light per hour which however they hope shortly to reduce by onehalf a series of careful photometric experiments car ried out by tho municipal authorities with the jablochkoff lights above referred to sbowed each naked light to possess a snxinsuma of  candles of intensity with the glass globe this was reduced to  candles showing a loss of  per cent while during the darker periods through which the lights passed the light was as low as  candles theforegoing were the only autbenticated particulars which the author could ob tain as regards the working of the various electric systems of electric lighting in condlusion mr shoolbred re ferred to tbetapieff light at the isms office whicb be observed wvorkedfairly and wvith regularity which could not be said of all others and it might therefore be en titled to take rank as an established application of electric illumination the paper was illustrated by the siemensrapieff serrin and other forms of electrio light which were shown in operationbravuxythe following cases of saving lffe in several of which great gallantry was displayed by the rescuers have just been investigated by the committee of the royalfnhuane society whicb has bestowed the usual rewards for the services rendered on the recommeoda tion of the field mfarshal
