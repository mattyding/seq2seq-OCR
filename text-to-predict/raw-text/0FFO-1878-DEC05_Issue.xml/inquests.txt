john nolna aged s  late prisoner alleged to have resulted from harsh treatment received while an inmnate sir william henry lyyatt chairman of the committee of visiting justices was pre sent with captain belby the governor of the prison mr bisch solicitr again attended on behalf of the friends of the deceased mr mead barrister represented the trea sury att the reopening of the court the foremanon the part of the jury objected to the presence of the governor while any other witnesses were under examination and ultimately captain helby retired under pro test sir william henry wyatt deposed that he was the chairman of the committee of visiting jus tices under the now prisons act he had had con siderable experience in prison management from their present position under the new law it was his opinion that the committee or visiting justices were without power to be of the slightest protection to the prisoners very shortly after the new act came into operation the justices at a meeting discovered that the governor had been as they considered overpunisling prisoners by con fining thm beyond a period of  hours on bread and water sir william then read a letter he had written to thehome secretaryatthetime calling attention to the circunmstance of the governor having punished seven men by keeping them confined in cells on bread and water for two days contrary as the justices considered to the d section of the act the reply supported under the th section of the act the proceedings of the governor the justices therefore felt that thev were powerless to protect a prisoner and could do nothing further the coroner said it was a part of the dutyof the justices to inspect the food sir w b wyatt said they invariably exammned the meat flour and bread c when they met once a fortnight on one occasion they condemned the bread but found it of no use as no notice was taken of it the governor seemed to bave supreme control but by the a ct of s he considered it was the duty of the governor to report to the jusices any cases of complaints or extreme punishment he did not know how often the commissioners under the new act were bound to visit the prison bat he knew they had mot done so from last april to august about  prisoners passed through the prison in the course of a week and of that number the mumber of complaints reported to the justices did not average four a week mr miead pointed out that the th section of the new act gave the justices power to report to thesecretarytof stats abuses they might discover in the prison sir w  b wyatt said they were unable to do so when reports were not made to them they did not go round and ask the prisoners in the cells for complaints the bread had been better lately be considered the spirit of the act prohibited the governor from punishing a man by putting him in a punishment cell on bread and wvater for more tban two davs be had himself ob jected to the governor putting a prisoner in hand cuffs a governor had no power to order a man to be doggedwithoutthesignature of two justices witness was notawarethat that punishment had been inflicted wvithin the last three months other punishments were inflictedunderthe authority of the governor and the medical officer prior to the new act the visiting justices had supremecontroloverthe government of the drison at present they had no control over the officers and in a recent case of illtreatment of a prisoner by an officer who would have been dismissed the latter escaped in answer to the coroner sir nz ifwyatt said he considered this investigation a most important one as at present he was convinced that prisoners could receive no protection from the visiting justices dr smiles was recaued and ex amined as to the number of prisoners he refused to certify as beig fit to undergo punishment but he was unable to don so what be mesat by dispensing his own mcdicines was that ho made up large bottles and his officers distri buted the medicines in accordance with his directions uaptain alfred prowsee elby usthe governor of the prison was next xamined be said he had held his appointment since augustlast he rememberedthe deceased nolan teing brought before him for bad conduct and his orderinghim to bepunished by bread andwater diet sometimes as many as  or  persons were brought before him in a day by the warders if he found indications of illhealth he referred the case to the medical officer to testify if a prisoner was unable to bear the punishment in cases of repeated misconduct he occasionally trought it before the justices in order that punishment might b in flicted beyond what ho as governor hadpower to orderunder the act be could not say how often the doctor certiiied a prisoner as unfit for punishment there vere punishment cels and a dark cell without light be had power to con demn a prisoner to that cell for  hours bat no power to flog a prisoner or place him in irons considered he had power to order a prisoner as punishment to his cell on bread and water for thlee days james phelps a former prisoner who had volunteered evidence was examined but no point of importance was elicited the jury retired to determine the question whether they had heard sufficient evidence in about half an hour the foreman inquired on behalf of tho jury if the body of deceased could be exhumed the coroner said probably it could provided some good reason could be assigned for such a proceeding the foreman said the reason was that the jury were so thoroughly dissatisfied with theomedical evidence that they felt they could not give a conscientious verdict without a postmorteam ex amination by an independent practitioner after con siderable discussion the jury consented to waive the point and again retired and after an absencea of half an houir returned with the following special verdict that the deceased john nolan died from congestion of the lungs and that the death was accelerated by the repeated and excessive punishment of bread and water diet which was ordered by the governor and sanctioned by tho surgeon the jury are fuirther of opinion it is impossible for the medical officer to properly or effectually attend to his duties at the prison without being a resident the jury are also of opinion that all kinds of repeated punishments should only be administered under authority of the visit ing committee
