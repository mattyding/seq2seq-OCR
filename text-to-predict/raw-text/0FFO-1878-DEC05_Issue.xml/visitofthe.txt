ibsit of the princb of wazes to lutonthis morning the prince of wales on his way from luton hoopark to london to take his seat in the house of peers on the opening of parliament will pass through the ancient town of luton and wil receive an address from the mayor and corporation the town is already decorated with flags and triumphal arches the principal orna mentation of the arches is made of straw plaits the prince will receive an address in the plaitball and will inspect two of the principal strawplait manufactories those of messrs vyse and sons and mlessrs welch and sons it is from its position as the metropolis of the straw plaitindustry that luton is so peculiarly interesting a town few are aware that within  miles of london is a district in which the problem of employing female labour has been successfuuy solved to such an extent that the census of  showed there were  females engaged in the strawplaiting manufacture and only  males the occupation of strawplaiting is largely pursued in their homes by the wives and daughters of farm labourers in the bedfordshire and hertford villages they bring their work into luton or the smaller market towns to sell it in the weskly markets the straw which the country girls have plaited is sewn togetber and made np into hats and boenets ia the towns of late years cheap straw but of inferior quality and colour from china has come in large quantities into the market gad halfruined the straw plaitingindustry but the makingup trade has flourished in the towns french aud swiss manufacturers are among those settled in luton and flne straw is imported from italy and switzer land in addition tothe cheap sort from canton the bedford shird straw produces a serviceable plaitwhich other english counties in vain attempt to rival the excellence is attri buted to the presence of silica in the stalks of the red lam mas wheat grown in this chalky soil an experienced eye can readily detect the superiority of the english to the chinese plait although the chinese product is very skil flillydyed in luton to hide its defects luton in fact inre cent years has become almostas fill of dye works asamiens isandbthe adaptation of the sewingmachine for sewing plait gave a fillip to the trade which has only just ceased to have its effect it is said that there are  sewingmachines in luton and as a hat or bonnet can be put together on the mschine in two or three minutes the quantity of the production is prodigious another invention that of bloclidng out the bats by hydraulic power has also caused great economy of time and labour in hat and bonnet making the export from great britain of hats which in  was worth � had risen in  to the valae of � the population of luton had increased from  in  to  in  it is believed to be now d a period of distress has now come upon the inhabitants owing partly to the general depression in trade and partly to the special competition oe ohinese with bedfordshire straw but the poor in luton will today be feasted at the expense of their richer neighbours in honour of the coming of the prince of wales and advantage will at the same time be taken of the princes visit to call public attention to the excellence of the local manu facture and to the claims it has by its superior quality to the patronage of the world the manufacturers of luton have the wisdom to reject the idea of shackling trade by a prohibitory tariff upon chinese goods but insist upon the superiority of english plait they have had the honour of submitting to his royal highness an interesting history of the straw plait and hat and bonnet manufacture of lutoa and are induced to hope mruch from the patronage of royalty by the fact that the establishment of the manufac ture in this town was due to a royal act mary queen of scots brought strawplaiters from lorraine to scotland and her son james i of england removed them to luton where the trade has flourished ever since before they left scotland the lorrainers had taught their art to some of the natives of the country and strawplaiting still occupies the long winters of the families of orimey fishermenthe plait in use up to the beginning of the present century was made of whole straw but in  some french prisoners confined at yarley barracks near stilton invented a machine for splitting the straw split straw had previously been used on a small scale hut the straws having been cut with a knife the process had become pro verbially slow and unprofitable the french invention marks an epoch in the mrawplait trade the red lammas or white chittim wheat from which the straw is obtained used to come only from bedfordshire the slopes of the chiltern hills herts bicks oxon or berkshire now it is sometimes brought by railway from much greater dis tances great care is necessary to cut the wheat before the flagof the straw falls wet weather spoils the crop by spotting the straw sultry seasons scorch the stalks and make them red the plaits are made up from the straws within a radius of some  miles of luton a few years ago there was no village which had not its plaiting school in which the children used to earn from gd to s weekly singing at their work the distich which contains in brief the arb and mystery of plaitingunder one and over twopull it tight and that will dowhen the plait is readv for the market it is collected by dealers and by them carried to luton dtunstable or other markets to be sold to the manufacturers sometimes the villagewives carry their own produce in for them selves the plait halls of luton present an interesting and busy sight on monday mornings traff c begins with the ringing of the town criers bell at am and some  persons may then bo seen anxious to buy and sell the average earnings of straw plaiters when there is a fair trade in english plaits was computed in  to be from s to s d weekly at the present momenr they do not earn more than half so mach the ambition of a clever strawplaiter is to go into the town and become a plaitsewer the average earnings of a skil ful bonnetsewer have been estimated at s weekly but at the present moment they probably do not exceed los or s about  years ago foreign plaits were first intro duced into this country and the innovation led to a depu tation of the leading men in the trade at luton waiting upon mr peel afterwards sir robert peel in the year  to urge upon him the propriety of repressing the importation of such plaits in the interests of the local plaiters mr peel gave the deputation a lesson in free trade and political economy so convincing that they retired perfectly satisfied to bave their requests declined in  a society called tho  straw hat manufacturers aud plain dealers association for the suppression of short measure in plait was established by the manufacturers it is supported by subscription among tho founiders and plait dealers an inspector attends the markets for the inspection of plait the effect has been to considerably check short measure for which the plait made in some districts had become notorious in  the inspector made  visits to markets and districts and  calls at warehouses travelling  miles in the execution of his duties he detected  cases of short measure and the total amount recovered by purchasers of shortmeasured plait upon his certificates during the year was  s d the associationappointed mir t e austin their secretary up to  be bad written  letters complaining of short measure and warning the plaiters of the evils resulting from its practice in the satme year t the following calculation was made showing the value added to the material straw in the different stages of its progress from the cowbarken to the boudoir a hundredweight of straw reckoned as worth s is capable within one month after harvest of producing about b weight of plaiting straws wortli from s to ls accord ing to season and quality this quantity of straws may be averaged to produce about b or lsb weight of straw plait worth from � to � or � this plait can bo con verted into about b or b weight of straw hats and bonnets which wholesale would be worth from � to � or � this wide margin will be understood when it is mentioned that bonnets vary in price from d to s d or s cash wholesale according to quality the result is that the s has grown to � an augmentation in value as wonderful in its way as the change of the mulberryleaf into satin the whole of the processes from the applica tion of the sickle to the growiag corn to the tacking on of the warehouse tickets may be gone through in less than two monthsup to a recent period the introduction of foreign plaits to comnpete with the homemade article had greatly de veloped the trade of luton without injuring the english plaiters foreign competition was unable to supplant beg lish plaits so long as the question was one of relative skill with little difference in tlie cost of production but during the last fewt years the chinese market being glutted with british goods chinese plaits have been imported in aschange at so lowa price as almost to exclude the lower class of english plaits from the market chinese plaits are made from the whole straws of rice and form a thicker and heavier article than our homemade plaits english plaits are not only lialter but tougher and preserve their colour better than he cbinese in sp ite however of this superiority the effoct of  chinese cheap labour  is felt as severely in bedfordshire as in california the manu facturers of luton in a memorial which has been laid before the prince of wales sayw when it is recollected that the english plaiters belong to the most necessitous class of our rural population that there would be a loss of avaluableadjunctto the husbands labours by the withdrawal of an cmployment for women and girls more congenial than female agricultural labour and when we also find that this supplement of an agricultural householders incomo decreases at a time like the present when the education and labour laws have to a great extent deprived the working classes of the earnings of their children the effect of the present depression among our english plaiters cleaims our must serious consideration we are not asserting too much wvhen we say that the handicraft of plaiting is in danger of such serious diminu tion as to threatea ultimate extinction ina the plaiting schools in oar rural parishes have become institutions of thepast while our village children aro now butlittle taught in their homes tho art of plaiting straws it is evident that if we would maintain ur superiority in the artide made by our english plaiwers if we would retain in our ownhands the double character of our handicraftnamely the plaitmaking and the bonnetsewingit is essential that a demand he created for hats and bonnets of our englishmade plaits and this can only be done by an effort to direct the favour of fashion to lnglish plaits in pre ference to the productions of a people such as the inhabit ants of the celestial empire of the chinise in this direc tion the powverful aid of our most gracious sovereign her royal highness the princess of wales eijd the ocher members of
