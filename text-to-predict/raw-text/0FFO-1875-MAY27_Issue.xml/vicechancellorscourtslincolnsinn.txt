ask him for money not due to them under the contract but according to tijo terms of which lo was quite prepared to pay what ever was duo from time to time he said however that he must have the proper certificate from dr zlorris before he handed the money over and offered to send them a cbeck for the � on the th of december ism the plaintiffs ceased au work under the contract on the th of january  they went at  oclock in the mornino with some carts and horses to romove the materials from the premises on the th of january the defendant gave the plaintiffs formal notice of hisintention then and there to rescind the contract and complete the wvorks himself ho lieg them responsible for any extra costs to which he mght so be ptt the plaintiffs not having been paid for the work they had done instituted this suit for an account of what was due to them fromthedefendant under the contract for payment a declaration that the defendant had not validly rescinded and was not entitled to rescind the contract an injunction to restrain him from appropriating or removing the plant and materials and from excluding the plaiatitfs from the site or preventing them taking possession of those things and for damages lhe cause came on npon an interlocutory motion for an injunction wvhich after some discussion was taken as a motion for a decree and the hearing of the caase proceeded with accordingly a great deal of evidenco was adduced on both sidesr j napier higgins qc anxd mr g w hemming were for the plaintiffs llr qliasse qan and m r  j milluar were for the defendantmsr j n figguns ol wasq besri in rlvthe vicecasnceao stated the facts ofthe case and in doing so said no doubt the contract was in its terms very stringent and the powers of the surveyor or arbitra tor amiple and undefinedl but esperienca showed that such powers were necessary in cases of this kind and the con tract was not really one iota more stringent than many of thoso into wvhich contractors voluntarily entered with rail vay and otber companies it was not to be wondered at that the plaintiffs should have been dissatisfied with lr imorriss ccrtificate thaey attributed its narrowness to want of comapetency or unfairness on his part  but there was nothing in the evidence to establish anything of that sort hzemade an independent survey of the works and po mises and the plaintiffs having by tho advice of their solicitors esntcred intothe contract which gave the surveyor such ful powers of determining the matter in dispute between the parties could notso far be heard to complain of his certiicate the defendants conduct appeared to have been harsh and unreasonable and the certificate certainly iwas not a lihbsrl one bot the authorities showed that in cases of this nature the only gronnd on which the certhifcates of surveyors could be relieved against was when the surveyors conduct had been inproper vexatious or fraudulent mr morris deposed that he believed he wan right in the certificate which he had funmished other surveyors had been consulted by the plaintiffs and they had certainly differed from him but then there was also evidence to support his views there was no proof that he had acted either improperly or vexatiously and nothing at all to show that he had given a fraudulent certi ficate for this court to interfera in these cases without the strongest proof of the requisite grounds would open the door to an immense amount of danger and mischief  and there were no sufficient grounds in this case ther waith respect to tho conduct of the parties themselves both the plaintiffs and the defendant were in faultthe plaintiffs should have gone on with their works for at least another mnonth mr morris might perhaps have been induced to reconsider the rnatter when he gave his next certificate but they certainly ought not to have peremptorily stopped the wvorks as they did and then proceeded to remove the mnaterials from the premises the defendant too hacd been not only harsh and unreasonable on his part but wrong in thinidng he could rescind the contract as he did the court felt itself greatly embarrassed and much op pressed with the difficulty there was in properly disposing of this case during the arguments more then one attempt had been made and suggestion offered with a view to a settlement either by a full performance of the contract on the one hand or the complete rescission of it on the other but neither side would listen to the proposals the strict rights of the parties therefore alone remained to be de termined end having regard to the whole case in all its aspects the proper order to be now made would be that thedefendant should give an undertaking to deliver up theplant to the plaintiffa and that their bill in this suit should be dismissed vithnut costs
