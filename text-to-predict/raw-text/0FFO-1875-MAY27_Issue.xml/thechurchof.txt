missionary should have a defined district and should be approved by the committeedr pmnin presenting the reportreferred to the building of new churches and said the church of scotland at this moment oon ied a position such as it never before held the comua were entering on tho year with perfect confideuco iu the liberality of the church and an earnest desire that they should have ample opportunity of spend ing on some missionwork the funds which the ohurch would supply he did not wish to enter on an argu nent for the htome mission as the adoption of the report would ba moved and seconded by gentlemen well able to speak with authority on the question after referring to some cases of difficulty which had arisen he said the constitution of the home mission committee was the most popular of any of the committees of the presbytery and comprised among its members delegates from every presbytery throughout the whole church in order that there might be no preponderance of what was called the  edinburgh element while there were dif ferences of opinion elsewhere there never had been any of these dieresces in the home mlission committee and the committee was simply for the purpose of extending the church of scotland and prometing tile organization of its peoplethe rev dr watson dundee moved the adoption of the report he did nut say that the efforts of tho home mlission committee were all that were necessary to raiso the lapsed masses but they hal been of great benefit there were a great many people in scotland who did not attend church and who were not in the commonsense views fallen they knew no minister or church but they wanted churches and only did not know how to get them hear hear and applause the home mission schemo had sup plied this organization which was so essential end he thought they should get an act to compel people to give for good purposes a most essential purpose tihe preser vation of the peace of the state could not be maintained if they had to depend upon voluntary effort vould they ever get the people to subscribe for the police laughter wvould they ever get the members of the peace preserva tion society or the community at large to subscribo for the army and navy  it was perfectly impossible that they could exist as a state upon voluntary efforts of that sortrhe money obtained by means of the education act was really acontribution from the state for moral secular and religions purposesand while people said they deniedl the power of the state to interfere he allowed them to say what they chose provided they did what was right the church of scotland world incur severe censure if it left its work undone but they might res assured that if they con tinued to preach the doctrine that they lived for the nation and not the nation for the church snd if they ruse to this and fulfilled their task then their existence in scot land would no longer be spokren of as g burden hat as a necessity loud applansealjor �saxllie seconded the motiondr story riosenoath was sorry to introduce a disturb ing element into the scene he proceeded to notice certain grants which had been given to two parishes in aberdeen by mir baird under conditions as regards the approval of the appointment of the ministers which he held were con trary to tho spirit of the patronage act he quoted cer tain papers isued by the aberdeen church extension association as showing that four montlhs after the act was in operamtion those conditions were in force as retards tho appomtment of ministers this he saidwas in aberdeen the very city of dr piries solemnitiesdr pirie rose to order and objected that dr story was quoting from documents not before the housedr story procceded to state that he had informed dr phin he was going to bring the case forward but dr phin disclaimed all knowledge of the documents quotedsome discussion ensued on the point of order the moderator eventuauy ruling that dr story could bring forward anything from his personal knowledge for which he would be answerable but could not bring forward a papr and put it on the table dr story went on to say that from his personal know ledge the home bmssion committee had bean giving grants in aid of local efforts those efforts being subsidized from other soutrcesregardng which due inquiry had not been made so thatto his mind aad possibly to the minds of others the hiome mlission committee occupied the un enviable position of conniving at what he took leave to call an evasion of the law of the land he proceeded to sup pose a case such as ho had described and moved that it be an instruction to the committee that they give no grant in alid in any case in which money has been obtained from other quarters on conditions inconsistent wyith the free action of congregations in the election of their ministers applause he disow ned any feeling in the matterhaving only spoken up for the congregational liberty of his fellow countrymen in the election of their ministers if they were once to admit that any one whether a prince a peer or a merchant commanding in thcse worldly days large influence might step in and say  you are not to exercise your liberties freely if any man interfered with congre gations in that way the patronage act of which they boasted so much was no better than tho envelope of an old letterto be trampled in the dust laughter and applausetheotev a scott edinburgb had no objection tosecond the motion of dr story he thought it of the utmost im portance that the rights they all along asserted in tho church belonged to the people of scotland aud which had nowv b act of parliament been declared to belong to them should he protected he did uiot knew of any man or any institution thnt was likely to bestow its money in any way a nstthe constitution of the church but he paid the utmost respect to the tender conscdnce of his fiiend dr storydr srevrtsox said the act to which dr story alluded did not apply to churches which got these grants at all there was no congregation in such churches to ex ercise the right of election of a minister if one were to build and endow a church where no church existed there was no court ecclesiastical or civil that could declare that that gentleman had not the right to the election of the first nsinister before  when dr chalmerss church extension scheme was established one of its provisions was that the first election of a minister should be held by tho persons subscribing the moneydr watsose in replying quoted a clause in the patron ago act that nothing in the act should affect or interfere with the appointment of the minister first appointed as minister to any new parish qzwad seacra so that instead of there being any evasion of the law theo home mission committee might have been justly censured if they had attempted to interfere with the operation of the act applausedr story expressed his willingness to withdraw his amendment but after some discussion this was refused and on a division the instruction was thrown out by  to dr traml read the answer prepared to tho queeas letter in which the members and elders of the church of scotland in general assembly convened acknowledge with profoundest respect her majestys most gracious letter and the expression therein contained of her determination to uphold ael the ancient rights and privileges of the church of scotland of its ministers and of the congregations com mitted to their charge they had sincere gratification in welcoming as her smajestvs commissioner and representa tive the distinguished scottish nobleman whose presence as her majestys representativo was not only a recognition of their right of assembly but was a becoming recognition of the king of kings and of the happy unmon between church and stato in full accordanco with the lvord of god and eminently calculated to promote the best interests of the nation her majestys donation of � for the re formation of the highlands and islands was received with geat thankfulness the reply concluded with the hope that almighty god the god and father of our lord and saviour jesus christ might enrich with all spiritual anfd temporal blessings her majesty her children and her childrens children and long preserve her in health and strength in this present world and after a prosperous reignn earth might confer on her a heavenly crownprofessor cilarteris gave in the iteport on christian iufe and works it rontained  answers fuller than those of last year but was stll incomplete owing to the unwillingness ot some ministers to contribute their statistics tho report he said set before the assembly the ecclesiastical attachments of neary two millions of the people of scotland but thes were not complete returns and therefore he did not think that any one friend or foe could fairly draw conclusions as to how many belonged to the churh of scotland and how many belonged to other churches in the population the returms of schedules received from  parishes showed the following results belonging to the church of scotland  free church   united presbyterian church  other presbyterians

the courts of the church much informnationt had been received there was almost everywhere an opinion favourable to the w ork of mrembers of the congregation in the sabbath school not a few expressed a strong desire to see laymen take a more active part ia the courts of the church in reference to the query as to any religious movements which had come under notice there was a wonderful agree ment of opinion in favour of the american revivalists and the committee believed that those who were somewhat cautious in intinating approval at the first would gladly receive testimony to the results so far as they could now be ascertained plymouchism theyheld was an undoubted result of a misgmided revival heir duty was to promote and advocate the purity and spirstual life of the ohurch anad to shovw to those earnest though misguided young spirits that god had not withdrawn his goodhandfrom them the condition of the young people in many of the rural parishes was a subiect which the assembly required most seriously to consider the effect of the report they had ventured to make being that in a great many easee the emlo era of labour ought to do a great deal more then they ko m ordero ttrengthen the hands of the minister the committee were well aware that there was much christian life in the church of which they can make no estimate and much christian work of which they can have no record  but they have seen and they believe they have also recorded what may encourage those who love christ to do more for his cause and withal may humblo them because it is so little as compared with what it might be applausethe rev a scorv edinburgh moved a deliverance thanking and reappointing the committee and regretting that the statistics were not more fullmr jaumz king edinburgh seconded the motion

and the committeo bad dis charged tc woevtrk assigned to them he thought however tbat if a train wynt on a wrong rail the better the engine the greater darnage ivould ensue this was a committee for discussion and not for action and he thought the resudts brought out might be of great interest to the con templative mind they would not issue in any distinct or articulate action thepreceedings of the committee would tend to drive into the conscences of the people a narrow conception of what christian actvity really was he put it whether there was not a danger lest they should con sider that christian life and work was merely attending to the spiritual destitution of the ignorant and destitute classes he yielded to no man in his desire to see vise and effective measures taken to grapple with the bar barism iinorance and the absence of christian culture that charactarized large masses of the people but thero was christian lifo and w ork to be done in the regions of culture one of the grandest of christian works was to grappl nwith tho intellectaul difficulties and perplexities which were totally unknown to those who occupied the lower strata of our social existence there was an idea going abroad that no parson was doing his duty to onrist or being a r christian unless he was a sort of semiofficial miscionary or some sort of unrecognized preacher of christianity he moved to

that sum and some of them have the largest stipends in the church and only a fewv are from ex ceutional circumstances without augmentation in con clusion the committee recommend that the assembly should instruct every presbytery to furnish to the com mittee a particular account of any additional provision re quired vhether by building or endolvment for tho spiritulzlenfit of any of their parishes as well as of the probable local aid to be reckoned on in making that provision by this information the conumittee would be able to lay bdore the next assembly a reliable view of tllo magnitude of the work of selfextension still before the church the church generally would more clearly apprehend both her duty and her means for implementing it and the proper sharo to be borne in

presenting tho report hoped the church would be roused to even more vigorous efforts to fulfil the mission of a national churchthe pev f l robxrtson glasgow moved the adop tion of the report he said the noblest pleadins in vindi cation of church establishments were to be found in the writings of dr chalmers whose works were still an armoury from which the fittest weapons might be drawn in defence of national churches and of endowed territorial work the noble band who founded a sister church had passed away their successors departing from the tradi tions of the church were setting themselves deliberately to undo and demolish the work of dr chalmers they were atperfect libertyto driftfromthetraditions oftheir church but he was warranted in argaing from the recent action taken by that church that they now no longer represented the historical free church applause the object which the endowment scheme set itself to accomplish was at once broad noble and in the highest sense philanthropic main taining that it was the high mission of the church to bring all men in communication with almighty god the com mittee had determined on dividing the country into man ageable
