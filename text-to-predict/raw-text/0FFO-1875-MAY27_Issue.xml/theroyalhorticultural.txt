receiving a communication from the council respecting the future prospects end condition of the bodietyand to receive an answer to proposals mado by the council to her majestys commissioners it was not intended to fulfil any part of this programme but dmply to postpone the meeting as tho expected answer had not been received from the commissioners this course was not however adopted for a discussion arose which was the means of bringint to the surface the present financial position of this old societylord bury presidedand in rising to address the meeting said the first announcement he had to naloe was that the hon secretary had resigned because he could not agree with the policy of tho council after this resignation had been formally accepted his lordship proceeded to say that it was his duty to explain the position in which the society stood at that moment his task ho regretted to say was an extremely easy one and would be discharged in a few words the upshot being that the council were agreed in asksng for the meeting to he adjourned for ten days on the last meeting of the fellows the council had confided to them the trust to make arrangements vwith her majestys commissioners for the future carrying on of tho gardens and to abmit to the fellows a scheme for the future guidance and governance of the soiety the council had hoped to be prepared vith tho arrangements and with the scheme but he was sorry to say time had been against the council the last meeting was in mkrch and the council had not obtainedameetingwith the commissioners until the th of april when the proposals submitted by the council wero not considered as satisfactory by the royal commissioners these propossls were again and again amended but with no better success and the council atlast considered it their duty to submit to the fellows the circumstances under which they found themselves placed for they fully believed by this time a  yea  or nay would have been received from the commissioners to the jest proposals and in either case of an arrangement havin been made or of a failure to make an arrangenent it wns felt that the fellows should be conurulte l hi desired to have it understood that he did not comnplain of the com missioners for it wvas in the belief that a definite ansuwer would be received to the last series of propositions that the meeting had been convened  and in fact an answer was received a voice  when  the answer vas received seven or eight days before but shortly aftenvards in that outward conversation in wvhich often more business was actual y done than in formal nmcetingsit came to the imow ledge of the council that her majestys commissioners had not thoroughly understood the last propositions of the council  and general scott having been good enough to attend the last mceting of the council it was thought ad visablo that a httle more time should be takeu as the council now stood in the position of not having received a definite answer from the royal comwissioners and they could not under these circumstances resign tho trust they helda course the council snould take unreservedly if they failed in making a definite arrangement le had one piece of advice to offer the fellows and he did so with the con currence of his colleagues and that was that they should refrain from discussing the position of the society at that moument it would not further the interests of the society to raise a discussion on any matters and he begged the meeting to pass the resolution he proposedfor adjournuent for ten days sub silenztio he begged to add a few wordis in answer to statements  and that was to say that the ill position of the society financially had been greatly exag ger tedd without going into figures he could say that when the present conncd eutcrel offico the debts were very much larger than they were at present in fact the debts had steadily diminished under the councils exertions but he regretted to say that uupleasant action had been taken against the society by persons of whom the society might have expected better treatmiient every one was aware that the funds had been falling off during the last two or three years and that the society had been obliged to post pone tho payment for prizes avarded last year now some persons who made arrangements with their gardeners that whatever could be made out of the royal horticultaral society should be part of the wages paid to the gardeners had commenced alctions in the countv court inrlle names or rue garreners out realy for themselves to recover the amount of these prizes as the society held funds for tho whole of the creditorsthe whole of the debts being more than the amount in handthe council refused to be obliged thus to make preferential payments as the case stood the society did not owe halfayears income and if these cases wvent against tho society in the county court the council would sooner file a declaration of insolvency than pay the preferential claims lic begged to remmid the meeting that the present council wvere not the cause of the evils which existed but stool in the position of defending the society froml themn and he treaited that such arrangemnents wvoul dbe made as would place the society among the greatest in the landftr a munay seconded the motion for adjournment for ten daysmlr lindsay the late hon secretary
