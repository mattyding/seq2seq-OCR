resnonded for thei army admiral sartoriusa dmiral of the fmeet nd one of the few sursivors of the battle of trafalgar in repling for the lavy said he believed he wavs one of the latelins that united the oe avy of england with the new the navy had been in a transition stlte ever since the introduc tion of steaml a new class of vessels had boen intro duced and although they had not yet arrived at the de sired type no one would dleny that the sapne bold and daring spirit existed which jiad characterized our sailors in the olden times as an old man who was about to quit the stage of life and hvbose paijod of exsitence might be reckoned by weeks and months rather than by years ho could not help pointing ont tho extraordinary posi tion in which this country wvas at present placed in his aoalger dsys there were only two great nal powers against which england was caded upon to contendfrance and spain the latter lower had ceased to he fqnidable but france would always ho a great and porerful nation and he trusted that england and france w ould never again be suc enennies as they had been in the vast otber nations however now the moat poerfulf in the world had srnce made thcir influence felt and they counted their armies by hundreds of thousands and stean would enable them in a very short time to create very powerful navies new motive powers wcre being dscovered the  old salt  was rapidly giving place to the skilled gtnner and it might be that tte fram di rected by steam would decine the naval victories of the future wyhatever changes might happen need not make us feel uneasy because the boli spirit of the british sailor would always be equal to the occasion our position therefore was as safe as ever it was in the paalaiest days of our naval triunmihs and if our vessels were not the best that might be devised they were at least as good as those of other nations wve had still to watch and maintain the ocean road for our vast commerce and our navy was as equal to the performance of this dlty as in the days of our greatest naval triumphs the master next gave the toast of  the archbishop of york and the clery and his grce in responding expressed his gratification in standing up in the hall of a company which typifed literature in the present day there were old associations between the church and this guild of literature the church of bngland had been in past times the leader in the work of education in this kingdom and threefourths of the educa tion of the kingdom had been in the hands of tho clergy time was whei the archbishop of canterbury had he be lieved the power of burning in the adjoining square any volumes which he held to bo of a detest able character the press was neov the chief estate among us and perhaps the reason why we were so deeply indebted to it vas tbat it kept itself in order the clergy had learnt to trust literature as their great ady and not for the vorld lvouldthey see the light ef that knowledge wshich the press had kindled extinguished in the landl they were told that the clergy aud especially the bishops owed their existence td rarliament zle could not quite admit this for if parliament withdrew any authoritv it had given to the churcl of xnglend ke people would still find her an instrument of good and her clergy would go on teachsingwhatthey now taught and withthesamne results lilr warden iivingtoa proposed the toast of the house of lords and commons lord haimpton in responding for the house of lords saiid ho afforded in his own person one of the most recent instances of the exttent to which that great assembly was recruited from thepeople he was a very old member of the houso of commons nd a very youmgmemberof the house of lords but tho difference as it seemed to him between the two rouses was not in the amount of business for the house of lords did as much business as the house of commons he would not say they did it bettor but they did it as well the maidifference was that they did it more quietly and di not talkl quite so much about it spealing from his personal recollections he felt inclined to say that the members of the house of commons were not quite free from the imputation of speaking to their constituents while in the house of lords so far as he had observed no one spole unless he really thought he had something to say in regard to the business done they wele rival worthy of each other the house of lords were conserva tive because they wvere attached to the great institutions of the country but there was in the best sense of the word  liberal a large liberal element in that house mr waipole acknowledged tbe toast for the house of commrons remarlkng that the two foremost members of thoi house of commd asmr disraeli and mr glad stonebad distinguished themselves in literature sir s waterlow gave her majestys judges and the master of the rolls in returning thanks said there was a time when not only books were burnt in the adjacent square but when an archbishop might have been burnt in an open place not far from that hau for his religious opinions he congratulated them on baving fallen upon better days end printed out the cannexion between the social and historical records of which he was the offical keeper and the objects for wvhich the stationers com pany was founded tr john murray m propoin  literature science and art said that so many mem hers of the house of commons were engaged in literature that it might be regarded as one of the greatest pubsilsing establishments of this country professor owen replied i a charming and characteristic speech on behalf of science and dr dasent and mr weeles ra briefly acknow ledged thetoast on bebslf of literature and art the other toasts were the ulayor and corporation of london pro posed bytho bishop of london and acknowledged by alder man sir b phillips and thoe ealth of the aesterpro posed by tho archbishop of york the hall of tho corn pany was hung with banners
