t  peace of europeby tgraphfrom a french coerespohdxntparis may there is much co mment this evening on the following note communicated to the papers in a semiofficial forma certain ournl auserut that the duxo decazes is mnultiplying assurances of the pacificdisposition ofthefronch government towards the berlin cabinet and is bent on furnishibg proofs of it by announcing the suspension of all tho measures destined to complete our military organiza tion as far as concerns the territorial army lve do not beliove the government has been led to multiply assurances of its pacific disposition for nobody doubts it it is still more incorrect that the government in order to fonish prcofs of it has had to uspend the measures destined to eomplete our military reorganization these measures as every one imows are the result of the votes of the ltational assembly and have no other object moreover than the restoration of our military establishment and the security of cur territoryaccording to the explanations given me by poli ticians likely to be well informed the object of the above note is in the first place to let it be under stood that germany has hitherto addressaed no direct observations to this government relative to the state of its armaments secondly to claim for france the right of restoring its military esta blishments and lastly to point out the purely de fensive chnaracter of these armaments from this point of view the note has a strictly correct and un assailablo character but in the present state of public opinion every movement in this direction deserves mature consideration the events which recently engaged public attention and happily led to reassuring declarations have evidently resulted in giving the relations of france and germany a character more frank and more worthy of both nations germany from the mo ment she firmly repudiated the threatening theories reported to have been put in circulation there did not stop halfway but wvished france to know from a certain source that it was the pacific idea which henceforth predominated with her prince hohen lohe moreover on returning from his recent jour ney after passing through berlin and seeing his master has held himself authorized to accost the head of the french government telling him i am a messenger of peace these soothing words which overpower the strife of parties and the pas sionate expressions which may find utterance whether in germany or france terminate it is to be hoped this eur of distrust and uneasinmss from which etirope has for years been suffering this very uneasiness has shown europethat a collision between twonations like those which confronted each other in  cannot beregarded with indifference byanyother conti nental nation great or smallthe result of this last crisis however would be very incomplete if it had only changed by mere words the relations of france and ger many when germany emphatically declares its tendencies to be entirely pacific it is because she has herself recognized how chimerical were the fears of those who spoke of french aggression this declaration has had a nataral consequence honourable for both nations france regaining security by the affirmations of its powerful adversary can now act in broad daylight and resist in this way the inevitable emaggerations attending the mystery with which a nation seeks to surround the restoration of its forces of course in the present state of internatioual relations a country seeks to disguise the construction of its needlegun or the casting of its rifled cannon but to try to conceal armaments especially in a country where every military reform and organiza tion must be discussed and passed by ffhe assembly is to attempt an impossibility and to invite ridicule from this vexatious obligation france has just escaped and what the above note tends to show is that france has understood that she is free to devote herself without disguiseto therestoration of hermili tary defence the greatest success of pacific efforts would of course be the adoption by entire europe of the principle of disarmament but human pride is opposed to such arrangements and consideringthe impossibility of that result the maintenance of peace depends on a quite opposite measure when nobody will disarm the armaments of one neutralize those of others whenacountryisinastateto defendc itselfifmenacedwhenthearmiesareequallymatched there is no longer surprise or inevitable danger free scope must not however be given to imagina tion by assuming that mystery which hides nothing and exaggerates everytning since the last crisis france has felt that she could prosecute openly the work of reconstructionandreestablish that necessary equilibrium in the family of nations which makes wars uncertainthat isdifficultby establishing a franker relation between the two nations and by giving france the right of putting herself on a suffi cient defensive footing this note protects ger mnany against accusations which can no longer rest on the weakness of her adversary and the dignity of france the hnour of germany and the peace of the world cannot but gain from this new state of thingsuises tfiegemberdrl mays the semiofficial provinwial correspondence of to dlay referring to the past political apprehensions refutes the charges brought against the alleged offi cial newspapers for having been the cause of those apprehensions recalling to its readers the atti tude it had maintained the correponadence points out that besides the imperial official gazette it is the only paper which has the acknowledged mis sion of authentically malding known the views of the government it reprints all the leading articles it has published since the th of april last end concludes as follows their contents and tone will only show that the government was far from wishing either to indicate the aprroach of foreign complications or prepare the piblic mind for them nor did it intend to suggest that any hange had occurred in this respect within the last fewr months
