labourebs akd ilandowkbrsabridged from the szffok cmronficea meeting of the agricultnial labourers wvas held at boxne in suffolk last week to celebrate the annivercary bf the branch of the national agricultural labourers unioi there was a considerable muster of labourers ana their wives many of whom wore the unionblue riband mr josoph arch was present and was well received sir ecdward kerrisoii of oakleypark also took a seat in one of the wvaggons and he too was received by tho men with great cheering mr aitcl mlde along speech and answered those who contended that the union agitation had done no good it had raised vages and though a rise in wages was in itself a low obwect it vras a great thing to an agricultural labourer sor i a veek more were much needed and though it was said they had reached the top of the tree and should begin to lay by for a rainy day he questioned whether there was much to spare cheers vages must advance and to those who said they could not pay more he ventured to say that the day was coming when the labourers would ask for the full worth of their toil and if it was not given to them in england would go to a country wliere they could get it cheers he would put it to those of them who were farm labourers if there was ever a period in their history when they thought so deeply as now no no when they read so much as now l no no j or when they felt so deep an interest in the welfare of their neigh beurs as today  never atr arch continued there is one grand feazture in otlr union there are many men and i think i may venture to say i am addressing some now who in  could not read a line of a book or even aletter of tho alphabet but who today can read plent  and the one thing which cheers me above all is thisthat the blessed book of god which in  was a sealed book to thousands of our british labourers to whom it possessed no charms is today read by them and read witth avidity and delightthis is a statement i am prepared to prove and in the journeys i have made on the sabbaths htundreds of our men have como to shake me by the band blessing god and the day i ever raised my voice on their behalf cheers looking at these facts from a national standpoint i akdo the sarmiers or any other class above the labourers think that they are going to keep the labourer in the ignorance and in the slavery in wlhich he has beenkept  with the growing intelligence and with a sense of the power of combination if the farmers do not meet this association on commercil principles and allow the labourers the qrcatest amount of latitade and freedom to exerciso their liberties they will have to face facts which they wont like to face leeas hear ho then went on to refer to the complaint that labourers were a burden on the rates which wero contributed to bv industrious saving people the fact was that the labonrers would have been among the saving people if they had had the chance laughter he vwas in oxfordshirc the other day and was told that the poor law auditorthere was dis gusted to find that for every sovereign of the rates is d had been for working expenses  oh  oh   ought not the labourers to be ashamed of being paupers at such an enormous expense  lautghter and  we don t mean to stand it mr arch sait they meant to have the pre perty qualificationt for the board of guardians done away withl and then those above them would have to mak up their minds to see clodhoppers on the board checshe proceeded to show that as it cost s a head per week for every man woman and child in tbe workhouse when a man with a wife and four young children having been uable to find omployment was compelled to go to the workhouse rntepayers had to pay ss a week said mr arch to curso a man  s a week to unwoman his wife and crush all her delicate sensations of the lanity of her womanhood s a week to blight and blast these poor little children and stamp them as paupers as long as they hve  shaime s a weak to do that but the very moment he leaves the threshold of the house andl wants to be an honest workman to pay his way and to rnaintain his wife and children independently you ofrer himn the paltry suim of  or s or s a weel s to blast a man but s you offer him when he wants to work  shame wvhy the very poor laws themselves have been enough to make the agricultural labourer a rogue and a scamp before he sat down mr arch said he wished to impress on the minds of farmers and of sir edward xerri son that it must be made worth the labourers while to stay in his native country or the tide of enmigration having set in no one could say when it would turn he urged them to consider the amount of land only half cultivated the enormous extent of waste land the unsatisfactory con dlition of the army and give the laboures some stake in the country instead of saying  landless you were born and landless you may die and they woald have something to defend and something to fight for with all parts of the colonuies calling them to go there he said the labourers will not consent to make food for gunpowderand if sir edward yonr property wants defending your greatest safeguard would bh tho happy homes around your mansion of thousands of the tillers of the soil cheers who would fight for you tooth and nail in conclnsion he re commended the agricultural labourers to be up and doing and rezvember that when in the counties they got political power the entire destiny of the country would be in tho hands of the worklng men and he wanted to see the working men allied with the jandednand moneyed interest in ono grand objectthe happiness prosperity and com fort of one another and the peace and freedom of their fatherland loud cheerssir edwvard kxerrosn then addressed the niecting he said he was the landlord both of the tenant farmer and of the labourer he therefore had to consiler equally the interests of both andl the principle on which he ha acted throughout the union agitation wars that should it become necessary to raise his voice for the advantage of either cass in a time of trbiile or difflculty he stood in a better position for doing so if he was indopendent both of the union and of any defonee association after denouncihig arbitrary rules which enabled unionist labourers to strike against the farmers in detail sir edward pointed out how umreasonable it was that the union executive  miles away should have the power of advising men to strike in n district thor were unacquainted with and under circum stances whicl they only knew imperfectlylmr arcre dont alvise any labourers to strike until we know the facts of the case eo have our branches in the villages and they are labourers who manage those branches as a rule and if they send an application to our offite they send also the circumstances and condition of the branch the rate of their wageswhat they think they ought to have and what is paid around them so thatwe dont do what we do in ignorancesir edward continuedthe result of this rule has been a vast amount of misery to a vst siumber of people in this country you have been recommended to emigrate and migrate all i have to say is that my objet as a landlord living among you and in comning here today is in every vwvy to promoto your interests so that you may haveno occasion to lo either the one or the other with teference to emigration i say that  years ago before lur arch appeared among you i was ono of the strangest advocates of it i spent time and money uponi it i was present andc my face vas as well known as any of the agents of mr arch at all the euigration offices in london  wvas there coutinuallyaud i triei to persuade the teeming population of this country who were in multitudes over and above those who could be kept upon it to emigrate but it was with the greatest difliculty i thied to persuade thoo to migrate but with the greatest lihlicultv too in drsetshire i went abont with lord goldolphin osborne one of the principal friends of the labourers ai years ago with  view to promiiote emigration becauso i saw it was a racans by wisiehs the labourers might rise my friends i do not speak against enigration or migration i have all my life when people have come to me week after week endeavoured to assist those who have wished to leave tle county or the country i elar hear and a voice  siredwad you have dono that whtile i have fdon that while i have thus been a union to you without youir paying me anything for it i have at the same time en deavoured to the best of my ability to keep you contented aud jhappy here hear hear at the same tim with regard to wages it is not a question of ls or s you know in this parish wrhere we now are how wages have risen gradually by themselves within the last  years with wheat at the samo price and remembering this vou would not go about saying that the farmers are altogether to blanie for the line they have taken with you in k tho price of wheat wvas the same as nows a quarter the rate of waes was then x  it is naw as vont know from s to s the rate of paymnent for harvesting was then gb it is now ï¿½ and consequently wages have risen grqdually in this parish f fhoane  per cent and i aim not eawareif it be qo you can saythat the labourers have gone about demanding ai increaso in waes which tbey havenot received even before it vas asked for no strilke no lockout nor anything of that description hans occurred in this parish or neighbourhood within my recollection i say therefore that as regards this neighbourhood mr archs or any other union has left things exactly as in the natmral conses uence of things theywould have been if ilrr arch had not existed ir arch has introduced various other mattera to this meeting with reference ta the tenant farmer and tenant right saying that the value of the land woult be doubled and not only so but the farmers could afford to pay double tho amount of wages that i beg ti deuy i ay it cannot be proved you kno wperfectly wellwhat can bo dione by good cultivation you have all allotments thore is not a labouring tenant on my estate who has not his allotment grournd for i wish al t rise by the gradual scale of inding from small beginnings to something higher  but you lkow perfectly weil that the produce of the land could not be doubled all over the country neither could the farmes altonr to pay double the wage they now pay it is said they would be able to do so if they lihd more tenant right i deny that i am in favour of tenantlightof a lihural tenant rightanl i hare spok en so but let me tell you that if you snake tnant right as stringent as it is desired that minute you fall upon the small farmers auj prevent the labourer front rising to bc a small farmer you would cilt your own throats why at this moment in this cotnty the amount of naoney paid for entrance into a farm is ï¿½ or ï¿½ an acre for the valua tion if you make theso tenants rights vnry strong how can a labourar afford to py ï¿½ or ï¿½ an acreo besides stiuing a farm on going inti it  i want you to have the opportunity cf rixins bat if tenant righe is prossed to that extent small farinas will diisaplpear and only large farms will remtain that is a state of things that i want to pre veat amnong yon i have  holdlings on this property under  acres and taking the vshole of lnglantlalthough it is said the labourers cannot possibly riso in england per cent of th nuniber of holdings are belov  acres iwiltll you what mostlyprevents laboure s from taking landthe e cessive burdens that are being perpetually placed on the land at this usoinent laud is paying per celit in taxation against  per cent on personal property that is what pre vents the possibility of people occupynz or having landandtwho is it that has eeln placing thcse burdeons on the land  for mr arch would have you beliere that it is by this legislation of the conservative party i beg leave to liar that it is the conservative party alone wholeo ave ever take lone shilling off local taation within my recollection n thxe contrary year after year and year followving yearthe liberals have poured upon us stil more and mnore taxation making it impossible for the labourer and almost for the tenant farmer to live upon the  land which he occupie now this is a very serious condition of things and one which requires onr very best consideration i quite agree with mlr arch that the amount of mnuny paid tor the management of the poor lawv is monstrous i mentioned about a month ago at a public meeting thatin two parishes in my own district brome and oakley at one time there were people in receipt of a money payment from the board mn one parish of a  and in another pariah of s lid while we were paying at the rate of nearlyï¿½ a wveek towards the maintenance of the great w orkouse and of its ofiicials i agree entirely with thatend as wages riseand they wrill rise naturally as a matter of course in a districti should like to see the people become more and snore independent so that they need not come as they have done to the workhouse or to seek charity cheers although i myself am naturally of a charitable disposition i have always said the first and formost thing you should give a man is labour and good pay for that labour cheers that is the iirst thing charity should be the second you should try to raise a man by giving him money for his labaur solid wages no truck system or anything of that sort and by that means let him rise to independenct charity should be a secondary consideration let it never ba men tionedas the bible says  let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth cheersafter some further remarks from sir er kerrison ar arch repliedand the chairman proposed a vote of thanks to both adr airch and sir b merrison which was carried by acclamationdir ancli said the best vote of thanks the labourers could givo him was to join the union stick well together do for their masters a fair days worlc and demand a fair dlays wages be sober and industrious and persevere and he hoped when he came down into this neighbourhoodl another year ho should find that sir edward who was anxious to encourage thrift rind providence had let them all have an acre or an acre and a half of land apiece cheers sir ednard lsrisox said there might have been differences of opinion between those wyho hlad spoken but he was quite certain that bpth vere devoted to the interest of the agricultural labourors and to the interest he hoped of those who employed the agricultural labourersthe farmers iie might say to dir arch that for the last  years the amount of rent on his own estate had hardly altered by one per cent and therefore as regarded that the farmers had precisely the same amount to pay for labour as to the cottage the rent hail hardly altered by a shilling remaining on an averago at ï¿½ os and most of them ihad a piece of garden
