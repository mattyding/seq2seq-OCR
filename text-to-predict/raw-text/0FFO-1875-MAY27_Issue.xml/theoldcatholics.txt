the old ca tbolicsfrom our prussian correspondentberlit may were it at all necessary to stupply additional proof of the isignifieante of the old catholic movemuent the report issued at tlm y ars meeting would snffice the meeting opened two days ago at bonn has been officially informed by this report that out of the  old catholic congregations existing in uermany only  have thought it expedient to send in their statistics this energetic hundred includes  souls amongt whom there are  grownup men and  priests of this total prussia the state which has done so much to encourage the formation of old catholic com munities numbers only  souls among whom there are  grownup men and  priests in the course of the last year when the clerical con troversy was rapidly approaching a climax and the public were repeatedly called upon by the press to support the movement no more than  persons joined the sect of these newcomers  were maleadultsa circumstanceshowingthathardlysny family man thinks he can afford to break with mother church the new denomination is comparatively strong in the grand duchy of baden whose  catholicsnearly twothirds of the entire populationhave already produced  avoved adversaries of the pope a year ago they were but half that number the increase being mainly produced by the law allowing old cathoics a share in the church funds in bavaria whose catholic inhabitants are about  the sect claims  souls with  grownanp men and  priests the clerical order were increased in the course of theyear by six personisone prussian two bavarians and three swiss all of whom it appears were ordained by bishop rleinkens the student of old catholic theology is at this moment represented by  specimens matricalated at the university of bonn notwithstanding these dis couraging figures the report looks confidently forward to a moral and numerical access of strength in a near future it is indeed easy to foresee that the bill now passing through the prussian parlia ment which allowvs old catholics to be sumrnmarily puz in possession of catholic funds will sensibly augment the devout little band gathered round a few distinguished leaders but as to anything like real life being infused into the new denomination i confess i am not very sanguine it is among the liberals only that the new faith can look for recruits but liberals are neither satisfied by that party in the sect whorejecting infallibility cling to the rest of the ancient dogma nor by that other section who while they profess a vague enlighten ment omit to determine how far they go those who have joined the old catholic congregations are mostly pious and highlyrespectable persons too devout to miss attending divine service and too reverent to acknowledge a cburch raled by a demigocl but thelr number is smau in this sceptical country where those who disbelieve in thepope are as a rule inchned to abolish mady other tenets of their former creed the great enemy of the pope in germany is neither the old cathiolic party who object to him for conscientious reasons nor the german government wvho regard him as a political adversary artfully disguised in cassock and gown the force the vatican has really to fear in this country is the determined rationalism of the educated classes this is an intellectual power as strong at any rate at present as the fervent belief of his immediate adherents and as there is not much visible difference in this respect between catholics and protestants the pope has no reason to look upon the failure of the old catholic reform as calculated to improve his prospectsone of the means habitually etnployed by the ultramontanes ia coercing adversaries has become painfully manifest at milnster you may remember that when the bishop of that ancient and orthodox city returned thither the other day from prison the nobility and lower orders gave him a triumphal reception to express their disapproval of the demonstration the middleclassinhabitants includ ng many respectable tradesmen signed an address to the speaker of the house of deputies protesting against the course taken by their fellowtownsmen this was pouring oil on the flames irritated in their turn by the provoking step of the liberals the ultramontanes forthwith outlawed the trades men whose naiues appeared in the address thus infiicting considerable injury on their business bmatters in consequence have assumed an un pleasant appearance in the city which has long been a sort of local metropolis for the westphalian nobilityspeaking of westphalia f ought to bestow a few words npon an artist a native of that province whose talent and perseverance have just completed a very remarkable work some  or  years ago when the unity movement hiid barely commenced herr ernst von bandel a westphalian nobleman devoted to the sculptors art conceived the patriotic idea of erecting a giggantic statue to jermann the vanquisher of varus in the teutoburg forest a grand national monument the statue was to reach the enormous proportions of  feet not to speak of pedestal and base and as it was to be placed on the top of a hill the site of victory the difficulty of getting it in position not a little added to the magnitude of the undertaking in spite of all obstacles what appeared a chimera  years ago has now become a reality assisted by wealthy friends and occasional public subscriptions herr von bandel has completed the figure and in two months expects to witness the solemn inauguration of his monument by the german emperor the statue is of embossed copper and has been wrought by the hand of the man whose brain created it his whole life has been consumed in this one object when he had done modellingno small task in the case of a figure with hands five feet longhe took to the hammer and forge and literally formed the immense surface with his own unaided strength a good deal of it was done at the foot of the hill whereon it stands the sculptor having built himself a forge and a hut close to his chosen locality if the whole is as imposing as the head which i saw ten years since germany wiir posess not only the largest but also one of the best statues in
