caaï¿½snmain proposmg the next toast said thev were honoured with the company of several distinguishea representatives of foreign powers it had always been the boast and the desire of this society to acquire and main tain something of a european as well as of an english character that desire had been met and sup ported from year to year by the attendance at these an niversary otcasions of many distinguished foreignersvho for the mospart belonged to the diplomatic body he needonlymention the names of princo lieven baron brunnolw the clevalier bunsen and mr van do veyer who avas half an engihslman and who twice presided at anniversary  festivals of the society they were not very badly off in that respect on the present occasion in asusuch as they were honoured by the presence oe several distinguishea foreigners by his sidefor example sat a man who was notonly a representativeatthe british court of thgreat empire of austrohungaryan empire the fortunes and future of which engaged au our sympathiesbut who was likewisela statesman of european famne w ho had built up that empire upon its newvfoundation cheers there was also present the representative of belgiuma conntry

departure of another foreign mlinister who had just unavoidably left his place general schenck the representative ot the united states whom indeel he ought hardly to class armong foreigners because in connexionwith english literaturewe could not regard americans as straugers the toast he had to pro pose was ithe ambassadors and alinisters of foreign powers coupled with the name of count beust the austrian ambassadorhis elxcellency count beust in responding saiddly lords and gentlemenit is always a most pleasant task forme when called upon to respond in the name of my colleagues and to tendej their and my thanks for the kind expression of goodwill ie which their toast is given and received to day i do so lth maixed feelings of pleasure and emotion for i cannot banish from my mind the recollection that i had the firtt opportunity of addressing an english audience on a similar occasion at a festival of the royal literary fund presided over by an en lightened sovereign immediately after my appointment as an ambassador to the court of st jamess and never shall i forget the cordial velcome which then greeted me how grteful that greeting was to my heart then i can hardly tell you lily reception tonight proves to me once more that one of ttuo most salient points of english cha racter is its independent stability he feelings of grati fication are alloyed in this instance wvith one grief i hope this assembly and the noble lord who pre sides will pardon me if i also check for a moment tne mirth of a social gathering like this with a tribute to one who was to have filled the chair this evening and whose place alas  is empty i feel it to be my duty to do it on behalf of au my colieagues for he vas a worthy representative of his coantry a worthy represoe tative of diplomacy a true representative of those old traditions which the french call  ifs bokznes traditions which taught us that forbearance andnmay be looked upon not as wveaknesses dultasweapons not the less powerful because tenn peredj by toie arts of peace let me now gentlemen turn once more to a joytul subject and express my deep satisfaction in seeing at my side the noble lord who so ably presided this evening and who has given my name in such friendly terms itb would ill become me were i to attempt to recapitulate the services rendered by lord carlingford to his country but i may bo allowed to give vent to my personal feelings of friendship towards him and his amiable companon bor to bila and to his noble lady my first and lasting imlpression of true english hospitality is due eleven years have passed since i vas intrusted with an honourable but equally delicate mission to this country i was called upon to represent the in terests of germany at a time when the task was less gratefu alnd easy than it now is politjral circumstances and events had made it almost imnossible for me to he a really welcome guest and at tais very time your hairmans house was always open to me and that house has since becn to me a home i vish i could claiin a home in his illustrious insti tution but to my deapest regret i must confess that i have none to urge lut rhe kind reception you have accorded to ma to othercharitable institutions vhen i have the honour of being asked i can at least coni tribute my mite like others but here more is required and howv shall i establish it  it may not be unmnown to yoa that during miy  years of active ninisterial life i have been oiten reproacoed vith writing too muh today in presence of such champions of literature asem bledtnas evenigi see thatinsteactof havirgvrittentoo muich i have vritten too little or rather nothingat all perhaps i muay have rendered ai service to my fellowmen by sparing them the publication of some literary attempts and m one respect i may even assume an indirect claim inasmuch as during my officialcarecrihave negotiated several treatiesfor the betterprotectionof thesights of authorsand thisatleast i think l may consider as a proof of unselfish disinterested ness but gentlemen i cannot aspire to a place in the iterary inuer circle i still feel myself able to appreciate the true value of literature more especially in an age so replete with strife and contradiction as ours t his age has a cosmopolitan tendency everything tends to bring the nations nearer tcgether and so to speak to amalgamate them treaty alter treaty is concladed to in crease commerce and navigation to regulate justice on in tersiatieni principles for the protechson of literary pro perty for the protection of trade marks and ptents cor respondence through the medium of the post is so easy so cheap that theo only facility it our wanting is that the sender should receive instead of paying the postage and the telegraph the telegraph haa so put a girdle round the world that e the capitat of one empire tne thoughts of the leading statesmen in one are known and pubihsned before he himself has conceived them ought one not to conclude that nations should be actuauy united in brotherly bonds and that all wvould tend to eternal peace but no  in less thau  years three great wars have passed over europe not wvithstanding that a few years before it had been decided by aneuropeanagreement that an appealtoapeace ful mediator should he made previously to the trial by battles light we nottheninfer that the nearer the nations become the moro they knowv of one another the less thev like each other  we knwo indeed from our copybooks that overfamiliarity breeds contempt  let us hope that this is not the true explanation but howv satisfactory it is to turn from this painful inconsistency to the peaceful labour in the fields of literature literature also is essentially cosmopolitan it also tends to unite nations it also has its strife butits battles never de stroythey orate the victory of the one does not entail the defeat of the other conquests are made but no loss is expesenced by the conquered wvould that as much could be said of nations  i know that it is difficult to draw a comparison between polities and literature  but still gentlemen there exists one fundamental principle which explains the conciliatory genial silnuence of literaturethat is the true respect and appreciation of the worth of another when the time comes tht nations adopt this as their mottowhich i am sorry to say is not yet there will be in nations as in literature but one strife that of generous and peaceful rivalryviceniadeellor sir il maxm next proposed the houses of parliamentlord stanley of alderley briefly replied for the house of

deplived the society of the presence on this occasion of the distinguished and attractive man who was to have occupied the chair noone couldhave filieditmoreworthilythan thelatecomte de jarnac by his birth and course ot life he exhibited a happy admixture of the french english and he might add irish characters hear the count was equally at home in the literatures of england and france and was a ready and graceful speaker aed writer in both tongues death had cut short a great career which was renewed very late but es his friends thought and hoped not too lateafter halt alifetime of disappointment and retirement spent most useflly in the performanee of unobtruive duties half alifetime of unmixed and uncomplaining fidelity to publiohonourandpublic principle cheers reverting to the toast ho lead to propose the noble chairman said heo lately submitted to the operation of bein coached with regard to the working of the literary fund the peculiarity ihowever of the coaching was that he was absolutely forbiddento mention the muostinteresting part of the in formationhereceived rhe officials of the society fur nished him with wveapons which would have proved very powerful on the present occasion if he had been allowed to use them but they were supplied on the condition that no use vwds to be made of them whatever a laugh one weapon was a colleetion of speeches delivered by the distinguished men whom he had the honour to succeed in that eair and vwhich he should eadeavaur as far as possible not to repeat and the other was one of the moat interesting documents he had ever seen namely the voluminous register of the society containing the name of every literary man who had ever received as sistance from the fund ho was forbidden however to mention a single name hear hear no doubt this was an excellent rule but it was a soniewhat tantauezinr one for if any chairman could raveal the serets of that book heweould assuredly excite attention and sympathy for his discourse hlowever the chairman must do what he could vithout revealing the informaion thus obtained inother words this society was destitute of thoso ordinary results which strike the eyes and the feelings of ordinary men it could not point to thousands of sick who had beea rnade whole or to hundreds of orphans who had been clothed and fed its operations were con ducted in the dark but nevertheless they involved a vast amount of personal and individual interest which if known would enlist the sympathy of the present audience sad of the country the extent of it operations was only known however to those officers of the society to whom was intrasted the task of dispensing the bounty of the sub scribersm this of course was as it ought to be cheers still it was difficult for the society to get beyond the comparatively limited circle of those who toek a real interest in literature and literary nmen and who had stuficient sympathy to enable them to dispense with the palpable details and the names lie wvas glad however tobe able to state that the ï¿½nancial position df the society was sound hoar hear two or three years ago mr gladstone renmarked that the society had hardly a oermeanent amount of ï¿½ a year for distribution among literary applicants butthat snm had beenexceeded inthe lastthree years andin the past year over ï¿½ had been so distributed hear bloreover a change had been gradually made which thln bestqjudges deemed to be of very considerable importance the money had beea distributed in somewhat larger sums than was formerly the case during the past year the dis posable sum ho had mentioned bad been divided among  grants whereas the number of grants amounted to  or st some yesrs ago when the sum to be disposed of as mush smaler than that vhichwasnowv available he thought the society ought now to be able to raise a larger revenue from the classes who were interested in english literature there had been a vast increase in the number of writers and readers since this society was projectedt a century ago he was not now pleading on behalf ofthe newspaper press which was well able to take care of itself but he might for a nmoment contrast the days of peblick adrcrtisers and evenino posts their scanty sheets and their letters signed  attclusmn f vorax or  ji unius with the mighty columns of owr moramig papers perhaps some people might
