preside and to represent the com panies on this occasion though i am rather amused by the selection he has made i understand he asked first of all an eminent lawyver to occupy the chair then a dis tinguished philosopher and hadt eventually to fall beck on an old pohticiam a laugh i ran hardly expect that anything i may say can add muclh to the knowledge of thore weo direct these banks however that may he i ask you first of all to consider what is a savings bank it is a place in wyhich the men wvho evork for these great in stitutionsnamely the railwayscan put their savings with perfect oonfidence in their safety and at the same time derive benefit from the money so kaid by it is a voluntary proceeding no man is compelled to do anything of this kind his money is perfectly secure on the fsith of the property of the company and he has an excellent security for the money so laid by so far then that is a savings bank and now i coene to consider by whom this bank has been created i think it was the suggestion of your respected chairman and no doubt he expected from at great results i fancy from huis ardent mind he may have expected more tha n the rcaeity had furnished  but still great benefit must result from it and it is to that benefit that i would nowv draw attention first it is re markable that working men at the present time are laying by anythig in the present state of the world population presses so much on the mcans of support the wages of labour are very low  and though your wales may be high in comparison wvith those of many other persons in this country stim oat of the wrages of labour a man vwith a family may find it very difficult to save hear hear honour be to that man vhn under such circumstances does save he sacrifices lis present enjoyment for future good and that one thing makes what maybe cailed a virtue it is the forbearance of present plessure in the ex pectation of fature rewrard cheers it is all very well or a man vith thousands a year to lay by money fle can do it with ease i recollect once hearing or tvo great noble menfather and sonmeeting together and in the fancy that they ought to save money beginnine by deducting one course ait dinner comnpare that with the case of a man wvith a family of five children and vinth wvages such as they are now sitting down with his vife to consider invwhatvwaythey might heabletosave hear hear what can a husband save after having provided food and clothing forhismwifeandhimuselfand education for their children out of what i may caul the miserable pittance he receives in the shape of wages hear bear it is a great virtue for a mnan unaer such circutm stances to lay by anything and if he does lay it by it is of great importance to him that it should be safe and should also be remunerative an ordinary savings bank has no security comparedwith thesavings banks non under con sideration estatalished as they are under an act of patlia inent anm having as security the property of thu railways for the nmoney you lay by inerefore your monei is quite safe for until england fails this railway secaity mast continue and you have the best guarantee that englishmen can hopc for then again what is the interest for your money  the interest of the ordinary savings banks was abcut  per cent certainly not  but here you have  per cent and that is a temptation to lay by your money i know it is a great sacrifice for you at present to lay by anything but still it is an inducement for you to do so as far as you possibly can what the railway comspanies want to do in these cases is to create habits of thrixtand to have good workmen and honest servants cheers the position of working men has been politicaly changed within the kst few years you have asked for it and have got itthat is a share in the management of the business of tho cotintry you are in fact part of the governing body and yeu are worthy of that greatt trust snhe intteseats of england depend now to a considerable extent on the condfine of workngmen and i as a politi cian feel deeply that the more interests like these can be created and fostered and the mnore the working man can be induced to save the greater will be the safety of the country in the hands of you the working men and by your t ninda and determination the futuro interests andrtune of england sill to a great exteut depend it may be said there is some mischief from one point of vieov in inducing young people to save and i will tell you what that means lt means that when a young man finds he has the iummediate means of providing for himself he takes unto bimself a wife and toe consequenco perhaps is that he has a large family resulting in a pressure on the means of subsistencc for population increases faster than the wealth of the country it is supposed that economy leads to that mischievous result i do not believe it in the contrary i believe the habit of tluift induces a young man to consider wetl before he takes the solemn step of entering into the bonds of ratrinonyandepeciauy vhetherbe can well maintain the fataly he is sure to bave  and the thrift he himself has exercised he will teach to his progeny we may male ourselves great among the nations of the earth hut if the core and body of the country should deteriorate the character of englishmen and england will sink it is on that great foundation her interests are built and those in terests depend on her vorking population her philoso phers are great her poets and historians are the wonder of the world but theydont make the country working men male the country the tolling mlaltitudes are its bone and sinew andguided by thinling menthose who think and those wvho toil i hope to see england take as it were a fresh bound namong the countries of the earth and berome more than ever the envy of surrounding nations and the wondler of the world cheersafter the transaction of some formal business the mect ing at the instauce of sir kinatchbulll hugessen passed a cordlial vote of thanks to their distinguished chairman mr roebuck and with that the proccedings terminated
