of the sustentation fund which gave the total amount of contributions during the year asi �oincrease �s by asso ciations �increase � and by legacies and donations �increase � in submitting the report dr wilson referred to the ivaluable services rendered to the church by the late dr buchanan wbose exertions during the  years he was convener of the sus tentation fund committee had contributed so largely to the success of the scheme he said that thero were  ministerial charges of the free church and there remained only  charges the ministers of which did not participate in the surplus fund by reason of the smallness of their contributions such results were very gratifying and encouraging but by no means of a character to lead to the indulgence of laxity or indifference on tle part of the deacaoes courts or the members of the church they had not yet realized what was proposed to be done and finishing what was inaugurated by dr buchanan would be the most enduring wreath they could lay upon his grave applause in conclusion he had to declare that the equal dividend for the year was  that the surplus to each minister whose congregation had con tributed at the rate of s per member was � and the surplus to ministers whose congregations contributed at the rate of s u or less than ixs per member was � applauserf vxstos stirling moved the adoption of the report vwhich was seconded by

in anticipation of the debate on the patronage actprincipal rarry gave inthe report on the subject which stated that the recent act acknowledges that an ancient wrong inflseted on the scottish people is no longer de fensible and affords a vindication of tho views and proceedings of the founders of the free church in the act recently passed there may be an extension or a confirmation of the churchs statutory jurisdiction settle ment of ministers but there is nothing that even appears to modify or reverse the maims of the erse church as jto the power of the civil courts th effect of it appears tobe simply thisthab it diminishes the likelihood ofcolli sion between the church and the courts of law in one class of cases the established church bas not since  pro posed to make it a point of conscience not to intrude ministers on congregatiois but if that should beoome a point of conscionce in the established church the act ltely passed would diminish the risk of collision with the courts of law in so far as it withdraws from cases of settlement of parishes the rights of the formerpatrons the state must be conceived to legislate as regulating wth equal authority all church affairs and in the light of that fact the recent act must be contemplated and in the same light one must contemplate whatever future legislation the changing condlitions of party and opinion may bring to pass in reference to the establishmentsthe rev sir henry moxcreifit moved that the church continues to protest against the principle of lawv laid down by the house of lords which led to the disrup tion that the recent act does not change that plin  ciple but tends to confim it that the freo church has attained a position she is not prepared to abandon for re establishment that the existing connexion between church and state being unscriptural ought to be brought to an end in the interest of religion and presbyterianism and that the church should use all right means to enlighten public opinion on the subjdct sir hienry nmoncreiff sup ported his motion in a long speech in which he upheld the right of the free church to spesl on the subject and to give a reason why she maintained an organization separate from the establishment he maintains it lays more with the establishment to come to the freo church than for he free church to go to the establishmentdr elder rothesay seconded the motiondr bfgg moved that the recent legislation is an important tribute to the principles maintained in  and while removing a leading cause of division among scet tish presbyterians makes it hopeful that other causes of division may be removed and that the presbyterianism of scotland may be united on reformation principles he regarded the liberty of the church as beyond all price and not to be sacrificed on any account whatever ap plause he did not agree that there was anything offensive in the statemuent at the commencement of his overture that they rejected ebiatianism on the one hand and voluntary ism on the other the protest set forth that it was the right and duty of the civil magistrates to support an estab lishnexta f religion according to the word of od  volun taries maintained that civil legislation of right not to ex tend beyond the outward and secular affairs of nations that kind of voluntaryism he as cordially repudiated as the erastianism which was maintained before the disruption and apparently was maintained still in certain quartersafter some remarks against the power given to churches in the establishment to alter forms of worship and intro duce instrumental musicdr begg proceeded to say he was disposed to regard as vastly imuportant the fact that the established church was in so far as the settlement of ministers was concerned re stored to the position which the church occnpied at the time of the revolution settlenient applause they bad heard strong statements that day to the effect that as long as it was possible for the civil magistrates to interfere with the internal affairs of the church they could not be safe but would they bo safe afier they had the revolution settlement abolished by disestablishment  if they did get disestablishment they would not be better off than they were at present  hear hear and oh he was not prepared to say that all the difficulties were now removed and although he was perfectly contented to be in the free church delighted to be in it and would re joice exceedingly if his bretbren could see their way to give uip agitating on this subject altogether until they saw how matters would turn yet at the same time he would not be forced into maintaining what he knew to be un tenablethat they would get more liberty or more advantages by the success of the course they were now pursuing even if �hey were successful

innocence loud laughter and applause knox thought that he would do ihat when he spoke of reconstruction but the landlords put the money into thfir pockets laughter some one had said that there wvere
