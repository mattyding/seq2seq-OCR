terrible story bas just been unfolded at the assize court of nimes i will tell it as briefly as i cana spaniard cauled jaime sancho had for many years lived with his wife at beaucaire the husband was a chiffonier and as the couple were laborious and honest they enjoyed an excellent re putation and were esteemed by all who knew them by dint of hard work they had managed to save a sum of nearly sf with which they purposed to return to their native place tarragona andtherebuy back a little property which had formerly belonged to the family last october indeed they had mmde a journey with this object but not being able to come to terms with the proprietor they had returned to beaucaire while waiting for some good investment for their earnings they hid the money in the house where they lived alone in the grande rue on the th of november at  oclock in the morning they received a visit from a fellowcountryman who announced himself as one josd vaque and said he was sent by sanchos brotherinlaw named praty to announce his arrival at marseilles and to say that his son had been arrested by order of the spianishl consul as wishing to avoid the conscription vaque further produced a letter purporting to be from praty re questing his brotherinlaw to come at once to his assistance at marseilles and asking him to receive faque as a friend sancho therefore at once de parted for marseilles and left his countryman in stalled in his house vaque went out twice during the evening and ten minutes after his return on the second occasion at about halfpast  the doorbell rang msadame sancho was going downstairs to answer it when a thick woollen covering was thtwn over her head from behind by vaque and at the same time the house door was opened and a second man entered the newcomer at once rushed towards the unfortunate woman and commenced beating her about the head and body with a bludgeon madame sancho it should be added being enceintc at the time the two ruffians next garotted her and tied her hands together with a rope and then her keys were taken from her pocket the newcomer saying to vaque in spanish hold her fast i know where the money is what was the poor womans horror to recognize the voice of her husbands own brother francisco sancho y carettawhomshe had left in spain a month before and supposed till to be there  evidently he knew of their money and she remembered that he had asked them to lend him f and had even struck her on their refusal she at once saw her terrible position and that there was only one chance of eacapenanmely to remain perfeetly still this she did with marvellous selfpossession while vaque still held her and francisco sancho was rifling the drawrer whern th money was kept not a word not a groan escaped her lips though she must have been in fearful pain at last francisco sancho said  we have what we want the wretch then drew a long catalonian knife and stabbed his sisterinlaw with it six times successively still this really heroic woman played her i difficult part ntot a cry did she utter nor give any sign of lifenot even when her brotherin law puthis hand to her heart and said to vaque  she is dead the ruffians then enveloped their victim in all the linen they could find and hur riedly left the house by a miracle not one of the kmifethrusts had touched a vital part though they were all aimed throuagh the covering at the heart the poor woman faint and bleeding managed by means of her teeth to free herself from the linen the woollen cloak and the cord and crawled to her bed where her screams brought no assistance for the room did not open upon the street her agony that night must have been awful at last in the morning assistanco arrived the alarm was given and the assassins were arrested at mlontpeuier at the trial madame sancho gave her evidence in the clearest way and described the minutest details of the terrible scene which she had undergone her appear ance in court naturally excited the greatest sympathr m millet a doctor deposed that mladame sancho had only escaped by what i have already called it above a miracle the jury found both prisoners guilty withwhy it seems hard to decideextenuating circumstances in favour of vaque francisco sancho was therefore con demned to death and vaque to penal servitude for lfe no one who reads these lines wiill assuredly
