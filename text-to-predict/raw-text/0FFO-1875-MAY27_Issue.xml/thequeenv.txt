qrnxe q v chatrellan important question was here raised asto the power to review decisions of magistrates at sessions by the com mission of the peace it was provided that in cases of diffi culty the justices should not give judgment nxcept in the presence of one of the judges and as late as the end of the th century as may be szen in sir christies  life of lord shaitesbury the judges sometimes sat with the justices at the sessions and the justices sat with the judges at the assizes and to this day they attond at the assizes and there are alvayg some of them on the bench the practice however of cases reserved from the sessions being heard at the assizes or of judges sitting at the sesslions became obsolete in the course of the last century and a practice arose of the magistrates deciding a case con ditionallysubject to a case to be aubmitted to this court the case and their judgment or order bein brought up by writ of certirrari for the purpose of oltaining the epinion ofthiscourt in tho courseoof the last century however the practieo arose of inserting in statutes giving the magistrates power of summariy convicting a clause taking awaiy the certiorari  practice whilch lord eenyon said bad been carried too far this court howvevr in lord mansfields time held that the effect of the provision taking ay the certiorari was to preclude the practice of sending up cases to this court for its opinion and the ques tion was now raised whetherthisdecsion wastobe up held and whether the party having been convicted unde a statute taking away the certiorari the case could be brought up to this court for its opinon the court had taaken time for considerationmer justice fel now delivered a learned judgment to the effect that the decision of the court in lord mansfields time must be considered as binding so as to preclude the court from entertaining the case after referring to daltons  justice of the peace  and dickensons il quarter sessions  for the form of the commission and tracing the history of the old practice and the rise in the last century of ths modern practice of stating a case for the opinion of this courttbe learned judge went on to say that it appeared from nolans  poor laws that in the time of lord hardwicke the modern poetice had arisen the question whether the case was one of difficalty or not was decided by tho justices and if they stated  case then a writ of certiorari was necessary to bring the case before the court that being the only way in which the order could be brought before the court balt as many orders were quashed for technical objectionsin an age when such objections had more force than they had nowit became usual to insert a clause in statutes giving powers of snmmary conviction providing that orders or convictions should not be quashed for errors of formand that the writ of certiorari should not be issued to bring up orders to this court no doubt this provision was directed against technical objec tions and was not intended to exclude the jurisdiction of the court to entertain asid determine substantial auea tions which the justices themselves desired to subnit to this court for determination and if the matter were rcs integra the court would be inclined to hold that a writ of certiorari to bring up a case stated by the sessions was not excluded by the provision taking away the certiorari but then there was the decision of the court in the time of lord mansfield that the jurisdiction of this court was ex piuded by that provision and in  tho decision was recognized by this court in a case however in which the objection to tho jurisdiction was waived and in which mr justice erlo said the cgislature toek awa the writ of certiorari inany cases because it had been used for the purpose of en forcng objectins to mere informality in the proceedings but if the nse of it werqr restored for the purpose of raising questions of substance for the opinion of h sun rior courts it wiould be a salutary addition to the aws  the queen vijickensonn  ellis and blackbuars rethe eaed judgo went on to say that the court were of opinion that their jurisdiction was excluded in such eases but they concued in the opuinon of r justice erle in the casa referredl to and they thought that the attention of the legislature might very wel be directed to the subject so as to allow of cses being brought up to this coart atthe aesire of the magistrates to raise sub stantial questions of law az the law istood however the eurisdictioxmeoa thez cobt was exclded and the wet of esiorar issued in this case must be quashed
