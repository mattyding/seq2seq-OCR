the finance bilxne house flaving again gone into coromittee on this bill resuned the consideration of clause  which is as follows where property liable to estate duty is settledby the wilt of the deceased or after ida ideath reaims settled by virtue of any disposition a a further estate duty on the principal value of the property shau be levied at the rate hereinafter specified but b if estate daty has alreadybeen paid in respect of such property since the date of the settlement neither the estate duty nor the further estate duty shall be again payable in respect thereof unless the deceased was at the time of his death or had been at any time competent to dispose of such property  in the case of settled property where the interest of any person under the settlement fails or determines by reason of his death before it becomes an interest in possession and subsequent limitations under the setthement continue to subsist the property shall not be deemaed to pass on his deathiii a gp iuxbay moved an amendmuent with the object of providing that in all cases of property remaining settled in the manner described in the clause there should be one paymuent only of the further esctate dutythe solicitorgenerai suggested that the amendment should take the followine form during the continuance of any settfement the f er estate duty shall not be payable more than oncemr a g murray was not sure that that was the most statisfactory fona that could be given to the amendmentthe chancellor of the exciequer explained that it was the intention of the government that under all settlements one further estate duty should be paid and no moreo after some conversation it was agreed to  leave the matter to the futher consideration of the government and the amendment was by leave withdrawnthe solicitorgeneral in pursuance of a former arrangement moved to add at the end of sub sectioub  and during the continuance of any settlement further estate duty shall not be payable more than oncemr t g bowles objected to the word further it seemed to him that estate duty should be levied no more than oncemrjames lowther didnot thinkthewordscarried out the undertaking given and hoped it would be made clear that while an estate remained in settle ment payment should be made once onlythe chancellor of the exchequer believedthe words carried out the understanding come to with the right hon member for st georges and hoped that they would be accepted for the presentthe amendment was agreed tomxlr butceier moved to add a new subsection as follows  c if the only life interest in such pro perty arising on the death of the deceased be that of a husband or wife of the deceased the further estate duty shall not be payable  he referred to an amend ment issued by the government in explanation of the budget which seemed to show that in the case stated the government contemplated carrying out what was proposed by the amendment and he urged that marriage settlements as the embodiment of thrift and foresigt chiefly for the benefit of children ought to be treated more leniently than otherssir r wrebster supported the amendment which seemed to him to carry cut what was suggested by the memorandumthe chancellor of the exchequer said the only question was how far the amendment corre sponded to the words used in the memorandum he understood that where a wife alone took a life interestsir r websteror the husbandor the husband no other life interest intervenedsir r webster said that was sothe chancellor of the exchequer said as the amendment therefore carried out the intentions of the government as expressed in the memorandum he should accept it hear hearthe amendment was agreed tomr bartley moved to insert after the word property  the following  in the case of settlements made previous to the passing of this act a no further estate duty shall be payable on the principal value of the property b on the death of the person settling the property estate dutyr shall be paid according to the scale in section   c on the dleath of other persons interested in the settlement no estate duty or further estate duty shall be payable during the continuance of the settlement the chancellor of the exchequer said they entirely accepted the principle of this amendment hut suggested that it should be deferred to a later stagemr bartley assentedmr byrne moved to add the following words to the clause  neither estate duty nor further estatety shall be payable in respect of pronerty com prised in a marrlage settlement and not in the aggre gate exceeding at the date of the settlement in value or amount the sum of £ so long as such pro perty is enjoyed under or by virtue of the settlement by the wife husband or issue of the marriagethe chancellor of the exchequer said they had already discussed the subject at great length and decided upon it he had pointed out that when a man left his money to his wife and children by will probate duty bad to be paid but if tho property was settled it did not pay duty h lie admitted that settlements were some times useful and advantageous but they were opposed to the principle embodied in the bill and ought not in any case to have a preference fiscalair j w lawtitn said the amendment would apply only to settlements under £ and it would be well to protect marriage settlements especially wheu they were for small amountslr butchier pointed out that in the budget the chancellor of the exchequer had fiscally favoured small incomes and small properties and if he could leok favourably upon any kind of settlements he maight with advantage single out marriage settlements ele did not attach special importance to the figure of £luoo and would be quite content if the amount of £ were fixedthe chancellor of the exchequer confessed that he did not want to encourage any settlement by fiscal exemptionur gosceen said it was clear that his hon and learned friends could make no impression upon the chancellor of the exchequer and therefore he would not advise them to dividethe amendment was by leave withdrawn  on the return of the chainszx after the ° usual intervalmr j g lawson rose to move as a ne w subsec tion to clause   c if upon the death of any person estate duty shall become payable in respect of any property upon which the farther estate duty bas been paid or become payable by or on behalf of such person there shall be deducted from such estate duty the amount of the further estate duty so paid the point of the amendment was he explained to secure that settled estates should not pay the extra  per cent for a benefit which the owners did not get under the clause as it stood it was possible that when property passed in regular succession from father to son the estate duty and a further estate duty of  per cent might have to be paid by each generation that he thought was unjustthe solicitorgeneral said the further estate duty of  per cent was accepted and treated as in the nature of a compromise and on the whole he thought that compromise was favourable to settlements made in good faith nxo particular class of settlementslught to he treated phreferentially he was unable therefore to accept the amendmenmtmr goschen said the necessity for the amendment again proved that the system of taxation laid down by the governmet in the bill would work great injustice in individual casesmr t g bowles said that he must con  fess that he could not understand upon what nrinciple it was proposed to levy this further estate uty upon settled property and he desired to enter his strong protest against the proposalsir r webster said that his object in rising was to give the hon and learned gentleman the solicitorgeneral notice that unless some satisfactory arrangement werer come to upon this he should feel it to be his duty to raise the question again upon the report he trusted how ever that his hon and learned friend behind him would be satisfied with the discussion thatwhad taken place and ould withdraw his amendmenut hiear hearmr butcher said that under the clause as it stood two estate duties and a further estate duty might be levied upon an estate that passed thrugh the hands of two tenants for lifethe solicitorgenieral said that he thought that the clause as it stood was correct the govern ment thought that where a property was settled a further estate duty of  per cent ought to be paidthe amendment was withdrawnmr butceer moved to insert at the end of the clause the following if upon the death of the deceased a life or any less interest in such property arises to the wife or husnand of the deceased the payment of the estate duty aud the further estate duty shall if otherwise payable he postponed till after tlhe determination of such interesthe did not propose to exempt from any duty what ever he simply proposed to postpone pa ent of the estate duty until after the death of the wifethe solicitorgeneral olpposed the amend ment and said that of all the forms of induleence this was the most undesirable besides it wo ld intro duce confuaion into the administration besides the amendment would not give relief to the poor onlythe widowof the millionnaire would be able to claim the indulgence with an incomne of £ or £ a yeartir r webster said it was quite plain to him that the solicitorgeneral came lown to the house that i evening having forgotten all about the treasury paper which had been issuedit was no question of indulgence it wvs a  question of simple abstract justice hear hear the only real argument of the solicitor general was an adminibtrative one and he hoped that on that point the hon and learned member would make some further inquiries hear hearmr t gp bowles said the amendment would add only the same kind of difficulties wbich already existed in the collection of the succession duties hear hear and it hardly lay in the month of her majestys tovernment to raise the objection of administrative difficulties when the whole schemebrised amum es l dificulties which would prove to be asolely in uperable and which would make the measure so n workable that after the experience of one year or at the outside two years any government would fnd it necessary practically to repeal the act cheers the government had scarcely realized what they would do by this scheme with regard to widows having failed to obtain figures from the government he had at the cost of great labour drawn sp tables of the duties and of their effect upon different smna they had taken him so much time and he was so proud of them that he was almost inclined to move for them as a return laughter and hear hear they had been quite a revelation to him under the guise of making a diminution in the charge on snall estates and on widows aud orphans the bill made an enormous addition to that charge and more especially with regard to settled estates he was not going to deal with the wicked millionnaire or his wicked wife or with the still more wicked person whom he admired in his youth laughter he would take the estate of a widow who on a property of £ left by will had now to pay s but who under the bill would have to ay  and equally the child who now paid s woud have to pay £ under a settlement instead of paying s us now she would have to pay £ but while the widows charge considerably increased in numerous cases the straugers charge would be very considerably diminished on an estate of d for instance a stranger would at present pay £ but under the bill he would pay only £ surely that was a mad way of going on laughter there were other strange things disclosed by the table which he had prepared and he hoped to have olher oppdr tunities of referring to it hear hear the amend ment was one which her majestys govemment might adopt since it only carried out the principle accepted earlier in the evening by the chancellor of the exchequer cheersmr gosce said his hon friend had raised some extremely important matters and the light which he had tharown upon the case of a wvidow would have to be very carefully considered by the committee cheers the fact wias that every day some new oints in this extraordinary bill were beng brought to light and he hoped his honfriend would pursue his studies cheers the committee had not yet had froia her miajestys governmnent nearly enough information as to the fiscal results of this proposal he asserted that tlere w ere no administrative diffi culties in the way of the amendment which would baffle the inland revenue or the department which dealt with the death duties ile knew something of the extraordinary omniscience and ageity with which the department acted and he could not admit that the simple proposal topostpone the duty was an administrative difficulty with which the inland revenue would he incompetent to deal or that it would largely increase their labours hear hear he thought however that his hon friend might well be satisfied with the facts which had been brought out without dividing the committeehir byrne said their contention was that the chancellor of the exchequer was now imposing a duty which combined not merely the old probate duty but an increase of the old succession and legacy duties  and that being so they were entitled to ask the right hon gentleman to apply the same rules as in the case of succession and legacy duties to the new estate datyhe committee divided when there votedfor the amendment     against     majority against   mr butchier moved to add at the end ofthe clause words providing that any person paying the duty payable under the section upon pro perty comprised in a settlement may deduct the amount of the ad vatorci stamp duty if any charged on the settlement the object he explained was substantiallv to put wills and settlements upon the same footing in regard to the payment of dutythe chancellor of the exchequer thought it reasonable to allow the ad ralbrevs stamp duty to be deducted and therefore he was prepared to accept the amendment if it were verbally altered so as to read  any person paying the further estate duty pas ablecmr butcher said that before he acceptea the amendment suggested by the right hon gentleman he should like to ascertain what would be the practical effect produced by the insertion of the words further estatemr goschen thought that as wills nnd settle meents were to be placed in futare upon the same foot ing property passing under a will should not be charged a higher duty than property passing under settlementafter some further discussion the committee divided and the numberswerefor the amendment to the amendment  against    majority for     the amendment as amended was then agreed toon the question that the clause as amended stand part of the billmr bartley said they might fairly ask why this extra duty should be placed on settled property wise settlements promoted thrift and benefited the com munity in many ways and the fact that the law of settlement wes not absolutely perfect ae the present time was no reason why they should discourage this desirable habit by penalizing it the clause increased the duty on small estates very heavily in the case of a settled estate of £d the estate duty was actually doubled the clause in his opinion ought to operate in the opposite direction and to encourage people in every legitimate way to make provision for those whom they left behindsr t g bowvles saw no reason why additional duty should be laid on property because it was settled on the contrary as settled property could not escape the hand of the chancellor of the exchequer it deserved favourable treatment but the chancellor of the exchequer as he confessed pursued settled property in this ruthless manner because he thonght it was the resource of the wealthy and related to landed property in particular and the right hon gentleman was determined to injure the landowner but by far the largest proportion of the settlements that were made were made by compara tively poor people such as young men at the time of their marriage such meritorious and thrifty provi sions ought to be encouraged an estate of £ coming to a widow now without settlement would pay s under the bill it would pay £ and if settled £ no doubt this had not been done pur posely but only foolishly and unreflectively like so much else in the bill cheers a stranger in blood inheriting £ would under the present law pay  under the bill he would pav £ or if the estate were settled £ a stranger in blood inheriting £ would pay £ under the present law under the bill he would pay only £ or if the estate were settled £ while the tax was doubled in some instances or even quadrnpled on the widow the stranger in blood was let off threefourths of the tax be now paid cheers on an estate of £ the extra tax on the widow was  per cent and on the stranger in blood only  per cent this was an extraordinary state of things for a democratic chan cellor of the exchequer to produce cheersthe chairimax mr robyorder order tbe hon member is going too far into detailsmr t g bowlesthen i will give a last instance laughterthe chairmnorder order i must request the hon member not to proceed furthermr bowles regretted that he was not  allowed to go into the discussion of the further estate duty a voice move the adjourn ment this further estate duty seemed to regr the stranger with great favour and to deal with the widow and the orphan with extreme disfavour theseere they pointing to inisters who spoil widows houses and for a pretence mqakne long perorations lanebtermr ambrose contended tlat no justification had been shown for the further estate duty imposed by clause  it was supposed to apply to settlements only but he could find only one set of cases which vould be exempt from its operation so that instead of this being a further duty payable in particular instances it would practically amount to an addi tional  per cent in almost every conceivable case apart from the mere question that this was an im position and an unfair imposition there were social questions involved if hesy were to have the duty regulated by the form of the bequest efforts wouli be constantly made to evade the duty and poor reonle would become involved in litigation it was in his viewthedutyofthe chancellor of theexchequertoraise the revenue he required without putting poor people to these temptations and risks for these reasons he opposed the clause hear hearmir brodrick did not think that tbe speech of the member for kings lynn should have been allowed by the government to remain umanswerel hear bear no doubt the object of the clause was to create an absolute equality between pqrsonalty and realty but what about the result  kn the case of a settlement created before this bill became law and passing to lineals and in weich one life had already erpired the amount of the settled roperty being £ realty and £ personalty tne personalty would have paid £ and been cleared for the remainder of the settlement while the realty would have paid £ in all and yet this was put forward as equality hear hear if the property passed to a nephw the personalty would have paid e while the realty would have maid £namely succession duty before the bill £ and after the bill estate duty  and succession duty £ he thought it was absolutely impossible that the govermnent could have contempted these figures when they framed the bill and be wished the chancellor of the ex chequer were now present hear bear while aclknowledging the courteous way in which the solicitorgeneral bad met all the points raised he would point out that it was not by leal points but by individual cases of hardshnptsa the bih would be judged by the country at large the taxation laid on realty under settlement by this clause would amount to half as mnuch again as the taxation on personalty in this there was grave inequality which might be unintentional but which was indensible uniess you were to set to work to put a retrospective penalty on land his request was that before this clause was passed thegovernmentwould hold out some hope that under clause  the exemption given to personaltv which bad paid probate would be extended to realty and that thus sfle bill would be made to harmonize with the professions of fthe government hear bearmxr goscfren boned thev would have an ptnsweffrom the government on some of he poits raised  hear hear and  progress he could weu understand that the temporary absence of the chan cellor of the exleqler was not due to uay disrespect to the committee but that it was to be accounted for by his desiring to obtain more information upon fanncial points a t the same time he ought to be rep reserited by some one capable of deding with those points in the committee the clause bad beeifla posi tively riddled in its financial nspect lat an extra ordinary name was further estate dutyv w  ie bhad never beard of  further incometax  or  furtber bonse duty laughter the government claimed to have attained to simplicity by diminishing the mumber of death duties but with estate duty suc cession duty legacy duty and farther estate duty there were really four duties left he hoped the government would invent another and a better name for the further estate duty it had been shovw to be very unequal in its operation varying from  to  per ent of the original he should like to impress upon the chancellor of the exchequer who had returned to his seat the point urged by the bon member for surrey that in clause  there was an exemption which favoured personalty nt the expense of realtynso clause  said estate duty shall not bepayable on fte death of a deceased persun in respect of personal property settled or by a will or disposition made by a person dying before the com niencement of this act in respect of which property probate or account duty has been paid he wished to know whly a similar privilege was not given in the case of realty this unfair treatment as between the two classes of property was as had been shown a flaw in the billthe clause was ngreed to clause  was s follows estate duty sll be a stamp duty collected ad recovered as hereinafter mentioned the executor of the deceased shall pay the estate duty in respect of all personal property wheresoever situate of which the deceased was competent to dispose at his deati on delivering the inland revenue affidavit and may pay in like mamner the estate duty on any other property passing on such deathx estate duty so far as not paid by the executor

the duty when collected upon an account shall be paid on the delivery of the account except that the daty an real property may at the option of the person paying the duty be paid either n the delivery of tbe account or with interest at the rate of s per cent per annum by eighst eqa yaerly instalments and the interest on the unpaidi porhion of the duty shall he added to each instalment and paid accordingly and in the event of nonpayn ment shall be parr of the instalment in nrrenrmr butcheer moved an amendment under which an executor would only lbe bound to pay the estate duty upon such kinds of property as were now subject to probate duty he said that under the bill as it stood the executor would be expected to pay estate duty on all personal property wherever situated not only at home but abroad be would also have to find out whether any property passed under settlements in connexion with which the deceased had a general power of appointment and if such property did pass e woula have to pay duty upon it the duties of an executor would thus be most extensive and he ventured to say impracticable and the difficulties in the way of windingup estates woudbe enormonslyincreased he suggested that his amendment which wavs simple carried out the intentionas of the goverument better than that standing in the name of the solicitor eneral which referred only to testamettary dis po°sitionsthe checelloll of the exchiequier said the hon and learned member bad taken exception to every line and word and comma of the bill snply because he thought that the la officers and the inland revenue authorities knuewv nothing of their business and that be could draw the bill a great deal better than they could but he must excuse the governzment for thinking that the gentlemen who had frumed the bill knew quite as well as he did how it ought to be drawn the hon and learned members view of the administrative effect of the bill was founded on an entire misconception of the clauses relating to administration at any rate that was the view of those who had to deal with these affairs he had not himself the advantage possessed by the hona member of understanding these matters thoroughly but he was guided by men who did understana them and who had the administration of these affairs he believed that these men were aware of the circumstances with which they had to deal and knew how they should be dealt with he had confidence that the government draftsmen and the law officers were able to express in proper terms that whlch it was the desire of the government to carry out hear heerr baifour said he did mot rise to deul with the maerits of the gentlemen for he knew almost as little about them as the chancellor of the exchequer laugghter the right hon gentleman said le had to rely entirely on the adrice of the inland ieevenue authorities and the law officers in this matter in these ciremustances it would hane been well if he had left the defence of the drifting of the bill to the law officers who pre sumably knew something about it hear hear bt he must protest against the tone which the chancellor of the exchequer had thought fit to pursue towards his lion and learned friend he right hon gentleman bad been good enough to say that tha able gentlemen on whom he relied for advice were infallible and that it was gross impn dence on the part of any one on the opposition side of the hlouse to critcize their action if the attorney general and the inland revenue were infallible wly had the solicitorgeneral himself pat down an amend meat on the paper cheersand if the hon and learned gentleman was qualined to reform and improve the language of these infallible guides why might not another lion and learned member improve the language of the monitor of the infallible cheers and laughter he was especially puzzled by the attitude of the chancellor of the exchequer seeing that the olicitorgeneral had himself admitted that he owed sounething to the hon and learned member who had moved the amendment hear hear he did not wish to continue a debate in which those who had not joined the bar or who had left it for a long time cheers and
