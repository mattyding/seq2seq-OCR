the cormittee determined to place the needs of the hospital before the public  the chairman the hons bney holland took the mattee up andit was to hisd evotion and perseverance that the ceremony of

in reply saidgentlemen it has given the princess of wales and myself great pleasure to come here today and i thank you all on her behalf for the kind reception you have given us it will i am sure be roadily understood that i am able to accept but a small proportion of the numerous invitations which i receive to be present at the opening ceremonies of institutions but my deep and especial sympathy is with work of the natare of the poplar hospital and when i was asked to open it i was glad to find it was in my power to return an affirmative reply i have bad the satisfaction of serving on the royalcommission on the housing of the working classes of this great metropolis and have been deeply impressed by the evidence of the miser able surroundings of the homes of so manv of my countrymen it may take some years before any really adequate measures can be adopted to lesseu this evil but in the meanwhile it is most encou raging to see that hospital accommodation is increas ing in london although it is far below the wants of the poor it will indeed be a happy day when every poor person in london who cannot afford attendance at home has the best prospect offered him of a quick recoverv from illness in a thoroughly welladmini stered hospital i can imagine no charity which should appeal more strongly to the rich than this hospital for accidents for it posseses among other advanages that of being situated in the very district where it is most needed among crowds of poor and hardworking men i can conceive no disaster which calls more loudly for our sympathyand help than that of a serious injury sustained by one who is the head and main support of a familv cheers i am very glad to hear from you ir hills as p resident of the hospital that the employers of la oar in the district recognize and appreciate the work which has been done by the institution and i notice with pleasure that you as the largest employer have helped it very generously cheers i am greatly impressed by finding that tme hospital receives a warm support from the working classes themselves i had learut the fact before you mentioned it in your address that thousands of them subscribe and i have seen myself today by the num bers present as delegates of their different societies how genuine is their interest in its uccess i am anxious to say to the hundreds ofworking men whom i see around me that my knowrledgre of the fact of their own labours on behalf of this hosptial was one of the main causes which induced the princess of wales and myself to take part in these proceedings we learn with pleasure from the president that our presence has been of service and i thank those ladies and gentlemen whose names are mentioned in this list for their generosity i hear with much gratification that the hospital r entirely free from debt a fact which cannot be too highly commended especially as such a financial position is not  fear altogether usual among the london bospitals lyhere so many have been generous it may seem invidious to particu larize individuals but i cannot forbear from specially mentioning to yon the names of sir donald smith whose generosity in his own country is well known and who having inquired into the work done by this hospital has sent us the magificeat donation of glooo cheers i would nest mention baron hirsch who always a warm supporter of charitable institutions in this country has forwarded a donation of £ i think the committee have only paid sir donald smith a welldeserved compliment by naming a ward after him to perpetuate an act of such kind ness and liberality and i am glad to find that the other two large wards have been called after sir donald currie and mr john coles both of whom have been such benefactors to this hospital i wish in conclusion to say how greatly i admire the unselfdsh devotion of the honorary staff of this institution and these words of praise are i am satisfied applicable to the stafis of all our hospitals i am informed that two gentlemendr corner and dr brownlieldwho have served this hospital without fees or reward from the day of its opening  years ago are about to retire they have i am sure earned the gratitude of all connected with the institution and it must be a sincere pleasure to them to feel that the hospital for which they have worked so loag and zealously is yearly increasing in prosperity i heartilg wish the hospital every possible success and  will now ask the princess of wales to declare it open cheersthe przcxss  of wales then saidl have very great pleasure in declaring this hospital open
