indian affairsa month ago we called attention to the old prophecy that in the year  the sanctity of the ganges would pass from her waters to the narbada river the subject has now been taken up by the indian press and is producing a sense of disquiet more widely spread than the treesmearing scare in behar the fact is that what between the indignation meetings in every part of the country to protest against the sacrifice of indian finance to the manchester vote the late murderous feuds of the muham zuadans and hlindus the criminal trials for lander which have sprung out of missionary misrepresentations on the opium question and the demand for the public prosecution of a leading missionary journal for insulting native religious beliefs a wave of unrest has once again passed over india there is that general looking for something to happen which is the parent of prodigies many diverse classes are expecting a sign and each is ready to interpret any unusual occurrence as a portent granted on its own behali in such a state of popular feeling the gods are not idle in the air men hear their voices their feet on therocks are seenyet we alu say whence is the messge and whatmay these wonders mean the particular prophecy to which we referred has obtained a sudden prominence from certain changes which are this year taking place in the ganges in its upper gorges the damnedup waters of the birhi gaugga threaten destruction to a whole series of pilgrim shrines and a possible catastrophe to the temple city of rardwmr in its lower course  miles distant a great tributary the eosi seems on the point of brealkinu from its present bed and of forcing its way back into an ancient channel one of the most remarkable changes of a delta river on record says the calcutta englisihnan in the northwest it is the sacred line of holy places that is endangered in the southeast it is a flourishing british town a thicklypeopled jbritish district and a costly british railway we cannot be surprised that impending calamities on so vast a scale should give a neempasis to an old prediction a prediction which the gangetic brahmans used to scoff at as an inrention by the rival priests of the narbada shrines but which now seems pregnant with fatality to their own riverin the magnificent volume that records the recent travels of the cesarewitch through india a striking passage is devoted to this prophecy his imperial highness was apparently much struck by the synchronism of sueh a prediction with the mighty forces of disturbance intellec ual moral and religious which he saw atwork around him the prophecy seemed merely to give a geographical expression to thc fact that the whole inner life of india is entering on a period of change in another chapter the writer dwells on our inability to discern the revolution that is taking place the fault of our rule meritori ous in many respects is in his judgment its mechanical eharacterits want of insight into and sympathy with those spiritual factors which have in the long run always determnined the destiny of india these passages will shortly appear in the english translation which messrs allen and co are publishing of the cesarewitchs travels they form a curious commentary on the letter which we published from sir george jiirdwood on the shine subject in february  sir george mentioned that the river prophecy was being connected in the southern presidencey with a prediction of a meore political character as to the  annroaching end of british rule in india he pointed out how such a prophecy strongly affects the imagination and must move a people so im pressionable and devout as the brahmanical hindus le drew the same lesson from such auguries as that which seems to have oceurred to the mind of the cesarewitch  of late years be said  the reaction against european ideas has been rapidly gatheringforce in india and it is easy to comprehend how greatly it must be intensified by the asso ciations connectea with such a date as  and the close with the current decade of a great secular period the change really hoped for is not the end of british rule in india  but of the undue prominence of those aggressive w estern influences which wherever they reach are rapidly undermining the whole industrial social and religrious fabric of induism in no part of indin have those influences been so aggressive as in the gangetic lvalley and hindn orthodoxy may well seek refuge amid thei secluded retreats of the lnarbada from the icono clasm of bengalthis prophecy is a comparatively modern one it derives of course no authority from the veda nor have we after some inquiry been able to discover a reference to it in any text belonging to the classical sanskrit period the earliest authentic notice has been traced no lurther back than the bewaxlhanda a local sacred poem in honour of the ntarbada sixty years ago sir henry sleeman mentioned it in his journal as current in the narbada region of the central provinces about the year  sir monier mionierwilliams heard a good deal con cerning it from the brahmans of western india at ahmadabad the change was to take place in l of the sainiat era correspondino to  of our own the ceremonial cycye ofi the hindus is one of  years and the bathing festivals on the lauges have each th year a special religious value at the last of these cyclic anniversaries the devotion of the populace was stimulated by the rumour that they had better take adrantage of it lest the sanctity of the ganges should depart before the next occasion arrived utnprecedented multi tudes flocked to the bathiugplaces alon its banks and the demonstratiou was considered of suffcient importance to find its way into the offlial record of the periodthe western spirit has had to encounter two reactions in india since the government passed to the queen the muhamiadans being the smaller and more compact body moved first their nrotest against western influences took the form of abstention from our system of state education grdually developed into an attitude of aloofness from our government and culminated in frontier  eoly wars sup portel bv internal conspiracies which lord lawrence had to put down with a strong hand hinduism acts or reacts more slowly but when once in motion it has a volume and a momentum immeasurably greater than any movement of the indian musalmans there can be little doubt that such a movement is now in progress our system of public instruction has been sapping the faith of the people during two generations at first it lected only the welltodo classes but in the past  years the indigenous schools of the peasantry have been deliberately brought within the net of state insdection withresults social and political which are now be ginning to make themselves felt on the one band there is a halfdespairing cry for a return to the ancient pathsthat cry which when eloquently echoed by mrs besant rendered her tour through india one long triumph on the other hand there are ever fresh attempts to found new faiths modern christianity after having had a hearing has been decided against and the hahts associated with modern christianity seem to the indians to tend towards demoralization among tropical races the theistic sects which spring up in rapid succassion have failed to satisfy the popular needs various adaptations of buddhism are now being offered and are strurgling to create a new organization vith all the apparatus of affiliated societies and a periodical and tractarian literature prophecies ind portents are a populr espression of the jeep current which iis maidng its wvay inlto the heart of hinduismhfor the moment buddhistic beliefs in their lmodern forms seem to have taken a

hlaller has on several oceasions pointed out thattheluddhists are debtors to the brahmans in almost all their philosophical speculations the texts wvhich hle and professor cowell translate seem to
