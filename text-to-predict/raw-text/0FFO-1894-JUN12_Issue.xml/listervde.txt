defence pleaded that in jane  he was on terms of personal friendshid with the plaintiff and that she had verbally requlested him as a friendto assist her to procure a pair of carie horses for aboat £ she stated that they were to be about  hands as her carriage was small the defendant thereupon being desirous of assisting her as a friend promised her that he would look out for such a ppair of horses and if he found any that he thought wodld sait her he would let her know in order that she might send her coachman to look at them to this the plaintiff replied that she would much prefer to leave the matter entirely to his own judg ment the defendant admitted receiving the plain tiffs cheque for £ in october for the pair of horses he had bought and also that in his letter to her tell ing her of the parchase he had by mistake described them as  hands se denied however that they were not of the description required by the plain tiff he further pleaded that the transaction was entirely gratuitous on his part and that in buying them he had exercised as much care and trouble as he vould have done had he been buying them for himself upon these pleas issue was joineamr a cock qc and mr beaumont morice appeared for the plaintiff and mr willis qc and mr horace brown were for the defendantthe plaintiff was called and said that at the time of the transaction she was a widow the horses were entirely useless to drive ln her carriage and were not as represented to her by the defendant when she sent him her cheque in payment for them when she first saw them she objected to them becaase they were not big enough not because of their coloar she would have kert them had they been big enough they looked hire ponies when i the carriage she could not remember mr de iviti saying to her when she said that she did not want to go beyond  guineas  oh on cannot expect to get big horses for that figure g he insisted that she had told the defendant that she would take nothing less that  handsmr lister the plaintiffs husband was also called and said that he had nothing to do with the order but on the day they arrived he went into the stables with his wife who was then mrs higgins and at once said  do not have them they are much too small leasurin them he made one just ander  and the ether  handsin crosse mination he said he did not like their colour they did not match in that or in any other mattermr listers coachman gave evidence corro borating his masters measurements they kept them a month before they were sold at tattersalls they were then in better condition than vhen they came to the plaintiffsin crossexaminstion the witness said that when they were tried in the carriage mr lister said that he did not like their actionevidence was then given that they were sold for £c s at tattersalls and that one was  and the other just under  hands and that they were then in very good conditionat the close of the plaintiffs casemr willis said he would call the defendant and le thought it would be clear that the whole difficultyrose because when the horses arrived they were not liked by mir lister and that the defendants letter statingby mistakethattheywere  was relieduponas a ground for refusing to take them this being a purely gratuitous transaction on the defendants part even if bv a oaod fide mistake he had stated in his letterto the ptaintiff that the horses were  he would not be liable unless it were showvn that in buying them for the plaintiff he had not carried out the authority with which he had been intrusted in a reasonable way that question depended uponhis mstructionsaudthese according to the defendants account he had fuilled in such a case as this there mnst be a gross want of propr care to make the defendant responsiblede witt called paid he knew the plaintiff before she was married to her late husband and had been on the most friendly terms with her one day while visiting her ste had asked him as an old friend to get her a pair of carriage horses he asked p rice  she said not more than g he said wvell mrs higgins you will not geta pair of big horseswithi actio for that she said she did not want big horses as her carriage was a small one and she wanted a pair of small horses about  hands to  not to exceed lb he said he thought he knew of one that might suit her but ke would look and see she said she wanted them about the end of september he agreed to look about for her and let her know about it so that she could send her coachnan to see them but she said she would rely upon his judgment he was jair that the plaintiff was mistaken in sayingthat she had said she woald take nothing under  she had never said so the two horses in questioa he had seenboth separate and togetherand had driven them himself one was bought of mr pratt and the other of a mr holmes he asked the height of holmess horse and he had been told that when shod properly he would stand  hands  his groom concurred r pratts horse was also made out by them to be  hands in the carriage they looked alike in size and were capital goers he turned his owa horses out of their boxes to make room for these before sending them u p to london his onlv objeot had been to oblige mrs lister in his letterto the plaintiff of september  he wrote that the horses wouldsait her exactlyand that they were ln crossexauminationhe could not say whether or not it was upon the faith of thatstatementthat mrs lister had purchased the horsesmr willis at the close of the defendants case submitted that the evidence showed that though mr de witt made a mistake as to the height of these horses in his letter to the plaiutiff of september tet he had not exceeded his instractions and that he i had auth ity from the plainti to purchase a pair of  horses such as these were vizabout  but not more than  handsmr cock in replying said that the law in the case was established in  balfe v west    c b airi jtrstice ceaales said that the dispute was a i most unfortunate one and he would have been pleased to have been spared deciding it  bat as the parties had not come to any agreement it was his duty to decide it upon the evidence before him to his miud the whole matter turned upon what instructions the plaintiff had given mr de witt when she asked him to get her a pair of horses there was a direct con flict as to what these instructions were and let it be remembered that as he was dealing with two tho roughly honest witnesses upon this point he cast no reflection n either side by his decisionwhatever it might be it was clear there had been a most un fortunate mistake reviewing the evidience and the letters the learned judge came to the conclusion that mlrs listers account was correct and that the horses in question were not such as she had a right to expect from her instructions he much regretted the view he felt bound to take as the defendant seemed to have very good naturedly taken a great deal of trouble over the matter there would be judgment for the plain tiff for £ and costs
