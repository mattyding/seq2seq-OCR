the english and french inafricaparis junz as was arranged yesterday lord dufferin had an interview of some length this afternoon with m hanotaux this first conversation can evidently be considered only as a sort of prelude to the interviews which are to follow rarely bas diplomacy had to deal with a more delicate and difficult matter the occasion is one for all the coolheadedness and tact at the disposal of the most experienced diplomatists to prevent the friction which has arisen from assuming a more serious character the origin of all this affair is in reality a misunderstandingof considerable importance no doubtwhich has been transformed by passion into a premedi tated and aggressive action which certainly was not in the spirit either of the english govern ment or in that of the king of the belgians france has perhaps some reason to complain of the form of the treaty and to claim that she should have been kept informed and that after the failure of her brussels negotiations she should have been allowed a chance of resuming negotiations with the congq state in lieu of oemg confronted with an accomplished factassuredly however neither england nor king leopold imagined after the rupture of th francobelgian negotiations that the treaty would create such an outburst and that the french foreign office would be armed with a unanimous vote of the chamber necessarily obliging itto give the question perhaps undue pro ortion the first consequence of this situation es been the vote of credit and the despatch of re inforcements and even of two gunboats england however should and happily will remain per fectly cool a few acres of african swamp or a clhmp of thatched villages in the tropics will not as lord dufferin remarked in a speech three months ago disturb the peace of europe or cause a condict between its two most civilized nations neither of them notwithstanding past or future imprudences will be senseless enouoh to lose its headit is evident that the authors of thursdays interpellation which led up to the unanimous orders of the day had not weighed all the difficulties in which they would place the two countries nor all the possible consequences it is evident too that a minister of longer standing and weight would not have delivered a written speech so peremptory as that of m lanotauxa bihth qsil  t  oqe q inotneoessarily fit to be miinister of foreign affairs it is often better that the post should be given to some one of less spscial knowledge but with a greater experience of things outside the office and of men outside the diplomatic service m hanotaux for instance was informed by the french ambassador at constantinople that the porte appeared inclined to dispute all or part of the anglocongo treaty whereupon he announced the thing as a fact without considering the difference at yildit kiosk between promise and realization ee so announced a protest by germany with out knowing whether it had been or would be made the chamber too led away as usual by the vehemence of speeches and by the patriotic excitement aroused did not consider that it had before it an ephemeral cabinet merely a pale copy of its predecessor and a minister surprised at his own appointment the chamber consequently rather imprudently gave that cabinet and that minister a vote which pushed them on instead of directing them it did not consider what tact selfpossession and acute ness are requisite for the discussion of business with men of experience and knowledge who have earned embassies as the crowning of a long and difficult career i learnt one day that a newlyappointed minister of foreign affairs had been conversing withan ambassador the latter having urged a particuar argument the minister shrugged his shoulders and exclaimed s allons donc the amnbassador had a mnoment of surprise excuse mehe said  but if you had been in the presence of my sovereign would you have answered him allous done   certainly not rejoined the minister then pray do not forget added the ambassador  that i represent him i am not referring to m ranotaux it is true he is a man who is apt to get rather warm but this is his nature and those who converso with him do not talre it amiss with more weight he will be cooler and will then find people more yieldingit would be curious to show how for the last  years french foreign policy has always reflected the temperament of the ministers of foreign affairs un aestionably in a case like this thehaving a negotiator such as m hanotaux does not contribute to speedy solution in spite of every good will inclading his own is sudden and rather surprising elevation and a natural but characteristic ambition oblige him to do something and this is an obligation which does not facilitate solutionsÂ£ inasmuch however as france bas complained specially of the mode of procedure of the hasty conclusion and of not having been consulted or even warned m ilanotaux who has since received the most express assurances of the deference with which elngland and king leopold are animated towards france will appeal to her enlightened intelligence he will make her understandthat this is an affair in which certain bounds must not be overstepped and that con ciliation is incumbent if france does not wish to incur the reproach of deliberate exggeration tt may be hoped that people here as elsewhere will see the importance of not aggravating a situation already very difficult and delicate and that parliament and the press will avoid any bitter word or irritating insinuation after all a treaty has been signed and constitutes a result on one sideit is therefore fair and natural as france has unintentionally been ruffled that she should receive all concessions consistent with the accomplished fact so as to show her that her susceptibilities have not been intentionally excited but that there is every disposition to pacifv them and to take account of the legiti mate objections which she may prefer i believe that this is the path which has today been entered upon and that this first conversation warrants a hope that with certain sacrifices freely made diplomacy will solve a difficulty which has taken unespected proportions but which will be reduced to its proper limits m hanotaux also will see that a true success w ill consist in a friendly solution a success less striking but less ephemeral less uncertain than the noisy triumphs preferred by certain rest less mindsthe newlyappointed london correspondent of the figaro writes  it is much to he feared that m hanotauxs speech mav not pro duce the effect expected from it in fiance in the first place the english in general have been somewhat astonisbed at tha bitterness of certain phrases they bave been equally sur prised to learn from the speech of the minister of foreign affairs that germany and turkey bad made express reservations on the anglo congo arrangement their surprise did not last long since some hours later sir edward grey stated in the house of commons that germany had merely made reservations of detail as to which she had already been given satis faction and that the ottoman government had said nothing at all but they do not very well understand how in a written speech a inister could commit such a serious mistake in offlicial circles there is greater reserve and there is hesitation at giving an opinion on the speech of m hanotaux it is easy however to see that it is felt that by the very vigour of certain expressions the french minister has made it difficult for british selfrespect to make certain concessions which but for this might have been made without so great an effortour own corretpondentberlin juin there does not for the moment appear to be any great anxiety here to adopt m deloncles suggestion that germany should at once sum mon a conference for the settlement of the ques tions arising out of the congo igreement such a conference might be usefully convoked to embody in a fresh treaty terms already agreed upon as the result of direct negotiations between the interested powers but until their demands have been distinctly formulated the possibility of an understanding cannot be con fidently estimated the chief german grievance appears to be the substitution of england for the congo state along the northwestern boundary of her east african possessions french diplomacy on the other hand it is believed aims at turning englands posi tion on the lower bnile by excluding her from the approaches to the upper nile and as even the bamburger nadhwichten remarks whilst applauding the slap in the face which france has given england  it is certainly not germanys business to pull the chestnuts out of the fire for the benefit of the frenchvur orresponazent
