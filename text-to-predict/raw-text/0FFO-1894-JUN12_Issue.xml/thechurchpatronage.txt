tehe chubrc patbonagb billthe standing comrnittee on law of the hoase of commons met again yesterday mr stansfeld in the chair when the consideration of the church patronage bill was resumedan amendment to clause  which stood on the paper in the name of viscount cranborne had for its object to limit the prohibition of the sale of the rights ofaltronago to the sale  of anyright of patronae gbei less than the whole of such right possesse b the vendor viscount ceandobne said he could not believe that any member of the committee to what ever party he belonged desired to make the rights of patronage altogether inalienable that surely could not be done without giving compensation to the owners of those rights and there was no fund out of which they could be compensated his amendment would limit the prohibition to the case of a right to next presentation he submitted that thant was the only right which ought to be included in the prohibitionand unless his amendment were carried the whole righb of patronage would be rendered inalienablemr paul said that the promoters of the bill had to choose between perpetuating what they themselves had spoken of as one of the worst scandals in the church and tho abolition altogether of the right of sale the noble viscount had said that the right of sale couldnotbe abolished without compensation but inasmuch as patrous were allowed to retain their rights and were only probibited from trafficking in them there was no case for compensation as a matter of fact the sale of a right of next presentation was just as much a legal right as the right to sell an advowson in many cases indeed it was the only right that was saleable the amendment moreover did not prohibit the sale of next presentations it was only where a man gossessed something more than that that he was pro hibited from selling itmr w f lawsence submitted that it was most desirable in the interests of the church that therehould be a right of sale in order to avoid patronage falling into the hands of a number of persons vwhere patronage was in the hands of a number of persons there ought to be some pow er of buying out so as to bring the patronage into the hands of one or twomir cabrvell wruuxs said that a letter in the tines that morning from chancellor dibdin admitted that there were two sides to the questionand that those who took a view opposite to hisownhadarightto be heard that learned gentleman had stated the issue very clearly  english law he said  ever since there has been any has recognized an advowson as a species of real property which can be dealt with by sale or purchase and devised or allowed to descend from father to son like a house or afield  that was true but  pity tis tis true that was an evil which the promoters of the bill were endeavouring to maintain and for which they wished to secure fresh legislative sanction he ventured to sav that if apoll  uinurcumen were taien on this question a majority of them would be found to be in favour of the total prohibition of sales they would not draw the subtle distinction the noble lord drew but would look upon the system as a whole as an evil he wished to relieve the church from such a scandal and at once the church was at this moment on its trial and if this scandal were not re moved the responsibility would rest on the leaders of the church in parliamentthe committee divided and there votedfor the amendment  against   maiority mr grifterboscawzn moved an amendment in subsection a of clause  which provides that in the ransfer of a right of presentation the right shall not e exercised by the person to whomi is transferred for twvo years after transfer hie thought that one year would be long enough for aul practical purposes and therefore he moved to insert one year instead of twothe committee divided and the numbers werefor the amendment   against   majority mr paul moved as an amendment to subsection c which provides that the right of presentation to a benefice becoming vacant within two years after a transfer the right of patronage shall he in the bishop of the diocese to add and in the case of any bene fice situated in london by the vestry within whose jurisdiction the benefice is situated in the case of any benefice situated in a municipal borough by the city or town council of such borough and in the case of any benefice situated in a rural parish by the parish council and where there is no parish council by the parish meeting he said this was an attempt on a small seale to recognize the rights of the parish it was not an interference with the sacred right of patronage in the event of patronage lapsing out of private bands it should go to the parishioners who were much more vitally concerned than the bishopsim b webster could not think his hon friend could be serious in this patronage must be exercised by some one with the interests of the church at heartmr birbibll thought the plan proposed would not work successfullythe committee divided and the numbers were for the amendment  i against majority clause  as amended was then agreed to as wer also clauses  and a short discussion took place upon clause  which prohibits a patron from presenting himself but after a verbal amendnen pypose ia zr wxsabeen ageed to the clause was ordered to stlmd pat of the ill clauses  and  having be reed toon clause  grounds of bishps r insti tatevsscodrt caieosmoproposed to add thefoflowm general words to the grotnds mentioned in the clause or by reason of any other circunstance not being n qnestion of doctrine or ritual he said the object of the amendment was to extend rather more theower of the bishop to refuse institation by the bleo the bishop vvas made the author in this tbut the qtestion was whether te grounds for refusal in the bill were wide enough he did not think they were he did not think that the bishops would exercise the power oppressively if anhn he was afraid they would notbe strict enoughsi r wsnsteu could not consent to the insertion of these words he fully admitted that the bishop was the proper authority but it was not wise to give him such general powersmr dodd ob ected to the amendment as putting the clergy too much in the power of their bishopsbr giffithboscawme said all it was desired to do was to strengthen the power of the bishop to pre vent the appointment of unit personssm f rowxll could not support the amendment the power it gave to the bishops was too widemr canrill williams was not in favour of increasing the power of the bishops but as there was no other authority to whom this power could be given he would be glad to see itgiven to the bishopafter a somewrhat lengthened discussionthe committee divided and the nunbers were for the amendment  against majority sra mi
