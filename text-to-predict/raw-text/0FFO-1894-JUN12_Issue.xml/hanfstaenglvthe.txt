hazfstarngl v tlfl ebmpire palace limitedand baixes and co and mansfieldbefore lobds justices lindley loprs andnavv nas is an important copyright case the appeal was by the proprietors and the publisher of the daily graphic against an interlocutory injunction granted by mir justice stirling as reported in the times of april  last and in the times law reports vol  p  to restrain the appellants from printing publishing selling or offering for sale or otherwise disposing of any copies or colourable imitations of certain copyright pictures of the plaintiff the action was brought by the proprietor of the copy right in some pictures originally painted in germany and published by means of photographs claiming an injunction against the empire palace limited and the proprietors and publisher of the daily graphic newspaper the case against the firstnamed defend ants was based upon the reproduction of the plaintiffs pictures in the form of tebleaux vivlanti upon the stage of the empire theatre that case was disposed of by the court of appeal on february  last as reported in the times of february  the court holding that what had been done by the first defend ants was not an infringement of the plaintiffs copy right in the case against the daily gaphic thye plaintiff complained that the second defendants had published in their newspaper pictures illustrating an account of the representations at the empire theatre which although sketched by an artist who had not seen the pictures from the living figures employed in those representations still were as the plaintiff alleged copies of the designs of his original pictures and therefore infringements of his copyright there was another similar actioni against the proprietors of the westminkter budget in which a simi ar injanc tion was granted no appeal has yet been brought in that action the plaintiff sought to enforce rightwhich he alleged to have been conferred on him by the international copyright acts and the order in council of november   and that the illustra tions published in the daily graphic were infringe ments of his copyright the international copgrright act of  provides by section   that  the international copyright acts and an order made thereunder shall not eonfer on any person any greater right or longer term of copyright in any work than that enjoyed in the foreign country in which such work was first produced the order in council of november   which applies among other countries to germany provides by clause  that  the author of a literary or artistic work which on or after december   is first produced in one of the foreign countries of the copy riht union germany being one shall subject as in this order and in the international copyright acts  to  mentioned have as respects that work throughout her mianestys dominions the same right of copyright inclu ing any right capable of bemg conferred by an order im council under section  or section  of the international copyright act  or under any other enactment as if the work had been first produced in the united kingdom and shall have such right during the same period provided that the author of a literary or artistic work shall not have any greater right or ionger term of copyright therein than that which he enjoys in the country in which the work is first produced the enzlish law applicable is contained in the act  and  vict c  sec tion  of that act confers on the author of every orginnal ith so e drawing and photograph and his assigns  the soie and exclusive riait of copying engraving reproducing and multiplying such paint ing or drawing or the design thereof or such photo graph and the negative thereof by any means of any size  for the term of the natural life of such author and seven years after his death section  provides that  nothing herein contained shall prejudice the right of any person to copy or use any work in wvhich there shall be no copyright or to representany scene or object section  imposes penal ties on any person who  shall without the consent of the proprietor repeat copy colourably imitate or otherwise multiply for sale hire exhibition or distribution any such work or the design thereof the questions argued were  what would be the rights of the plaintiff on the supposition that thev were governed exclusively by english law   whether german law was to any and to what extent applic able and  what were the rights of the plamtiff assuming that german law did to any extent apply it was contended on behalf of the appellants that under english law the plaintiff had not the right which he claimed and that a fortiori he had not that right under german law it was said that the illustrations in question were not in any proper sense copies of the plaintiffs pictures it was argued that that which was copied from a representation which was itself not an infringement of the plaintiffs copyright could not be an infringement moreover the ilfustra tions were merely an adjunct to a description of the representations at the theatre and were not in any way a substitute for the plaintiffs pictares they were rather an advertisemnent of them the plaintiff had not shown that any damage would be done to him and this he was bouna to do the illustrations were merely a rude and rough sketch and the court must have regard to commercial value it also argued that under german law the plaintiffs rights were not so large as under english law and evidence of german lawyers was adduced as to the effect of the german law mr justice stirling held that what the appel lants had done was an infringement of the plaintiffs rights under both english and german law it was agreed to treat the appeal as an appeal from the trial of the action so that the case might be finally dis posed of as regards this courtmr crackanthorpe qc mr grosvenor woods q c and mr h a aforman were for the appellants mr grahanm lastings qc mr scrutton and mr a h jessel were for the plaintiff mr bramwell davis held a watching brief for the proprietor of the westminstr budgetthe appeal was heard on may  and  when the court reserved their judgmenttshis morningthe counjt allowed the appeal and dismissed the action with costs in both courtsloud justice lndley read the following judg ment the plaintiff is a foreign publisher lie claims to be entitled under the international copyright acts to the copyright of certain pictures and he eomplains that his copyright has been in fringed by the reproduction of those pictures in the daily graphic newspaper without his consent he accordingly applied ior and obtained an injunction against the proprietors of the daily graphic restrain ing them from infringing his copyright the pro prietors have appealed from the order granting this in junction and by consent this appeal is to be treated as if it were an appeal from a judgment at the trial of the nction the appellants contend  that as the plaintiff is not registered as the proprietor of the copyright in the pictures in question he cannot main tamn this action  that assuming him to be entitled to the copyright in the pictures the extent of that right must be determined bythe german law and nlot by the english law   that what the defend ants have done is not an infrngement of the plaintiffs copyright even measured according to english law and is still less an infringement of his copy right if measured according to german law which it is contended confers upon him less extensive rights than the law of england the first point viz the necessity for registrationhas been re served for further argument for it is known to be diicult  there are conficting decisions upon it and as it will not arise if we decide that there has been no infringement we thought it better to decide the question ot infringement first this after all is the great question between the parties because althougeh this action would fail if reaistration werenecessary still the plaintiff could register his title and then institute another action and in that action raise the question of infringement which both parties desire to have determined i shall assume there fore for the present that registration is unnecessary and that the plaintiff is entitled to copyright in this country under the international copyright acts  to s the first question which then arises is lvhat is the right conferred by those acts on the plaintiff and the second question is have the defendants infrinned that right  i will address myself to each of these qaestions in tun the right conferred by the international copyright acts upon the plaintiff depends upon those acts and the order in council of november   made under their provisions and the berne convention of september   referred to in that order in council these documents are to be found in a convenient form in mr copingers and mr scruttons works on copv right the short effect of these enactments order in council and convention is that subject to the limita tion imposed by section   of the international copyright act   and  vict cap  the plaintiff is entitled to the rights conferred on british subjects by the act  and  vict cap  which is the act relating to copyright in paintings draw ings and photographs the right conferred by this act is defined ty sections  and  his lordship read these sections the short effect of these two sections so far as paintings are concerned is to give to the author of every original painting the sole and exclusive right of copying or reproducing the same and the design thereof by any means and of any size for the period mentioned in the act but any thing in whichtlhere is no copyright may be copied although somebody else may have copied it before and may have a copyright in his own copy see per lord blackburn in  gravess case lb  q b  the limitation of this right w en claimed by foreigners under the international copyright acts is expressed in section   of the act of  his lordship read the clause if therefore the ger man law of copyright confers upon the plaintiff a less extensive right in his pictures than the right con ferred on british authors by the act to which i have already alluded the extent of the plaintiffs rights must be measured by the german standard and not by the english standard and mast be restricted accord ingly now in one respect the german law of copy right is shown by the evidence before us to be less extensive than the english for by german law copy right in a painting does not extend to reproductions in literary works provided that snch reproductions are ex planations only of some text it cannot be said as a matter of lawt that english copyright does not extend to snch a reproduction although whether any parti cular illustration of a text would amount to an infringement of copyright in a particular painting would depend upon circumstances as will appear presently again there is evidence to show that the german law confers no copyright in the design of a picture as distinguished from the picture  but on the other hand there is evidence to show that even bv german law copyright in a pictare extends to the iaea conveyed by it i confess that i do not feel sufficiently sure of the german law on this subject to be able to base my decision upon it  nor is it neces sary for me to do so as will appear presently having now ascertained the rights of the plaintiff i proceed to consider whether they have been infrined by the proprietors of the daily graphic in order to determine this question it is necessary to know exactly what they have done they and bythley  i include their artist have not seen or copied the plaintiffs pictures or nan painting engraving drawing or photograph of them lvhat the defeniants have done is this they have sent two persons to the empire theatre to describe and sketch what was being represented there what was seen there was an arrangement of living persons so dressed and placed as to represent what was represented in the plaintiffs pictures the idea of the representation at the empire theatre was no doubt saggested by and taken from the plaintiffspictures and the representa tion was made as exact as could be with such materials es were procurable bnt the representations p y auawr were no siringements ot the plaintiffs copyright in his paintings this has been already decided the sketches published in the daily graphic are rough sketches of those representa tions but the sketches are so raugh and incomplete that they do not represent any of the artistic merits of the plaintiffs pictares the sketches merely convey a rough idea of the subjects of the pictures and of the grotti of their main features to this extent but t er or otherwise it is possible to regard the sketches as copies of the plaintiffs pictures or as reproductions of the designs thereof such being the facts the question arises whether the publication of the sketches thus made is an infringement of the plaintiffs copyright the learned judge has held it to be so but i am unable to agree with him i will pass over the difference between english and german law to which i have alluded with the remark that i am not satisfied that the sketches in the daily graphic are merely illustrations of the text their value to the rerder does not depend on the text and if they were without the text infringements of the plaintiffs copyright their connexion with the text isnot close enough to render the german law as distingaished from the english applicable to the case the daily graphic is an illustratedpaper and the sketches conrlained of are intended to let people know what is to be seen at the empirenheatre and they have a value and importance wholly irrespective of the texb which they are said to illustrate they are principal objects and not merely auxiliary or subordmate to the text by which it is sought to justify their insertion treating the matter as turning on the english law of copyright conferred by the act  and  vict cap  i am unable to hold these sketches infringements of the plaintiffs rights the mere fact that the defendants aid not know that they were copying the plaintiffs pictures would be immaterial if the sketches ought on other grounds to be regarded as infringements of the plaintiffs rights see r west v francis   b and a  iloreover the defendants did in my opinion know that the scenes they sketched repre sented pictures in which some one might have a copy right i do not decide the case therefore on the absence of any intention to copy the plaintiffs pic tures although the fact that the defendants never intended to copy them canaot be wholly disregarded in such a case as the present nor do i base my deci sion on section  of the statute  and  vict c  the first portion of this section is not applicable because the  work  there referred to is i think explained by the preamble to mean painting drawing or photograph and if the sketches complained of are copies of the plaintiffs paintings they are copies of paintings in wnich he has a copyright neither is the second part of section  applicable to the ease because iilthongh those sketches are sketches of a scene or object the scene or object is not such as is referred to in the section the scene or object referred to in the section is something which some one else has copied and not a scene or object whiah is itself a copy from a painting in which there is a copyrright although therefore these sketches aremade from something in which there is no eopyright and although they represent something which is not itself an infringement of the plaintiffs copyright vet i am not prepared to say as a matter ot law that these sketches might not infringe the plaintiffs rights if they could be fairly regarded as reproductions of his pictures or of the designs thereof to hold other wise would be to open the door to indirect piracies which i am not at all disposed to do a copy of a foigncopy of an enlish painting would not i apprerendube poted sy section  see  murray black°bgura  srow  and the judgment of lordpkez beal lrl  qb at p t shows that if a painting is in fact reproducedix is immaterial what the mtermediate steps may be by which the reproduction is arrived at again the case of  robiuson v turner   ir ch  where the painting of the death of chatterwas pirated by copying an arraugement made up from the picture shows what injustice might be done if it were to be held that section  protected the defendants if they could otherwise be held to have in fringed the plaintiffs rights my decision is based on different and on wider yrounds copyright like patent right is a mouopoly restraining the public from doing that which apart from the monopoly it would be perfectly lawful for them to do the monopoly is itself right and just and is granted for the purpose of preventing persons from unfairly avail ing themselves of the work of others whether that work be scientific literary or artistic the protec tion of authors whether of inventions works of art or of literary compositions is the object to be attained by all patent and copyright laws the acts are to be construed with reference to this purpose on the other hand care must always be taken not to allow them to be made instruments of oppression and extortion it is on such considerations as these that fair reviews of literary works although containing lengthy extracts from them are not infringements of the copyrights in them that a representation of part of a dramatic piece if confined to some compara tively insignificant part of it is not an infringement of the copgyright in such piece it was by considering the object of the statute aud not only its words that in  dicks v brooks   ch d  a worsted work copy of an engraving was held not to be an infringement of the copyright therein lastly in ths very action this court proceeding on the same principle quite recently decided that the representa tion in the empire theatre by human beings arranged as shown in a pictare were not an infringemrent of the copyright in such picture   ch  moreover although the intention of an infringer is immaterial if he copies more than is fair so that his copy may be used as a substitute for the original as in  roworth v wvilkes   camp  yet in doubtful cases the extent to which the copying has been carried and the object sought to be attained by she copies complained of are matters which mnst be considered as is shown by  bradbury v hotten  lr  ey  and  scott v stanford  lr  eq  the extent of copying and the degree of resemblance between the original and the copy are always most material as was pointed out long ago in  vest v francis   b and a  guided by the foregoing considerations and by the principles acted upon in the decisions to which i have referred i ask myself whether these sketches are such copies of the plaintiffs pictures or such reproductions of the designs thereof as are struck at by the statute which confers copyright in such pictures my answer to this question is no the sketches are not intended to be and are not in fact copies of the pictures at all neither are they intended to be nor are they in fact reproductions of the designs of the pictures they do not represent any of the beauties of the pictures they are rough sketches made for a very different purpose and answering a very different pur pose that purpose being not to give an idea of the plaintiffs pictures but to give a rough idea of what is to be seen at the empire theatre in giving that idea it is true that they also give a very rough idea of the subject represented in the plaintiffs pictures it is also true that in w west v francis  mr justice bayley said  a copy is that which comes so near to the original as to give to ever person seeing it the idea created by the original but in applvynig this to any particular case the degree of resemblance is aul important and the possibility of injury to the plaintiff must bo regarded as was pointed out in  dicks v brooks  lr  ch d  it is only by a great stretch of language and by the exer cise of much imagioation that these sketches can be regarded as copies of the plaintiffs pictures or the designs thereof the case is very unlike  gambart v ball   cb xs where cngravings were copied by photography i cannot bring myself to say that the sketches complained of are in any fair sense of the words copies of the plaintiffs pictures or reproductions of the designs thereof within the mean ing of the statute to which i have referred the qestion if it came before a jury would be one of act for the decision of the jury on a proper exposi tion by the judge of the meaning of the statute and i do not believe that any jury properly directed would find these sketches to be copies of the plaintiffs pictures or reproductions of his designs whe defendants have not in fact directly or indi rectly intentionally or unintentionally made any use certainly not any unfair use of the plaintiffs pictures or of the brains of their authors this in my opinion settles the case in order to avoid mis understanding i will observe that i do not think that the coinpetition test is necessarily conclusive i agree that if the defendants had copied the plaintiffs pic tures they would have infringed his rights even although the use made by the defendants of such copies could in no way compete with the sale of the plaintiffs pictures this was the case in  eianf stingl v holloway   qbj where copieso ee pmainsius pictures were only used by being put on pillboxes but were nevertheless held to be infringements of his rights again unauthorized sketches of pictures made on pnrpose to convey and in fact conveying tolerably correct ideas of them would i apprehend be infringements of the copy rights in thera although the sketches might not com pete with the pictures or with any copies of them which their authors or their assigns might desire to make or sanction but where copyimg a picture never enters the head of a person who is said to have copied it or to have reproduced its design where the question is whether a sketch by snch a person is or is not a copy or reproduction then the impossibility of injury by competition may i think be fairly con sidered the amusing sketches in punch of the pic tures in the royal aeademy arenot in my opinion infringements ot the copyrights in those pictures although probably made from the pictures themselves the application of similar principles to the different facts of this case leads me to a similar conclusion in neither case is there ani piracy actual or intended in my opinion therefore the appeal must be allowed and judgment must be entered for the defendants with costs here and belowlords justices lorps and daxvey delivered judg ments substantially to the same effect
