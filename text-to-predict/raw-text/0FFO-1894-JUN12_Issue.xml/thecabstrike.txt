employing between  and  men wouatisg last yeoar to upwards of £ mlention was also maae of the fact that the drivers of hansorns only worked an average of i days per week and fourwheel men five days while the horses reqgired feeding and tendingevery day evidence was alto pro duced en bebalf of the owners to shovv that the charges for fcdder stabling cleaning and the revenue and police charges were as high for second and third rate property as for the best and it was argued that this fact ought to be taken into account when fixing an eouitable scale of chatgesmr asqust said the masters demanded an average of s per day all the year round and that snm he understood was equal to s d yer day if no de ductions were made for  shorts  and  nonletsmr bidcan handed up a statemext showing a

with three representatives of each sida in order to discuss the teims of settlementmr atqit said that he did not think that that would be a convenient course to pursue if he could not settle the dispute by giving a slear decision he would have to retire from his position he would require the assurance that each side would abide by his decision it was true that he was a mediator and not an arbitrator but at the same time he insisted that his decision should be aceepted by both sidesmr loroe mi said that the award might befo one year onlyhr aisqit replied that that was somewllat anticipating his decisionmr barley mp said that th e proprietors were quite prepared to accept slirsiths award as being between owners sod drivers and not as between owners and the uionmr bants mp protested against such a defini tionin the course of the diecussion mr f sntamaos on behalf of the men enieavoured to show that the statement made by mr scott on saturday that a first class cab and two horses could not be worked for less than s ad per day was incorrect as applied to the general body of owners be instanced cases in which cabs were worlked at ss d and at a trifie under los per day and contended that from s to s per day was a fair average of the cost of working a cab and twn hrneat the conclusion of the argumento on both sides mir asquitr said that the following points had already been agreed to at the preliminary coference  all yard money to be abolishel   union labels to be taken off the cabs and  union and nonunion men to work amicably together he now proposed to fix

frequentlypaid in  sbort money the home secretarv remarked thatthis appeared to strengthen the mens case as it was no use asking them to pay imjpossible prices mr asqaith added that he could plainly see that short money wras paid and accepted and it would be well to remove this if possible and thus place the whole of the trnde upon a more businescslike basis mr white thought the settlement satisfactory so far as it went seeing thaty ard fees  had been abolished and that the men would gain considerably in the price paid for cabs in futurea crowded meeting of proprietors was held last

hairsbreadth from the position which they had all along taken up mr h h porter asked if there was any guarantee that the drivers would work six days a week if they did not do so he con sidered that
