gave judgment yesterday as followsthis actionwas tried beforemeatthe lastleicestershire assizes and was snbsequently discussed before me in london the plaintiff claimed to nave it declared that he is seized in fee simple and entitled to the rents and profits of a garden called the malthouse garden comprising about threequarters of an acre of land at syston in the concty of leicester john sheffield of syton by his wvill dated miay   gave and bequeathed the maltingoffice with the two atdjoining cottagtes and the garden and outoffices hereto belonging to his cousin james down thelaintiff by codicil dated iav  he devised all is real and personal estate not otherwise disposed of to his brother thomas sheffield the defendant the testator died on may   the question is whether the garden claimed passed by the devise to the plaintif    was pressed by plaintiffs counsel to receive evidence of the intention of the testator but this was objected to by mlr graham who cited  hiscocks v hiscocks   i and w  and  charter v charter  lr  hl  i am of opinion that the evidence is not admissible because i think there is no latent ambiguity in the language of the will when read in the light of all the circum stances known to the testator when his will was exe cuted now what were these circumstances  the whole of the property was purchased by the testator as one property and under one title the malthouse was originally a dwellinghouse but it was after wards converted into a maltinhouse the whole property before the testator became the owner was occunied by a person named want the malting premises extended over the ground floorof that cottage which actually adjoins them the second of the two cottages is separated from the first by a narrow pas sage fending into a private way called the street communicatiig with a public highway called church lane this private way formed the southerm boundary of the whole of the maltoffice premises and both the cottages a yard is attached to each cottage to the north of these yards and immediatelyadjoining them is a quadrangalar plot of land which forms the gardens or garden as the case may be to the cottages it is separated from the vard of the one cottage by a lowdwarf wall and privies and from the yard of the other cottage by tcdsonse thrughwhich thereisa way ou byl th coatheuside a his bounded by valls and for at least  years it has been entirely divided by  low wall isin high into two separato plots each cottage having the exlusive use of one of the two plots fr a garden a doorvway affords a communication between the maltoflice oremises and the yard of the cottage immediately adioining as regards the cottage further from the snaltmgoflice it was occupied for d years by a waitness namned pick wheo for the whole of that time wvas employed at the malting premises as to this garden in ispute and its surroundingsfirst it has for many years beea called the maltoffice garden although certainly for the last few years it has not been occupied w the malting premises but has been let to a teuant who has used it as a garden the only access to it from the public road is and has always been by means of tihe private way leading from churchstreet  if by horses or carts through certain gates leading into the bard of the malttinghouse premises across the lower end of that yard and througha bam at the north west extremity of those premises if bypersons on foot through a doorway leading out of the private street into and through a building called the grindinghouse across the southwest corner of the yard and througa a doorway opening from the malthouse premises into the prden there was indeed a small doorwvy opening out of the garden into a piece of land devised to a aliss eamon but it was not suggested that that was used as an access to the garden in all other uarts the garden was enclosed within high walls the earn through which the cartway ran was nsed partly by the tenant of the garden for storing and preparing his vegetables and partly by the testator for storing tunber as to how the grindingtlace was used here was no evidence these two buldings do no seem to have been used for malting puroses but they we attached to that which is called the maltoffice and open into the yard and i look upon them as out offices or onthuildmgs the quston is whether the language used by the testator in his vill indicates an ntention by him that the melthouse garden should be incloded in the devise to the plaintiff if it does the plaintiff is entitled to the verdict if it does not then of course mere extraneous evidence of the testa tors intention would be useless and inadmissible ihave given the matter much consideration and have loolked at it from every point of view presented to me by the learned counsel by whom it was very fully and ably argued and i bave arrived at the conelusion that the intention of the testator and the tmre interpreta tion of the devise can be arrived at by a caretul study of the language employed and that his intention wasthat tle garaen in questan should pass to plaintiff having regard to the fact that the plot of iand belonging to the cottages had been divider into two portions for about  years that no evidence was given that after the cottages were built the plot haa ever been treated as one plot that one of the two portions had always been exclusively used as a garden bythetennnt of one of the cottages and the other plot by the tenant of the other cottage i think it impossible to treat themn reasonablv in any other way than as two gardens each cottageb lving one attached to it and i tbink it would be a imisdescription to deseribe them as one garden each garden would also in my opinion pass with the cottage to which it was attached as would also the domeszie outbuildings belonging to the cottages respeetively without special mention of them  tme word garden is clearly isronmg description of the two cottage gardens as regards the mjltofflce garden it was rightly conceded by dr raham that if the testator in the devise had described it as the maltoffice and garden thereto belongiog the garden vonld have passed with the mnalthouse hut he insisted that the words  thereto belonging  must be read in their primary sense and be taken to refer to the cottages    the resl questionto use the language oflord tenterdencj to he considered and determined is in what sense the words  thereto belonging  are to be understood in this will and the sense that will best accord with the intention of the testator as it may be collected from other circumstances and other parts of the will or the sense that ought to prevail see  doe and gore v langton   b and a  lnow it is difficult to suppdse having regard to the circum stances in which this garden was placedbought with the mnlthouse adjoining it having no access to it from any public highway except thoagh the malt house premises always annown as the malthousr garden and the tenant of it alvways using with it for convenience of occupation the bamn forming part of the malthouse premisesthat the testator intended to sever it from the mthouse premises and that too without assigning as he had the power to do a separate access to it    i think the desire of the testator was that the whdle of that malthonse estate including the malting garden and cottages sho go to his cousin james down and that the desire is carried out by the words employed accord ing to the true construction of the devise i think the words thereto belonging  refer to the malting house    for the reasons above mentioned i thintk the plaintiff is entitled to mny judgmnent witb
