inquire intotheworking of that act showed in a remarkable way the great benefit which the statute had conferred upon our manu facturers certain blots however were discovered in the act andthe act of  was passed with the object of removing those blots the latter act how ever left untouched the serious blot in the act of s which omitted to deal with the case of un marked foreign goods which were imaported into this country and were then fraudulently marked as british manufactured goods the first part of the bill dealt with the fraudulent practice of marking foreign imported goods as being of british manufacture and the second part of the measure related to the means to be taken to prevent the importation of foreign prisonmade goods into this country without bearing any marks ot origin he admitted that the committee of s was hostile to the proposal to insist upon the marks of origin being placed on all goods imported into this country on the ground that to do so would restrict trade and would injure warehousemen and small traders the importation of foreignmade goods fraudulently marked had so enormously increased as to render it necessary that steps should be takento put a step to the practice a short time ago  bill having a similar object came up for second reading when it was opposed by mir mundella on the ground that the existing lawr wvas sufficientm zr hmundella urged that certain articles coul not be marked that w as true  but such cases were provided for in the bill and it was left to the regulations to be framed by the board of customs to say what goods were to be marked in niece and what in bulk no doubt it would be betterlimit the operation of the bill to manufactured articles and he would consent to such an amendment if a separate bill dealing with meat and agricultural produce were introduced afterwards mr mendella misisted that these provisions would provoke foreign governments to retaliate by demanding the marking of eurlishmade goods if that were to happen it couldhardly be a disadvantage in view of the fact that englishmaade goods were run after all over the world mr iundella further contended that the bill would harass and restrict trade it would certainly zestrict dishonest trade but that it would restrict trade in general was much to be doubted the ship ping industry cried out very loudly when the mer chandise marks act was passed  bat the committee of  after taking exhfaustive evidence came to the conclusion that there had been no serious diminu tion owing to that act in the amount of goods in transit perhaps there wonld be a great outcry acrainst the bill but it would hp frnm thnos whnprofited by fraudulent raactices and false marking as to the portion of the bill which dealt with foreign prisonmade goods a great amount of feeling had beon aroused by the discovery of the extent to which gernian prisonmade goods were imported and sold here if such practices were allowed to continue the steps which had already been taken to restrain tihe competition of british prison labour with free labour in this country mast be rendered fatile the bill did not raise the qnestion of protection but the protection of houest trading it was supported by thousands of freetraders all over the coantry  and at the last trade union congress a strong resoiation was passed condemning the practice of introducing enmarked goods into this corutry there was the choice of two evilsto submit to the vexation and in convenience of seeing to the marking of foreign goods or to witness the spectacle of more starving mnen about the country year after year the tendency had been to improve the condition of the working classes in this country and that tendency had the sympathy of their lordships hle subbmitted that among the circumstances which must necessarily tend to raise the cost of production to some extent were the insistence by the london county council of the adoption of trade union wages the condemnation by the late government of sweating in counexion wvith army contracts and the notionaol the present governmen t in limiting the hours of lahour in the government factories if this unfair competition of goods manufactured by means of cheap labour and by men who worked very long hours abroad was enocuraged he was afraid that many working men would be thrown out of employment in this country all they asked was that the people should be told what kind of goods they were buying and therefore he asked their lordships to read the bill a second time first of all in the interests of commercial morality  secoudly in the interests of the honest manufacturers of the country thirdly in the interests of the consumers of the country  and fourthly in the interests of the working men of the country cheersthe earl of onslow after remarking that the law on the subject was that the mark put on the goods should be an honest one and not a mis leading one said that a strong feeling existed among producers of goods in this country that they were subjected to unfair competition vith those who imported foreign goods british producers bad no objection to fair competition but they thought that the middleman derived an undue share of profit through buying in a very cheap market and selling in a dear market thoughl he did not profess to sell the article which he bought in the cheap market for that which it really was the feeling prevailed therefore that something ought to be done to protect the con sumer from fraudulent marks on goods passed upon him he trusted that the bill would be read a second time because there were a large number of interests in the country which wrere anxiously looking furward for some remedy in the nature of the present bill their lordships ought at the same time to carefully consiaer what would be the effect of the bill on the producers of this country ilis belief was that there were a large number of good and cheap articles pro duced abroad and if it was announced by the terms of this bill that such articles were made abroad it was possible their lordships would find the consumers determinintg ouly to take the articles made abroad and rejecting the more expensive articles made in this oaontry he gave an instance within his own know ledge farmers in his district bad been endeavouring to make hay contracts with the forage merchants of this seasons crop the anster that the farmers had received was to the effect that as the farmers had no hay to sell last year the contractors had to go abroad eor a supply  they had been so well treated abroad and had found the hay so satisfactory that they had umade up their minds to deal abroad again for haylord playfair said that it was only by con struing this bill as a part of the act of  that it could have any effect whatever the purpose of the bill however was altogether different from the act of  the act of  was only directed against fraud and wilful misrepresentation but the noble lord tried to penalize honest trading in the preamble of the bill the noble lord said  whereas much fraud and misrepresentation takes place by reason of the importation of foreign goods by whom not by the importers which goods are subsequently sold in the united kingdom the noble lord alleged that the fraud aud misrepresenta tion took place when the goods were subsequently sold in the united kingdom but if the fraud andaisrepresentstion only took place in the united kingdom the act of  provided that any false re presentation made any fraudulent trademarks false repressntation cf selling as english goods what were foreign goods eould be dealt with and punished  and therefore no new bill wvas needed honest trading would by the bill be made a frand and wilful misre presentation which of course it was not tradezs might import a cargo of iron or of copper wire for electric lighting purposes and the mark of the place or origin was no needed but if the articles were represented to be henglishmakethentherepresentation was fraudulent and punishable under the act of  what was the real object of the bill p it was to handicap foreign produce as against english producewhat was the definition of i goods  that w vas intended to apply in the present bill  under the definition of  goods  in the merchandise mlarks act of  every kind of article of commerce was included now it was intended that every kind of  goods should be marked with the name of the country of their origin there was no exception made f agricultural produce or frait from the operation of this bill and he contended that if the act passed withcut such a reservation being added to the clause as it then stood very great hardship would be done to the emaller retailers of fruit suc as costernongers and others who might through want of knowledge of the effects of this act upon that of  subject themselves to a fine of  or a serious term of imprisonment in the case of a cargo of eels from borwav was every eel and every portion of the fish sold to be marked  then as to prisonmade goods the bill would apply not only when the whole qf the article manufactured was made in priso btt when anyhpart of it was made there ew would th wk in cfse ef mat lprson but was afterwards dipped in phosphorus by atchmakers working outside the importer woduld have in many cases therefore no means of ascertain ing the true place of origin how was that want of knowledge to affect the case of the legitimate buyer  this question had been considered over and over again and a committee appointed by the late govermnen reported that an alteration of the law in the direc tion now advocated would inflict a serious iniury upon trade and almost destroy certain classes of business moreover if such a course were adopted a policy of retaliationagainstengland would be sure to be taken up by other countriesand it was a question of the greatest importance to this couniky that our goods should have norestrictions placed upon their introduction into those countries with whom we did the greater portion of our comumerce he hoped thereforethat the house would not permit the bill to pass the seconld reading it was not a complete measure and could not be worked unless it was read in conjunction with the bill of  and if that were done he submitted tbiat honest trade would be branded as fraudulent the bill in volved a system of protection which he again pointed out would be very advene to the prosperity of the commerce of this countrylord salisburytwo questions are raised by a bill of this kind the first is whether your lordships are agreed with the object aimed at by the bill and secondly whether its provisions do or do not require amending i shall not argue in favour of any of the details of the bill because i fully admit that a bill of this character must require very careful examina tion in committee the noble lord however did not go into the details of the measure at all and his speech was one of a most extraordinary kind i am afraid that the noble lord has beenlatelytoo much in the society of that distinguished statesman the chancellor of the exchequer whose practice seems to be when ever he fends he has no arguments ta advance against a measure he wishes to oppose to shout some popular watchword in the same way the noble lord finding he had no real or even plausible arguments to urge against the bill fell back upon the right hon gentlemans example and shouted that this was a bill of protection how could it possibly be a bill of protection  how can this be treated as a matter of protection wheni all the bill desires is to require that those who import goods into this country should state the truth respecting them  yet absolutely nothing more is asked for by this bill than that they should state the place of origin of those goods that they are selling to the public the noble lord sunding himself unable to attack the bill went off into a diatribe against some bills which had obviously no coanezion whatever with the one we are now con sidering and as it turns out he was really arguing about bills which are still in the house of commons then the noble lord told us of the terrible penalties which might be inflicted upon the costermonger who wanted to sell apples and oranges and bananas under the merchandise marks act of  as affected by this bill but this bill is not the merchandise marks act of  and the effect of this measure would really be to lighten the penalties and save the coster mongers from those ills which the noble lord saw hanging over their heads if every case containing foreign goods were marked with the place of origin there would be no danger that tradesmen would be temptedas they are now often tempted either through ignorance or any less plausible reasonto hide the real place of origin of the goods the great hardship under the merchandise marks bill is that it exposes men who are ignorant or careless of its provisions to exceedingly heavy penalties for their want of knowledge or their want of care now if the cases of the goods they were selling were fairly marked with the name of the place of erigin of the goods they contained surely thatlanger would he entirely averted this is a bill whichaccording to the statementsof thenoble earl who uoved the second reading would in fact tend to make the merchandise marks act a far more tolerable and easier measure than before the only question of difficulty is whether the imported goods can be marked of course we are all familiar with the old arguments about the matches the needle and the egg it is impossible to stamp that class of articles with the name of the place of origin but the cases containing them can be stamped and a declaration cau be exacted from the importer in which the place of origin would have to be entered that would do something at any rate to make that kind of fraud less nossible and less likely than it is now and the british trader and british producer would be saved from that which ever one msadmit is illegitimate competitionanmely the selling of foreign made goods as english produce that is the only protection against fraud how far it is possible and as to how many classes of goods it may be suitable might be determined by inquirybt in view of the important considerations which are involved and of the very serious evils suffered from this competition it would i think be a very strong measure to reject this bill on second reading jcar hear i should have preferred to invite yourrdsp to unsider whether it was not possible under this bill to give the tradesman sufficient protection against fraud and if it were found that that were possible we should be passing a measure of most salutary legislation hear bear it would be an unwise step if we said we did not sympathize with the tradesman and that we should do if we did not ccept the principle of this measure cheersthe lord chancellor did not wish to treat this bill from the point of view of protection his objection to the bill was that it was absolutely impracticable it suggested an idea but provided no means of carrying it ont and it would be impossible to mould the bill by the ordinary process of com mittee into a practicable measure he did not deny that the object of the bill might be perfectly legitimate bnt it must be borne in mind that the person who imported goods from foreign countries was never deceived as to the place of origin he knew perfectly well that they came from abroad and the wholesale purchaser of the goods was equally familiar with that fact therefore to insist on the place of origin being marked on the goods would as far as they were concerned simply be to tell them what they already knew unless they provided for giving that information to those who eventually purchased the goods by retail they would do absolutely nothing in the bill hear hear they might mark a bale of cloth with the place of origin but they could not mark every yard or every ten yards of the cloth without destroying the purpose for which it was bought and it was the same with many other kinds of goods the man who was going to sell the eloth again would divide  into smaller quantities and he would be asked nothing about the place of origin they would therefore afford no protection unless they could provide that when the goods were distributed the place of origin should be indicated that he submitted was not practicable and the bill would not work the noble marquis said  whv not take it into committee and try to make it wor p if it were a new system there might be something to be said for that suggestion but a comnmittee of their lordships house was already sitting on the marking of meat and other foreign produce the committee had reported that as to certain goods it was inpractic able to mark their place of origin while a committee of the other house having inquired into the subject had come to the conclusion that it was impossible to carry out this system of marking that was not a committee composed of persons wsho were mad about free trade but with one exception the committee was unanimous that the proposal would interfere with commerce and be prejudicial to the interests of this country they were asked to accept the bill which contained no scheme simply in order that english produce should be sold as much as possible but even with that object in view it would be unwise to read the bill a second time unless they could see their way to provide some practical means of givig it effect by reading the bill a second time he feared they would hold out expectations which they would be unable to satisfy and they would seem to give something when in reality they were giving nothing bt by checking commercial intercourse by placing difficulties in the way of those who were importing goods they were running a danger of checking exports to this country and it would therefore be dangerous to read the bill a second time unless they not only saw their way to some scheme by which its proposals mibt be advantageously carried into effect but were satisfied that that might be done without imperilling interests which could not be touched unwisely with out the greatest possible risk cheerslord hsalebury pointed out that the bill differedfrom any whichhadbeenpreviously introduced and as its object was to prevent fraud their lordships ought certainly to allow it to be read a second time the object of the bill being good and theproposition being a novel one in respect to the machinery to be employed it was not desirable that the bill should be thrown out upon the possibly exaggerated statements which had been made by its opponents cheersthe earl of kitmibebley thought that the restrictions which would be involved on the importation of goods from abroad might affect our foreign treatiest end he would doubt whether the passing of thi bill might not lead to remonstrances by foreignowers in regard to those restrictions the provision that goods made in prisons should when imported into this country be so marked could not he thought be of any use inasmuch as such marking must necessarily depend on the actioa of the foreign governments concerned was it expected that he should enter into negotiations with those govern ments with the object of iusuring the marking of prisonmade goods  if restrictions were to be imposed wby shoald they not have restrictions upon english goods end why should not sellers here give a gnarantee that the goods sold by them were ofa ienglish origin  be had often heard that manufac tures known to be made in this country were delibe rately sold here on a large scale as if they were foreign goodsthe miarquis of salisburythab is iready provided forthe earl of imberlby did not agree that this was so in conclusion though he would not say that this was a bil absolutely favouring protection he asserted that it constituted an endeavour to place foreign goods at a disadvantage in regard to english goods and tlis bs he maintained the object of tedt bills djxi of llthzd thogt that the objectwas to prevent foreign goods from receiving tmdue advantage in regard to english goods hear hearthe house divided and the numbers werecontents       not contents     majority       the bill was then read a second timeuganfdalord stanitiore in rising to ask the secretary of state for foreign afairs whether in consequence of the decision of her majestys government not to take into consideration the question of the construc tion of a railroad from the east coast of africa to kikuyu it was the intention of her majestys govern ment to place upon the victoria nyauza and lake albert the steaners recommended by lir g portal to be in that event placed there and whether the deci sion announced with regard to unyoro involved the abandonmenb of the forts erected and the withdrawal of the force stationed in that country said that when about tean days ago the secretary of state for foreign affairs stated the intentions of her uajestys government with regard to uganda the noble earl dealt largely with negatives he told the house that it was not the intention of her majestys government to extend an active protectorate over the states immediately surrounding uganda that it was not intended that the road from mombasa to ugands should be under the control of the commissioner in uganda  and above all that it was not their inten tion to commence the railway from the coast or to take into their immediate consideration whether such a railway was or was not desirable that railway washowever the keynote of the report of sir gerald portal who went so far as to assert that unless and until the railway should be made he had no hesita tion in saying that any organized system of govern ment in the country must be in the nature of a make shift but sir gerald portal either foresaw or dis covered after his return home that the reluctance of the government to emnbark on this enterprisewas likely tothrow initswayobstacleswhichmightprovefatal to it he therefore in view of the possibility that the rail way scheme might fail to be carried out suggested in the last few paragraphs of his report another plan not as an equivalent to the railway scheme but as a bad substitute for it by which large steamers should be placed upon the lakes be should say judging from the internal evidence furnished by the report that sir g portal had put forward the latter plan as a rather hasty afterthought it was clear that the scheme for peutting larger steamers upon the lakes as a substitute for the railway would not meet more than a few of the objects that the railway would carry into effect no doubt the plan of placing the steamers upon the lakes would be cheaper than the construction of the railway for the first few yearsbut eventually it would prove to be the dearer of the two in these circum stances he did not think that the alternative scheme was one which it was desirable to adopt the reason which her majestys government had put forward for not making the railway was the great expenditure that would bave to be incurred this year on account of the railway but as it was clear that the expen diture upon the lnavy would have to be spread over several years the same argument would be put forward every year aainst the construction of the railway he was afraid however that her majestys govern ment would neither make the railway nor place larger steamers upon the lakes those who were connected with uganda bad differed on many points with regard to the administration of that country but they were unanimously in favour of the construction of the rail way hear hear the great difticulty in connexion with urganda was that which related to transport of mnen and goods and it wyas with some surprise that he had hearv the noble lord the president of the council say the other night that he would almost rather have a telegraph line tn uganda than a railway it could not be too often repeated that although the route through the british spbere of induence to uganda w as shorter that throuth the german sphere was easier and cbeaper he had been informed that the last govern mnent stores that were sent to urganda w ere sent by the german route and that we had to pay an ad tazoren customs duty of j per cent m con sequence things were bad enough as they were atresent but they would get worse as time went en because within a short time a line of railway would be constructed through the german territory the consequenc would be that by the time we thought about constructing a british line it would be too late the custom duties would all go to thevgermn authorities and the trade would all go into the hands of the german traders this country would find its protectorate so poor and worthless that it would withdraw if it had been a question as to whether we should go to uganda or not there might be some hesitation but the late government had decided that question at a later period it might have been possible to withdraw but that possibility had been disposed of by the present government vthat could nob be done with any credit was to establish a protectorate and invite a friendly but rival power to undertake the enterprise wvhich we dared not undertake ourselves about two years ago a line of forts wras erected by captain lugard with the object of preventing raids to the south of the line those forts were afterwards abandoned and the garri sons withdrawn later another line of forts was erected for the same purpose he understood from an answer given by the ndersecretary for foreign affairs im the house of icommons that those forts had been put up for the protection of uganda if that wereiobhehad nothing moretosay itxwaspeieneoft so idake those who had hadmno personal experience of dealing with savage races ofo apprecite the danger of a vacillating policy but tot those who had haa that experience he would confidently appeal to say whether anything was more likely to excite unreasonable sus picion and distrust in the native mind than the policv of establishing withdrawing

commissioners on the road was by appealing to the foreign office and then eight months mnust elapse before he received his reply finally he would urge above all things the vast importance of the appointmnent of the commissioner for uganda if a man possessing the exceptional qualities which were necessary was appointed there might be disturbances but if there were not such a mnan but the ordinary commonplace official who looked to his appointment merely as a steppingstone to something better and who looked to members of the house of commons and the london newspapers for guidance then trouble was absolutely certamn possibly there would occur then disaster of a grave and serious character such as this country would be happy to escape from vithout the loss of honour hear hearthe earl

only the opinion of her miajestys government it would nave very little weight with the noble lord laughter with regard to his second ques tion referring te unyoro colonel colvile the acting
