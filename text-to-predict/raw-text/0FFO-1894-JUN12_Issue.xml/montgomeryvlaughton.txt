opened the case for the plaiutiff he said the f rst voi ume of his clients work appeared in  the author describing himself as  an undis tinguished iaval officer the other volumes came out in s the authorship soon became an open secret and was ascribed to his client bv the armag and near geztte in the year  so that they could hardly seriouslv say they did not know he was the authior  myclientsaid mlr isaacs  does not com plain of fair criticism and he proceeded later on to read a critique published by the journal now being sued written in s soon after the first volume came out and couched according to mr isnacs in a very different tone from that adopted in l eight years after the book first appeared the learaed counsel thoe proceeded to give some facts in his clients life in  he entered the navy as a clerk becoming in  assistant paymaster on board the duke of wel lington in  he published the first volime of his book he did this because he had come to the con clusion that there were many most serious abuses in ihe xavy as it was then which required reform le attacked not only the meaurik but the personnel particularly the officers these as he explained in the preface to his book he placed upon a pedestal and subjected to a searching criticism in conse quedce when the authorship became known his popu larity ws not great he wrote lrom knowledge and experience every word he wrote he honestly believed to he true it might not he always trae in minute detailwhat movement of reform was there which had never erred in deail  but it was honest in irs aim some of the statements the book contained it ght have been better taste to have omitted but he was young when he wrote it and at least he believed what he wrote was true an article in the army and narv garettc of september   spoke of  its trenchant and amusing style called it  this remarkable book said that  facts are stubborn things and the facts ot this book are not to be got over by disputing the accuracy of the generalization leduced from them much is true more than out siders can dream of and ended by calling it  thismngent amusing and withal truthful satire it was true the artiele also took exception to much in the aintiffs work his hasty generalization of type frominbat after all were exceptional instances and to his being unfair to certain classes satirized but this the plaintiff did not object to it was criticism he could not agree with but it was fair continuing his history of the plaintiffs life the learned counsel said in t a painful incident happened which no doubt would be made the most of by the other side bat which ought not to affect the mind of the jury als it was in no way material to the present action in  the plaintiff went to townu from his ship theunscan and broke his leave few days later hearing it was stated that he had deserted he communicated with the authorities and at once returned unfor tunately in the meanwhile his boxes had been broken open and £ was found missing from his accounts ue could not explain it but at once offered to make it good he was tried by conrtmartial a tribunal he had always disliked indeed a year before he lad said he would rather be tried bt  members of colney aatch than a courtmartial this seemed almost prophetic for he was sentenced to two years imprisonment and dismissed the service in  he became a free man once more since then he had been honestly and manfully tryiug to earn his living and make once more a position for himself in the world by the arduous but honourable profession of journalism it was now after all these years that his book was described in these terms so different from those used by the same journal a toie time his book first appeared he asked the jury not to be pre judiced against him by his past but to give him pro tection at their handsthe court then adjourned till tomorrow
