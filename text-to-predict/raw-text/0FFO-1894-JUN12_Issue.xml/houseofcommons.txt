a meeting held at tagoat county weaford on sunday may  and reported in theerfod people onmay  which was convened for the purpose of aiding in an effort to rant the grabbers who had taken possession of evicted farms in the locality whether he was aware that one of the speeches delivered at this meetin was a direct incite nent to boycott mr thomas of instown who in the exercise of a legal right had taken three farms which had been vacant for five years whether men who ineited to and who joined in a conspiracy to boycott an individual were guilty of an illegal actnd whether he would consalt the law officers of the crown as to whether the law was broken at tagoat en the occasion in questionmr thomas healy asked whether the only ceut sel given at the meeting referred to vms that the people should act on the advice generally given by the primrose league laughtermr j morleyi do not know that that was the snm total of the advice given laughter but i do not say that it wett much if at all beyond that the newspaper report of the proceedings at the meeting referred to in the question of the hon member or south tyrone shows that resolutions were passed and language used denouncing the practice known as landgbbing and recommending exclusive dealin but the names of individuals are not mentioned in tis connexion no reference was made to the name of mr thomas of martinstown at the meeting and the law officers advise me that there is nothing to show that  one of the speeches delivered at the meeting was a direct incitement to boycott him  as alleged in the question persons who incite to or join a con spiracy to injure another by boycotting or other means are guilty of an illegal act the law officers have advised however that a newspaper report is not legal evidence of what occurred at the meeting nor are they able to say that the law was broken at this meeting even on the assumption that the nevwspaper report was accurate as no particular individual vms named or pointed out and general denunciations of landgrabbmg not directed against an individual are not evidence of a conspiracy to injure him i may add that the police report that the meeting has had no effect whatever on mr thomas or any one elsemr t w russell asked whether the right hon gentleman knew that at a committee meeting of the national federation held on may  the public meeting on the th was arranged for the purpose of taking notice of the action of mr thomas and that the werford pcoplc on the th directed attention to the meeting as being held for that purpose  and whether in view of those facts it was correct to say that no person was directly referred to at the meetingmr j morley said that the hon members ques tion referred to the meeting on waiy  in the pro ceedings at that meeting as reported there was no reference whatever to mr thomas no ill effect had followed from those proceedings and it was the opinion of the most competent oficers in ireland that if they hunted up every case of supposed intimida tion as the hon member did and founded a prosecu tion upon it the effect would be to increase disorder n ireland rather than to lessen it nationalist cheers no people were less pleased with the courso taken in connexion with these matters by the hon member than the people who really wished to see intimidation put down cries of  oh and hear hearmr t w russebl said that with reference to what the right hon gentleman had said he held in his hand a letter cries of  order  and as a matter of personal indulgence he asked to be allowed to quote from it on the ground that the right hon gentleman had stated that the people affected objected to the course of procedure which he adopted he had taken this course of procedure at the direct request of the persons involved the right hon gentleman had stated that these people were not inimred by the meeting he desired to make one extract from the letter upon which he should ask a further question the letter said that after the meeting eas addressed by the hon member for wexford the  miller refused to grind corn for us as he might lose  customers if he did so two of our workmen have left  cries ofordermr sexton rising to order asked whether it was a fair use of the practice of interrogation to read without notice passages from a letter introduoing matters of fact which they had no opportunity of testingthe speaker said that after the statements of the chief secretary he thought some latitade should be allowed to the hon member the right hon gen tleman did make some statement in the exercise of his discretionwith which he was not finding fault which the hon member was now seeking to rebut in the nature of a personal explanation therefore under the circumstances he thought the hon member should be allowed to proceed hear hearmr t w russell said he thought he was justi fied in asking the right hon gentleman after reading from the letter whether he was entitled to stand at the table and say that those proceedings did not injure anybodymr j morleyeven after what the hon mem ber has read i think i am entitled to repeat what i first statednamely that the police have reported to me that the meeting has had no effect whatever these are their own wordseither on mr thomas or any one else the hon member hbs now kdragewhich will of course induce me to apply for further information eear hearmr sexton asked whether a resnlntion as not rnhnimously carried at the meeting in question de claring that lasrabbing should be opposed by legal and constitutioa means whether the chairmn in

as a party question it wyas too grave for that theresen governnent had been in of ice for trwo years and they had done nothing for agriculture the late government were six scars in power and they did not do much for agriculture either so that it might boe said to be six to two in favour of the liberal party the boroughs of essex he contended were affected a great deal more than the surrounding
