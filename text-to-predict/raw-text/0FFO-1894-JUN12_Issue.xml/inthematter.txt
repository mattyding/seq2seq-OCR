in the hatter of the extpabitiox owxeunxerthis was the case of the frenchman meunier com mitted by sir john bridge for extradition on two charges of murder and attempt to murder in paris the two offences charged were on distinct occasionsone on the night of the th and th of march  at the barracks the other on the oceasion of the explo sion at the caf vry on the nd of april last where two persons were killed this was an applica tion on the part of the prisoner for a hkeeas corpub to discharge him on the grounnds that it was not shown that the meunier to whom the depositions taken in paris referred was the meunier who was brought before the magistrate  that the evidence as to the exiplosion at the caf vdry was that of an accom plice airl who was herself accused and triedthough icquitteon the ground that she had acted lnder the control of meunier and required material corro boration   that the evidence was not sufficient to justify a conviction nor enough to be left to the jury the evideace was reported at length meunier described as a carpenter and member of a syndicate was proved to have been at the cfd with a valise c just before the explosion he was arrested at victoria station and said  je sais meunier c adding  i deny nothing iaal an anarchist his own witnesses proved that the prisoner was in paris on the dav of the explosionsir john rigly attorneygeneral and lr reid solicitorgeneral with mr sutton appeared for the crown to support the order for extraditionmr burnie appeared for the accused in support of his application for his discharge and stated the above as the grounds on which he made itthe solicitongeb ral at the desire of the attorneygeneral argued against the gmunds for theapplication the evidene which he read at length was heurged amply sumcient and as to the evi dence of the girlwhich of itself was sufrieientit was abundantly confirmed by the other evidence and as to identity he urged that it was abundantly shown zhotogrs were produeed in paris but not beforel o srdemr be then addressed the court on beshlf of the accused and first as to the point of identity as to the evidence of the girl he said there was nothito identify the person of wom she gave evidence with the prisoner lo photograph was shown to her and she gave no deseription of him there were no hotogrmphs prodaced before sir john bridge it was not enough to receive depositions taken against an accuse person i his absence abroad that therisoner iso the same nae he onght to be identi ed it was merely stated that meunier was a car penter and a member of a trade union no personal escription was given to identify him it was true the prisoner when arrested said  i deny nothing i am an anarchist but he did not admit that he was the metmier nsmed in the warrant which indeed at that time was not read to him to admit depositions taken abroadin theabsence of the acrusedwhichare allowed by the statute to be admitted against the prisoner it is essential that he must be identified with the prisoner it was trui that the prisoner was somewhat deformed and might be described as a  hunmpback and several witnesses had described meunier as  hump backed  but there was no other evidence to identifv meunier as the prisoner next he urged that the woman was an accomplice for she had got a disguise for meunier her evidence therefore required material corroboration and there was none that was sufficient no doubt there was the fact that she said she got a disguise for mieunier and he wore the clothes of another person and that was the strongest piece of corroborative evidence but then it was not connected with the explosion nor did it implicate him with the crime and so as to the fact of hiscarryig a valise though many witnesses were called from the cafe vwrv no one spoke to his having the valise there was no real corroboration of the evidence of the woman and such corroboration was always required in this country he cited  in re castioni  qb div for   he admitted that it was not an absolute rrle of law that it was necessary but as it was deemed unsafe in his country to act upon the evidence of an accomplice without corroboration it would not be proper to extradite a prisoner for trial under such circum stances in england the prisoner would be acquitted and it could not be right to send him for trial to another country then as to the explosion at tbe barracks it was a  political offence it was otherwise as to the explosion at the cafe very for it was aimed at the murder of a particular person a waiter who was suspected of having given information to thepolice but the explosion at the barracks was irected to the destraction of govermment buildings and therefore was of a political character he admitted that it was an act of an atrocious characterand might have caused terrible loss of life but still it was political in its character on this point also he cited the case of castioni on the whole there was no evidence for the jurythe learned judges then conferred and proceeded to pronounce judgment against the prisoner refusing a writ of loaba corpus for his dischargemi justice cave in giving judgment said as to the point that there was not condrrnatory evidence to corroborate the evidence of the woman as an accom plice he thought there was there was inportant evidence as to the valise that there was explosive substance in a gray valise and that the pirisoner had such a valise and there was also the evidence as to the disguise the woman being seen to go to a house and come away with a bundle these were important circumstances and seemed to afford material con firmation further mieunier gave some one a minute description of the crime and at once left the country no doubt each circumstance by itself was sma but as a whole there was material confirmation morever he thought that the existence or nonexist ence of confirmatory evidence was not decisive  but the magistrate must exercise his discretion it was a rule not of lav but of practice and was a matter for the discretion of the magistrate then as to the point of identity he thought that there was suficient evidence the prisoner was named meunier and was a carpenter andi a member of the syndicate of car penters and was an anarchist and there were de scriptions given of meunier which tallied with the appearance of the prisoner moreover mieunier wentadroaa ana tne prisoner was iound in this country and he thought there was sufficient evidence of identity there was a technical objection that there were two offences and only one commitment there was nothing in the act which required a separate commitment for each offence then as to the point that the offence of the explosion at the barracks was  political to constitute a political offence it mnst appear that there were two parties or factions struggling for power and each seeking to impose its rule upon the other and here there was no such con flict the persons with whom the prisoner was con nlected were rather the enemies of all governments and their crimes were rather directed against the people generally than the government and he was very clearly of opinion that this was not a political offence but a crume against citizens and he came to the conclusion therefore that there were no grounds for discharging the prisoner and that the application for a habeas iorpus must be refusedir justice colliis said he was entirely of the same opinion and on the same groundsapplication accordingly dismissed
