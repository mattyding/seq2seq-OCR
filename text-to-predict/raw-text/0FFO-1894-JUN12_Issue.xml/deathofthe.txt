death off the sultan ofmoroccothe death of the emperor of morocco is an event of some importance because it is pretty certain to give rise to internal troubles and these may possibly exert an influence on inter national relations in morocco the principle embodied in the old motto le roi est mort vive k ri  is by no means universally recognized as no adequate provisions exist for the con tinuity of government the death of a ruler necessarily creates a dc facto interregnum in which all the conflicting elements in the country struggle for mastery though the late sultans favourite son and designated successor abdul aziz who generaly accompanied his fatber in his taxgathering tours and military expeditions bas been proclaimed emperor by the court and a considerable portion of the troops it would be contrary to ancient tradition and modem practice that he shoald be peace fully accepted by the nation not only the berber mountaineers may resist until ho has made concessions or at least promises to them but even the city of fez may close its gates against him until he has accepted certain con ditions possibly he may be compelled like his late father to effect an entrance into his capital by means of artillery eiowever this may boe certain it isthat pretenders frornannong his near relations are ready to come forward and contest his claims if they can only find sufficient sup port and as a rule such support is not wanto auley beh assanwho has just terminated a onwparatively long reign succeeded his father sidi whomed as emperor of orocco in  a european traveller who saw him about that time describes him as tall and slender with larg soft eyes a fine aqnuile nose and a perfjotly oval face encircled byyashortblack beard his graceful action smiling and pensive exprpssion low soft voice and dignified manner impitessed all beholders people who knew him said that he was a man of mild disposition and kind heart that he lived austerely that he had but bne wife that before coming to the throne he diiilled with his soldiers and was one of the mosf active among them that he liked work and offen did himself what he might haie left to his seits and that he was at once beloved and fear dby his subjects for some years he was aniiated by the best intentions being anxious tb reform abuses and put an end to the eiactions of his ofeicials at the rane time he was inclined to establish more friendly rela tions with foreign rowers and hoped to dirbinish the religious fanaticism of his people unfortunately these laudable inclinations did not bear much fruit but it must be admitted that for his want of success he was not entirely to blame even if he had been a man of iron will and indomitable energy he would have found it impossible to accomplish very much in the way of reform in theory an autocrat the emperor of morocco has in reality very little power only a comparatively small part of the country is under the control of the central government and in this limited area the sultan has to respect the religious pre judices of the people and follow the advice of the religious authorities in spite of these difficulties some little progress was made if not in matters of internal progress at least in relations with europe travelling in dforocco is no longer a perilous under taking and foreigners may now wander about freely wherever the sultans authority is respected tbe handful of europeans who were to be found in the empire in  have steadily increased and foreign commerce has been in some measure developed if there bas not been much movement it has at least been in the right directionseen from the outside the chief events of the reign of muley el hassan have been frequent expeditions against refractory tribes negotian tions with numerous foreign missions and occa sional complications with foreign powers his ex editiins were by no means always success fueandmany of the tribes remained practically independent paying a small tribute to nsvzre freedom from molestation the diplo matic missions were more serious affairs and ofteni caused his majesty much trouble and anxiety among the powers who annoyed hin in this way were england france spain portugal germany italy belgium and the jnibed states the results hardly justified the expenditure generally a few outstanding commercial claims have been settled and occn mionally some sort of treaty has been extortedtt all the farreaching demands have been systematically refused or evaded the export of wheat and barley remains forbidden except for occasional limited periods prohibitive duties on imports are still maintained nothing is done to improve the harboure and the means of communication with the interior and the right of foreigners to posasess land is made a dead letter by the provision that all aequisitions require the sanction of the local authorities muley el hassan could congratu late himself on having successfully resisted the pressure of foreign diplomacy and it must be confessed that he showed considerable diplo maitic talent of the oriental type but his name will hardly occupy a prominent place in the anials of his coruntry
