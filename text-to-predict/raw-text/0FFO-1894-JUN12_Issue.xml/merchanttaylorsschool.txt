college oxford the pnesmx t of st jois col  in responding said that every member of his colletodk a great interest in merchant taylors schoo which never was lmore efficient than it was tody tshe school of st pauls had been subjected to interference which uot only was entirely uncalled for but was in the nature of interfering with the efficiency of the school lt was inconceivable to him what could be the objeet of such steps the public sehools of london were among the most useful of the schools in the country they had always been fore most in the matter of education and training profes sional peoyle numerous families of cualtured and refined habits of life and thought had in those schools had an opportamity of giving their sons the very best education and m any way to interfere with the education of such schools was it alpenred to him the most cruel and hardhearted thmng that could psibly be done the merchant tmylors school had itheto escaped any such interference it perhaps owed its inmmunity to the want of endowments and he might perhaps commend the wisdom of those j founders who left it to the care of the merchant taylors company he coulld conceive of no better joverning hoey than that which the school possessed in that companythe mastn proposed the toast of  the visitors to which the allbrca a snasdon responded the toast of  the merchant taylors school  proposedby
