the balance of the three months mentioned in the notice from the crown it was contended on behalf of colonel north that the compensation for taking the land and for severance rnd otherwise injurionsly affecting the other lands should be assessed in respect of the residue of the term of  years subject to the right of the crown to determine the term the magistrate overruled the railway companys

dismissing the appealthe iasteii of the rolls said that colonel north had taken a lease of considerable acreage of land with al right of shooting for  years from the crown containing a clause which enabled the crown to put an end to the lease either as to the whole or part of the land by three months notice a railway company proposed to run a line of railway through this land and gave notice to the crown andcolonelnorth thecrown then gave notice to colonel north to put an end to the lease so far as regarded the strip of lnnd required for the railway colonel norths position was then changed and he became owner of the land on either side of the strip for  years but of the strip itself only for three months a question of jurisdic tion as to the assessment of compensation which might have arisen if the matter had stood there aid not in fact arise for the company immediately took possession they then took proceedings under section  of the lands clauses act for having com pensation assessed by a magistrate colonel north objected that te maistrate had no jurisdiction the magistrate upheld te objection aand declined to exercise jurisdiction the company then applied to the hi h coart for a mandamus on the ground that colonelnorth claim was inrespect of aninterest which was within section  colonel north contended that hle had a larger claim but on the hearing of the mandamlas proceedings he failed to formulate that claim snd the divisional court thought he had no colourable right to the interest which he alleged and therefore ordered the mandamus to issue the magi strate proceeded umder section  but doubting whether the decision of the divisional court was right he awarded compensation in the alternative and stated a cased for the purpose of raising the question on which principle he onght to have acted in making the tssessment the divisional court again gave indgment against colonel north and he had appealed ah ogw seemed to be in this siosition that he couldnot insist on a greater interest than could have been adjudicated upon under section  if he had a greater interest then the mandamus was wrong and he ought to have appealed against it he bad not done so and it was now too late for him to say that it was wrong it thus becatme unnecessary to deter mine certain points which had been raised in argu mnent the appeal must be dismissedlord justicet kay read the following judgmentcolonel north the appelant under a lease from the crown dated february   was entitled to certain land fcr a term of  years the lease contained power for the crown to determine the tenancy as to all or any pare of the land upon three months notice the land included a good deal of covert used by colonel north for re serving pheasants in may and june  the beicy heath railway company gave to colonel north notices to treat for a slip of and running through this property for the purpose of making a railway which would be in a deep cutting part of this strip went through and divided some of the pheasant coverts on june  before anything had been done under the notices to treat the crown gave notice to colonel north to determine his lease as to the strip of land included in the notices to trest only then on june  the railway company proceeded to take posses sion under section  of the lands clauses act and gave security for the estimated value of the land nert they took proceedings to have the purchase money and compensation assessed and treat ing colonel norths interest as being for three months only by reason of the notice deter mining his tenancy as to the strip they took proceedings before a magistrate under section  which gives the magistrate jurisdiiction only when the owners interest is as tenant for a year or from year to year the position of colonel north at that time was that he was tenant of the strip for three months only but he was tenant of the ands adjoining on both sides for the residue of the term of  years subject to the contingency of hav ing that tenancy determined on a three months notice colonel north objected to the jurisdiction of the magistrate he said in effecti have three claims first the value of my interest in the land taken secondly damages for severance of the land on either side  thirdly the injuriously affecting the land on either side by the execution of the works or other wise boreover he contended as i understand that each of these three claims should be valued as at the date of the notice to treat not the actual date of the valuation and at the date of the notice to treat his interest in the land actually taken was for the residue of the term of  years subject to the contingency of its being determined by a notice which had not then been given the magistrate decided that he had no jurisdiction thereupon the company applied for a mandamusto the magistrate to assess the purchase money of the land or other compensation on february   the divisional court granted the mandamus as i understand they held that the time to be regarded was the date when the magistrate had to make the assessment the contingency of having the tenancy determined by three months notice had then become astothe striptakenaccrtaintywhichitwasim possible to disregard the price therefore must be the price of a three months tenancy of the strip and the damage by severance must be damage for a three months severance the severance beyond the three months was not by the railway company but by the crowni who by determining the tenancy resumed possession of the strip after the three monthsand i sppose have soldtheirreversion to therailwa company there remained the third claim for injuriouslyaffecting the adjoining land on either side of tfe strip which was held for more than a year or from year to year the divisional court evidently doubted whether the ma  strata had jurisdiction to assess the compensaion for this but they doubted still more whether there was any such injury and they invited comnsel to formulate thair claim on this account counsel could not or would not or at all events they did not do this to the satisfaction of the court and therefore on the ground that there was no tangible claim in this respect the court granted the mandagbs the effect of that was that the divisional court considered that the only valid claims werefirst for the price of the three months tenancy of the lana taken and second tor the severance for three months of teadjacent lands on eithersidc and theyheld thathhese two claims were withiethejorisdidtionofthemagistratet the case went back to himsndihe awarded £sforthesetwo claims but if h hhad jurisdiction to deal with theother claim for inuriosly affecting otherwise than by severance he aarded £ iost and he stated a special case as to which sum should be allowed for the opinion of a divisional court that court upon argument of the special case hold that the matter had been decided upon the application for a man damus and that the larger sum therefore could not be given this appeal is from that decision it seems quite clear that section  applies onlywhen the land taken and the adjoining land are all held for not more than a year or from year to year and that the magistrate had no jurisdiction to assess the larger compensation in this case in truth the proper course for colonel north if he insisted on this larger claim was to have appealed against the order for a mnandamus in order to have had his claims assasmed not by a magistrate under section  but by arbitration or by a jury in the ordinary way under section  on this appeal we are bound to treat the mandamus as rightly granted the only claims which the magis trate could deal with under it were those which he has valued at £ los the decision of the divisional court must therefore be afalrmed and this appeal dismissedlord jijsticx a l smite tlelivered judgment to the like effect
