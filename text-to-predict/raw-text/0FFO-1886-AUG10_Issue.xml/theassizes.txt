the plaintiffs case said that on the lst of july  the plaintiff who was a bailiff at leicester was a passenger from wolverhampton to birmingham by the defendant companys line between hockley and birmingham the plaintiff got up to look out of the window directly he touched the door it flew open and he was pitched head foremost into the sixfoot way his ancle was sprained and he received other serious injuries in respect of these he began an action against the great western company on the th of july  shortly before the action wastobe tried thecomny settled with the plaintiff by agreeing to pay him �u hia taxed costs and his doctor s bill they afterwards refused to carry out the settlement and defended this action on the extraordinary ground that the plaintiff had fallen out of the train on purpose the plaintiff had previously been injured by a collision on the london and north western railway companys line in when he received � and he supposed that that was to be used against him but it could not bh suggested that the plaintiff was himself the author of that collision the plaiutiff then gave evidence in support of his case in crossexamination hs denied that he had told any one that he chose the place to fall out at or that he would have another tv in a short time mr vinrace the surgeon who attended the plaintiff spoke to the nature of his injuries and in answer to the judge said that there was no doubt that the plaintiff took an exaggerated view of them the worst injury from the fall was the enlargement of an old rupture for the defence william tozer engineer was called and said that he was a passenger in the same compartment as the plaintiff on the occasion in question he was dozing ad was roused by a draught of cold air in consequence of the door being open he saw the plaintiff standing on the footboard outside the carriage holding on to the car riage the plaintiff might have gone on into birmingham in that position the train was then going about six or seven miles an hour the train moved on about two lengths and the plaintiff fell backwards on his side clear of the carriage and without any sound or cry edward parish commission agent of leicester saud that the plaintiff told him at the wheatsheaf inn in august  that he had jumped from the carriage in consequence of that statement he wrote a letter to the comnany subse quently he had an interview with the plaintiff in the presence of a detective pitts a detective in the employ of the great western company said that in consequence of the letter from the last witness he was sent to lescester to make inquiries parish and the plaintiff met at the red cow publichouse and he followed them in parish asked the plaintiff how the matter occurred the plaintiff said that he went to wolverhampton taking care to get into an empty carriage some peope got in but they all left exept two before the train reached birmingbam he jumped out sideways faling on his side he knew where he dropped he did not drop on the metals he dropped on the sixfoot way parish asked the plaintiff whether he was unconscious and he replied  i had to be witness reported this conversation in writing to his snperiors the report was put in and read the guard of the train and other officials were caued and said that all the doors were fastened of the train in question mr dugdale having summed up the defendants case mr rose in replying on the whole case asked the jury to sav that it was a gross improbability that an old inactive man already injured in a railway accident and suffering from a rupture should toluntaril throw himself out of a carriage in which there were other passengers and a further gross improbability that if he had done it he should boast of it to strangers the learned judge in summing up the case told the jury that the injuries which the plairntiff had received were compatible either with the theory that he fell out or with the theory that rhe jumped out it was a very remarkable case it might be that the story of the detective and of parish would not altogether commend itself to them  but there was then the evidence of tozer which was quite a distinct channel of information and which it was difficult to reconcile with the plaintiffs case in any event they could not find a verdict for the plaintiff unlessthey were satisfied that the defendants had been guilty of negligence the jury then retired aud after an hours absence requested the judge to inform them whether a verdict for the defendants would neeesssrily imply that the plaintiff threw himself out of the carriage the judgecertainly not the jury immediately after wards returned into court with a verdict for the defen dants
