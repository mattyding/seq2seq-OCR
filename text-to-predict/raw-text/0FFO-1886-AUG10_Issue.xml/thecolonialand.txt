overy one of the animals i eoffectivoly arpanged in the lofty and crowded rophy was shot by himselfand they may be taken as a representative sample of the abundant gamo svhich still roams over canadas northern terri tories and the picturesque slopes of the rocky gountains as a matter of fact howover nearly lhe whole of the specimens arranged in the trophy hiave been obtained wvithin the province of mani toba of the gun club of which province mr hub bard is president as agriculture advances game inust retiro but it will be a long time yet before the game is thus driven out of man toba where for many years to come abundance of sport should be obtainable but as there must be a limit both to agriculture and stock raising in canada there is no roason vhy she should not in her remoter and higher regions be always well stocked with game and so retain tho products of the chase as a not unimportant export furs alone in  counted for  among her exports some of the specimens of mv hub bards skill as a marksman are really superb here we see many of the animals with wvhieh a merican hunting narratives have mado us familiartho jrocky mountain goat the wapiti the big horn the caribou the moose the black and grizzly boars tho arctic fox the skunk with splendid heads of the moose the rocky mountain sheep the elk buffalo antelope and many others with birds of all kinds and varied plumage displaved in all underneath the trophy is a nicely furnished chamber where mr hubbard receives his visitorsand hereif a visitor succeeds in winninahisfavour he will spread out one of the most naagnificent buffalo hides that surely ever graced animal to illustrate the natural thistory wealth of the dominion the canadian government contributes a fine collection of over  birds and  mammals her royal highness the princess louise also contributes a collection of birds a souvenir of her pleasant canadian expe riences the hudsons bay company has a corner to itself in which are arran ed some splendid specimens of its furs adjoinin tho udsons bay companys exhibit is a case containing various specimens of the produce of the island of anticosti and among these various animals including bears a variety of birds gulls ducks eagles hawks c as every one should know this island some k square miles in extent lies right in the centre of the mouth of the stlawrence the popular impression is that it is a dreary island mostly befogged where no one would live unless compelled we are now assured this is a mistake and to prove tho fertility of the islandthe case referred to contains fine specimens of a variety of vegetables besides cereals game fish and other things the island has been bouht by mr f w stockvell and his brothor and a company is being formed to develop it the island evidently affords fair sport and no doubt is capable of yielding crops of various kinds but wo should think it would be difficult to persuado people to colonize it so long as tho mainland has so much space to spare those interested in the island should apply at the bxhibitionfor the abandant literature upon it and tho prospectus of the company and make up their minds for themselves as to its attractions a good many other natural history specimens are on view in this and the adjoining court including a large collection of insects sent by the entomological society of ontarioand as an insect product should be mentioned b of extracted natural honefrom mr holtermann of fisherville haldimand ontariofrom land animals ono naturally passes to the denizens of the waters with which canada has been so abundantly endowed the two great ocans bound her and send offshoots deep into the land  the greatest lakes in the world she shares with the united states  lakes are scattered all over the face of the teiritory and great rivers are everywhere the coilectiob of stuffed and preserved specimens of canadian fishes and marine invertebrates is large and comprehensive and the specimens as a rule in good condition nearly every class of fresh and saltwater fish is represented here from the shark the sturgeon and the salmon down to the haddock and the flounder the importance of the canadian fisheries has been very forcibly brought before the british publio recently in connexion with the disputes with the united states this resource is indeed an invaluable one to canada and she should guard it carofully crustaceans and shell fish are also amply iepresented in this collection as woll as marine mammals like the seal and whale the boating rnan as well as tho fisher will find special delight in walking through the court lying to the west of the machinery sece tiondevoted to fishingapparatus here wehave fish ingtacklein everyvariety and here alsobelongingto the classnavigationwe find those graceful canoes for which canada is famouscedar canoesbark canoes canoes with paddles and canoes with sails and boats aad models of boats and ships of all kinds for fishing for lumber for ordinary

recently been given to the development of the canadianfisheriesand govern ment wisoly does wat it can to encourage them the number of men enaed in the fisheries in  was  the number of large vessels

is of much soientific inte rest the western exhibits however aro those whieh aro likely to attract mest attention while specimens will be found over nearly the whole of the courts in one form or

poplar black birch balsam and other trees characteristic of the dominion the hastings baw mill coin pany british columbia rend fine sections of the douglas fir probably the most valuable treo of that

various woods belonging to the uorthwest torri tories the show cases moreover are nearly all of caoedian woods from the new brunswick govetnment there is a fine collection of woods of that province in tho central court arranged in planks as a trophy with leaf fruit and flowor zidey paintod on oalwh generally speaking thepine of various species is the mts valuable timbertree ofc anada the white pine and red pino over most of the eastdrn provinces and the douglhs pine of british columbia thon wo have white and black spruce hemlock white red and black balsam pine larch birch maple beech cedar and a great variety of others though that variety is not to be compared witlh what we find in the united states of all these the whito pine is no doubt the most valuable and best known the sprace in its three varieties is of importanco to the lumbertrade of the maritime provices the bark of the homlock is valuable for its tanning properties while that of the whlite birch is the bark bo much used for canoes the birdseye maplo furnishes beautiful furniture wood whlile many other trees of tho canadian forosts find other uses if for nothing else at least as firewoodbut even at the present day wo fear the canadians show the most reclkless disregard for their forests  though since the advent of the european fires have done far more to sweep away the forests than the agricultural pioneer or tho lumberman dr robert bell of the geological survev im a paper read at the montreal meeting of tho british association states that the amount of timber which has been lost through forest fires in canada is almost incredible and can only be appreciated by those who have travelled much in the northern districts the proportion of red and whitoe pino which has thus been swept away in the ottawa valley and in the t maurico and georgian bay regions is estimated by the lumbermen as many times greater than all that has beeoo cut by the axe yet all this is insignifi can bin quantity compared with the pine spruce cedar latch balsanic which have been destroyed by this means in the more northern latitudes all the way from the gulf of st lawrence to nelson river and thence northwards the total quantities which have disappeared are almost incalculable but even a rough estimate of the amount for each hundred or thousand square miles shows it to have been enormous and of serious national import ance his is all the more to be deplored that these forest fires are usually tho rosult of gross carolessness on the part of lumbermon and indians any laws existing on the subject seem to bo a dead letter as a matter of fact practically no care whatever has been exercised as to the cutting down of theso forests as a rule they belong to the central or to the provincial governments and are let out in sections to tho lumbermen who cut down the trees as if the pros perity of canada depended on gotting her surface as rapidly denuded of timber as possible it was until recently the same in the united states but there the people have begun to realize the alarm ing truth that their timber supplies were getting rapidly exhausted indeedthenorthwestern states import largey from canada systematic planting and forest conlservation have nowbeen introduced and beneficial results must follow the lumber men of canada the real pioneers of settlement have done splendid service in the past in opening up the country and preparing tho way for the farmor and stock rearer but canada is a big country  there is amplo room on her broad sur face both for timber and for grain and much of the denudedregion is suited only for forest the geater part of the white oak and rock elm mr bell assures us have been already exported the cherry black walnut red clover and hickory have likewise been practically exhausted red oak bass wood white ash whitc codar hemlock butternut hard maple c as well as many in ferior woods are still to be found in sufficient quantity for home consomption a considerable supply of yellow birch still exists and in some regions is still almost untouohed mr bell shows that the white pine the great timber tree of canada has a very much more limited area than is popularly supposed even if we include the douglas pine area of british columbia the pine region is very limited compared with the whole area of canada the prinoipal white pine reserves as yet almost un touched aro to be found in the region around lako teniiscaming and thence westward to the eastern shore of lake superior and to the central parts ofthedistriet betweentheottawa atgeorgian bay but the exportable white pine mr bell tells us must be exhausted in a few yearsthough there are still vast quantities of spruce and larch to fall baqk upon not to mention the immense supplies of british columbia but there are still vast forests of small timber in the northern regions which can soon be used for agricultural purposes and which could be used for railways telegraph poles fencs and such liko still surely the condition of the canadian forests deserves the serious attention of the centralandprovincialgovernments if it isdecided that they are not worth preserving then let the reckless lumberman and the forest fire have their way but surely a product which has still so im portant a place im the exports and in the internal economy of the country deserves looking after all that is wanted is systematic cutting andaystenatic planting not only of native trees but of such foreign species as would flourish on canadian soil in an official report published in  it was esti mated thatexcluding manitobaandthen orthwest territory about  square rriles of canada were under forestand of this  square miles were in british columbia and  in quiebec the total value of forest produce exported ia  wvas  and of this about nine and a half millions each went to greatbritainandthe united states about threefourths of this export was classed as lumbo including planks boards joists deals and staves about two and a half million dollars werth being in the form of special timberthistimber export does not include manufactured articles of wood of which there are so many exhibits both in the central court the west gallery and the stalls in the arcades it was found at the consus of  that the number of factories engaged in industries dependent on wood was  tho number of hands employed  and the annual value of the products we have said that canada is at present mainly in the second stage of national progress the agri culturaland that agriculture must always be the staple industry but all the canadian courts in tho exhibition give ample evidence that she is rapidly advancing to the third stage the manu facturing it was found at the census of  that the capital invested in manufactures of all kinds amounted to over  the number of hands employed to  and the total annual value of the products came to  million dollars no wonder then that manufactures oceupy so prominent a place in the canadian courts it is well that this is so ior nothing will better demonstrate to the ordinary visitor the rapid and allround progress of the dominionthat it has long ago ceased to be inhabited simply by backwoodsmen and hunters there is probably not a manufacture of importance unrepresented from pianos to nails and from tweeds to biscuits the central court in which the principal articlos of this class atfe arranged is always crowded and indeed it looks like the show room of a great storo beginning at the tvest end of the court we havo cases devoted to boots and shoes nd cooper work of all kind the former highly creditable and the latter varied and excellent alongside of them in the centre of the court is a great variety of furniture much of it handsome and even artistic and all of it sub stantialhandsome wooden bedsteads chairs of most initing make billiard tables carpets tables mirrors wall papersand in the court to the north bods and bodding of every doscription the desks cabioiets and otffce furniture are parti cularly striking and novel and quite equal to similar productions from the united states it is enrious how america should havo gone in so largely for this partioular kind of nianufaeture a little further on we find a small xection of wall spaco devoted toa new kind of window blind very prettily paintedin different patterns and waterproof we believe along both sides of this court many cases aro devoted to woollen manufactures as well as some  cotton goods  we find tweeds flannels blankets plaids and woollen articles oflll kinds the main characteristic of them seems to us tobo utility they are evidently useful wearing goods making no pretence to tao finish and elegance of similar tqxtuyes from now zea land and now south wales not to men tion tho mother country in time no doubt canada vill be independent even of the mother country even for the most finishedwoollen if not cotton textiles and the most elegant boots ancd shoes among otlher classe of articles in this department we find hats of all kinds corsets and umbrellas fur goods of every aitswn silks and ribands and oilk godssome prett lace work mocass  wehave of corrse of all patterns and leather nd leather articles of various kinds besides boots and shoes canada like every other big colony has its biscuit trophy contributed by christie brown and co of toronto occupying several hundred squaro feet of vall space and showving evory variety of biscuit all looking toothsome and well shaped beyond the biseuit trophy and around the agricultural trophy we have canned meats and fruits in endless variety condiments and sauces confectionery ale porter and lagor beer and even canadian wines and rye whisky as canada growvs excellent grapes in its southern districts vinland was the first name given to america by its great norse discuverers a thousand years ago there is no reason why she should not mako toler able wvines though wvo cannot pronounce on the quality of thoseexhibitedhaat probably attracts most attention in the central court are the pianos and organs so largely exhibited probably few people thought that canada was sb far advanced in civilization as to bo able to produce such a profasioii of articles in this class in american organs and american pianos sho evidently is quito capable of holding her own with tho united states all of the instruments shown in this court are of excellent exterior finish and competent judges assert that some of these pianos cainot be matched in englandat least in all thoso characteristics of tone and quality which are most valhed by experts in the court of masoa and risch of toronto is an exhibit which at the pre sent moment is of special interesta lifesize oil portrait of the lato abbe liszt a letter from the abb to the firm speaks in high terms of one of their pianos sent him and informs them that ho sends them his portrait painted for them by baron jakovsky it is no wonder the firm are proud to exhibit this portrait and decline to part with it for any money ut they are not the only firm of exhibitors who produce excellent pianos as any player can find out for himself tho american organ is thero in many varieties and its music generally wvell played always attracts a crowdbefore leaving this court we should mention the knitting nmachine which is taught by a girl and vvhich will finish a pair of socks in half an hour while you wait  in fact  and tho tobacco stall near tho agricultural trophy in which canadian grown and manufactured tobacco is on sale in various forms and of fair quality here also we find the sowving machine which has become an american specialty and somo rolls of beautiful canadian paper with highly creditable specimons of account books and other paper products passing on once more into the machinery court we find other large exhibits of woodwork doors and window sashes mainly which are made in a whole sale fashion and exportedto a considerable extent in this couit is an ingenious railway carriage window fitted with clarkes automaton window sash by which the window can be raised or lowered to any height with tho certainty that it will stay there eere also we see wood in com bination with iron and steel in every variety of instrument and implement besides tho agricul tural machinery already alluded to we find hero many other pjroducts of the metal manufacturing industries an ironplaning machino and a fretworkmachino aro specially worthy of notice for their simplicity lightness and cheapness a sawsharpening machine in which a little emery wheeldrivenbymachinery does tho work offec tively rapidly and quietly will commend itself to all who nave ever been tortured by the oldfashioned process of conducting the operation the same hart emery wheel company show emery wheels of all sizes in this court then we have a great biscuitmaking machine with every thing complete from the flourbin onwards the corless enrgines of horse power and wvesting house engine are compact and should be ex tremely useful for many purposes there is a vast display of tin utensils of all kinds on the walls and of ranges and stoves for every and any kind of fuelcoal wood or gas we never saw anything in tbis country equal in finish and handiness and strength to the spades and axes which are exhibited here in such immenso varietv the nail trophies and the augers aro things of beauty while the steelwire doormats are a great improvement on the open indiarubber article the buffalo barb fa nee are an ingenious adaptation to peculiar canadian conditions the machine made horseshoes seem to us worthy of attention and so is tho hotwater heating apparatus shown in this courtbut it would be hopeless to attempt to givo anything like an adequate idea of the multitude of manufactures which englands greatest colony is able to show as evidence of her progress that progress so far as manufactures are eoncerned has been extremely rapid in recent years the capital invested in nanufactures increased from sg in s to  in  and the annual value of theproducts froni to �gooo this development has been most markod since  mr carlings hand book informs us that a partial investigation made in  in tbo provinces of ontario quobecoew brunswick nova scotia and prince edward island shows that there had been in  an increaso over  of  per cent in the number of hands employed of  per cent in the amounn of wages paid of  per cent in value of products and of  per cent in capital invested in  there were only two woollen mills in all canada and in  the first tweed factory was started now there are  carding and fulling mills  hosiery factories and  tweed and other woollen mills employing a total of  handsz and producing goods to the annual value of  million dollars up to  canada exported large qpantities of her wools and imported manufactured woollens the returns of  showthat the exports of canadian wools were ouly b a decrease of b as com pared with the export of  the first cotton mill was established in canada only  years ago now there aro  mills in the ldominion with  spindles in  the imports of raw cotton were b in  it was b the number of hands employed has increased  per cent since  lthe im ported cotton is about  million yards leaving million yards to be supplied by canada factoriesthese figures do not look well for british industry taking the census figures of  the magnitude of some of the other indufstries repre sented in the exhibition may bo seen from the fol lowing tablewhile dealing with manufactures we ought to say that in the most westerly of the canadian courts will be found varied wooden articles on a large scale cheese manufacturing machinery with specimens of cheese to taste handed you by a nice looking girl wood fibre used for a variety of pur poses vats c above all here will be found a very various exhibit of oarriages of all kinds from the neat broughamuptothe buggyand tealwwagqn with sleighs of the most luxurious anld elaborate patterns the width of axle of these carriages compared with the body is remarkable and is evidently adapted to a country where snags and stumps and boulders would soon play havoc with a narrow gauge trap the slenderness of the spokes and rims of the wheols seems also strango but then they are made of hickory as strong as steel and practicaily unbreakable the finish and work manship of these carriages seem all that could be dosiredthere is miuch else that deserves notice in con nexion with these spacious canadian courts if space permitted we have referred to the speci mens of paper in thelfain court in the machinery court will be seen a canadian newspaper printing machine by e b biggar of m ta at work while in tlhe educatioual court will be found speci mens of nearly every newspaper and journal pub lished in canada and there ar many of them somo  altogether of these  are daily  tri weekly  semiweekly  weekly  altogether are issued in french seven german

compare with the best of th osoinothercolonies canada has alreadyproduced a vory creditable national literature notably in history and science as the section devotedto education and instruction shows canada has an excellent system of national education this section has been admirably arranged by dr passmore may the commissioner in charge of the education exhibits and wouli require an article to itself to do it justice in this dlepartment we have a very considerable libral of works relating to canada a feature wanting irn most of the other colonial courts we regret to se that canada seems as far behind in geographical instruction as wo are ourselves to judge from the maps exhi bited which on the whole aro very pfvor there is one greoat roef map of eturope shown by the education department which is very bad indeed we find for example a great range of mountains ip kent as high as the gram pians otherwvise this educational cxhibit reflects the highest credit on the colony there is much historical and statisticalmaterial showing the progress and present eoridition of edu cation exhibits illustrativo of school methods and orgaiiization a fair show of photographs of schools colleges o school furniture and fit tings somo of them highly ingenious textbooks of all kinds apparatus used in teaching anatomy and physiology physics chemistry and other sub pets with abunydant specimens of pupils work im all departments then wo have exhibits for mechanics institutes art schools institutes for deaf dumb and blind agricultural and other special collegostuniversities and thohigher institu tions all these are shown and are exhibited by the ontario government but other provinces have also sent exhibits the geological societys exhibit of maps is very large and the cartography good the magnificent map in tho main court on the scale of  miles to an  inch deserves special notice  it has been prepared under the direction of tir jollingwood schreiber chief engineer and general manager of the dominion aovernment railways to the many photographs throughout the court illustrativo of the scenery the cities and the people of canada wo can only allude merely mentioning the large groups illustrative of toboganning and the sknting rink the paintings we may have an opportuniity of referring to afterardsenough has been said to prove how abundant and various aro the activities of our anadian brethren since confederation in  the story has been one of steady advance in all directions now she has  miles of railway spread over her broad domain with projects of sundry bralhes extending from the main track in all profitable directions her debt is somothing like  millionssterling and is has mostly been expended on useful public works not much more than the debtotf new zealand which has only onetenth of the population revenue and expenditure have bothgrown and so has trade with considerable fuctuations however the great country west wards is being rapidly taken in manufactures as wo have seon are growing with everincreasing rapidity notwithstanding the marked difterence between the english and the french colonists they manage to get on with wonderfully little frictionthe english section wisely accommodatinc themselves in language educational matters ana other respects to the older occupants of the country the country does not need to be vamped up and already it has almost out lived misrepresentation for thoss who desire detailed information on points on which we have only been able to touch there is abundanco of literature and trustworthy information may always be obtained from the oflice of the high commis sioner sir charles tupper to whoso enthusiasm and intelligonce the canadian section owes its success weg ourselves must acknowledge our indebtedness to his courteous secretary mr j g colmer for the assistance rendered us in inspect ing the canadian courts
