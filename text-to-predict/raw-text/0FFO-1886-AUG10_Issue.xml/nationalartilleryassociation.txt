ntational artillery associationthe second division of artillery vclunteers at shoe buryness commenced the active work of artillery soldiers yesterday with the same oider and regularity which characterized the work of the first division in the early morning the first duties of encamped soldiers were per formed and the men and tents stood ready for inspection battery by battery then the breakfast parades were beld and the men were marched to the huge mess tent where the army cooks from aldershot had prepared for them after breakfast the men vere again paraded for in spcction this time by colonel ewes ra and they were then marched out to the marshes aud batteries some to the former to do repository work or to drill with the greater pieces of ordnance and others to the latter to fire five sheliwith the pounder palliser muzzleloading gun as soon as the detachments had fired they were p t upon some other duty and those vho were at first caled to drill took in turn the post at the gun thus every de tachmentcanadian and britishwas kept hard at work the ambulance bearers accompanied the columnthecompetition yesterday on the batseries wasas already stated wvith the pounder palliser gunof a similar character to that of the first day of last week there were four targets placed out at sea over the mlaplins in a line or apparently in line with the nore light wqhich is on the other side of the channel the targets were six feet in height and were placed at a distance of  yards from the batteriesa little over a mile the targets in each case formed the centre of a parallelogram ft by ft marked oft by banderols and this space was again marked off into inner aud outer a shell bursting over the inner part near the target end at no greater elevation than ft from the planecounted  points  a shell burst ing a little forward or a little in rear of the inner parallelogram and still within the boundary counted nine  while a direct hit through the target with a shell which does not burst at the time whatever it may do afterwards counts only six points as on the correspond ing day of last week there were four prizesthe first � given by sir richard wallace and the others principally by the association the competition was of such a character as to bring out the best qualities of the volun teers as artillerymen and in order to score the best drill had to be combined with the clearest knowledge of practical gunnery there were four rounds allowed to eachdaytarend the hihest possible score was  points in the dayaud the points obtained had to be got within ten mninutes or the score lest points in the event of scores being equal the one done sn the shortest time had the prizethe detachments who commenced the firing had to do their work in a very peculiar light which was most puzzling to the number ones themembersof the teams who ay and aim the guns a heavy storm cloud overhung the water most of the morning the weather being what is called muggyandcloseandnow and then a gleam of sun shine glinted out presenting varied shades of light which interfered greatly with the aim there was scarcely any wind and what there was came from the firers right this puffed the smoke from the guns lazily and it hung about the range making the atmosphere still more hazy detachment after detachment went in and scored badlythat is to say theydid not come up to the high standard required at the meeting to score the oanadians were watched with interest and the first detachment with corporal bell as no  came to grief  but the second detachment under bombardier bridgefordmade a good scoreitproved the best score of the day when it is seen that the highest score of last week with the shell firing was  after the morning firing and during the dinner hour the storm cloud burstand there was a sharp and welcome shower of rain which cleared the air and the light was better in the afternoon the firing generally in the morning gave shots returned  under owing to the sight being taken too low and the curious thing was that nearly al the detachmeuts made this error in some cases there were  overs and doubtless this arose from refraction on the sun coming out the com plete scores of the firing could not be made out last night and only the winners could be given there was warm cheering in camp when it was known that the canadians had won the firsb prize with a score of  with shell and so had become the possessors of sir richard wallaces nine cups value � the time was excellent of all the top scorers as will be seen from the following abstract of the top resultspirst prize won by no  detachment of the canadians with  points in min sec  second prize byno  detachment of the st cheshire and carnarvon with  points in tnin sec  third prize by no  detach ment of the d lancashire liverpool with  points in bmin sec  and the fourth prize by no  detach ment of the st lancashire liverpool with  points in min sec the d kents no  detachment with  points in min sec and the no  detachment of the id lancashire with  points in min isec received certificates for making scores equal to that which took a prize and in good timethe repository competition of this week commenced simultaneously with the competitions from the batteries the work in this may be shortly described as the shifting by simple appliances such as ropes spars and scotches of a pounder gun of a dead weight of cwt from one gun carriage the gun being dragged over an intervening space by the like simple tacklae here are two methods by which this can be carried out and the two drills are called the  a  and  b  shifts the drills give the men the necessary instruction in garrison artillerymens duties in warfarewhen the occasion frequently arises tochange agun from one side of a fort to another and under circumstances which demand that the gun itself shall be uismounted and remounted that the men shall all be instructed in both  shifts  it is one of the rules that they come into camp without knowing which shift they will be called upon to do and the winner of the shift in one week has to com pefe rwith the winner of the shift in the second to show which is the best in both thus last week the b hift was donethis being the removal of the gun down the rear of the carriage the removal of it on a sledge which the team have to construct and this works on rollers the gun is then carried over a space representing a ditch by parbuckling on long skids the shift  a  commenced yesterday consists of the dismounting of the gun by rolling it over so that it shall fall clear of the platform the construction of a temporary sledgo on to which the gun is lifted by first one end and then the other being gradually raised and then the gun is moved on the sledge round a traverse eight feet in height it is then parbuckled up another carriage put into the line of fire and run up the maximum time for doing one or the other of the shifts is min and points are given for drill in the whole of the work but while time and drill both count drill counts most when the shift is done wvithin timnethe work of yesterday was watched by colonel nairnoe bs the commandant who was attended by garrison briade major walford ra lord limerick lord h vtane tempest colonel s l howard who has quite recovered from the accident in the field recorded in the tmws in the surrey stag hunt and many other offlcers the lancashire men both of liverpool and manchester for the most part made bad time and leboured over the task  but a smart piece of work was performed by the th durham who discharged their task quite coolly in imin in the afternoon nearly all the camp and garrison went oat into the marhes to see the canadians under sergeant gaffney do the shift the officers of the de tachment colonel armstrong and captain drury were both present and the visitors on the occasion were greatly increased the drill was well carried out and the whole of the team worlked together like a piece of machinery they followed strictly the lines laid down by thedrill book that is no  tricks  for the saving of time the work presenting a very soldierly performance but the team ex ceeded the timo allowedtakiing about min sec to do the workl and thus ere ruled out the tearn had the satisaction of knowing that their work was watched with interest and it was secn with
