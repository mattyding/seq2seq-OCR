dealing with debenture holders as a class in his lordships opinion this was a compromise within the act of  and being a fair one it was also such a compromise as the coutt ought to sanction his

were the counsel appearingin ee tlomas burnitt and company limitedthis case showed the ingenious uses to which the com panies act  may be put to the exclusion of personal indebtedness it was a petition for the winding up of the comanym presented by an unsatisfied judgment creditor for � odd it ap eared that the company was established in january  lor the object of among others acquir ing the businest of thomas burnitt of nos  and  great northerm potato market kingscross and nos  and jamesstreet coventgarden pctato merchant c rhe registered offices of the com any were at nos  and  great northern potato market the petition was op posed on behalf of the company by the said thomas bur nitt who daimed to be the holder of � debentures of the comupany upon which interest was in arrear and by reason of the nonpayment whereof he was entitled to call in and enforce payment of the whole principal amount of the debentures thomas burnite stated that he was the only debentura holder of the company and claimed a charge on  its assets he also stated that the nominal capital ofjhldi conpany was � divided into  shares of   each and that  of the shares were al lotted to him asfully paid up sharesand that of the remain ing shares only  had been allottedupon which calls to the extent of s d had been made but that  of such shares had been forfeited and that the assets of

being the companys managing director he submitted that under the cir cumstances stated a windingup order would be altogether useless and of no benefit to anybodyand that the petitioner could not obtain any benefit therefrom as there were no assets whatever avaulable for payment of his debt the petitioner was a potato merchant also carrying on business inthe great northern potato marketmr p b abraham appeared for the petitioner and mr e ford for the companymu justioe chrty said that thomas burnitt had sold his business to a company and also very nearly sold it to himself the business was in form that of a limited company but in substance it was thomas burnitt carry ing on business in the guise of a company thomas bur nitt appeared to have thought it fair to thus obtain potatoes from the petitioners and others and then when they were not paid to say that he was the flrst creditor having a � debenture security covering the whole business the petitioner was entitled to take an order for winding up the company which however he would have to work out at his own risk if it should evene that the debenture security was as stated then the petitioner would obtain nothing and have to pay his own costs but no harm would be done to anybody else on the other hand the making of an order would perhaps enable the petitioner to inquire into any irregulanty in the security claimed he should therefore make the usual windingup order
