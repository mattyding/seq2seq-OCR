the  british agsociatiobfor the fonrth time on september  the ritish association meets in birmingham the first birmingham meeting toolc place in  the second  years laterand the third  years ago in  everything promises that the fourth birmingham meeting will be one of the most uc cessful on record at least in certain respeqts so far as tho various presidential addresses go we have reason to believo thay will deal with subjects of wide and critical importance in the several branches of science with which they deal whilo the discussions arranged ior in more than one of the seetions will introduce an element of real originality and give an impulse to further and fruitful resoarch while no doubt the bulk of the papers will be of the usual secondhand character there will certainly be a very fair pro portian of novelties so far as the local arrange iments go they ivil probably leavo nothing to be desired the local committee have gone about their work in the most liberal and eager spirit and for months past have been busy devisipg dis tractions and dissipations for their or ected  or  guests so far as we can seo nothing but persistently bad weather can mar the complete success of the forthcoming meetingone noveltyit certainly will possess  it will be markedly colonial the president sir william dawson president of mgill college montreal is one of the foremost of colonial scientists and one of the most eminent of living geologisis his fellow canadian professor mlacoun wvill be a worthy representative of colonial botany  dr selwyn the able head of the canadian geological survey will no doubt tell the story of the great work which is being carried out under his dtiec tion from now zealand we shall have sii julius von aast as an emrinont representative of its vastly interesting geology and geography and drullorc mg whoso  birds of new zea land  is aclassicinsciencoand whose maorieollec tions form one of the great attractions in tho new zealand court of the colonial exhibition but wo need not go over the catalogue of more or less distinguished representatives of colonial and indian science who will this year add a fresh feature to the meeting of the britis h association other eminent colonists will be here also and will thus bo able to witness what in spite of all pro phecies still romains a characteristic feature of english life and perhaps the excoptional opportunity will be taken advantage of to devise somo means of permanently extending the opera tions of the associationso as to make it imperial and not simply english and thus form one moro connecting link betwvon the variousportions of the empire the matter has been seriously discussed in australia where as in new zealand scienco holds a most important place and where scientific societies are nearly as plentiful as they are at home various plans have been proposed and the subject mioht vory appropriately be discussed informally atieast at the birmingham nieeting among distinguished foreigners who have promised to be present is mr phelps the united states miister who will thus mnifest his neighbourly good feeling to the distinguished canadian presidentsir william dawsons presidential address will of course be mainly geological and we believe it will deal specially with the geological history of north america a subject of the greatest interest and even fascination it will necessarily involve much reference to modern physical geography as well as to the geofraphy of past geologicalperiods it will deal specially with tho atlantic borders both of america and europe  it will bo shown that a study of the older recks proves that while within certain limits the continents of america and europe have undergone frequent oscillations their essential permanence awd the permanence of the intervening atlantic cannot be doubted the subject is sure to receive able treatment at tho hands of sir william dawson though possibly some of bis conclusions may not be palatablo to extremists the address of the president of seetion aprofessor g hdarwinwill alsoprobably be of intorest to geologists as well as physicists professor darwinfs investigations with reforence to the probablo age of the earth its rate of tibling the oondition of its irnterior and similar poblems are well known to the scientific world it will not be smuprising then that the theories which havo been broached on these points should form the subject of his birminghat address we may be sure however that they will be dealt with in a rigidly scientific fashion and that there will be no pandering to the popular love of sensation though the subject is sensational nuhiitself i ienough inno one has done more to infuse new life iato the association and inerease its usefilness than professor bonney during the period he has illed the office of secretary the compliment paid him of miaking him president of setion cis thoroughly well deserved both on this account and because of his eminence as a geologist in recentt ears the microscope has beceme avery potent instrumeit in geological research and we believe professor wonneysaddress will deal with the results of the study by meqns of this instrument of the strac ture of grits and conglomerates it will be shown that we havconstant indications in the mate rials of these rocks of a large land area in imtne diate proximity to and sometimces partially inclusivyafthe flritish isles this will be held to indieate that in all probability the older rocks of scandinavia britain and rittany are the rem nantsof an almost continontal land the remark able abtndance of granitoid ricks schists and other mire or less metamorphosed materials in the earlierpalheozoic fragmental rocks shows that this anciontiand area must even then have existed and have been composed of archzenn rocks firther it will bemaintained that the nature and distri butionaf the sediments in the english fossil bearhigbcksindicato that they were often imme diately connected with important rivers draining this ancient land and wero probably formed in the great majority of cases at no great distance from its shoro linesmrcarruthers presidernt of sectiondis keeper gf the botanical departnient in tho natural history museuma south kensington and has a very sqid reputation as a botanist he ii  hure to take advantago of this exceptional opportunity to deal with some important aspect or aspects of his own department and we may be sure that his treatment will be marked by moderation anil caution aswell as full knowledere sir frederic goldsmid is sure to be a popular president of the most popular section that of geography at the same time we may confidently expect that his addresg will contain much well worth listening to considering the recent action of the royal geo graphical society wfth reference to geographical education it is probable that sir redenrics address will deal to a considerable extent with that subject not only in its social aspectsbut in its widest bearings sir frederir may attempt to show how much every traveller might contrsbute to the advancement of ninwladas well as  ownenpcyment it ipst oi all he had somee elementary instruction in methods of observationin section f the address of tho president mr biddulp martin is likely to be of much more general and muel aore seientific interest than is usually the casg in this muchmaligned section mr martin after referring to tho widely ivej gent views that have been held as to the relatiolns of economic inquiry to scictiee iy its  own pro fessors and to the equally divergent theories that obtain as to ther scope andlimits of science and art respectively will vindieate the study of politieal ecqnoqmy from tho charge that it has fallen into abeyance or that havnng surrendered its out works it is now only concerned to detnd its citadel mer martin will probably claim that theb ppsition of economics is rather in analogy with the physical sciences to have taken up wider ground and that tho tendency is to break away from the narrow basis of  orthodox  political economy and to include in its inveatigationq tho whole sphere of social science the study of statistiqs is inseparably ponnected with that of economics and tho former cannot be lirmited to the more ompilation of faures without hny  attempt to draw conclusions therefrom any mpoe thanl the latter oan be resirioted to the study of  the rules that tendlt tho aenumujation of wealth tho meeting place of the association will mo douht suggest  some consideration of vital statistics m view of tho general tendency o poplation to leavo the country for tlihetown an ih mportnce  will be urged of accurate kjowiotgon thisheand as the first step towards jk ioamartin in cgnolasion may deal with the vexed problem o the indeox numberiti section g it would mlot be surprising if sir jamus douglass dealt with some such subject as marineo ongineering  if not speoial lightheuse engineerinp while air geore campbell wvill deal with practical rather than scientifio anthropology advocating the study of the crleature msan ashe exists rather than inquiries into his origin and developmontas was the case last year discussions on certain topics of present and wide interest will be arranged for in severalof the sectionsespecially the frst four the organizing committee of seption a for exajmple has arrariged that a special dis cussion will be heldjointly with section d on the physical and physiological theories of colour vision the disdussion will be opened by lord raloighanddrmichael foster will also take part in it in the chemical section professor tilden we understand will introduce a discussion on the subject of solutions in all the sections an un usually large number of papers have been promised and a vory fair proportion of them will have the merit of originality in section c special efforts have been made to secuire a number of good papers on local geology probably the whole or the greater art of the first two days of tlhe meet ing will be devoted to the discussion of thesea considerable number of the leading local geologists havo promised papers on their special subjects of study and no point of interest m the district is likely to escape wvithout some notice tho cambrian or precambrian rocks of hartshill and the lickey the wrekin the coalfield the ineoua rocks f tho vicinity and abovo al tho gliacial drifts will recoive fuli notice the presi sent sir xy dawson sir julius von xaast professor renard of briissels professor judd professor lapwortb professqr rupert jones dr hicks dr crosskey and many others hlave promised papers on various subjects after de voting the above time to the hearing of local geology the visitors will be better able to ppre ciate what they will see in the numerous interesting geological excursions proposed for the satur day afternoon and the thursday it is intended to illustrate the geolposy of the district by a series of specinens at the bmngleyhall exhibition new zealand coal will form the subjeet of a special paper by sir julius von eaastin the biological sectiqn it is to be hoped that tho serious modifications in the darwinian theory of selection just propounded by mr romanes will come up for discussion in section e as usual more papers have been promised than there will be time to overtake there will be some very decent lions in this section perhaps the greatest of these will be the rev mr brown who has spent  continuous years in the pacific islands most of the time in the new britain group where it vwfil be remembered we sorno years ago waged war with the natives much to the con pternation of the missionary societies mr brown will here say much that is new and interesting about the islands and the people among whom he has lived so long mr rmilly commissioiner for the wvestern pacific whose charming work on that region has recontly been publishedl is also expected to give a paper it will be both racy atrd instructie then from new guinea there will be captain everill the able and successful leader of the australian geographical societys expedition to that island it is hoped that dr bnller if not also ir julius von haast will tells us something of tho geo graphy of new zealand while mr mason the commissioner fdr fiji will give the most recent informnation on that group the geography of the canadian pacific railway may come in for notice while from africa we shall have mr joseph thomson on his recent journey up the niger and mr cope whitehouse on his recent valuable researehes on the site of lake moeris papers on bechuanhland on burmah on central asia on deep sea research on geographical education and on other subjects will give variety and interest to this section additional attraction will be lent to geography this year by the exhibi fion of appliances used m geographical education which wll be opened during the meetingsoction f will have rather a crowded list of papers over  havo already been promisedr many of them likely to be of great interest on educational subjects there will be papers aong others hy sir philip magnus and crosskey various aspects of the great land question will be treated by lord onslow and professor foxwell on allotments ladv verne and mr archibald lea n smiall icligs professorfseam the hon jhn lpwe of ottawa and others on the subject of labour nnd wages several papers are proinised as also on prices and currency and on tarifts ihe subjact of eraigratien will be dealt wvith by r lialiburton ind mr westgarth while papers on subjects of abstract interest are promisod by professor sidgwick and mr patrick o dedds tho saturday evening lectmre to work ing men we may say will be given by professor chandler robertsausten fr the subject boing  colours of metals and alloys a subject whieh has doubtless been sleeted inview of the importance to birmingham of its metallic in dustrysuch are afevv of the features thatare likely to mark the sciontific proeeedings of the birming ham meeting but we suspect that for the great majority of the attendants at these itish ssociation mneetings the extraseetional proceud ings constitute the real attraction and for them the lcal committee have made ample provision indeed we do not remember any meeting in which the comfort and enjoyment of the visitors have been so thouglhtfully and completely provided for the comnmitteews room will in reality be a club in which even smokers will be provided for as well as the convenience of the representatives of the press vasious elubs and seientitic and literary institutions will be thrown open to menmbers and associates the secretaries who do mll the hard work of these meetings will have a hotel to ihem selves ample acconmiodation for all the seetions has been provided for in the spacious public buildings ofb irmingham including the magnifi cent new art gallery phere wifl be a special exhibition of the prod ots of local industries and local manufacturing processes in bingleyhall a series of s afternoon walks  to various places of interest has been arranged besides visits to the schools of the town there will be garden parties every day conversazione and a great concert in the townhall on the th at which there will be a per formance of mendelssohns elijah wrhich was
