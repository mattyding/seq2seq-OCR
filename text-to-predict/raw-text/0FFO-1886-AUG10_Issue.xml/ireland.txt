the forces in ireland had an interview with the chief secretary at dublin castle as to the state of belfast and the military arrangements necessary for preserving peace in the town there is reasou to expect that the presence of the large garrison will have a salutary effect not merely because the populace fear them but still more because they respect them and do not impute to them any partisan or vindictive feeling they are greatly exasperated against the police who have shot down numabers of per fectly innocent personsmr fanning deputy inspectorgeneral of constabu lary has furnished the

justico obrien in his address to the grand jury on opening the commission of oyer and terminter in greenstreet today referred to the charge against cruickshank and explained the law relating to the dis charge of fireatms in defence of property or life he said there were many grave critical and dangerous questions affecting the law which he forbore to touch upon but as a goueral proposition of law there were occasions ix which the defence of property as well as the defence of life might warrant the use of firearms and render suoh justifiatcle but these were very rare and uausual occasions and were always to be regarded with great vigilance and attention because in the estimation of the law life was a very sacred thing al thougb property might be defended at the risk or peril or actual

believe that a local legislative parliament with safeguards would be of the greatest advantage to my country yours trulya h sunw what the members of the associition complained of was the fact of mir
