ammbbican opinion on tib ibibhq lbstiona correspondent writing from snn jo california july  under the signature of an angloamerican  has forwarded to us two newspapers the san joe afereusy of july  and the argovaut of san francisco dated july  the former tales the parnellite annd the lattex the unionist view of the irish question an angloamerican says of the san jose mercuryj this is simplm in yankee parlance a  specimen brick of what is published more or less on the same subjects in nearly every journal in the ulnited states the reason is evident to every intelligent man here and that is that the pressif not owned or controled as it is very fre quently by the iristiamericansis edited or influenced by irish w riters in the great majority of cases and when this is not so it must be borne in mind that the american per se of the present day is a born oficehunter if not for himself personaly then on behalf of his brothers cousins or uncles consequently he will do anything to concili ate the irish vote in all this broad state there is only one journal that dares to dublish the truth or say what muost real americans thiak but dare not utter and that is the san francisco argonaut editds and owned by ftank pisley but he is possessed of an independent fortune and seels no office nevertheless the irish tried to prevent hira from speaking last th of july and because they couldpot succeed had a celebration of their own under cover of a  labour denienstration accompanying this letter i forward you his issue of juy thin corroboration of what i haye advanced above it is high time that england should know the real state of public opinion in america and ao longer revel in a fools paradise i have lived in this country and kept my eyes open too for nearly  yearsand in all that time one side of the question only has been so persistently taught and never contra dicted that the average american of today fully believes that never was poiand lhalf so badly ground down under the iron heel of russian tyranny as ireland under english rule and that dyasmite boycotting and even assassination though regrettable are at any rate not to be wondered at under the circumstances in the not improbable event of an irish outbreak sympathy aye and more than sy patby on this side of the water will be on the side of tbe irish and may lead to consequences such as every man of anglosaxon origin would never cease to deplore for centuries to come what should be done i know not i only give you a few facts and leave to other hands to draw their own inferences and enforce the moralwe take the fqllowing extracts from the dublin letter of the sen jos merouryl which is dated june th and is headed  old irelatd an eloquent portrayal of her sufferings depression of trade commerce and manu factures paralyzed esiled sons and daughters a starving peasantry surrounded by wealth and luxury which their unrequited labour has produced comnmesdable patiencethe display of injustice which met my view as i went alon the coast of leieeister province prbved too clearly the frish have been more than patient udder circumstances more trying than the bondage of egypt thet vwe seea starving peasantry and the seas teeming with supplies of fish which in quantity and quality cannot be surpassed game in abundance cover bill and dale but excep to the landlord and the commissioner the words  taste not touch not handle not apply vith a vengeance to al those most in need so that in every instace the iron rule binds the irish hand to fot and what a merciful providence once intended for the vrorlds use british role forbids and declares the soul that violates shll die the poor in sligo denegal mingu and parts of galway are hot so well cared for as english hogs this seems swveeping but it is not the less true i found homes of rude huts inthe counties referred to unrit for men or beasts the rain and winds freely entered the old walls emitted rolls of smoke and the poor people looked sad and dejected i entered one of these eabins at midday and witnessed the following which it seems is very gokerally the prevailing custom through the curse of want the father and mother with two boys and four girls encompassed a board sapposed to be a table on which were placed boiled potatoes and cups of sour buttermilk and this fcrmed the supply for the noonday meal  i con versed with them and heard from the aged man that he was raeied in that hut and of a farnil of ten ala were at home and the others in americathazthree morte were on the eve of leaving for missouri  apd the tears rolled silently down the cheeks of the brave old veteran who had devoted his tie and life to the master of slavery and bowed lowly indeed to the mistress of poverty  i am pass ing on said the aged sire  to the graneand i shall not in the hour of death have one of my children to close my eyes thete is evideltly no occasion for this wholesale fbrm of decopulating ireland the irish are as valuable as english oxen anct there is an evident nisrule in tying a faniy to a few acres of bog land for which they have toyfrn n sn o per acre annually cattle are allowed araeom and for their

fears are entertained and there is cause if england refuses justice to ireland it is the prevailing opinion that englands large towns and some of her largest ant most destructive man ofwars shall be laid useless without even one shot of a common pistol and nllin one day odonovan rossa speaks admiringly when he says london can be burned to tho grunds it canand in a short time the same may be said of other towns but we do not think the tories will drive to desperations in this christian age a christian people whose demands are moderate fair and honest and every unprejudiced mind is prepared to decree the future fehelty of ireland or bnglands misery  patience has been preached so often that the irish now say  she has no reward and effort after effort shall be adhered to until the bars of the cage are broken to pieces and the inmates allowed at least as many privileges as thelcanadians australians indians and new zealanders aitnd in con versation a few weeks ago with one of the most conserva tive tories he justly admitted the irish people have griev ances and many of them using his own words he said with few exceptions thn offlcial work in britain is carried oat by irish ability whether bvy a wolsey or a duoferin and the clerical responsibility devolves entirely on irish bran the irish he says make up our army and navy and fight our battlps bring honor te our standard and the irish mechanio and workman are certainly foremost in our em ploy then if the irish can dosomuch forengland it is only a simple infcrence she is able to transact her own business i am nearly done thistime letmeaddathat the captain moonlights you read of are the deeds of violence recorded by tory papers and are purely imagina tion there may have been a few acts of violence but they were like angels visits  few and far between and after all i have heard would not and could not blame the izish for committing any act of violence under such harsh treatment and deep drawn lines of hardship if not bigoted persecution i am pow convinced the reports and punish taents inflicted on the irish peasantry were much akin to the cruel and undeserved hanging of miles joyce irish men have been pronounced guilty when innocent why not allow a full investigation i am writing for your journal and give yon only a few facts of thes many re corded evidently to the shame of rich and prosperous eng land and i stand today fully convinced that the freedom of ireland is the first act of charity cast on a christian worldthat her slavery is a disgrace to all nations particu larly to america who is the mother of liberty and who has so largely reaped by the industry of the immigrant irish to whom in tne hour of their want she offered a home under the protection of the stars and stripeson the other hand the argonaut of san francisco which evidently appeals to a different class of readers has an article severely condemning the position of the local press on the question of home rule it observes that every other journal in san franoisco has pronounced in favour of home rule and that mnost of the prominent politicians are avowed hdme rulers that the journals want insh advertisements and the politicians irish votes and if pusillanimity is a stronger vord than cowardice let the readers of the a rgonaut apply it to those editors and politicians who do not speakaccording to their convictions the article proceeds there is an almost universal sentiment upon the part of nativeborn americans and intelligent foreignborn persons embracing those born in ireland embracing the majority of roman catholics not irish and many irish catholics wvho have been emancipated by education that these restless ignorant bigoted priestridden democratic irish are dangerous to society then why is it that gentle men like stuart taylor senator ulearst exmayor bryant profess a sympathy wirh the irish in a struggle vwith the enghshsend letters enclosing cheques tomake apolitical fight which they would not turn over in bed to aid or defeat if they did not hope to conciliate the irish vote how in the first place does it happen that intelligent americanirish can justify to themselves the use of money in english politics  what right moral or legal have the amerfcanirish to declare that if the home rule measure should be defeated in parliamentand a new pbrliamentary election should be held they would give to each irish member who would vote with parnell   eightysix thousand dollars to  irish members voting vith glad stone i is not this briberyflagrant undisguised bribery let us suppose an issue had oeen made in our house of congress before the war whether the southern states in rebellion should be permitted to divide our union to secede and have for themselves an independeut congress at montgomery or bichrnond let us suppose that meet ings had been held in england for the avowed purpose of afsg in the election of members of congress who should vote to divide and destroy the american union and if they would so vote that each should reeeivethe sum of sloc and suppose that at such meatings members of the english house of lords like the hon george hearst should send  and an encouraging letter and the mfavor of man chester like bryant should send  land the lord mayor of london like mayer bartlett had presided and had ex pressed his  full and complete sympathy with the cause aud to hope that it would be successfalaid that the money collepted would assist in securing enough votes to disrupt and destroy the american unionwould any amerieau whovwas not a rebel havo thought such conduct appro pnate or would any gentleman from the southern stateseaveregarded it as honourable the english did just such thngs and we denounced them for it they ran our blockades and let loose pirates upon our commerce and wve made them pay the value of the spoiations under the threat of wvar the democratic irish who desire to give home rule to ireland and a parliament to dublin green are doig just what those english in sympathy with our rebellon and who wanted to destroy the american union were doing when they were encouraging rebellion in the united states bribisg our voters and meddliug with our politicalconcems the men who are takingtheleadat these meetings are irishbern and they have broken the parole upon which they became american citizens by meddling writh the elections in great britain they might with equal propriety and with more honour aid ireland to rebel if their conatrymen were trying the issue of wrr they might send arms and money and munitions of ar with greater propriety than to sendl money and encourage sient in a political controversy
