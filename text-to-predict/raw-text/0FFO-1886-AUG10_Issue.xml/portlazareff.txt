port lazarbeffthe rumour that the russians havo occupied port lazareff does niot appear tobe verified as yet but such a step is exceedingly probablo and it is worth while to consider its significance port lazaxeff broughton bay is a fine natural harbour on tho little known eastern coast of corea situ ated in latitude  n it is nearly abreast of the neck which joins corea to the mainland at a point where this neck is about  miles across furthoe to the north there is a rango of mountains forming a natural frontier and a possible line of defenco to coroa it is witliin this line there fore that tho russians are reported to be csta blished and to china and japan the move would necessarily appear to be a prelude to annexation of the whole peninsula port lagareff itself is well sheltered on the east by the nakhimoff penin sula a broad bluff linked to the mainland on the north by a low narrow neck the harbour has an area of about eight sqluare miles with a depth of seven to ten fathoms and offers a protected an chorage at all times the entrance is two miles wide and the outer approaches lead through several small islands but with proper light houses and beacons would offer no diliculties to navigation the dungan river whllich discharges into the northwestern corner of the harbour has a shallow bed possibly capable however of being deepened to afford dock accommodation the corea is believed to contain coal in abundance and to be rich in other mineral wealthfrom a defensive point of view the position leaves something to bo desired the entrance to the harbour presents rather a long line for sub marine mine defence while yung iing bay to the south probably offers a fair landing place for a hostile force it is not unlikely therefore that the line from the southern point of the nak himoff peninsula to muravieff point ineluding yungr hing bay would be taken up involving a long land rontier in any case land defences of greater or less extent would be entailed thus viewed as a possible naval fortress port lazareff is far inferior to port hamilton with its island position and single deep entrance barely  yards broad nor is the strategic position by any means equal to that of our last years acquisition portamilton lying off tho southern point of the corean peninseuais only  miles from shanghai and  from nagasaki the distance to the southern island of japan is  miles so that in a sense the position commands the yellow sea and the corean strait hongkong is  miles or four and a half days distant port lazareif on tho other hand is  miles further to the north  from inagasaki  from yokohama which lies on the further side of japan and  miles from the russian station of nicolaieff at the mouth of the amur vladivostock the most eouthern of the russian harbours isonly miles to the north of port lazareff or one day for a modoratelv fast steamer vladivostock is closed by ice hovever for about three months in the yoar the reported occupation makes an advance beyond the ico regionand wouldplacethe russians within  miles of our own outpost in the western pacific the importance attaching to the move is to be measured principally by the probability that it portends an eventual annexation of the corea and this is doubtless the light in which it would present itself to the chinese and japanese governments thus viewed it will appear a measure of verydifferentproportionsto our occupation of port hamilton and if it bas really taken place vigorous protests at least are inevi tableit has already been hinted that russias latest move is merely designed to accelerate the hauling oewn of the british flag at port hamilton and that this advertisement of weakness and vacillation is under serious consideration no measure could be niore illjudged or illtimed tlo recede is rarely a wise policy and to abandon a strategic point whose importance in the near future can hardly be exaggerated would be simply suicidalthe arguments for such a measure aro easily con ceivable to hold port hamilton is to extend our responsibilities unduly it constitutes a new point of departure leading us who can tell where the british navy has enough on its hands already the aet wvas politically immoral and indefensiblewhile it tended to arouse the suspicions of tho chinese and japanes besides can we not tako the wretched isiands whenever afe want them i alr this has doubtless been urged with some show of force it is nonsense and worse to own port hamilton is to incur no increaso of responsibility even if it remains imfortified for p time rlssia cannot take it from us till we have been defeated in war and that has not come yet nwe have not fortified periin which nevertheless in freneh hands could more than neutralize aden where we are now spending thousands to hold the little islands leads us no further for wo aro quite near enough to the region of winter ice where the wildost champion of annexation would hardly have us go for a port the coal stores at shanghai and at nagasakiwhere the russians also have an esta blishmentcannot be relied upon in war aind without them ships based on honagkong could not operate in these seas during the northeast monsoon it may one day be necessary to visit vladivostock and failing a certain coal supply how is this to be done i as for the immorality of the annexation the recent proceedings of russia and france in these regions have rendered it imi peassiblo for us to follow the path of rigid rectitude unless we wish to be placed at a hopeless future disadvantage moreover china has shown no dis like of the proceeding whieh was doubtless a matter of previous negotiationto abandon port eamilton at the present moment is to hand it to russiaand when once our rivals have turned its unique defensive advantages to aceount and created a naval base from whah they could not be dislodged wvithout a vast effort the responsibilities and the difflicultiesof our china squadron wil be increased tenfold the opening of new trade and mail routes which must ulti mately follow tho completion of the canadian pacific railway will confer new importance on a strategic position which will ono day rank with bermuda no stronger argument for the retontion of port hamilton could however be furnished than the confirmiation of the report of the russian occupation of part lazareff
