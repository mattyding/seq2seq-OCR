work of the large number of volunteers who are assembled at aldershot for a period of training in soldiers duties before the more important operations with which the present week is to conclude all the volunteer battalions were under arms yesterday morn ing by halfpast  and the men had a thoroughly good drill before breakfast which was served from the field kitchens where the rations are cooked in the open more or less by the volunteers themselves indeed it is worthy of notice as indicative of the larce strides being made in the military education of volunteers that camp cook ing is now being extensively taken up as an ordinary department of regimental routine the drill work set down for the day was of a rather simple character being corn pany and battalion drill only which it might be thought volunteers need hardly travel all the way to alder shot to practise  but it must be remembered that fve of the eight battalions are made up of scratch detachments from many corlps the officers frequently not knowing the men nor the men their officers  and hence the need of at least one days plain regimental drill in order to shake the men into their places and make all the parts of a battalion familiar with each other colonel du plat taylors battalionin which the greater number of the men belong to the postoffice corps with only a few of the civil service rifles and london rifle brigade attached were early at work practising outpost duty on cove common and towards hartford bridge flats their neighbours of colonel alts battalion using the rough land nearer faruborough and doing much good worl in battalion drill an interesting adjunct of this battalion is supplied by the mahine gun battery of the central london rangers a corps which has the honour of being the first infantry regiment to add such weapons to its ordinary establishment the battery consists of a couple of nordenfelt guns hauled by ropes by the men themselves after breakfast there was another general turn out for drill and volunteers whose notions of a batta lion drill are based upon the evening spell of one hour on a london drill ground discoverd that there was a great deal of differenceo when the scene was changed to dusty lumpy aldershot heath and the time was extended to three hours taldng the line of the farnham and larnboroughroad shortly after  yesterday morning the on spaces between redchurch and swan inn plateau presented several scenes of activity colonel cantlon had his d battalion out on the slopes of rushmoor hillwhere it appealred as though the d london and their comrades of the west middlesex railway rifles st and th surrey and d tower hamlets were being reviewed by the iron duke from his position on the terrace mound and near to these colonel steward was at work improving hisdark clad men of dorset movig northward the gla morgan was found very busy at ushmoorgreen the welshmen being indeed a smart lot of men who did not reach the camp on saturday night till nearly  oclock after a  hours journey from swansea tbie somerset shire battalion lying just to the north of the glamorgan is also avery fine body of mn who are in appearance somewhat like the artists their uniform bein only a shade darker than that of the wellknown loudon regi ment the d somerset has  offlcers and men here but it is a very big battalion at bome in the district a which taunton is the centre and even when this is known it is as astonishing as it is creditable to learnthat colonel patton can count aboat  marksmen and first class shots in other spots on the outskirts of the camp colonel routledge and colonel bird were busy with their battalions in the early morning after breakfast and in the afternoon so that with guard and other camp duties to perform the working hours of the volunteers are pretty fully occupied in the south camp the volunteer medical staff corps camped near the cambridge hospital find plenty of occupation learning their own special workyesterday lieutenantgeneral sir archibald alison issued the general idea and distribution of the forces for the grand feld day with which the manceuvres are to con clude on friday morning the battle will be fought out eastward of the camp on the fox hills and the opera tions will be based on the assumption that a column of all arms detached from an intrenched camp at bagshot and marching by chobham ridges on aldershot which has fallen into the possession of the enemy finds on driving the enemys outposts across the canal that the southern end of the fox hills is being occupied by a strong hostile
