gentlemen subsequently hoaddreased an enlthuatio but disorderly meeting of iha supporters ati the windsorstrcet board schools ir la h gibson chairman of the divisional conservative lassoclation presidedmtm rat eys was received with enthusiastio cheering fe said that he was almost ashamed to come among them xigaiu  o last july they electe him avoice  and will again cheers by a majority which was not bnsignifieant it was not one of those majorities that did aot indicate the opinion of a constituency it was not a thance majority of a dozen or so but it was a majority of inany hundred votes a clear majority given by that humbor of voters svho chose to exercise their frauchise hear hear let them not suppose for a ifmornent that he deceived himself as to the significance of that election that he regarded east birmingham as a conservative con tituency he had never done so he knew that he was returned not so much because he was a conservative as because he vas a unionist cheers it was because men of different parties men whose political views in many respects differed from his own agreed with him upon that essential point that they rauied in such large numbers to his support and gave him go clear a victory over tho antagonist he had then who was his antagonist  a voice a washerwoman and laughter it was a gentleman of whom he desired personally to speak with great respect alderman cook hisses he hoped they would not hiss that gentlemans name alderman cook although unknown to him was he believed respected in his private life and useful in his publiclife inibirmingham aud having therefore every persoual claim to their regard and to their sufifrages and those suffrages alderman cook would have obtained except for one reason that reason was that alderman cook had voted for the second reading ef a bill which in his judgment and that of the electors of east biri ingham broke up the empire hear hear by that vote mr cook had done his utmost to dethrone the rule of the british parliament in ireland and to set up in that country an executive in dependent of otr parliament and who would act by them selves and supersede the authority of the executive of the united kingdom hear hear so that the mlinisters of her majesty if alderman coolk had had his way could not have appointed even a pliceman in ireland  shame that was the issue upon which they elected him in july it was not because teey agreed with his political priuci plesnot because theydid not think him backward and slmw to move in many walks and paths of politics but it was becatuse upon that great issue they all agreed with him and disagreed with alderman cook interruption and cries of  turn him out it was not in thoe eastern division alone that that spectacle was afforded of englishmen rally ing round the capital institutions of this country they had the same spectacle in bordesley and in aston cheers mr bright cheers rejected and denounced the cheme of separation that was proposed by mr gladstonee government and air chamberlain cheers declared that wherever be might havo a vote he would cast it for the unionist candidate quite irrespective of party politics cheers the result was that birmingham went solid or tbe union cheers solid for the british empire with l its glorous traditions of greatness and of liberty cheers and that the separatist candidutes wvere rejected hear hear that decision sent a thrill of joy throughout the country eiear hear everywhere the example of birmningham vas followed and both in boroughs and in counties mnen flocked round the unionist candidate and returned him against thc separatist irrespective of party there were at least  seats in this country which oight have been won by the conservative party but they bad abstained from coming fcrward and contesting the seat agains the liberal unionist hear hear there were also many seats in which the conservatives so far from being opposed by liberal unionists were supported by them an din that way all stood shoulder to shoulder and the unionists were able to secure a large majority in the house of commons the result of that was that for the first time for many years they saw that tnen in this country were able to set their country above party and prefer the interests of their country at large to the narrow petty interests of the political body to which they happened to belong cheers iir glad stones government fell and he hoped that it would never be forgotten in birmingham that the leader of the party which had the majority in the house of commons went at once to the chief of the jiberal unionists lord her tington cheers and offered to him the first and the chief place in the government of the queen that was only what one would expect from the splendid character and from the great publio services of lord salisbury cheers nevertheless it was a generous and a noble thing to have dune lord hartington refused the offer he did not nean to discuss his lordships reasons for doing so lord hartington wxas an honoubloand highminded gentleman nod his reasons were sure to be the reasons of a man of honour anl a man of sense hear hear but he regretted the decision if lord hartington had decided otherwise there would have been not only a unionist victory at the polls but a unionist government in office which would have given full effect to the national verdict among others to whom office had been given he most unworthily had been selected to hold the post of home secretary cheersand that fact brought him to anst birmingham again there was an old statute of the time of good queen anne which provided that who ever accepte office from the crown must immediately vacate his seat in the house of commons and seek re election it was a statute no doubt very useful when queen anne was alive because in those days the crown was a powerful influence and it would have been prudent and wise to make such a provision a voice it is no good to cook and laughter but he though that every man felt that nowadays the influence of the crown was not so deadly but that he might have been trusted to go on as their member without having to seek reelection cheers he heard some people say that the result of the election would be different from what it had been before  no he would like to discuss the question of who had changed in the matter cheers he had not changed renewed disturbance and a voicedungarvan followed by the ejection of the dissentientthey had quite enough to do to talk about east birmingham interruptionwhat he was and what he professed to be m july that he was still re pewed interruption and by accepting office he had taken pledges which made it impossible that he should be other than he had told them he was mr cook had a right to oppose him if he thought fit but it was not extremely handsome of him to do so cries of imean when our cavalry made a famous charge at balaclava our french iniltary critics said  it is magnificeint but it is not war he must turn that saying upside down for mr cook laughter and say  it is war but it is not mag niiicent cheers why should mr cook ask the con titnency to reverse a verdict given a month ago  had e changed or had he not  it seemed that mr cook had can interviewed by a number of gentlemen who be onged to what was called he was toldthe radical union md he understood that that interview was a hasty one that it took place at the close of a long railway journey and that the result upon bmr cook was an extraordinary one mr cook was put through the mill as it were laughter hie was put in a gladstonian at one endand he came out a unionist at the other laughter and cheers he suddenly found enlightenment and salvation renewed laughter and they were to speak of him as the deformed who hqa been transformed loud laughter this sudden conversion was very creditable no doabt to the gentlemen who put mr cook through the process but for his own part he did not now how far the result would inspire them or the electorate with confidence in the vandidato interruption did they believe that members of the radical union could possibly be satisfied with it ilr reid the late member for aston spoke of the radical umonin a most disrespectful and calumnious way le did not endorse those sentimeats he believea the adical union to consist of gentlemen who had serious politics and he remembered that they had made great pacrifices for the cause to which they were attached they eould not be satisfied with this sudden conversion it had been said that there was joy over the sinner that repented but he did not think any body ever said that you were tocave confidence in the sinner cheers and laughter it was possible that the ethiopian might change his skdn put none of them would piec him out as a good sample of abite man renewed laughter and cheers therefore ntilhe should see the thing he would not believe that jhose intelligent firm and patriotic men who ceonstituted rhe radical union would ever adopt mr cook as a unionist candidate in doing so they would cover them elves with ridiculemr cook had written a letter in which e professed that he was just the same man stilljust as nueh a gladstonian as he ever was laughter  with eservations it was true but with reservations whicl mr xladstene had declared to be impossible moreover he ad read with the keenest interest a manifesto putforward by the national liberal federation declarlng that they would have no half measures that the liberaltarty had pinned its faith upon the scheme introduced by lr gladstone that they would accept nothing less than ihatand that every candidate who came forward undet their auspices must be looked uponto use a short term ias a separatist at the foot of the manifesto were tho honoured names of mr kitson and mr schnadhorstlgroans and those he believed were the principal sup orters of mr cook ile felt confident therefore thatthe great majority if not all the unionists of that divi sion would again be found in support of the cause of which he was the humble representative and advocate cheers mr matthews went on to argue the im ractibityof hiome rule by a reference tiagrttansinrlia naent and expressed his conviction that the electors would not consent at the present moment to abandon a minority that looked to england for protection and called forprotection with passionate loyalty and with unwavering affection e knew that this was dangerous ground ttouci upon for he was warned by kind critics that in that contest he might have to suffer from religious bigotry shame he nd not believe it loud cheers but roligious bigotry was a fact in ireland which no man could shut his eyes upon at the very moment of their assembling men of opposite creeds wero firing at each other in a street of bellast and inflicting deadly woundshot only upon men but upon women and children civii war was raging in bealast to such an extent that the authorities had been unable as yet although it had lasted almost for a week to quell it did they think that the controlling the guidinginfluence of a british government was not useful in a country such as that  hear hear iid they think that when a country contained meen un happily so hostile to each other that they were ready to fly at each others throatsdid they think it was not of tonsequence of inportance that there should be an impartial geovernment at a distance cheersa govern knent moderating checking controlling these violent per wons and keeping the peace so far as it was possible to keep the peace among riuch deadly and internecine strife hahoar  he great need of ireland waa for peacei ndrorder eoewosaid that ireland needed to be rid of the a�cursed pest of the pohtical agitator she needed all men who disturbed order to be punished and punished with cer tainty she needed that good men should be allowed to go about their avocations in peace and not be interfered with by any tyrannical political organizationshoulcl be allowed to till the ground and to buy and sell without being molested by meddlesome neigh ours if these things were only secured irelands prosperity in a very few years would astonish the worldle needed also to get rid of parliamentary huckstering with irish voters cheers public men were ueeded who would have the courage to set at defiance even the mhaster of  irish votes and who would not purchase his support at the price of the unity of the british kingdomcheers those were the things that ireland wanted first whatever else the government of lord salisbury might attempt to do for the unhappy country and whatever other schemes might be propesed for her futurewelfarethat much at least he thougt he might without being indiscreet promise they tvonn endeavour to do cheers and he asked them to enable him as one of the huriblest members of the government to take what part he could in that useful work cheersa resolution pledging the meeting to support mr matthews wns roposed by mr  w lowe and seconded by ir ilfred young a liberal unionistmlr bariny a member of the national radical union supported the motion and repudiated the suggestion that that body had in any way officially sanctioned mr cooks candidature he had that day seen a member of mlr chamberlains family and without presuming to speak authoritatively wond asmsertwand he ivould challenge contradiction in detailthat thosemembers of the national radical union who had affected to endorse the candida ture of alderman cook did not representthe union these geutlemen had simply acted as individuals he would go further and say that such had been the evident desire to play double on the part of alderman cook since that resolution to give him a qualified support was passed by those few gentlemen that it vas quite upon the cards that in a few hours the radical union might speak authoritatively on this question and speal in a wholly contrary sense to that in which alderman cooks supporters desired cheers he asked them not to believo that the leaders of the xiatical uuiou would extiuguish their iuustrious reputations by turning their backs upon themselves and making them selves the catspaws of alderman cook cheersthe resolition was carried with two orthree dissentients mr joseph rowlakds in proposing a vote of thanks to the chairman said that the contest had been forced on east birmingham by the officers of the liberal association not by alderman cook or the liberal party in birming hamthe vote was agreed to and the meetingseparated
