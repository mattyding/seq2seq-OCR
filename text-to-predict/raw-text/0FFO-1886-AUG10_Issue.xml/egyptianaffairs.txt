 eayptiax aaznmo our coresporntjwatlexandria july sothe main excitement during the past month has peen caused by the proposal to create a harbour t damietta sir maurice duff gordon tho son pf a lady whose name is yet a household word intyp is the originator of the proposition which is at least worth consideration a glance at the jnap will show that the position of the com nercial capital of egypt is not in every way atisfactory a mighty stream runs through the ountry forms its natural highway and jons thea b two mouths about  miles apartrosetta to the west anddamietta to the east between bhose two branches lies the fertile delta and it would be natural to suppose that either or both of these towns were likely to become the export narket of the country but circumstances fiave driven the two mediterranean ports of egypt the onealexandria so miles tothe west of the western knouth the other port said a similar distance to the east of the eastern one the latterhowever pan hardly bo considered tin egyptian port situated on a narrow strip of reclaimed land it has hardly the capacity for becoming a firstclass seadort and whatever advantages it possessed over its rival have been more than balanced by the fatuous policy of the suez canal company the city of alexander has remained the com mercial capital its populationleft by napoleon at  to  has advanced with strides to its present figure of  inhabitants as pushing as energetic and as noisy a community as can be found east of greenwich the proposal of sir maurice duff gordon and his associates is to construct at the cost of about � a harbour at damietta  the profits derivable from it to pay as a first cbarge seven per cent to the capitalists and of subsequent profits onefourth to go to the egyptian government it is avowedly expected by the wouldbe concessionaires that a large pro portion at least of the produce cultivated on tho eastern branch of the lnile would find its way to the new port the distance would be less water oarriage is cheaper than by rail a considerable economy would thus bo effected on the transport and that economy would benefit the fellaheen while the government would disburse nothing and would receive a fourth of the profits such are the arguments of the wouldbe concessionaires and they are specious it is sound politicai economy to lessen the charges on produce and the introduction into the country of � capital employing labour is temptingalexandrisns heard with anxiety the proposition to erect a rival port at its rates and adduced fair arguments to which i shall allude later showing that there was at least another side to the question had the matter ended here it mnight have been safely left to the decision of mr vincent the finanoial adviser but unfortu hately alexandrians have never ceased to deserve the character given them by strabo some   years ago their interests wer or appearea to be threatened obviously the only course was to demonstrate the rebuilding of the town was suddenly stopped the workmnen were craftily informed that it was because the government were going to assent to a scheme which would be the ruin of alexandria and required little inducement to demonstrate against the proposal headed by an amiable but injudicious banker a mob proceeded to the palace to accompany the petition received by the khedivewith excellent judgment bhey were smartly reprimanded and the only result was to render themselves and the whole movement ridiculous the more respectable ignatories of the petition at once went to the palace to disassociate themselves from the cir curnstances attending its presentation and i have only thought it necessary to mention the circum stance to protest against this the third attempt in a few weeks to control or ifluence the execu tive by veiled intimidation on the part of a few noisy levantinesthe question as to the advisability or non advisability of the project is however one fairly open to discussion the selfish interests of one town must not be allowed to inliuence the decision if the country gains at the expense of alexandria so much the worse for the latter but tho gain must not be rejected the sole question iswould the proposed port be for the benefit of the country at large ifirst as to its immediate effects it may be admitted that the cost of transport from certain parts of egypt will be reduced and as a general rule merchandise will choose the cheapest route but i venture to think that the projectors are ignoring very important facts other considera tions besides cost of transport enter largely into the question it has been p roved over and over again that merchandise teng even at increased cost of carriage to the largest marketsif a b an export merchant wished to buy a thousand bales of a particular class of cotton for consumption in england he would doubtless be able if it were procurable on the east branch of the nile to procure and ship it vid damietta with considerable advantage provided always that he had at damietta in addition to a port all the laecessary adjuncts such as stores presses and a supply of tonnage but even assuming that a b and other export merchants found all this their tnethod of procedure would not influence c d e and f small cultivators who have not sold their cotton and who though they may send it very cheaply to damietta will not care to risk sending it to a port where the number of buyers will be aecessarily limited they will prefer sendi it even at an increased rate to alexandria where merchants most do congregate and where there is abundanco of cheap storage presses and acontinual supply of tonnage in time a b him self will find that he can buy as cheaply at alex andria as he can ship at damietta just hs the alsace spinner now finds that he can buy as cheaply in liverpool as at marseilles and the iamietta route will at most become an excep ional one only occasionally offering advantages this lesson has already been taught at port said it has taken  years for the trade of that place to assume its present insignificant proportions so far as purely egyptian trade is concerned and though the economy of shipping from thero is great though tonnage is frequent hardly a single alexandrian house has found it necessary to avail itself of it to any extent moreover if the brightest dreams of the damietta projectors were realized for a brief space the railway administra tion could destroy them at a moments notice by a reduction of rateseven then from the selfish point of view i think the alexandrians were unnecessarily panic stricken and the objects of pity if such a project were realized would be the shareholders in it as however the expense would be borne by them and not by the egyptian government these considerations need not affect the latter they have only to consider the result to themselves and to the population in a purely agricultural country it seems at first sight obvious that a reduced cost of transport on however small a quantity must bea gain but it must not be forgotten that in a country where the monopoly of railway carriage is in the hands of the government any reduction in the rates of transport ib practically a reduction of taxation ie the fellah pays � for carriage of a lot of cotton which formerly cost � he is benefited to the extent of � but if that � or � in either case goes into the hands of the government the government is a loser to the ame extent and if the government loses � by the transaction what is the result  either it must suffer it as a loss of revenue or it must recoup itself by extra taxation but unfortunately we know that the govermtnent cannot afford to pacrifico this revenue so that it would be com pelled to substitute another form of taxation nnd ll the benefit to the fellah would disappear the question then resolves itself to this ia there any advantage in remitting taxation in the form of zharge for transport and reimposing it in another ilhape i the answer is obviously in the negative o tax io less unpopular than that charged for carriage because if is hardly realized as a tax at all and no tax is to unpopular as a new one or ono that has been raised there is moreover another objection the equivalent of such a re duction could not be raised without imposing in creasedtaxation perhaps an example will best thow this a parcel of cotton worth � in liver piool give the fellah let jis say � net shipped wi alexandria � going in transport and � intor ox enses the fgures are ox course purely pothetfcal tho same shipped by damiettadocoet only � in transport but zhe ther ex k uae d iatbalno ead fo qroant who inalready esablshea at alexadria cannot stat a second officeduplicate storesand duplicate presses at damietta without increased cost put this cost at  per cent only and the gain to the fellah would only be  while the loss to the govern ment would still be  anyv attempt to recoup their loss would therefore impr y extra taxation on the fellah  and this is ignoring the fact that the diamietta dues must cover seven per cent on �o or � which must also colme out of the fellah before the government begins to make its profitthere is indeed one pessimist ar u wt which is perhaps worth recording though i must be dis missed as beyond the domain of practical politics it is that our interest lies in benefiting the culti vator at the expense of the statethat when in consequencethe state is unableto pay its coupons we shall be able to insist on a reduction in the rate of interest the obvious reply is that we could not so insist unless we were actually masters of the country and that if we were we should have no occasion to resort to such measuressince writing the above i have heard that the council of ministers have decided that the pro posed scheme while advisable on general prin ciples is impracticable in the existing state of egyptian financehe following is the official return of mr joseph jones oe a member of the firm of beaumont and jones in reference to the recent discoveries of petroleum on the shares of the red seaacting under the written instruetions which i received in london i have visited at the reouest of the egyptian government jemsah jebel zeit and the neigh bourhood in company with mr mitchell the egyptian government geologist i examined the entire line of country from jebel zeit to the foot of the jebel isa range opposite the island of shadwan on the red sea side i further passed over the desert through the metamorphic rarge and examinea the run and charaeter of the rock to the west of it and am of the opinion that the two sides are one and the same range of formation parted only by the presence of the older rocks from jebel zeit to the end of the jebel esh range there is a ran of pretty uniform ground say  miles long by five to  miles in width all of which strata bears equally good indications of surface oil while however the existence of surface oil is proved beyond a doubt i would remark that that fact is one the value of which may be very easily exaggerated the existence of surface oil may or ruay not be an indication of the exist ence of quantities of oil at a lower stratathe chances are about equalbut the quantity of surface oil is no in dication as to the quantity of well oil while the ex perience of baku tends to show that wherever there is surface oil well oil is sure to be struck within  feet the result of american borings has been very different and the remark that  the pennsylvanian fields have ab sorbed more dollars than they have delivered  is probably correct two borings may be made within a few yards of each other the one may produce nothing the other  barrels a day and the supply may cease in a few months on may   pithole in pennsylvaniat was a collec tion of huts in a forest three months later it was a town of  souls by january   it was again deserted i mention these instances because i think it my duty to inform you that in strict language the discovery of petro leum on the red sea has not yet been made surface oil has been found has probably been known from time im memorial and there is very good ground for supposing that petroleum existsbut at what depth in what quantity and of what quality it is quite impossible to say the discovery of the surface oil which it was perfectly certain must exist appears to have led the overnment into expenses connected with tanking c which  venture to think were iniudicious and unnecessary i feel convinced and mr mitchell the government geologist together with others there shares my convictionthat the surface oil in the place where struck is exhausted mi debay states that ue has checked the supply i venture to say that the supply has exhausted itself and i base this opinion inter alia upon the simple fact that he is boring through the identical shaft where he found petroleum now if petroleum still existed there in the spot at which it forced itself  metres it is physically impossible that the mere placing of lining tubes should obstruct its flowhile boring is going on in the same shaft unless it is superior to ordinary hydrostatio laws it would follow the boring and then rise to the surfaceundoubtedly more surface oil may be found in other spots but probably to no greater extent than that already extracted surface oil itself is not likely to be in sufficient quantity to pay the cost of extraction its value is an indication of the existence of further supplies lower down and that as i have said is of very uncertain valuei am of opinion that there is very reasonable ground for tthe existence of petroleum and safer as i rm abs to judge i am inclined to baieve that it dwil be found at a very low depth probably not less than the baku strata of  feeti am further of opinion that the indications are suffi ciently favourable to justify the preliminary expense of borings but theywill always be of a speculative character aed i would venture to suggest that they should be made in several places until a bondfde strata is reached that they should then be plugged and from the number of suc cessful soundings made it will then be possible for the government to iudge as to the advisability of working in which case but not till then reservoirs means of trans port and refineries will became necessary the diamond boring a paratus in which i em personally interezted vwouldr lhough expensive in my opinion place the ques tion so raidly beyond doubt that it would pprove cheapestan expenditure of � to � in six months would be necessary it might be perfectly fruitless it might indicate the source of enormous wealth a lesser amount spread over a longer period mightsuffice with hand boring but i feel convinced ib would not be equally satisfactorythis report has the rare merits of being modest and disinterested mr jones came expressly from england at the expense of the egyptian govern ment to report on the subieat but he was con fessedly desirous of obtaining a contract for the boring operations his interest therefore rather lay in representingthediscovery as aninexhaustible eldorado but so far from doig so he has made perhaps the least favourable report yet submitted and while recommending operations has frankly admitted that they would be of a speculative characterit is characteristic of egyptian adtninistration which is never hurried except when caution is ad visablethathaving incurred the expenseof aspecial report on the subject theauthorities did not await the arrival of that report before taking a decisive step while bmr jones was on his way back to suezand two days before his report was handed in the egyptian government made a contract with an american named tweddle who at � a year became their petroleum adviser for  months with liberty to expend a further � in petroleum explorations mfr tweddle has gone to europe and expects to return and begin working by october ln the meanwhile mr mitchell a very able and conscientious american geologist in the service of the egyptian govern ment reports the find of a further extensive area with petroleum indications at some distanee from the coastin the matter of the daira sanieh the french government have acknowledged the report of the commission of inquiry by what practically amounts to a vote of confidence in the freneh controller with careless  cynicism they assert that m gaylussao has exercised his functions in a conciliatory manner and that it is not for the egyptian government to make that attitude a cause of complaint seeing that they have pre viously maintained that the controllers themselves were the obstacles to the reform of the adminis tration in other words they insist on the con tinuance of the salary and exonerate the recipient from performin the functions for which it is granted in this reply one can trace the insipirat gon lof m o aylussag himself who at oncehurried to paris as soon as the inquiry was over for that gentleman makes no secret of his convic tion thatas the egyptian government is responsi blo to the bondholders for any deficit ib is a matter of indifference whether the estates give good or bad resultsunder these circumstances our duty is obvious in justice to mr kelly as well as to the govern ment we should do our utmost to act in conjunc tion with the french government and to award equal judgment to both but if political reasons prevent us doing our duty to egypt together with france then we must do it alone we must nominate an english controller who will have sufficient authority to enforce the efficacy of his control  who will recognize that his duty is not to the bondholders alone but to the egyptian government and people whose ser vant he is ferid pasha the newlyappointed successor to the dismissed hall yaghen is a man of good antecedents of intelligence andenergy associated with an english colleague of capacity and tact backed by the support of theenglish and egyptian governments the two would be able to reduce m gaylussac to the position which he is apparently willing and in any ease which he must be made to acceptthat of a highlpaidcyher if we loso this occasione accepting the disgraceful lead of the frnch government in sacrificing the fellah to the creditorwhile on the subject of european officials in egypt let me againtdaw attention to a maatter mentioned in a recent telegram outi of  europeonus receiving eachover � a year  are absent from their dteout of ten englih men from the same category only twomr vin iceat and mf aelwwar snxqzt in tha court ofappeal there are nine european judges and one prooureurgeneral all are on leave at the caisse de la dette two remain out of six and in parenthesis letine add are doing all in their power by obstructing the government to make their preseneoregetted the chiefs of the army of the police of the public works of the railways and of the customs are all absentnow i do not for a moment wish to deny that many of these officials have well earned their leave nor that many of the others are as little use in the country as out of it all work and no play has the same results in egypt as elsewhere and those who have work to do probably do it afl the better for an occasional change there is however no reason why this principle should be pushed to the extreme nor why egyptian officials should receive more licence than would begranted to them in india or than is required by other europeans pursuing other avocations at least equaly arduous in egypt in any case absence on leave should be arranged with more regard to the public service in one department not only is the chief absent but his vice and three others of his superior staff  in another an administrator with important functions is notoriously ineapable of two months work in  it is time that we who are responsible for this country should recognize that it must not be used asa lumber room for the reception of those who from illhealth or other causes cannot earn pay elsewhere even apart from the necessity for good solid workand let me repeat that among english officials in egypt there are those who are doing itwe lose immensely in the eyes of the natives by the nature of some of our appointmentsnor perhaps should we neglect this point even in our consular service in egypt disagreeable in cidentstowhich itis unnecessary more particularly to referhave created somescandal in connexion with tho british consulate it is rumoured that mr cookson is to receive the promotion which his long and able services have well earned should tbis prove true it will render vacant the position of consul and chief judgewhile that of viceconsul is already so it is earnestly to be desired that the oreign office will avail itself of the oppor tunity to make appointments which may command the respect of the community the duties of the english consulate are not onerous but are yet ira portantby his position the chief judge is thelega adviser of her majestys minister at cairo liable to be called upon to discharge the functions of the agency ad interim whilo the viceconsul should represent british interests at the quaran tine boardduties which are now temporarily gratuitously and ably fulfilled by dr mackie cmg both officials then should be men of judgment and in addition men accustomed to the usages of society who in case of need mav represent the colony without rendering it ridicu lous experience shows that this warning is not unneeded
