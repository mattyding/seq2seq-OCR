thb mnocbbsp corpur xtion eotblfnoq ourt anchiester correspoxdenthe manchester city council has been studying a long roport of its improvement committee re lative to an undertaking that has gained somo celebrity as the manchester corporation hotel the report unfolds a tale of trouble which might movo the sympathy of all other good men who may havo had or whocan fancy they may ever have municipal adversities to struggle with the com mittee have been trying as hardas they could to make the best of a very large bad debtand they find themselves under all sorts of illnatured censure for their pains it may be as well to state at once that the corporatiqn is not itself the licensed victualler it has been careful to let its hotel to a lessee an independent trader as much responsible for rent as is any other private person who has hired for any business wvhatever a bit of the pile of buildings of wbich the hotel forms part such at least is the theory and the fact is not here questioned but it is part of tho misfortune of the corporation in holding an ad mittedly anomalous position that while one set of objectors picks holes in the termsnmadowith the tenant looking jealously for unfairness towards other hotel proprietors contributors to tho local rates  another set is tempted to imagine that better security for the success of the investment mighi have been obtained by keeping the hotel more immediately in corporate hands but a third sot of course sharos the corporations own objection to entering further than was thought unavoidable on a doubtful and difficult courseit is natural to askwhy enter on it at all  it appears by official reports that the authorities had no desire for any speculation of the kind the property came into their possession as part of a very large transaction in street improvements these were certainly of the first importance and no one seems to quarrel with their design or execu tion the bone of contention has been found in the subsequent disposal of surplus land it was a triangular plot of  square yards with nothing but a busy thoroughfare separating it from a worldfamous exchange what was to be the destination of a site so valuable and so costly  ten years ago or thereabouts the cor poration sold it to a syndicate of private pur chasers who covered fourfifths of the ground with so much of the massive structure that was designed to cover the whole nearly  yards remained blank or worse than blank a picture of desolation and failure that was detrimental to the property as a whole the projectors fands had run dry the unfinished building as far as it had gone had cost � the purchase money of the land itself had been calculated at � but payment of this had been deferred the interest only being exacted in the meantime it now appeared that the unfortunate speculators had no hope of fulfilling their engage ments and they had to forfeit everything not only the whole of the lands but the fourfifths of building reverted to the torporation in its un finished condition the prospects of sale of the property were apparently more dubious than ever the building was of a composite character form ing shops and offices for tho most part with a spacious internal court overlooked by galleries but there was a anity of design about the whole the intention having been to finish it off at the rounded apex of the triangle with the principal rooms of a large hotelj and unhappily it was this  crown to the edifice  that remained to be con structed somerooma inthe building as it stood wereprobably better fitted to form part of an hotel than anything else and thnir rental value would evidently depend very nuch upon the original design being carried outat this juncture the committee received pro posals from the architect who had been employed by the abortive private company the sum then named for the completion of the hotelg on the vacant i yards was �g but this was as long aao as  the committee entered into the seheme with modifications not however in the direotion of decreased outlay after much negotiation with the architect and others they obtained the sanction of the local government board to a loan for the purpose and after a still longer course of negotiation they secured a lessee of the projected hotel but eveu after the lease had been concluded negotia tion had still to be continued and terms newly adjusted from time to time to the changing circumstances as they came in view with the pro gress of an undertakirjg that provedto have been so impossible to measure m advance alreadyin  the sum specified for the hotel to the lqcal government boards commissioner was � so rapidly had estimates doubled for one thing the corporation had undertaken to smooth matters by not only completing the stoucture but providing as mueh as possible the internal fittings anddecorationls a good percenltage on the eapital out i lay for these to be calculated in rent there wasl to be one rate per cent for one class of fixtures a higher rate for more perishable or more luxurious adornment and so on the hotel was not com pleted and opcned till  end in  the total cost as showsn by contractors bills only lately delivered appears to be � or including the architects commission � the chair mzan of the commiittee poinlts out that this at sj per cent repregents an annual charge of g but the rent which has been provisionally fixed at � may ultimately prove to be � as baulculated upon the several classes of oatlay as yet the classification has not beenicompleted assuming however that the rentl obatainablezany be � a year the chairman shows a balance of �s after paying interest at the rate at which the money has been borrowed besides this it may be noted ngain that the hotel is only one portion of the whole the com pletion of the hotel and of the entire scheme of bailding has ehanced the value of all nowv that the hotel is tenanted and ini full operation ithe shops and offices also are better let and the icommittee are counting on a total rental of � a year of which the hotel is to yield little more than halfincidentally the above leading facts may give some idea of the length the omplexity and the anxieties ef the undertaking but the impression would certainly be deepened by perusal of the  pages of report by the conunittee especially when taken in connexion with the hot fire of criticism which hns been krept up by people who avow themseeves illinformed distrustful of the whole affair in its mnanagement and in its details andpositivelyaghast at the groin evidence of out lay on marble and granite anrd gilding and other embellishisients neone of which may be at all in excess for such an estal iishnieft as the hotel tenant has covenanted to carry on but which excite the alarm and anger of ratepayers predis posed to view it either as a waste of money or nn extravagant experiment quite beyond the limitsof municipal duties a t the sae time there are nimbler minds just as ready to jump to an oppo site point of view founding themselves on a statement that the tenants takings are alroadly � a mouth they qan exclaim on the iniprovi denc of a bargain which did not

internal history of the matter showvs how diacult it was to negotiate the tenancy and even after alease for  vears had been effected to revise the respective claims of tenant and corporatiofi if the

truly that some had no rivalry to fear that their older and wellknown morits keld them safe an answer may indeed be found somewhero in the protit to the general ratefund from a successful financing of publio improvements through the medium of the corpoo ration hotel but this possibility seems a hard one for many to grasp hey grudge even the inevitable result of advertising the new entorprise the more it is discussed and decried as one fanatic sometimes charges a brother in the ranks with being an enemy in disguise so it is part of the humour of the situation for some malipnants to affect that much of this antihotel agitation by others is an adroit device of tho authorities themselves to benefit their questionable offspringseriously however there is a final obstacie to the otherwise plausiblo endeavour to disarm all fears of tho expense by proving it to have been public profit and that is the striking disclosure of the improvement commuittce that to quote the chairman for � of thei expenditure there is no act vote or resolution of the committee on record and they had no knowledge of it till the bills came in hero aro the scandalmongers reinforced one might almost say to their hearts content they have now carried the appointmenb of the special committee of inquiry for which they have long been clamouring it does not indeed seem to have been much resisted unless a a piece of superfluous investigation by the side of that which the corporation offlicials and committee were alfeady carrying on they appear to be well persuaded that the worst the inquiry can disclose will be unauthorized outlavfor which at any rate value has been fully receivod the contractors charges are certainly to be paid in full that is already confirmed by the city council on the improvement committees advice there may be questions of liability still open between this com mittee and the architect or anybody to whom responsibility for excess outlay may bo traced but whatever weak places may be found or acknowledgeed in the supervision of works or accounts there is the reassuring conviction of the chairman of the committee trat nothing will be found dishonest the chairman who has not been long in office assumes to be in a position to speak  with judicial fairness he declares that he  has not been able to find the slightest evi dence of any irregularity of that kind or any thing to lessen his confidence in the entire honesty or integrity of the members of the comnittee the contractors or the architect no doubt it says much for the ability of human nature to stand trials of some duration that for all that appears to the contrary in reports or debates of this busi ness committee architectcontractors and tenant are all good friends still but the chairman him self in a moralizing mood admits that  the committee have learned a lesson he also  hopes the time will come though it is not now when they will be able to dispose of the entire property he has even  a very clear idea that the corporation has no business with it in such words may be detected the gleam of hope of better days when this committeewill be happy if it can get rid of the load of cares it has drifted under on a pavement of the best and purest in tentions the lesson as well as the sympathy may be widely felt
