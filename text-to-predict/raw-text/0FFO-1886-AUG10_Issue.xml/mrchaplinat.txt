i b ohaplin t tslafobdur eny chaplin hp waa present at the annual dinner of the sleaford conservative association held in the corn exchange sleaford last night mr cg h w hervey vlcepresident of the club occapied the chairmr caplj said that he hoped and believed they would excuso him if he dvwelt for a few moments on a question which was person to himself they had watched with interest he vas sure the creation of the ministry which lord salisbury had just been called upon to form and they were probably aware that in that ad ministration lord salisbury was good enough to offer him a place he was offered the local government board without a seal in the cabinet but with a prospect of attaining to that position at some indefinite period in the future under these circumstances he declined the offer for reasons to which he should refer directly his attitude ou that occasion had been he had observed the subject of criticisms some friendly and some the reversethough much more frequently he was glad to say the former which had proceeded from variora quarters but if any vindication of his conduct if any explanations were re quired it was to themhis constituentsthat they wereue before all others and he gladly availed himnslf of this opportunity of making them it was a long time now louger than he cared to think of nearly  yearssince they had first returned him as their member for a division in this county and he never could repay them for that generous confidence which they had oiven him throughout fhat time he could trui say that for the greater portion of that period he had laboured hard to serve their interests and he had grudged neither time labour nor expense in parliament and out of it in whatever he thought was in the interests of the country and of the party to which they belonged but he frankly confessed that it was a disap pointmentand it would be mere affectation to pretend that it was otherwise to any man who was so deeply interested in the fortunes of the party as he was to find hiniself excludedwithout even a reason being given for that exclusion from all share in its deliberations and from any voice whatever in its councils at a period like tho present that however was not the cause of his declin ing the offer which was made to him he declined it for other grounds and for reasons which he believed would commend themselves to them contrary to what was the case with regard to any other of the subordinate appoint ments there were impending most important questions in connexion with that office questions both difficult and delicate and in some of which he knew that there existed a wide difference of opinion among those who would have been his chlleagues he did not and could not see his way to conducting the dutiesof that ofice in the coming session with the prospect of either satisfaction or success unless he had the opportunity of joining in their deliberationsle would give them an illustration of what he meant it was quite certain that the whole question of local government must very shortly be dealt with and the charge of the measure would necessarily have devolved upon the holder of that office it could not fail to bea most important a very large and a very complicated measure it would probably includeat least he assumed it would includethe question of allotments upon which as he knew from his experience of the last administration there was very considerable difference of opinion whether it still existed or whether lord salisbury was still entirely adverse to the principle of the bill which he had introduced upon this question last session and which he had reason to believe both here and elsewhere had found considerable favour in the counties at the last election he was not in a postion to say but assuming that it did he was sure they would perceive that he could not hope to introduce a measure in accord with his own convictionsand satisfactory to himself in relation to the question without the oppor tunty of submitting to the cabinet arguments and reasons i favour of the principles and the views he entertained as a minister outside the cabinet last session he had a somewhat unfortunate experience in connexion with that question and although he made no complaint of it at the time for it was useless to cry over spilt milk it made an impression on him which he had not since forgotten he referred to the occasion on which they were defeated and the conservative government turned out on the motion of mr jesse colliugs that was a fiasco caloulated to damage the party most seriously vith the new voters in the counties and apparently to place the conservatives in a position of direct antagonism to their interestsa fiasco which never ought to have occurred and which if he could have made his views prevail he was sanguine enough to believe never would have occurred at all events on that particular question in that howeverhe had been unsuc cessful ana all he knew was this that on the day of the discussion when he was asked to undertake the defence of the government against mr jesse collings all the material he had at his command was the promised intro duction of a bill for dealing with glebe lands and the first intimation which he received of the final intentions of the g overnmeut to do anything whatever with regard to allot ments was contained in the speech of a colleague mr balfour delivered at the close of that debate the dis crepancy in their speeches was the subject of course of general remark it was not an experience that he desired to repeat and it was a position in which he entirely declined ever to be placed agaiu there was one other coisideration which if there had not been those other and graver reasons might possibly to some extent have influenced him in his decision he had always taken as thoy knew a keen and active interest in the fortunes of the agricultural commu nity and he had endeavonred at all times to support their interests in the house of commons for many wears the duke of richmond represented that interest in the coun cils of the party but now he had withdrawn and although for the moment lord john mannersand there was no single member of the government who stood higher in the estimation of the partywas at the head of the aericul tural department he had served the party for many years and it was impossible to expect him to take the labouring oar on behalf of any particular interest beyond that he was not aware of any other mlinister whose e erience or whose duties in other deparents wouldlow of his waksn actfhive part in relation to those interests hened enough to think that the agricultural in terest which used to be the backbone of the tory party ought to be acbively and directly represented in any con servative cabinet of the day but ifthat could not be the next best thing they might be sure was that it should be actively represented outside the government al together he arways looked back with satisfaction to the days when two or three years ago thanks to their support and that of agriculturists everywhere throughout england some of them were able in the house of commons without any assistance whatsoever from either offi cial or exofficial members of the house to com pel a liberal and a hostile government reluctantly and against their will to pass a measure which was not the measure of the government but a measure of their owne was speakng of the cattle bill the benefits of which had been appreciated not by agriculturists only but by all classes of the community since then if they were able to do that with a liberal and a hostile government it would go hard he thought if they were not able to in duce their friends to pay due regard to their claims and to carry whatever measures they might find to be feasible and effective on behalf of that powerful and most impor tant interest he had dwelt on that because it was due to them to know the reasons which prompted him to de cline the offer which was made to him on that occasion and he hoped those reasons were such as would induce them to believe that he had not been wanting either in patriotism or public spirit in the course which he had taken those however after all were very minor matters the question of this office or that and the par ticulas individuals to whom they were apportioned became of infinite unimportance by the side of the tre mendous issues with which they were confronted at the present timeand what he desired most earnestly to impress upon them was the duty which rested on every one of them the present parliament they must remember had been returned as a signal and emphatic protest against thd policy which mr gladstone recently endeavoured to forceupon this country with regard to irelanl and it was in virtue and in consequence of that protest that lord salisbury iild thme government of lord salisbury reignedin mr tlastonesplacethatday he took the policy of losd salisbury anae hiscolleagues to be thisthat they were detproniued to amaintain the union betveen the two countries to administr and to enforce the lawi and to give effective security for life and properbt to every sub lect of tlie queen inireland it was no simple and easy matternat thelpresent time irelaid had been debauched by a series of lax administrations until crime until out rages until general defiance of the law in ireland had almost come to be regarded as the normal condition of that country that was a state of things the continuance of which any loyal and truehearted englishman could not sanction or support what might be required to terminate that state of things and what the method by which it was to be put an end to were matters upon which the govern ment must be allowed full and even ample time to form a mature and deliberate opinion their duty in his opinion was perfectly simple and that was for every single man among them to give not only their united but their indiviual sulppors as nest uhey might to the government of lord sahabury in their attempts to deal with the intolerable state of things the creation of which in his opinion had been mainly owing to the evil influence of mlr glad stone in ireland for the last  years and tho mischief and miery of which it would probably take generations to repair loud cheersthe following resolution was subsequently adopted that this meeting expresses its sincere satisfaction at the accession to power of lord salisburys administration but cannot refrain from placmg upon record its extreme regret at the lonadmission to the cabinet of the right hon ehenry charlin zip whose undoubted abilities and the eminent services he has rendered to the conservative party for many years past and especially during the recent general elections ave entitled him to a leading position in the present administration
