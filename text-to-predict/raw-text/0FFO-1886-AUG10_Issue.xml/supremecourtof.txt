latb v l p tollemache commonly knowtn as lord hun tingtowerwhich occurred so far back as asto the right of prbving for dremiums paid on certain life policies it appeared thattord huntingtower was indebted to messrs cocks biddulph and co te bankers in � and on the th of october  he by deed assigned two olicies of insurance for � on his life to them as security and covenanted to repay the debt by instalments and also covenanted inter acia to repay cocks and co upon de inard any premiums which they might pay in respect of the policies a warrant of attorney of the same date was given a a bcollateral security to messrs cooks and co empowering them to enter up judgment for � which was done but wvhich udgment wias not to be en forced if the covenants in the deed were performed in  one of the policies was sutrendered and the sur render value received by cocks and co and in  the office with which the other policy was made faileds and cocks and co received divdends on the policy up to these dates the premiums had been paid by cocks and co lord huntingtower had obtained his certificate in  snd the creditors were ultimately paid s in the poundbut cocks and co sought further to prove for a sum of e paid for premiums after giving credit for the sums received in respect of the policies the assignees of lord euuntingtower opposed this proof on the ground that onder the bankruptcy act in force in  when the bankruptcy occurred  geo iv a covenant to pay premiums of insurance was not such a contingent debt as could be proved it was argued on behalf of cocks and co that there being hudgment for � at the date of the baikruptcy and therefore a legal debt and the conn ene having happened after the bankru tcy and beroc the proof the debt could be proved tor under section o of  geo iv as there was a legal debt liable to be reduced subsequently mir registrar brougham held that cocks and co were entitled to prove for � the premiums paid before the bankruptcy but not for the premiums paid subsequently cocks and co appealed andmr winslow qo and mr yate len argued for them and relied upon  ex parte myers    deacon and chitty mr cooeri willis qc and mr wace for the hssignees and hr cannell q c and mr mlonrob for an opposing creditor contended tbat there must be a p resent liability at the date of the bankruptcy ascertained before the grantina of the certificate and from which the bankrupt was discharged by the certificate and that the indement for �o was only a security and not a legau dett the claim must be capable of being valued at the date of the bankruptcy in order to be provable which could not possibly be done in this case bx parte myerswas reheard and explained sub nom  ex parte simpson   deacon and chitty lord justior fry read an elaborate judgment to the effect that the bankers cocks and co were not entitled to the proof they claimed to make at tie time of the bank tuptcy he said there was a judgment debt for � in forcd against the bankruptbut by a contemporaneous deed it was only a security creating no present debt but a lia bility which might upon the happening of a contingency ripeb into a debt and the execution was so limited to the extent allowed by the deed and the judgment was reduced to a security for the sums leviable by execution the question was whether under the bankruptcy act in force at the time  geo iv the proof would be allow able and after exanining the enactment in that act their lordships came to the conclusion that the proof as claimed would not be allowable under the tatute and that the statute did not authorize the proof besides whch there were other difficulties in the way of the creditor which the judgment proceeded to point out and so their lordships came to the conclusion that there was no right to make the proof as cilimed and that there fore the appeal must be dismissedthil tine art socieyry v the union bahr op lontdoqthis case raised for the first time a question of great public importance whether post office orders are to beeemed negotiable instruments or in the nature of nego tiable instruments payable by bankers to the bearers it will be seen that their lordships have held unanimously adopting the jud ant of mr justice day that they are tot so and that ix a clerk gets them paid by bankers to his own account they are responsible tothe rightful holders or owners of the orders the question had arisen under these circumstances the plaintiffs had received post office orders and had handed them to a clerk to pay into their account at their bankers the clerk had an account at the same bank which it did not appear was known to the plaintiffs his employers and paid them into his own ac count it appeared that there is a practice not amount ing to a legal customat the post office that as to merchants and others who have accounts with bankers the produc tion of the letter of advice enclosing the order otherwise necessary is not required by the banks and there is also a practice between bankers and their customers for the ankers to receive the orders and get them cashed at the ost office without seeing the letters of advice under these circumstances the clerk paid the orders into his own re count and the bank acting for him presented the orders at the post office and put the money to his credit tho plaintiffs now sued the bank for the amount and mr justice day had decided in favour of the plaintiffs that the bankers were liable prom that decision the bankersalivealedlord ebit unow delivered judgment in favour of the plaintiffs affirming the decision of the learned judge the practice he said as to bankers receiving and cashinthe orders for their customers was not a legal custom and it did not appear that the bankers would doso for persons who had not an account with them nor even for all their customers and it did not appear that the plsintiffs were aware that their clerk had an account at their bankers that the clerk in paying the orders into his own account had committea fraud was obvious and it was equally obvious that he did so without anuthority for the orders were given to him to pay the smount to the credit of his employers the receipt by the bankers therefore of the orders was itself wrongful and strong evidence of a conversion but when theytook the orders to the post office and got them cashed there cliarly was a conversion by them of the plaintiffs property though an innocent conversion it was indeed urged thatthese documents having been treated by the post office and by merchants and bankers as if they were negotiable instruments and having been so treated by the plaintiffs they must be so regarded and the case of  goodwim vhobarts was cited but in that case the doetmenta had been treated as negotiable not only by all parties merchants bankers and others but also on every exchange in baropeand so it was held by the house of lords that they were m the nature of negotiable instru ments but here it was otherwise the docuiments had not been so treated by everybody it did not appear that bankers had so treated them except for their cus tomers and the post office had not treated them as negoti able but had o dealt with them as they had done on the faith placed in them from their being in the hands of bankers they were not negotiable instruments and did iot come within the authority of the decision cited then it was urged that the plaintiffsknowing that the documents were treated then as negotiable and having so treated them were not to be allowed to contend thab they were not so  but such a decision could only be given on the groundthatevery body had treated the orders as negotiableand that was not to and there was nothing in this case to preclude thetlaintiffs from denying the negotiability of the orders it did not a ppear that they knew their clerk had an account at the banks probably if they had known it they would hiot have retained him in their employment and the plaintiffs were entitled to recoverlord jugrce fry read a judgment of lord justice bowen and himself to the same effect the orders they said were nob negotiable or payable to bearer nor were they in the nature of negotiable instruments they were issued by the post offlce under regulations by which ordinarily the paycc was to sign a receipt though it was provided thatf the name of a banker were wvritten or stamped on the face of the orderthe namewouldbe aecepted as a sufficient receipt but the operation of this was only to make the bankers name a substitute for the receipt of the original payee there was no evidence of a custom makiing these documents negotiable there was nothing to preclude the plaintiffs from recoveringfrom the bankers having merely given the orders to their clerk to carry to the bank and pay into their account the plaintiffs there fore were entitled to recoverjudgment for theplaintiffs affirmed and appeal dismissedpandoirp and co v namton fraser anid cothis case as lord esher observed ib giving judgment is one of considerable importance and moreover is one of a curious and interesting character and the ques tion being whether damage done to the cargo of a ship by injuries caused by rats can he considered as caused by theperils of the scas it had arisen thusthe action was by the charterers of a ship and the holders of a bill ofadigfor damage done to a cargo of rice shipped by thematnd belonging to them and the learned iudge at the trial lord justioe lopes had given judgment against thebi en tho ground that the damage doneto the rice by means of rats gnawing a pipe and letting in the seawater was one of the excepted perilsthat is perils of the seas but this has been overruled the charterparty as usualexcepted all dangers and accidents of the seasrivers c whatever the nature or errors of navigation durin the voyage and the question was whether the dangers othe seas thus excepted included the damage causedby the seawater through the gnawing by tha rats what had happened was tats the vessel had been chartered by the plantiffs to proceed to a port in burmah and take a cargo of rice the cargo was loaded but in the course of the voyage ratswhich of ourse must have been in the shipbefore it sailed with cargoso gnawed a leaden pipe om snunicating with a cistern as to let in the seawater which damiaged the cargo of rice two questions were put tothejurr l whether the rats had been brought on boardithe shippers in the course of shippinz therice andmi whether reasonable care had been taken to prevent them from coming on board the jury answered the frstuestioa in tho negative and the next in the affirmativetihere was no dispate as to the cause of the danage to the riee that is it was caused by seawater coming through thehole gnawea by the rats in the pipe the question was vhether on tho true construction of the charterarty this was a cause of damage excluded as arisitn fromdabgerw of the seas  from the charterparty the learned judge heldthat ir was so and gave judgment for the clefendantsfrom which the plaintiffs alppealed lord esherdelivered judgment at considerable ength contary totho judgmdtb of lord justic lopes

speaki of the gnawting of raits as the act of gdd aid the other parts of the elauae had ho apphcation then as to dagers orperilsof tho seas they meant perils to which vesseli were exposed by reason of their being o the sea it had always been laid down and was laid downi in  arnould on insurance that they mneant damage or losses caused by the sea and did not include all losses or damage happening on the seas perils of the seas were peculiar to those who were upon the seas then the damage dono to the ship or cargo by rats was not a damage caused by the sea the rats did not come from the sea and the damage done was not peculiarto the sea uor was it eamage done by dangers or perils of the seas it had always thetefore been held even though the jury had found that damage done by rats was caused by perils of the seasthat on the true construc tion of the charterparty it was not within the perils of the seas and lord justice lopes in his judgment had adopted that view lord esher here reviewed the cases on the subject in a recent case  lavaroni v drury the damage was done directly to the cargo by the rats and not by their letting in the sea water is was done by the rats themselves in reference to a charter party the real effective cause must be looked to if the rats gnawed the planks to within oneeighth of an inch ot the sea was it to bh held a damage not caused by perila of the seasbut if they gnawed oneeighth of ad inch furtber and let in the sea was it to be held that it was so y he could not draw suich a fine distinction with reference to the terms of the charterparty or tho bill of lading it could not be said that the coming in of the tea water wvas the real cause of the damage  the real cause was the gnawing by the rats he could not agree with his brother lopes in holding that the immediate cause of the damage was the coming in of the sea water and not the gnawing by the rats the strict rule as to causa proxima only applied to policies of insurance and rotto charterparties and as to the charter party the immediate cause was the entering of the sea water the effective cause was the gnawing by the rats in my opinion said lord esher where the effective cause of a loss under a charterparty is damage done to a cargo by means of ratsthat is not a peril excepted by the excepting clause and that where the ratsas the effective causelet in the sea the letting in of the sea is not cause but effect and that what was done was not done by any danger or peril of the sea i cannot therefore agree with the judgment and think that it ought to be overruledljoiti justice bowen then read a written judgment of himself and lord justice fry to the contrary effectthat the judgment was right and must be upheld he said this was an action brought agamst the owners of a ship to recover damages for sea injury to the cargo caused by a leakage of which rats were the authors the defendants ship had been chartered by the plaintiffs to proceed to akyab and there load a cargo of rice for liverpool the excepted perils id the charterparty were the act of god and au and every other dangers and accidents of the seasrivers and steam navigation of whatsoever nature and kind and errors of navigation during the voyage and the tenour of the bill of lading was the same it appeared that the damage was caused during the voyage to liverpool after the ship had left akiyab by sea water passing through a hole in a metal pipe connected with a bath roomn in the vessel this pipe having been gnawed through by rat it was not disputed at the trial that all reasonable nrecau tions had been taken by the captain and his crew to keep down the rats on the vo age from liverpool to akyab the jury found further that the rats which causedthe damage were not brought on board by the shippers in the course of shipping the rice at akyab and that those on board had taken reasonable precautions to prevent the rats coming on board at akyab during the shipping of the cargo there was on the other hand no finding of the jury and no admission by the parties as to the condition of the vessel in respect of rats when she left liverpool for akyab or as to the original cause of the presence of rats on board the ship the case was dealt with by lord justice lopes on further consideration and he directed a verdict for the defendants on the ground that the case was one of danger or accident of the seaa within the exception in the shipping docuaments and that the shipowner was thereby exonerated from this judgrneait the plaintiffs now appeal that damage done to cargo by the direct action of rats which devour it on the voyage ir not due to a peiil of the sea was decided in  kay v nvheeler    l r c p  by the exchequer chamber see  lavaroni v drry  ex  and a aymar v astor   cowens reports supreme uourt of new york p  lt was contended however in the present case on behalf of the shipowners that the question is a different one where cargo is airectly damged by sea water entering a ship through leaks whtch rats ave caused and that although the ship owner is not excased when dhe rat eats a cargo of rice directly if a rat eats through a pipe which lets the sea water in upon the rice the accident is one for which the shipowner will nor be responsiblea distinction which if it exists must be admitted to savour of subtlety by the common law of this country which in this respect is stricter than either the civil law or the law of man con tinental nations a carrier by sea was liable for oss or damage to goods except only in the event of accidents caused by the act of god or of the kings enemies in  dale v eall   wilson  the loss was occasioned by a leakage caused by rats gnawing a hole in the bottom ofthe vessel the goods were not carried under any bill of lading and it was held thab by the common law the hoyrnan was not excused on the ground of any act of god the larger exception to the carriers liability contained in the exception of perils of the seas or accidents and dangers of the seas has sptung up gradually sincethe reign of queen elizabeth no such provision being found in the forms of charterparties or of blyls of lading given inwests symbols but being krlown apparently in the reign of cnarlesi sseu pickering v barkely  styles   reble   barton v wolford  comberbatch  the crgo inthe present case was carried under a bill of lading containing the now familiar exception and we have to consider accordingly whether a carrier who would not be excused by the common law for loss due to leakage caused by rats can find protection under the ex press term accident or danger of the sea the exact definition of the term  dangers or accidents of the sea or of the cognate expression of  perils of the sea  which latter name is only the latinized equivalent for dangers has been the subject of perpetual discussion both in eng land and america on the one side it has been sought to confine it to calamities which occur only through the violence of the elements  ex marinto temu statis discri mine  or to use the language of  marsh  vol p   such as arise from stress of weather winds and waves from lightning and tempests rocks and sands c by others it has been sought to extend it bo imclude all inevitable accidents which occur upon the seas or at all events all such as occur by the action of sea water in the course of navigation for which human negligence or for which at all events the carriers negligence is not responsible the term peri of the sea is one which has long been employed in policies of insurance as well as in contraets of carriage though losses which fall within the meaning of the policy owing to the different nature of the contract are not always losses which would fall within the bill of lading exception but it may be at least considered probable subject adways to any question of usage or construction that if a loss is not due to a peril of the sea within the meaning of a policy of insurance neither will it be due to a peril of the sea within the meaning of the ordinary bill of lading ac cording to lord tenterden the decision of the judge upon what is a peril of the sea may be guided by usage and the course of practice aong merchants and it is observable that the case in which pirates were fist held to be a peril of the sea was decided upon a certificate of merchants read in court that they were so esteemed  styles  it is not necessary in the present instance and not being necessary it would be undesirable to lay down an exhaus tive definition as to the meaning of the terw  perils of the sea  either in contracts of carriage or in policies of insurance we desire to leave ourelves entirely free to consider whenever the necessary occasion arises whether the term  peril of the sea  might not embrace othbr dangers beyond those which are due directly to the violent actionef the elements unless there be some exception to such a definition it is difficult to aecount for the fact that pirates by mercantile custom are a peril of the sea or that shipwreck upon a hidden boulder when not due to negligence of the master would be due t the same excepted cause it is sufficient to affim broadly that within the meaning of an ordinary charterparty or bill of lading a loss cannot be due to the perils of the sea which the exercise of reasonable skill and diligence on the part of the shipowner might have averted in tho case of the schooner reeside  sumner  ad  mr justice story thus expresses himself  the phraso danger of the seas whether understoodin its most lnimted sense as importing only a loss by the natural acci dents peculiar to that element or whether understood in its more extended sense as including inevitable accidents upon that element must still in either case be clearly understood to include enly such losses as are of an extra ordinary nature or arise from some irresistible force or some overwhelming power which cannot be guarded against by the oramary exertionb of human skill and prudence so again in miarshall on isurance vol  p   if any loss or damage happen to the goods from any fault or defect of the ship not arising from sea damage or from any accident or misfortuxne in the voyage but from some latent defeet before she sailed thb ownter of the goods has his remedy againisb the owners of the ship for such loss or damage the judgment of lord justice lopes in the court below accepts this principle but proceeds upon the basis that the action of the rats in gnawing through the pipe and letting in the sda water upon the cargo was a mxatter beyond all humian control that it was to addpt his own words a ease  of sea damage at sea and nobodys fault i ae burden of proof of this rested upon the shipowner but the admissions made during the trial of the case and the findings of the jury seem to us to fall far short af establishing the inference drawn by lord justice lopes it is consistent with both the verdict and the findings that the preseice of rats may have constituted an original vico in the ship when she ssilea to take in cargo which continued down to and at the time when shein fact took it in their presence at such a timeso far as theai presence constituted any element of danger to the cargowas to that extenbt a defect in the hip eveh if it were shown to bb impossible to have ex cluded the rats which caused the mischief to the pipea

whibch states that keeping cats on board excused the shpoer frdm damage by rats chief baron polloek says wzoatever be the case when roqecas wrote we cannot but think rats might be now banished from a ship without any particular vigilance on the part of the master it is not impossible that it was on some such broad common sense view of the case that lordeuenboroughproceeded henin hunter v potts   camp p  he held that a loss arising from rats eating holes in the ships bottom is not within the perils insured against by the common form of a policy of insurance as a rulerats can be kept out of ships which are fit to carry cargo and speaking broadl a loss which is due to leakage caused by rats wil pro a ly be found to be due not to the perils of the sea but to the defects of the ship or the want of precautions of the ship owner in his chapter dealing with policies oe insurance the learned author of  kents commentaries saysit has even been a vexed question whether damage done to a bhip by rats was among the casualties comprehended uncter perils of the sea and the authorities are much divided on the question the better opinion would however seem to be that the insurer is not liable for this sortbodamage because it arises from the negligence of the com mon carrier and it may be prevented by due care and is within the control of human prudence and sagacity he adds in a note some referenees to a number of foreign juridical writers who have all maintained the principle that the owner and not the insurer is liable for any injury by rats and states that the only case which he has met with direetly to the contrary is that of garrigues v coxbinn  storyon bailments p  adds that  it seems a loss occasioned by leakage which is caused by rats nawing a hole in the bottom of the vessel is not in the enghsh law deemed a loss by peril of the sea lord tenterdenin his work on shippingcap adopts lanvuage to the same effect  where rats he says  occasioned a leak in the vessel whereby the goods were spoiled the master was held responsible for the damage notwithstand ing the crew afterwards by pumping c did all they could to preserve the cargo from injury and this deter mination agrees with the rule laid down by roccus who says if mice eat the cargo and thereby oecasion no smal injury to the merchant the master must make good the loss because he is guilty of a fault yet if he had cats on board his ship he shall be excused this rule and the ex ception to itaithough bearing somewhat of a ludicrous air furnish a good iuustration of the general principle by which the master and owners are held responsible for every injury that might have been prevented by human foresight or care in conformity to which principle they are re sponsible for goods stolen or embezzled on board the ship by the crew or other persons or lost or iujured in conse quence of the ship sailing in fair weather against a rock or shallow known to expert mariners it is not strictly necessary to decide what would be the result in the some what improbable case of a shipowner who succeeded in proving tht the presence of rats that have caused mischief by lealage to the cargo was neither due to any defect in the reasonable condition of his ship nor a matter which by reasonable precautions could have been prevented this hypotheticalcaseofa possible exceptiontowhat we may cau the broad and natural inference of faet is reserved by mar shall vol i p  where he says that  the owners are liable for damage done by rats unless it appear that au necessary precautions were used to prevent it the academical question which marshau and other writers have left open it is not necessary in the present case to close so far as relates to leakage caused by rats as dis tinguished from damage so done by them directly to the cargo it is however obvious that the continental writers to whom story refers as entertaining a view that in such a case the owner would be protected wrote at a time when ships were very different from the carring ships of the present day nor indeed were their views followedby the court of exchequer in lavaroni vdrury  e t or by the exchequer chamber in  kay v wheeler   lr cp it never must be forgotten that the english law is less indulgent to the carrier than either the roman law or the law of many continental nations tn the present instancethe buiden of proof resting with the shipownerno facts have bean estabhlshed which raise this speculative pointit was consistent withal thefindingsthat the mischief done toa pipe andtheincursion of sea water which followed would never have happened but for either a defect in the condition of the ship or some want oa providence in the shipowner or his servants the question therefore does not arise whether there may hot be a conceivable case of leakage caused by rats which would not fall within the broad and everyday rule por these reasons we are of opinion that the judgment of the courb below must be reversed and the
