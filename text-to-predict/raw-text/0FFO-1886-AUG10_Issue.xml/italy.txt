zaalr oim otm comuebsroxderrome aug there is one manifestation of the political life in italy which fmust strike a foreigner un acquainted with the character of the people as in explicable and vicious in motiveviz the passion for electing to some post of honour a person con victod of misdemeanournalost anything in the wayof violationof law it is certainly amorbid and depraved tendency say what ono may in explana tion of or excuse for it and no people that respects its representative body and has a due sonse of tho dignity of constitutional government could be guilty of the insult to itsolf which lies in electing a convict to stand for it in tho national councils but the selfinsult and the causes that lead to it may be explained and to a cortain degree palliated as due to a perverted idea of the relations of government and governed growing out of a false political education not peculiar to italy but which italy has not yet had time to recover from especially in the southern provinces and the romagnafor centuries the relations of the population of those provinces to their governors have been thoso of subjection varying from benevolent despotism to inexoraole tyranny government and its instruments being on one sido of the scale and the people on the other the government of the popes if sometimes paternal was never less autocratio than that of the bourbons and above all no suggestion of the right of the subject to judge the manner in which he shall be governed or to remonstrate on its injustice much less react against it was permitted i have lived in rome undertho temporal power and am competontto express an opinion the consequence of this tato of things prolonged for generations and this even more in the rmagna where the people lhave a sturdier and more refractory naturo than in the sicilies was to establish as the dominant political motive almost instinct a vivid popular sympathy with whoever was obnoxious to adminis trative measuresunfortunately the same political school which oducatod the subject formed the administrators and tho astute quickwitted people is still in an orgauic antagonism to all functionarios and these in their turn are still in their own conservativo view of the duty of governmont obliged to use all their authority to repross popular tendencies to more complete emancipation whence continualotty collisions and insignificant revolts which leop up the antagonism then the legal pro cedure goes on the theory that to prevent crime it is necessary to convict and punish somebody and the object of tho appointment of a public prosecutor is to make this conviction more certain and the animus of the tribunal partaking more or less of this spirit and the pride of tho public prosecutor being engaged in his success not in arriving at simple justice but in securino a veodict the sympathies of the people generally go with the prisoner in the trial just now going on at ancona of tho thieves of a large amount of money from a consignment of bank bills from one braneh bank to another it transpires that at a former trial of persons accused of the theft an innocent man was coiivicted and has been in prison ever since the real thieves having only lately been discovered anid suchan error of justicewhich may occur anyvhere is here folt as the consequence of a radically incorrect attitude of justice towards the people and so crime to a certain extent becomes an affair of government and governed and assumes a political colour as if the criminal were a revolutionist a common criminal is a poverino a poor unfortun ate fellow who only excites commiseration and whom everybody is interested in delivering from his persecutors while a more prominent man or one who has shown some qualities of the eugene aram or jack sheppard type is made a hero of and as the vote at the political elections is the only arm of the masses that at the administrative or municipal and communal elections boing much more restricted he is nominated for deputy at the next election this is in the main an act of defiance and an insult offered to government as the constitutional enemy the people do not yet feel that insulting tho chamber of deputies by sending convicts to sit in it is insulting popular sovereigntyv whose symbol and organ the chamber is and the government on the other side while absolutely liberal in theory still since the individual italian especially when function ary is intensely conservative does not frankly adopt a liberal practice and treat the chamber with that respect which is due to a sovereign power and take steps to protect it against this kind of insult and tho restloss radicals in a hopeless minority in the chamber of deputies and at heart antagonistic to any governmont that is not radical and revolutionary join shortsightedly in the movement and vote for a candidate whose election is theomost deadlyblowto goodrepublican government in the future and the surest means to make popular representation contemptible as if the obanber of deputies were the refuge of sympathctic criminals and an election a measure of pardon ar crime committedlhus lately wo saw cipriani a wandering italian who has in love of adventure been much out of italy and was one of those who volunteered to fight with garibaldi in lrance and who falling into the hands of the police on some minor accusa tion was recognized as a man wvanted for a double or triple murder at alexandria in egypt the mnurder was admitted and the provocation alleged was unsupported by evidence or evon probabilitv and cipriani was convieted for various reasons which it is needless to investigate but of which the chief was an accusation against the govern ment of having pressed for a conviction on political grounds popular opinion took up the defence of cipriani and elected him deputy in two constituencies of tho romagna the elections vwre declared invalid and the seats vacant but new elections being held cipriani was again returned in one of them and the government has btill to meet the question of what to do with the conatituoney which insists on degrading itself to show its hostility to the government of the king domjust now again rome is the seat of what may become a dangerous agitation on account of a similar freak m the constituency ono cooca peiler who aspires to be a tribuno of the people aud who is a banalc imitation of rochefort in paris a thorsites of politics and who has attacfmd almost indiseriminately publie and private character with intentions which may bo perfectly honest but whieh no govermment in the interest of society can tolerate has lately been sontenced to a term of imprisonment for libel the natural result was a nomination to the chamber of deputies and after an indecisive election he is by a ballotage elected over the prince colonna by a very small majority thereupon his adherents demand his release as a deputy which the government naturally ceannot accord as he is nota deputy until sworn and is underoing a legal sontence which the chambor has no right to intor fero with and cannot vacate nothing can release him except a pardon by the king and this the ministry apparently do not feel disposed to adviseif the ministry should not decide to meet this question firmly and follow up the consequences with equal firneness they wil make themselves sreater trouble in the future tho porverse and ignorant line of action of the promoters of such scandals on parliamentary goverment can only bo supported by voters who wish to throw dis credit on the institutions of the kingdom of italy or aro too blinded by their political antipathies to see that by this system of manifesting their piquoorpassion they are only throwvingmud on the nation the triple election of cipriani is a gravereproachi for which no sufficint political motive existed and the return of coccapeiler is simply a scandiwhich should have been avoided by the ordinary codmon sense of italians it is probable however that the election was influenced to some extent by the anticlerical feelmg which rules the majority in the poltioal elections as the clerical tendenoy prevails in the administrative though as in the former only about  per cent of the voters go to thie polls we know very little of italian publi opinion from the electionsit isto be holped that government will
