eutorbs in thb housb of lordbsit is an interesting inquiry how far the house of lords is a match for the house of commons in intelleetual power and one test of this may be esamjinedby placing side by ide the achievements of thetrotouses in authorship objections may easily be taken to this test inasmuch as so many peers are without the stimulus to authorship which brings many obscure men into prominence and eventually into parliarnent if they do their duty most peers can find enough occupation in the supervision of their estates and other properties and all can readily find means of killing tinie by sport and travel yet if talent is hereditary we might expect to tind it bear fruit in the shape of books in a larger number of cases than actually occurs the hereditary peers it is true supply us with l fair number of men of as high literary stamp as any to be found in the commons but they ought to include a considerably greater proportion of literary men of mark seeing that they are the descendants of picked men con tinually selected out of a whole nation we are driven after a survey of the present house of lords to the conclusion that the influences of decadence which crowd upon it are more than suficient to counterbalance the effects of selec tion of culture and of heredity and we recog nize the undoubted fact that more than half the literary achievements of living peers aro the work of men who in their youth knew that they would not sit by right of birth in the house of lordsin order not to leave a wrong impression at the outset we must confess that the preponderance of the new over the hereditary peers in literary achievements is not duo to special selection recently exercised for the hqnour of literature excepting so far as lord tennysons genius may be colsidered ax outshining that of a host of his compeers it is to the spiritual peers the arch bishopa and bishops of the englishchurch that the houso of lords is most indebted for its intel lectual superiority and although in their case perhaosp nbt more than with other professions thero is a class bias yet a house which eomprises such men as archbishops benson and thomson bishops temple iightfoot harold browne magee goodwin hervey and ellicott not to mention others almost equally well known must include culture training sympathy acuteness experience and capacity of the highest kind their works being largely connected with their profession it does not seeni necessary or desirable to recount them here for it will be at once acknowvledged that in their persons they furnish a great literary contingent to the peers chamberit appears best to consider the rest of the peers efforts in authorship under the two heads of hereiditary and created peers the dukes as a group have not done much for us in authorship with the brilliant exception of the duke of argyll whose  reign of law has gono through very many editions and whose  unity of nature  is a more bulky and more recent contribution to the study of universal laws other works of his on primeval man iona  crofts and iarms in the hebrides and  the eastern question froimi  to  have been published besides numerous speeches and addresses the marquis of salisburys  life and speeches  have been issued the marquis of bath has published  observations on bulgarian affairs f and lord bute has translated the reformed xromish breviary the earls figure much more largely as authors than peers of a superior grade lord dufferins  letters from high latitudes  have gone through numerous editions and have been twice

schylus and has written on prison discipline for the llampshire quarter sessions he has eaited his fathers work on athens and the morea and has written a life of dean mansel and his archeoltogy of berkshire  may be con trastedc with  recollections of the druses of lebanon the arl of pembroke once ioemedlikely to gain permanent note in literature to judgo by south sea bbubbles by the barland the doctor the earl of desart is tho chief novelist among tho peors among his works may be named  kelverdale imervyn oconuorand only a womans love lord dunraven has wvritten on tho irish question and has also published his travels on the upper yellowstone lord derby is chiefly represented by pamphlets and speeches while lord nelsons name is widely spread as the compiler of a  manual of family prayer which has passed tbrough numerous editions and also by his  salisbury hymn book and his discussions of the  relations botwveen church and state  and other religious questions earl fortescue warned the nation as to its last  leap in the dark  in extending the franchise and as also advocated public schools for the middle classes lord malmes burys  memoirs of an exmilinister  have been several times reprinted and lord albemarle too belongs to the class of those who have successfully pablished their memoirs in their lifetime his fifty years of mv life has beenverysuccessful and lord albemarle may look back upon a literary career of more than sixty years for his earliest work was  a journey from india to england in  through baudad persia and astrakhan followed by a journey across the balkans and to asia minor he is also the author of  memoirs of the mkquis of rockingham and his contem porariesthe hereditary viscounts and barons are less fertile than the earls lord bury has written on  the exodus of the western nations and on volunteer questions lord reays addresses on education and on international relations are sound and valuable lord wrottesley a good while since published his  thoughts on govern ment and legislation lord stratheden and campbells published speeches are numerous if not well receivede and there almost ends the list of hereditary peers notable writings but for a scientific contribution of the first rank  the theory of sound by lord rayleigh who by many original contributions to physical science has shown that he worthily inherits the name of struttand sustains the fame of senior wranglersamong created peers we find that lord iddes leighs chief contribation to letters is his  lenty years of financial policy  lord selbornes  book of praise if not an original is a standard work and he is known by numerous speeches on church matters and leaal decisions lord shorbrookes speeches and letters on reform his budget and education speeches contrasted singularly with his  poems of a life lord actons essay on george eliot is recent but he has published writinaes in germany not so well known to english readers including contributions to the history of the vatican council under the titleszur geschichte desvaticanischen concils munich  and  sndschreiben an einen deutschen bischof des vaticanischon concils  he has also edited  los matinees royales attributed to frederick the great of prussia lord nortons essays on human happiness are not so well known to this generation as his speeches and pamphlets on national edueation andthecolonies

vane  florence the beautiful  francis the first  historic chmteaux and  historic pictures lord brabourne has written a large number of popular story books for children such as h higgledypiggledy  the fairy oak river legends c besides several political pamphlets he has also edited the  letters of jane austen lord wolseleys soldiers pocket book  has aone through several editions he is also the authlor of a  field pocketbook for the auixiliary services and has been the subject of a biographical memoir lord hamptons place in letters rests on his  speeches and addresses on education lord ebury has written copiously on church matters and especially on the revision of the liturgy lord cnrlingford has published speeches and pamphlets on the land and irish questions and lord lobhouse has written on the dead hand dealing with endowments and settlements of property and on several points in the law of married womens property it would of course be unnecessary to do more than refer to lord tennysons long list of brilliant writings except to say that if his abilities are conceived to be of value in our house of peers it would surely have been better to place him there many years ago with several others who could be namedlt will be evidentfrom the foregoing particulars that a solection could be made of  or  peers and spiritual lords who collectively would be far superior in literary ability and perhaps in originality te an equal number selected most ad vantageously in the house of commons fromthis it appears even more forcibly than in our article on authors in the new eouse of commons  on july  that for some reason there is an incom patibility between authors and the popular assembly and that if the nation is to gain ad vantage from such deliberative counsels as they can or will bestow it must either be under some different system of election from the present or by calling them to the upper hlouse reconstituted as many desire to see it
