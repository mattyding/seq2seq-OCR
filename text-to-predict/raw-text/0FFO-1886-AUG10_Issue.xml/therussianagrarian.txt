telhrussian agbaribar qubstioxby setzpxiin all european countries the sgrarian question is of groat moment but in none does it possess the same interest and importance es in russia where the agricultural class constitutes  per cent of the entire population equal for european russia exclusive of finland and poland to about  million souls ireland alone with  per cent of her population engaged in husbandry approaches at some distance this figure in england tho pro portion is only  per cent in scotland  while in central europe it varies from  to  per cent in france and the united states the proportion is  per centthe industrial development of russia since the emancipation has been very rapid a progress however which is chiefly due to improvements in the methods of manufao ture in  all the factories of the country employedonlyabout  hands twice as many as in  while the value of goods produced increased in the same period fivefold even adding to them the  artisans engaged in various industries at their own homes without entirely abandoning agriculture their numbers are still insi nificant as compared with the  millions who work exclusively on the land russia is and must undoubtedly for many years remainapeasant state in the fullest acceptation of the term with us therefore the agrarian question is the nationai question and agrarian concerns are national con cerns all others being de endent on and sub servient to them the tillers of the soilour mouj iksmust of necessity become the chief figures inour social and politicallife on the moujik rests the financial military and political power of the state as well as its interior cohesion and prosperity the inclinationsidealsand aspirations of the mouiiks will also play the principal part in the remoulding of russias fulture for all in terested in politicsstatesmen and administrators writers and scholarsthe moujik must be the prime object of study observation andinvestiga tion as well as of practical manipulation for the same reasons the russian moujik has always attracted the attention of observant travellers who have desired to make known to englishspeak ing readers the agrarian conditions of this strange countryof which somuch is said and so little known thereare few among educated foreigners who have not heard of the selfgoverning semirepublican mir and the somewhat communistic russian sys tem of land tenurewith its periodicalequalizations and divisions much less attention has been given by the european public to the modern phases of russian agrarian life albeit this side of the ques tion is perhaps the most interesting and instruc tive the emancipation act of february   enfranchising and settling the economicai conditions of onehalf of our rural population the former serfs of the nobility followed in  by a second act settling the condition of the other half the former state peasants were by far the most extensive experiments in the way of agrarian legislation the world has yet seen the peculiarities of our traditional system of land tenure sanctioned to a great extent by the eman cipation act imparted to this experiment an additional interestthat these experiments have not proved a success no competent person can now deny emancipation has utterly failed to realize the ardent expectations of its advocates and promoters the great benefit of the measure was almost purely moral it has failed to improve the material condition of the former serfs who on the whole are worse off than they were before the emancipation the bulk of our peasantry is in a condition not far removed from actual starvation a fact which can neither be denied nor con cealed even by the official press the frightful and continually increasing misery of the toiling millions of our country is the most terrible count in the indictment against the russian govern ment and the paramount cause and justification of the rebellion against it and yet it would be a gross injustice to affirm that the government has directly ruined or purposely injured tbe peasantry why should it act with such foolish and wanton wickedness  we can well understandbthat a des potic government caring only for its own selfish interests shoild object to the commonalty being educated but it is to the governments own material advantage to have welltodo taxpayers rather than the beggarly ones it has now i admit willingly that the central government quite sincerely intended to benefit the peasants not only morally but economically by the agrarian arrangement of  still more so by that of  which is better than its predecessor in every respect  the government in the latter case not having been hampered by a desire to conforrato the wishes of the nobility leaving out of the ques tion the immaterial point of intentions i am ready to go the length of acknowledging that it would be mcorrect to maintain that to the govern ments unintentional blunders should be ascribed the ruin which has overtaken the peasants the new agrarian arrangement is very unsatisfactory and the system of taxration is simply monstrous i shall presently show how far both these elements contributed towards reducinge the peasants to their present condition but still it was not the go vernments direct doing there is one considera tion which clearlyproves this since the emancipa tion the yield from the direct taxes imposed on the peasantshas increased butuntil their burdens had increased  per cent only since that time they have remained stationary and of late years there is even a slight decrease in the direct taxes very slight yet still a decrease as to the im poverishment of the masses measured by the reduced consumption of food and the increase in the rate of mortality it is frightful and intense and shows no sign of abatement whatever this is proof to demonstration that there must be at work another corrosive influence more inexorable and fatal and less under control evena than the actions of the uncontrollable bureaucracy this influence lies in the new economical system quite opposed to the traditions and ideals of the russian peasantry and which has been forced on them by the act of emancipation in these few letters i propose to present to the readers of ithe timea a brief yet as far as iossible complete account of the results of the russian agrarian experiment derived from the nimerous andpainstaking reports on the subject in which modern russian literature is so richbut what constitutes the basis of the traditional economic conceptions of our agricultural classes  the communal system of land tenure the reader may suggest is its most original and striking feature on this however i shall not dwell first becanse it was affected but slightly by the emancipation act of  which gave each village commune the option eitherof breakingup their land into private allotments and distributing it among independent families or keeping it as common property then the communal land tenure though accepted by  per cent of our peasantry is only exceptional amonug the rutheninns who formtne remainder of our rural population the evil inflicted by the emancipation act is of a much wider reach and greater importance it arises not from the way inwhich occupyingownersdivide their properties among themselves but from the fact that they are fast being divorced from the soil which they till the russian popular con ceptions of land tenure though they may seem somewhat hetetodoxto a western lawyer ormodern economist are exactly the same as those which in pat times prevailed among all european nations before they happened to fall victims to somebodys conquest russian peasants hold that land being made by nobody and an article of universal need ought not to become property in the usual sense of the word it naturally belongs to or more exactly it shotuld remain in the undisturbed possession of those by whom for the time being it is cultivated if the husband man discontinues the cultivation of his holding he has no more right over it than the fisher over the sea where he has fished or the shepherd over the meadow where he has once pastured his flock this does not however imply any question as to the right of the worker over the product of his labourin russia  peasant who has improved and brought under tilisge new landalways obtainsfromrt the  mii aright of undisturbed possession for a number of years varying in its mazimum in divers provinces from  to  years but ktriotly oformin h in aoh qase tothesamount oï¿½labour which has been bestowed on it by the peasant and his family during this period the occupier possesses the full right of alienating his holding by gift or sale but when the husband man is supposed to have been fully remunerated for his work all personal prescriptive right ceases these notions cannot be called exclusively russian they are deeply rooted throughout the slavonic world save among the few tribes who have been long subjected to western influences and overdrilled by the feudal regime the turkish domination proved in this respect much more tolerant the customs which prevail among the balkan slavs are almost identical with those that obtain in russia here according to bohishitch the people do not recognize a right of property in virgin land when cultivated it becormes the rightful property of its occupier and remains his so long as he continues to improve it with the work of his own hands a tenant who has cultivated for ten years without interruption another mans land becomes ipsofacto its leitimate proprietor and ceases to pay rent on the ground that he has bought up by his ten years payments the claims which the former land lord might have acquired in bulgaria according to the same authority the principle is pushed still further here simple wage labourers acquire the right of ownership over the land on which they have been empfoyed without interruption for the ten years period so that farmers in order to avoid being expropriatedchangetheir labourers at least twice every ten yearsin russia until its closo alliance with western countries in peter the greats time the popular notions as to land tenuire were common to all classes the government included  there is no country says prince wassiltchikoff in con cluding his careful study of the history of our agrarian legislation inwhich the idea of property in land was so vapue and unsteady as it was until very recently with us not only in the minds of the peasants but also of the representatives and heads of theatate the rightkof useof possession of the occupation of land has on the contrary been very clearly and firmly understood and determined from time immemorial the very word property  as applied to land hardly existed in ancient russia no equivalent to this neologism is to be found in old archives charters or patents on the other hand we meet at every step with rights acquired by use and occupation the land is recognized as being the natural possession of the husbandman the fisher or the hunter of him who  sits upon it in the living language of peasants of the period there is no term which expresses the idea of property over the land in the usual sense of the word the expression our land in the mouth of a peasant refers indiscriminately to the whole land he occupies for the time being whether as private property under recent legisla tion to the land held in common by the village which is therefore only in the temporary posses sion of each household or even to the land rented by the village from neighbouring landlords here we see once more the fact of nvorking the land identified with rights of ownershipwhen serfdomwasintroduced and onehalf ofthe arable land with the twentythree millions of human beings who lived thereon gradually became the property of the nobility the formerly free peasants could more easily understand the fact of their slavery than the law which appropriated the land to others than those by whom it was tilled  we are yours they said to their masters but the land is ours  my vashi zemlia nasha the stereotyped hundredtimes quoted phrase vividly sums up the russian peasants conception of serfdomwhen after so many years of expectation disappointments and delusive hopes the day of longedfor emancipation came for the dowvn trodden serfstheideaofthe impendingenfranchise ment assumed in the rural mind only one and the same shape through all the empirethat when once restored to freedom they would not be despoiled of that which they had possessed as slavestheir land the universal expectation as proved by the universal disappointnment was that the freed neasants would have all the land which they haa previously illed as to the nobles their former masters the czar would keep them they thought henceforward  on salary as he keeps his generals this was the ingenuous and naive expression of a very clear and practi cal ideathat of the state buying out the land lords by means of a vast financial operation this was precisely the measure advocated by tchernyshevszy and the contemporary party as the best and most convenient solution of the russian agrarian problemthe government as might well be expected was loth to adopt a course which seemed so hazardous and new fortunately for itself it did not follow the opposite course wllich wvould have been the signal for a tremendous popular rising the enfranchisement of the peasants without any land at all as suggested by the reactionary anti abolitionist party the freed peasants were endowed with small parcels of landcarved out of the estatesof their masters who retained however the greater part of their properties the government idea was to reep up the system of great landlords while creatin around them a class of occupying owners this may have seemed a fair com promnise but unfortunately it was not so in the preamble of the emancipation act the intention of the government was clearly defined  to pro vide the peasants it ran  with means to satisfy their needs and enable them to meet their obliga tions to the state payment of taxes the peasants will receive in permanent possession allotments of arable land and other appendages as shall be determined by the act jience a small proprietor according to the governments own definition is a husbandman having a piece of land on which he cani live however poorly and pay his taxesa definition which economists will readily accept a peasanti in this position is indeed a regular  small proprietor or occupy ing owner if however a man possess a patch of land of a few square yards on which he can grow a bushel of potatoes he is a  proprietor  all the sainembut onlyfrom a juridical point of view in theeyes of an economist he is a pure pro letarian amenable to the economical laws regula ting the conditions of this and not the other lassn ovwto ivhich of these two categories do the enfranchised russian peasants belong  certainly not to that of small proprietors as the term is ordinarily understood neither are they pure proletarians they partake of both characters in what proportion we shall see further on let it here suffice to say that the land was so parsi moniously apportioned that the enfranchised peasants were utterly unable to provide them selves with the first necessaries of life w ith few exceptions the bulk of our peasantry are com pelled to look to wage labour mostly agricultural on their former masters estates as an essentialotten the chief source of their livelihood thus the act of emancipation did not as its promoters intended create side by side smail and large land owners who could live and labour and thrive inde pendentlywithout obstructing and damaging each others work tho peasants were notindependent of the landlords the landlords were not inde pendent of the peasants there existed in russia at the time of the emancipation no agrarian pro letariat whatever the landlords could nowhere find regular wage labourers with whom they might replace their enfranchised serfs the cultivation of the landlords vast estates had either to be en tirely dropped or their serfs compelled totill them for hirethis was the new principle on which russian rural economy had thenceforward to be based it was decidedly opposed to our national and in veterate traditions as i have just shown it was borrowed from western countries i do not say that it was not better than serfdom it certainly was better neither do i afirm that those who introduced it had the slightest suspicion of the havoc which in one generation it was destined to produce iam simply stating a sad but undeniable fact in eocial and political life as well as in the domain of art and fiction imitations seem always to bear the same original sin while reproducing with great fidelity the drawbacks imitators ignore and forget the merits of their exemplars thus the capitalist order came to us without any of the free elements of polity which were its outcome in the countries of its birth all the advantages in the impending struggle were therefore on oine side the masse s were left npith no means of defence and the government threw the enormious weight of its material andl political power into the scale of wealth and against labour the victory of the proteoted few over te he peasmanywasthenceforth assured it was also complete and fright fullyr rapidin folowing letters i propose to describe the ways and means whereby this victory has been gained and the consequences which it has entailed as yet rusia is an enormous albeit a comparatively simple economical organism through tho pzzling and disorderly cornprication of private economical operations we shall discover a striking unity of cause it is an enormous economical mechanism combined on one principle and baving one consistent end i shall begin by describing its central organs those which impart movement and life to the whole tho banking and credit system movements of money and the rest
