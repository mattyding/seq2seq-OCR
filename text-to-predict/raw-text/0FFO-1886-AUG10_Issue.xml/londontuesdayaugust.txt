london t usda z august  the iiots in belfast whatever may have been thoir origin have risen almost to the height of civil war it is imperative upon tho govornment at once to use au tho power at the disposal of the iprown to restore order and to enforce obedience to legal authority sir mxciarl iiicasbeacm has shown no reluctance to deal vigorously and firmly with anarchical violence it is something pore than ridiculous to blame the new cnixr szcrctaiy becausehe has not been ablewithi a few aours to obliterate the effects of a longcontinued courso of demoralizing policy the time has cpme however for instant and energetic action it is im possiblo to allow one of tho prineipal contres of commercial and industrial activity in the united ingdom to lie at the mercy of raging mobs maddened by hereditary feuds of race and creed eand oneuraged or provoked to defy the supromacy of the law the case is one demanding the immediate exertion of all the strongth of the executive power with as stern a voice as if the sitandard of rebellion were openly raised or a foreign invasion were threatened sin ficnael flicksbeacn must know that it is his duty to put down the disturbances in belfist if in doing so he had to give marching orders to every available regiment in the qufnes army the disloyal classes in ireland will understand that they have no indulgence to expect when they see the unruly protestantismn of the lnorth promptly and firmly compelled to abstain from violence and to respect the authorities set over them if a conservative maiister wero to shov weakness in suoh a situation it would be all over with govern ment in ireland the formidable character of the rioting which ib believed to havef resulted since saturday last in the death of at least a doen per

convinced that there have been faults on all sides neither the executive government hor the stipendiary magistrates nor the local magistrates nor the poliee nor the rival mobs protestant and catholic nor the influential citizens of the town can be held blameless the facts if we look at results alone and do not pretend for the moment to disen tangle the originating causes show that there is urgent need for the interposition of a powerful and impartial authority on the face of affairs howevor the heavier share of responsi bility must fall immediately upon the protestant masses they may be able to plead provocation  they may have had reason heretofore to regard the proeeedings of the police and the interferonce ot the executive with angry suspicion but they belong as they are proud to affirm to the party of loyalty and law  they boast of their attachment to the crown and their fidelity to the english connexion they aro in thle majority and have no reason to fear the fanaticism evon when mosb violently displayed of the local roman catholics moreover thev are at this moment politically triumphant tho danger of homo rulo which would have subjected the protestants of ulster to the domination of a government in the hands of mim pahnell and ancbiisnop wasn has passed away there can be no longer any mistake about the feeling of the ulster protestants apd in theso circumstances it is clear that their strength is to sit stillparty passions nevertheless havo gainred such an ascendency that belfast is swept day after day by storms ofmob fury which challenge compariron with the most heartrending incidents of oivil war this grievous waste of courage of fighting force of blood and even of life must be stopped with the strong hand wo are convinced smr m acael iensbaou will not shrink from any measures that may be necessary to bring home to the minds of tho rioters the knowledge that tho law stands above and apart from all parties and niust be enforced at xwhatever cost even

principal officers in command havo beehi commis sioned as special magistrates which will cnablo them to uso the soldiery not only in clearing the streets and dispersing tho crowds but in arresting tao

the frietiox was increased by the stspicions that had been for a long time gathering around the new egiime in dublin castle the police and tho stipendiary magistratea who were sent to belfast were tainted with the unpopularity of the authors of theo hoine rule scheme and without raising questions of controversy at the present moment it seems clear that the measures at first adbpted for dispersing the nmob and preventing collisions were in many respects open to criticism not only was the jurisdiction of the local magistracy superseded at a time when the rioting had not assumod serious proportions but a special inquiry overriding the ordinary courso oflaw was ordered fram the scope of whichhow ever the conduct of the police was excluded owing to these mistakes the niatter
