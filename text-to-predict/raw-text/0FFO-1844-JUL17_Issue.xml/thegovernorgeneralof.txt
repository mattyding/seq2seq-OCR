masters gmudance but a young parlia ment is of exactly an opposue nature it exhibits all its docilty and if ever is without trick and vice in its early years then is the golden age the surnia regm in which ministers of state so much elight analyze the thin as the result of our own observation we should say that for the two first eara after a general election the majority of the house of commons are as submissive as as many negroes and coolips to the voice of their leader they seem for such a period to be totally dependent upon him to hve only to do his will and for sueh a portion of the loaves and fishes as he may choose to cast among them in the third year however they evince symptoms of a more refractory and ungovernable spirit many of them by this time have met with either political or personal dis appointments at the hands of the minister with regard to the one point they have fouad out that the imaginary god of their devotions was only a fallible wan ikc themselves with reference to the other either they have been able to get nothing in the general scramble or nothing equal to their hopes and expectations murmurs of discontent therefore begin to be heard on the benches where all was peace and acquiescence before measures which a year ago would have been passed with acdamation now proceed sub sienao or it may be are questioned epposed thrown out in short the session now expiring being the third years session of the present parliament will thoroughly illustrate our opinions of the doings of a house of commnons in this era of its existence but let us proceed the dificulties of a third year to a minister are awfully enhanced when a fourth year comes visions of the future as well as thoughts of the present and the pas then begin to flit before the minds of members of parliament they have lived two years for the minister and one for themselves they must now look to their responsi bility to those horrid monstrous nuisances the electors and the people at large in a fourth session then pa triots increase in untold numbers in the house of commons they are as thick as blackberries on a hedge the wishes of the people are taken into consideration ministers are snubbed and thwarted by the very drudgas on the treasury benches a fdth years parhament becomes more desperately liberal still a sixth years even more outrageous in its bids for popularity and thus the thing goes on increasing so in its ratio that if not saved by a dissolution from its legislative attempts there is small doubt that a house of commons al lowed to die a natural deatb would play such antics in the last moments of its seventh year that it would give if the peopled wished it anew ministry and a new reform bill twice a week set up a model republic or nernetrate

the bay on monday is almost unprecedented yesterday in our necessarily hurried and imperfect notice of the accident we mentioned that mr bennett not bentley as before stated the father of the two girls who gerished along with the young gentleman whose name is mr henry rawliags his nephew was absent from dover at the time of the accident mr bennett comes from frome in somersetehire where we understand he carries on the business of a woollencloth manufacturer and has also a warehouse in the borough he came to dover with his family for the benefit of their health only about a week since he had gone to folkestone and hythe yesterday morning and did not return till halfpast  oclock when he became acquainted with his sad loss mrs bennett who narrowly escaped with her life was so far recovered by about  oclock last night as to admit of her being re moved in a carriage from the bathingrooms on the beach to her lodgings at no  strandstreet uo to that tiue abe bad not been informed of the fate of her two daugters mid the young gentleman she is now aware of it an hbears the bereavement with christian fortitude last night and this morning bouts have been employed in dragging the bay in search of the bodies but up to  pm none of them bad been found the boat in which the par ties embarked as we mentioned yesterday was a small punt and not one of our regular pleasre boats which are large wieufouna ad manned by experienced licensed boatmen it is only justice to the owners and crews of these vessels to state that not a bingle accident has occurred to them for many years the mend fox and newsome who had charge of the boat are not licensed boatmen though they have been in the habit of taking off pleasure parties for some time back and we trust a strict investigation wiul be instituted as to the cause of the accident and also with the view of preventiag incompetent persons or unsafe boats from being employed in future to the endangerment of the lives of her majestys subjects the illfated craft was onlv about  feet long and of a class not adapted to carry saal at the time of t e accident we understand mr rawlings was steer ing the boat and in  wearing or  jibbing her a squall caught the sail and before the sheet could be let go upset the boat one of the bodiea that of the youngest girl has just been found  oclock pmasmlays apmtrnartrto turn the old fashioned
