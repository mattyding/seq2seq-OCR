the defendantsthe trial of the case occupied several hoursit appeared by the evidence that the defendant who is a shoemaker and his wife had lived in lodgings at the baths in gocesterstreet hackneyfields and that in conseguence of information which had been received by the pansh au thorities an officer of the parish was sent to their residence upon his arrival he found after mounting a ladder to a plat form about  feet from the ground that they had a child locked up in a loft and upon the mother calling her the daughter in question came towards them in a state of nakedness the only thing upon her person being a smau bit of rag which hadbeen tiedround one of her feet in consequence of the foot being in a state of ulceration the child appeared to be in a state of the utmost exhaustion from disease it vas almost in the lat stage of emaciation and upon a subsequent examination of the child it was discovered that te toes of one foot had au been amputated whilst two had been removed from the other the foot which was toe less was that which was in an ulcerated condition on ex amining the loft wherein the child vas found a bed with scarcely any covering was discovered in a corner and by it a bar of cold boiled peas the child as well as being naked was in a most filthy state with her skin shri relled and appeared to be almost starved to deatb upon being questioafd as to why they had so treated their child the defendants said that the child was so dirty in her habits that they could do nothing with her the offi cer admitted that the defendant had behaved with the greatest civility to him and in his crossexamination he stated that the mother had spoken with kindness to the chil l that the defendants had informed him that the child had had the erysipelas in her toes that it had been found necessary to send it upon more than one occasion to the hos pital where the various toes had been amputated that they most readily and freely answered every question wvhich was put to them by him and that they had punctually kept their promises to attend at the workhouse whither the child was cnveyed and afterwards at the policecourt he fur ther saidthat there had not been any marks of bodily punish xent discovered upon the eubsequent examination of her person a witness of the name of johnson stated that ho had given the information to the parish in consequence of a conversation which had passed between the defendants and himself in the course of which he discovered that they had one child who the mother said was given to dirty habits and had very bad health and was diseased the female defendant vroceedin to add that she couli not bear the sight of�it whilstthe father aid that he wished the child were dead this statement accompaslied with these expressions created a suspicion in his nmind as to their motives regarding the child because a coroners inquest had somte time before sat upon another of their children who had died from the efeects of poison this was afterwards ex plained when it appeared that the child had been onlvthree i months old and that too strong a dose of medicne had beeneluumswstrece to ir in consequence of the doctor havin put a wrong label upon the medicine aud the jury therefore ta turned a verdict of  died by misadventure whilst a third child had died of consamption the landlady of the defend axits mext stated that they had come to reside at her house aboub the month of october at which period they had two children one of whom had died shortly after upon this child it wvas that the inquest had sat the child

upon her imprper food as wells scarcity of food would have a tendency to bring on diarrlcea and prolapsw ast upon a consideration of this childs case be was of opinion that her we aess and

by her parents would add considerably to such a disease the child was novw however much bettermr payri on behalf of the defendahts made a very powerful and feeling appeal to the jury pntting it to them whether it was probable that any parents were likely to have treated their offspring i the way vwhich had been described by the witnesses uho had been examined on that occasion no doubt this was a very proper case for the parish to institute inuiryq into because beyond all doubt he was bound to admit that upon the first representation of the matr it did appear to be one of very great suspicion he would however submnit that upon the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution itself it had been clearlyproved that this unfortunate child was afflictei with habits of dir tiness which required a different course of treatment than that which wfould be adopted under other and different cir cunstances he submilted that there had not been any cruelty made out that there was no evidence of any beating as set out in one of the counts of the indictmqnt and that any little severity which might have been manifested towards theychild had been induced by and used with the hope of curingtbe dirty habits to which the poor child was addietedvaqieclear tsnere was no proof of an assult iess th act of throwing the child into the bath to cleanse it could be denominated as an asault the jury would observe that by the fifst count the defend ants were charged with having  oiltted to provide sufficient food and with having neglected the child whereby she had become emaciated and weak  and by the second couxt that they had violently and cruelly beaten the child upon various occasion and had confined it without sufficient food for  hours at a time he submitted that under an circumstances there was no proof of violent beatingthe cnairmvax having summed upthe jury returned a verdict of guilty upon both counts except that rlrt of the second which charged the violent the coaman in passing sentence upon the defendants told them it was their imperative duty as parents to provide a sufficiency of fgod indeed to provide in every way for their unfortunately afflicted cbild and the obligation was the greater in consequence of her afflictions the court therefore with a view of marking its condemnation of the conduct of the defendants would pass a severe sentence upon themnamely that they be imprisoned six months each in the house ot correctionfthe peotrchild wals in court and prested the appearance of a reating keleon ith he ecepton tat its bones were covered with
