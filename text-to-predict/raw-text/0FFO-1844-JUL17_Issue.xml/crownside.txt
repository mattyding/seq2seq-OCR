  crown sdellejove mr baron paraaphis lordsurp in charging the grand jury said he was sorry to observe that notwithstanding the numerous gaol deveries in the county and the operation of the central crminal court there were so many prisoners for trial at the present assizes and till nmore to see the maguitude of the offenes with whih s great many of them were charged there were several cases affecting the lives of the accused and but for the recent alterations in the law and the auie lioraton of the punishment formerly inflicted many others would havc been in the aame position the most serious case appeared to be a charge of child murder and in this case it appeared by the depositions that the usual difficulty in cases of this desenption viz vhether the infant was born alive or not would not arise inasmuch as it would be showvn that it was three weeks old at the time it was destroyed and he apprehended that if the facts should be proved as they appeared upon the depositions it would be their painful duty to find a bil for the murder there was another revolting case in which a father was accused of a felonious assault upon his own child and it was alleged that the offence had been committed while his daughter was under ten years otage which if made out amounted to felony even if the jury should believe that the child was a consenting party this said the learned judge was the most shocking case he had heard of during the period he had been connected with the administration of the criminal justice of the country but it would be the duty of the grand jury to take the acts dispassionately into their consideration and see whether there was sufficent evidence to warrant them in retarning a bill either for felony or misdemeanour he regretted to see on the calen dar that there were maany instances of an offence which was very common both in that and the adioinlng county the desaruction of corn and other agricultura produce by incendiarism but it was satisfactory to find that in nearly all the cases theparties accused were not labourera who were alleged to be dissatitied with their employers or with any particular law but were children of teuder age in one case the accused not being more than eight years old the law did not hold any one criminaluy respon sible for his acts who was under seven years of age and perhaps in some of the cases the grand jury migit be induced to consider that the age of the accuse vwas so near that fixed by the law as not rendering him responsible that they would pause before they found a bill although he must admit that the depositions showed the accused to have admitted that they were aware they were doing a wicked action but at the same time without any apparent motive thelearned judge stated thst it was not necesay to prove any malice or illwill against the owner of the property this having been specially provided for by the statute and all they would have to consider was whether at the time the offencewas alleged to have been committed the party accused ws i aware that he was committing an illegal and wicked act to the prejudice of another in one of the cases it did not clearly alipear that the stack was actually ignited and on that the jury would not find a bill for felony but must return one for niisderaeanour for the attempt to commit the offencethe jury then retired  there were no cases of interest tried during the da
