la w reportcourt of chancery tuesday juy in ble dyco sombrelunacymlr thomas wzndt resnuned his reply in support of this petition for setting aside the commission and continued bis argunent that the delusions under which mr dyce sombre was adeged to laboar even if true were no evidence of his insanity he contended that the world had never been and never would be wholly dispossessed of the inueance of an perstition and instanced the cases within our own time of mr irvine who professed to be able to converse in an un known tongue and of nathaniel brasey haslett the secre ary of mr william jones who made a most eloquent speech in the house of commons in favour of a madman of the name of brothers dr euiotson with his ideau respecting mesmerism was in his opinion quite as insane as mr dyce sombrethe load chancelloi dont think he would ever send you to sleep sir thomas wildesir thomas wildlthere was also the beliefrespecting auguries whieh still raged to a great extent in the east but the real question was had mr dyce sombre been en axiuned by a my competent to judge of his conduct i one of the delusions urged against him was that mr dyce sombre had been guilty of infidelity with a servant who confessed it to him by standing on a step lower thaa himself and sgain that mrn dyce sombre had confessed her incontinence to him by sins which he could not misunderstand  now the signs themselves were not aet forth and it surely was requisite before deciding that a man who came from a country so strongly imbaed witb superstition was insane narrowly to watch his actions he would therefore invite his lodships attention to mr dycesombres conduct previous to his marriage from that time to the issuing of the commission thece to his escape ad lastly his behaviour in paris with respect to his con duct before marriage there were the affidavits of the rev mr farr and lord oombermere mr farr stated that he had known mr dyce sombre in india and saw him shortly after his anrival in england that his feel ings and notions were asiatic to an extraordinary de gree mr dyce sombre told him of his intention to marry misa jervis provided she would live with him as his wife in the eastern manner he subsequently informed him that he had had a conversation with lord st vincent respecting his future wife living according to the asiatic faehon and also about a settlement and asked him to take a chaltlenge to lord st vincent and lastly deposed that he considered that mr dyce sombres inatelect manners conduct and ideas were the same now as they everhad been purely asiatic lord combermere also spoke to the same effect saying that he had known him for s   yesa that he was threefourths an asiatic his fiather having been a halfcaste and his mother a native asad that his education had made no difference in his feeings  and yet his lordship was asked to believe that this man was an european although brought up in the court of a native princess from his infancy the impressions refpectinz superatition if imbibed in youth were vry rarely eradicated and except the short time when he was with mr fisher his education was entirely asiatic if therefore you judge his delusions by an asiatic standard there was nothing par ticular in them but if measured by an euronean one then the case would be altogether different imr dyce sombres conduct throughout had been bzad fide he had never dis guised any of his failinas andwhen he found that his notionm did not accord with those of his intended wife he broke off the match ought he therefore to be measured by sucb an unjust standard as that by which his odponents wished hih to be tried  lord combermere when dics tion of mr dyce sombrea marriage kn h uestionhe was impressed with eastern notions stated his belief to be that he would be totauy unfit to live for any length of time with a wife unles she conformed her self to the habits and usages of the indian law the learned gentleman then proceeded to read extractsfrom the anstitutes of menau to illustrate what were the in terpretations put upon somte of the acts of married women according to that law if a man only walked or talked with a married woman in a forest or a grove he incurred the guilt of an adulterous intercourse so if he sat upon the same sofa with her or even exchanged the ordinary prac tices of civility was it therefore so wonderful that mr dyee sombre coming from a country where the law was such if he had heard that his wvife had only met a man in hydepark should infer that she had been guilty of an adulterous intercourse  mrs dyce sombre might very inno cently indeed from her fashionable manners commit some acts which might induce mr dvye sombre to believe that she had perpatrated a criminal familiarity the great evil was not that mr dyce sombre was insane but that he had brought frora india notions respecting womnen which were totally inadpliceble to this country he had applied his eatern tess to english women if therefore his lady did that in this country which in the one he came from woald be conclusive eyidence of gnilt what reason was there to say that he was mad  now all his notions had been communicated to lord st vincent before the marriare by lord combermere  it was only therefore a morbid feeling of jealounsv on the part of mr dyce sombremorbid so far as regarded english ladies for it was clear that if asiatic ladies brought uap in the way that they were and looked upon almost in the mere light of instruments for sexual intercourse were to act ia thefree and unrestricted ranner that english ladies did thev wouldact from very different motives and under verydiffirent feelings in the one it would be perfectly iancent and in the other ial pably criminal all this being well known to lord st vin cents familv before the mrriage it was now rather too late to comne ani complain of it and say that mr dyce sombre was insane mlis jervisa on her matti wita ur ilyce somtbre took hiua with al his faults lhe came now to what took place after the marriage up to the period of bmr dyce sombres restraint there vas an account of hisirritable conduct and violent jealousy but could that iustify his beingt  a c lssmr jr wlyaesopinion was that nothing could justify such a measure except antidipated danger in the ecclesiastical courtsalthoughabusband might be very severe very captious and even very crael those facts were never considered evidence of his being mad lord fer rers although a mnan so violent that he was willing to run anybazard to gratify his inclination was never supposed to he insane it was no proof of a maus insanity to say that he treated his wife cruelly but in this case the instances of vio lence if they occurred exactly as stated were positively nothing in short there was no statement which could at all be construed into violence previous to the time of his being placed under restraint mrs dyce sombre cercainly deposed that the day previous to his confinement he took up a knife from the breakfasttable and said hre would cut off her nose but upon her threateningto ring the bell for the servants he put it down now did this look like the whole of the account of the transaction  for if he was rane enough to know the effect of the servants comine up surely he was sane when he took up the knife the learned gentleman then complained that the affidavits asainst the petition were filed so late that it was impossible to answer themthe lord cinancellorif you had re uired time to answer them you could have had it by applying to mesir toxoas wildethe delay which had already oc curred in the hearinz of the case had been so great that it would have been highly prejudicial to postpone it any lonizerthe lobd c canoellori think sir thomas wilde that it is a much more important consideration that alrs dyce sombre in her affidavit states acts and converation wrbich took place between herself and husband alone and which therefore he cannot answer or explainsir tiosras wrideit is mylord very important well mrs dyee sombre again says that her husband was very violent while at worthing but the clue to that was he thoueit very palpable they went to worthing after lr vyce sombre returned from sudbury and lord comber mere stated in hi affidavit that previous to going there mr dyce sombre told him that he did not think it right that his vife shoula go out during his absence hut she had said that she should this might therefore very feasibly account for this alleged violenice after his return being no more than his asiatic notions of female propriety ile would return to the violence of the day on which be was put into confinement oa that occasion mr rickettsand mliss parker were in the next room and their evidence to bear out mra dyce sombres account was that she told miiss parker that mr dyco som bre pursued her round the room with the knife but all that she herself heard mrs dyce sombre saying was if you do not put down the knife i will ring the bell for the servants  but the best way to judge of what the parties thought about this wonderful af fair was their own conduct upon it did either of them run to assist mrs dyne sombre when in this great danger uo and mrs dyce sombre herself could not at any time have thought herself in very great personal danger or she would have instantly gone home to her father and again he looked in vain for any affidavits from persons who were living at the clarendon during the time that mr and mrs dyce sombre resided there and when these alleged acts of violence took place it therefore was ridiculous to say that mr dyce sombres conduct excited any apprehension of personal danger ihis belief was that mrs dyne sombre was induced by the representations of the medical men to place mr dyne sombre under restraint for the only two acts that are mentioned in the affidavits of alleged personal danger are the one already mentioned and again when mr dye sombre threatened to shoot his wife with a pistol  but brs dyce sombres conduct even then and now proves in contestably that she was in no personal dangermr krllyshe swears that she was in constant appre hension of personal danger and had a valet to stand at the door when with her husbandsir t wiadndid she not sleep with him every nigtb it is obvious that there is absence of anything like a belief that he wap a dangerous lunaticmr befoell said that dr munro sent a keeper into thehouse before the inquiry wvas institutedsir t wlde rea the affidsvit stating such a factmr bethellthe affidavit of mfrs dyce sombre says she believes he did sosir t wsidebut where is the affidavit of dr unro to that effect  the mere belief of mrs dyce sombre was not to be taken as conclusive in the absence of an affidavit from dr munro the difficulty was felt of the absence of anything like violence previous to the restraint they wished is lordship to infer that dr munro had sent in a keeper this was an attempt now to ascribe danger to acts of imr dyne sombre which at the time they lid ot believe to be dangerons their own conduct proved that they did not believe them to be danzerous particularly that of mirs dyce sornbe there was therefore nothing to jus tify mr dyne sombres being put under restraint he was how ever placed in confinement and his lordship might wellimaginle what were his feelings in such a positionwithout any occupation believing that he had been confined at the instance of the east india company and wsith such passions as a person born in the wrarm climate that mr dyne ombre wats wv not such a restraint quite enough to produce a morbid sensation in his mind wellhe wast kept there till september and then came the in quisition hie would beg particular

anart from the delusions re specting his wife the resoen alleged to mr dyce sombre when be applied for these papers the day before the inquiry ws that they wnere immaterial now he sirt wude would contend that they were most material for the two letters that he bad beenr able to recover namely the one of lady inarcus hill and c r dce sombre herself proved that beyond a doubt coulrd mr dyce

partiea were ocupied before the in quiry were they occupied boin s de looking only to the comfort of mr dyce sombre or where they acting fromselfta motives with a view t the obtaining of  e ayear for

jury were induced to come to the decision they did at any rate it was cera n that even in the present argument there sad been much more skll used to prove that certain delusions existed in mr dyce sombres mind than that those delusionshere dangerous thegrounds however ef mr dyce sombres insanity as found by the report of the commission were thaat he bielieved he was visited byspirits and affected with un founded delusions respecting his wifes infidelity with re spect to mr dyce sombres belief in apparitions he did not know that it followed as a mnatter of course thlat because an east indian believed in such visitations he must he mad more esdecially considering the faith put in incanta tions and various ether superstitionqi in that country he had never heard lord lyttelton called mad because he be livdi prits the belief too was very prevalent even at llvdithe presenpt day in this country and there were very few persous buit what could nuinbpr amongst their friends some one who hea such a belief it was a conviction that had existed at all times and in all countriesithe load cirancaaloai was never affected ink that waysir t wilde raid he did not tbink his lordship ate heartily enough at supper mnoreoverjhe had not the right sort of mind at any rate he could not see how the belief in pirits had anything to do with mr dyce sombres being a dangerous laatic or incompetent to manage his affairs there were numbers of persona who believed m such things whlo were ashamed to own it but at all events in such an inquiry evidence of the mans character education and con duct must be of the utmost imdortance in determiaing on hie state of mind it was therefore monstroue in mrs dyce sombre saying in one breath that she wished for the fullest inquiry and that she had no other object in view than her husbands comfort and happiness and at the same time asserting that the commission so conducted ought to be final there could be but little sincerity in her protestations with respect to mr dyce sombres conduct during his sojourn in paris if it had been necessary he would rest it entirely upon the letters written to him by mrs dyce sombre and hia two brothersinlaw mr solaroei and captar troup an i his answers thereto those letter coearly proved that they considered him not only perfectly sane and fully competent to manage his affairs but also that he was a man well acquainted with business the learned gentleman then read a niumber of letters from mr dyce sorbre which certainly were written in a rermarkably clear and perspicuous style and evinced a clear knowledge of mat ters of businessthe lord crametaior said that the letters showed that mr dyce sombre was well acquainted with the erglish lan gvage and even a businesslixe style they also indicated what state of mind he was in as the time they were writtensir tuomwas wilim then proceeded to read the answers of rs dyce sombre mr solarosi and captain troup which seemed to bear out the inference that they had also treated him as being sane le wrould then come to an affidavit of mrs dyca sombre to prove that she had no fear of danger from her husbands violence it was an affidavit made by her at a time she was seedinz to be appointed committee anud stated in answer to an objection that her appointment might irritate her husband that he had always shown the utmost fondness for her up to the day he was placed under restraint it was remarkable doingl everythinu he could for her comfort and putting aside every tlstngshe liked could that statement he asked be reconciled with her wish no w to impress upon the court that he i had acted with such violence to her that ahe was in positive danger by his being ahowed to remain at large  he now came to wbat took place in france mr frere went over there armed with everything necessary to prove mr dyce sombre a lunatic he applied to the prefect of the police who said that nothing could be donie without the sanction of the minister of the interior it was then determined that an inquiry should be had before physicians and mr frere after remaining in paria for almost a fortnigbt leaves the very day before the examination took placeaccording to his own showing because be believed that the physicians weuld decide in the way they did but did not go on to sav as he sir t wilde believed was the truth that from his own inquiry he was convinced of the sanity of mr dyce sombre and yet they wvre told this inquiry was to go for nothing because the proper information respectin mr dyce sombre was not laid before the physicians and all because mr frere the adviser of mrs dyce sombre thought fit to leave at the very time when if there was any truth in the insinuations of his learned friends he ought not to have done so for he was the very person of all others who could have given the best information to the french physicians bat at any rate they had some little clue to guide them in their inquiry for sir j clark wrote to dr chermaide sug gesting the style of examinationthe lord citkncrlloni think the criticisms of mr bthell upon that report are well worthy of consideration i sulppose you intend to comment upon themsir t wmdsundoubtely be should presently the learned gentleman then argned that there was not sufficient evideneto prove that mr dyce sombre ever intended that such inference should jbe drawn from his statemeats of his jbj  z uutu uone ny tne various persons who had deposed to thema in the affidavits at the sametime he had no hesitation in stating his belief that some thing occurred which to his jealous and perverse mind led him to form an asiatic notion of her unchastity she coulddo hardly anythinghardly hold a conversation or lock at i any one without exciting his indian iealousv she must have been a daily blister to him but it wsas the same before mar riage and ought not therefore to be now called madness wvith respect to the delusion upon which so much stress had been laid that many pecra had offered him their wives why if he had only shaken hands with them that was ac cording to his indian notions allowing them to act in such a way as would lead him to infer the worat criminalitythe lord cilancelloryou forget that there waspostseriptto the end of the paragraph you have been quoting which states that he believed the queen had oflered him a peerago to bush it upsir t wvilde argued that the whole context could not have been given and that it was difficult to accouant for an isolated portion of a conversation without having the whole before themnin all probability mdr dyes sombre never meant such an interpretation to be put upon his wordsat this staze of the learned couisels address his lord ship adjourned the further hearing of the case until to morrow
