buildings billmittthe earloif lilcon moved that the house go into commr hawes said that a paper had been laid on the table that morning containing more than a hundred alterations xhich were to be proposed now he must protest against being called on to decide on aul these alterations until he had heard soraething by wvay of explanation of those amendmuentsfhe did not get a satisfactory explanation he rwould oppose the bill in all its details and move the  previous questhe earl of lincoln said that a more unfair ground of objection he had seldom seen for nearly the vwhole of the alterations wrere merely verbal alterations not at all affecting the principle of the measure and let him add that he had econtrary to the general practicc on such vccaaions printed thevwhole of them for the information of hon niembers the hon member for lambeth had no later than last night informed him of his intention to move a variety of amend ments to this bill but he had not informed him of the nature of even one of them he regretted the opposition of the hoti member but he should proceed with the billlmr hawe contended that many of the noble lords pro posed alterations were substantial and grave and wrould reqmire mature deliberation he looked upon the bill as a complete warfare upon the wrhole trade of the metropbolis inasmuch as it interfered writh every kind of building great or small and if the bill had been in force at the time wrhen those great undertakings the docks and railwray sheds termini and bridges were erected they could not have been built under a heavy penaltv unless the permission of the comnmissioners of lyood and t rests wrere airst obtained if anyperson used any such building or bridge by waking over it he wrould be sub ject to a penalty of  and any such building bridge dock warehouse or abed having been built without such permis sion prenously obtained would be deemed a nuisance which the tommissioners of woods and forests wrould have powuer to abate by pulling dowfn another provision of the bill imposed a penalty of ss on any man employed in the erec tion of such buildings on all these grounds he should movete previous question as an amendment to the motion for going into committeemr hiackinnon supported the amendment and cor tended that though the bill contained many good poinab it was in many others of its provisions directly the reverse of the recommendations of the committee from wrhich it pro fessedly emanlatedthe earl of lincoln said that the oppasition of the mover and seconder of the amendment formed an apt illus tration of the remark that extremes meet the one hon member objected to the bill because as he said it wrent teo far and actuauly made wrar on the trade of the metropolis while his seconder complained that it did not go far enougvh and did not carry out some of the most useful recom mendations ot the comamittee the noble lord went on to howvthat every practicable means had been adopted in the bill fer promoting the cleanliness and of course the health of the metropolis ant that it interfered not wfith any private intezest further than was neces sary for the protection of the public the hon mem ber for lambeth complained of what he termed the ridicu lous minuteness of the bill no doubt the hon memsber wvas a great critic in his wray but there wras no style of phrase ology wvould please him as long as it emanated from the go vernment if the details of the bill were so plain as that all wsho ran might readashe contendedw as the case writh this bill still there would he no pleasiag him as long as the details wrere those of the government and of course they must be wvrong the hon member had not proved any one of his objections his wras simple allegation and no more hxe objected to having many pubhic buildingrs sulch as the theatres included in the bill but did he recollect that a theatre had tumbled down occasioning the death of sowme eight or nine individualsl hhad a pdroper survey by competent architects been made that accident could never have happened nor could the acd dent at the termninus of the railwfay ac the bricklayers arms have occurred had such a bill as this been in operation as to the queshion of patronage which had been created by the bilï¿½ he defied the hon member to bring in such a bill witn fewver appointments te carry it out tlhere were two referees who must be architects a registrar and a clerk which wlere not onefourth the number of persons who had been considered by many to be necessary for carry ing out the bill with respect to many minor objetions urged by the hon member he would decline any notice of them until they went into committee wrhich was the proper placee for their discussionmr tufnell objected to the bill on the ground that it w as an unwfarrantable because an unnecessary interferencerdthpriv tail poet he also objected to a bill containinag suhvarious detal being brought in at this period of the sessionthe house then divided when the numbers wferefor the original motion    for the amendment   miajority    sthe house then resolved itself into committee on the bil a number of the clauses were agreed to

in the eveningthe house then adjourned till halfpast  oclock the house resumed at halfpast  oclockcustomhouse fraudsthe chancellor of the exchequer laid on the table of the house the report of the commissioner of in quiry into the customhouse frauds and moved that it be printedmr t dui combe said there was no evidence attached to that report  he did not see why they should not have all the evidence thrat had been given before the commissoners printed and laid before the house for without it they coulcl not tell whether the report was well founded if the right hon gentleman thouht that the evidence was of a libelous nature and calcvilate to injure individual parties its circu lation might be confined to the members of the houmsethe chancellor of the exchequer thought it woul be ettr tht te evdene shuldbe accessible to thedreb his motion for rting the reportdr heathdote presented a petition from the attor neya of tiverton against the poor law amendment billthe revolt in dominicamr eawin wished to kiow whether the noble lord tiefcretery of state for the colonies had reoeived any acounts from dominica and whether he sould inform the house of the present state of the island i he understood that mar tl law had been proolaimed and that violent proceedin and a great deal of insubordination kad taken plice his in formant had told him that more than  of the insurents had been arrested that several maurdes had been committed and that one mans head had been severed from his body and raiised on a high pole at the meeting of three roads it appeared that these disturbances had aren in consequence of the authorities of the island not having taken the proper precautions to inform the people of the nature and object of the census which was bemg taken the people had mis tmderstood its object and thought that it had something to do with the restoration of slavery be also waihed to ask the noble lord whether lord j russels desatch of  exempting bible teachers in the qwest indies from serving in the militua sill remained in forcei and whether under or dinay circumstances those teachers would be expected to servein the mlitial course on extraordinary occasions they would serve but he wished to ascertain whether the rule laid down by lord j russell still existedlord stanley said that according to the sccounts he had received dated the d of june it appeared that dis turbances had broken out in the island of dominica in con sequence of an absurd impresion prevailing that the object ofthe government in taking the census of the colony was preparatory to taking steps for restoring them to a condition af slavery the insurgents he understood were ehiefly led on by refugees from the french and other colonies and by those who were newly arrived from africa the revolt had been put down immediately in the neighbourhood of the capital but in some of the ditnt and inaccessible districts df the colony the disturbances had continued for four or five daye the governor had thought proper to prochim martil law but by the latest accounts that had n re ceived it appeared that the disturbances were completelyut down and that mnartialf awould soon cease in the espatch which he had that day sent out to the governor he bad expressed his regret at the disturbances having oc curred and stated that he considered there was no ground for demanding the trial of the insurgents by any extraorji nary tribunal all the wvomen and children who had been arrested would be released and the trial ef the other insur gents would be proceeded with not before any extraordinary tribunal but before the ordinary courts of lw he would state that he had no doubt judging from the last accounts that peace bad long before this time been restored in con sequence of the notice which the hon member for lanbeth had given him he had made inquiriea as to the despatch to wfhich the hon gentleman had referred and be found that lord j russell sent out a despatch in  but that it was applicable to the btle teachers of jamaica only thelespatch was not applicable to any other colony except ja mllaica and he had never heard of any reluctaune having been expreesed by the bible teachersain dominica to serve in the militiamr iawes said the information he had before him with reference to the last point differed from what had been stated by the noble lordthe slave tradelord palmerston saidin rising to makse the motierz of which i have given notice for returns connected with the slave trade i will make a few observations on the sub ject of the slave trade itself it is a subject of great im portance and one which is not new to this house for it hae during nearly half a century engaged the attention of par lament and the country au the most distiagaihed and eminentmen who have lived during that period whethei siting on this side or that side of the housewhether withim or without these walls have devoted their energies to put tingan eadto this abomainable traffic and they have so far suc ceeded as to reecue this country from the foul stain oi slavery and in consequence of the abandonment of tha trade the condition of slavery itself was abolished through out the british dominions i think it is well known that these great results were not ccomplihed without mueb labour and much lapse of tiiethe descent to evil is rapid and easy but the return to good is difficult and slow and if there le nations as there are who have imitated ow downward course and have not yet resolved to follcw ou upward footsteps we should look upon their error witb anoreindulgence by rememberingthe long and painful efforte which it cost us to wean ourselves from these pursuits but if on the other hand there are nations vho have contracted by treaty to cooperate with us in euppressing the slave trade i think we should not release them irom their engage ments although they may have been our former participa tors in crime many years have elapsed since these inves tigations took place which by laying bare in all their odioue deformity the diogusting facts connected with the prosecu tion of tae slave trade had induced the men of this country to determine that they would pursue that wicked traffic no longer the details are now well nigb forgotten although almost all men have a general no tion that the slave trade is a cruel thing and that it ie barbarous to force men by violence from their homes and families to transport them across the seas and to compel them to toil under the lash in a foreign chmate yet i be lievethere arefew who atthis time of day cangivethemselvee any conception of the intense degree and the extensive way in which the cruelties of the slave trade are carried on it ie difficult with any degree of certainty to calculate the num ber of negroes who only land on the isles and the continent of america for the purpose of being consigned to slavery the returns for which i am going to move will furnish some information but that information can only be given by our con sular agents in slave trade countries and by our naval officers the governments of those countries into which negroes are imported publish no accounts many of those governments are bouna b engagements and by treaties with us to pro hibit the slve trade amongst all their subjects and to punish those who contravene that prohibition by severe uprisonment the governments of pain and brazilhave no toriously set those engagements at nought they have sys tematically disregarded them and have permitted the laws which they have passed to be violated and even in some places have derivea a revenue from their violation hear hear our accounts therefore must in isome degree be conjectural but one thing alone is certainthat they must fall short in giving the numbers of slaves imported from africa now what are the sumbers which are calculated at this time to be annually imported to the isles and conti nent of america  mr bandinell in his able work on the subject compiled from official documents and containing condensed forms in a small compass of more valuable in formation than perhaps any other work of its size can affordmr bandinell a man of great industry andaccuracy ealculates the number of these only who have landed in america previous to the fewyears that have lately elapsed at from  to  and sir f baxton in his interesting and valuable work puts the numbers at  at least but which ever account we take whether we consider the annual importation of negroes to be  or  what an enormous amount of human misery and human crime is shown by this simple statement to exist hear hear let any man consider to himself what  people are let any man who has seen armies colected think if it hu ever fallen to his lot to see  men collected at once under his eyelet him imagine that he saw that num ber assembled together on a paimthat he was told as they passed by him that they were traveling fast towards their eoomt at that living mass of human beings was doomed to a painful and premature death under every variety of bodily and meatal torture  why sir if be were told that it was not a single sight but that every year over the same spot of ground an equal number were urged forward to the same melancholy doom i say could any man when he witnessed such a sight fail to invoke the vengeance of heaven on the authors of such enormities andwhat wouldbe the condemna tion he would pass on those who if they could have prevented it had neglected to employ the meaus of doing so  hear but any man who thinks that only  negroes are sacri fieed to the avarice and cruelty of meni will not call them christian menbelonging to christian nations is very far from the trath it is calculated that for every negro who nds two others have perished in the previous stages of the lave trade that whatsoever number may be landed that number must be multiplied by three before you can arrive at the full sacrifice of human lifeat the faul number of human persons who are annually swept away from the popu ation of africa it is well known that the negroes are net colected at the places where they embark  many of them come from a great distance in the interior of africamany hundred miles in the interior dovn to the sea coastsome of them are captives taken in warswars stimulated and brought on by the prospect of gain to be derived from the sale of the captives but the greater number are the victima of the system of manstealing which prevails in the interior of afriea the way it takes place is thiswhen the time of year comes round for sending a slave caravan to the coast some peaceable aficamn village whose unsuspecting in habitants are buried in that repose which nature kindll be stows on man to fit him for the useful occupations an the innocent engagements of the succeeding daysome african village in the dead of night is surrounded by armed ruffians the huts are set on fire the inhabitants roused from their sleep by the fiames in which they are enveloped endeavour to escape some attempt it by flight and some by resistance but all fail the fugitives are brought back and those who resisted are overpowered and made slaves some timesa ahillcraisers on the leasto give them gmaler gqotions less distaaces to sail overless ground to engage their attention why let it be remembered a great part ol the african coast is so studded with islands that a man ol war may go within half a mile of a slave vessl taking in slaves and never discover her position hear and then what do you do  why the slave trader the moment she escapes the watching squadron has a fair run for it and is in absolute security until she reaches her destination repeated cnee of hear hear let me ask too have her majestg government considered the diffculty which must armse from the confined geographical limits of the french treaty  south of the th degree of south latitude on the eastern coast and all along the western coast there is no right of search of the freuch flag if therefore you withdraw your cruisers on the coast of brazil and fail to obtain the ratification of the treaty of  which would give you the right of search where you have it not now there can be little doubt but that a great part of the slave trade of brazil will be carried on under the french flag and you will find it impossible to stop it or if you say you wil effect that object by french cruisers then i replythat in consequence of several circumstances i cau place less d ienence on the vigilance and activity of french cruisers than in the cruisers of our own nation cheers sir unless the right hon baro net goes into it i shau not discuss the project of putting down the slave trade by discouraging slavegrown sugar be cause i fear that if that is all that we have to dependon we have very little prospect of effieci much good eesr hear we have heard much lately of a cordial understand idga perfect agreementbetween england and france no man could rejoice more than i should at the establish ment of complete friendship good understanding and inti ate adiance between france and england i know welthat an alliance of that sort if properly conducted must be productive of the greatest advantages not only to those nations themselves but to the whole world but i must say with reference to the  good understanding established by the present government that up to this time the fruit bas ot been worthy of the tree heir the onl lm oortant result has been that pulsr right in spaifn haa bveen tramapled en ana that inltary doapotisui has

be greatly relieved when his dilemma was thub terminated for notwithstanding the perseverance with which he constantly renewed the notice of his motion he had the good sense to abstn from bringing it forward at last though unwillng to lose the speech which he had pre pared for the occasion the noble lord in my opinion pur sued a much wiser course by not provoking the opinion of the house on a question raised by himself with respect to the royal prerogative and the consequence was that we have now reaped au the advantages which we should then have derived from litening to the noble lord i shall in dealing with this question separate the useful topics of the noble lords speeeh from those parts of it in which he has indulged in reflections on her majebtys government for i hold it to be one of tae most solemn duties inposedupon this houwe not to suffer party differences to operate as a bar to discussing fully fairly and with practical effect such en important question as thatwhich relates to the abolitioa of slavery aud the save trade hacr hear in al the first part of the noble lords speech there fore i beg to say that i most cordially and unreservedly agree i do most sincerely believe that the slave trade is the most iniquitous the most heinous offence agaimt mankind that was everyetiavnea dorpractinebyte raind orkeu t an it enenerc moe crm thteaenid produces more misery

place in portgl thfe also therewas a contest be tween despotismand constitutional principles there also an uncle was arrayed against his niece there also we threw our influence into the scale of liberty and the cause of liberty prevailed when tranquillit was comparatively restored we made the same demand upon pertugal that we had made to spain but not with the same results the slave traders of lisbon were stronger than the slave traders of smadrid in deed i am almost tempted to say had we made an aptlication to the cuba dave traders themselves it wouldhave been im possible that they could have offered us more violent opposi tion than wa received from those of lisbon what was the consequence we came down to parliament parliament saw that our courae was good and gave us the powers which the court of queen isabella had refused that certainly was a great step to take it gave us the means of checking slavery carriel on under the portuguese flag in seas in which our hands had

disputes with the squatting slave traders landed and burnt down their barracoons gave the territory to the native chiefs and car ried off the slaves to sierra leone we sanctioned that act hear hear i know it struck the greatest dismay into the hearts of the slavetradera of cuba so much so that many of them were about to withdraw their capital from the traffic cheers so much for our endeavours the result was that we did esecta great dininution in the number of slaves landed on the islands and continent of america in the year  there were landed in the brarils   and in cuba  makin a total of  ir

and then comes a scene of suffering and horror hear keare greater than any that hs gone be fore and greater than it is ia the power of any man who has not seen it to fancy or to ventbre to describe ia the first place whatever may be the size of the ship the slavetrader always takea on board onefourth or onethird more nerroes than the veesel is capable of holding that is done and always has beeik done on true arith metical calculations it is done on the same calculations as these according to which a perion sending a pipe of madeira to the east indies aad back thips with it a quatercas to makeup the defiiency produced by leakage and evaporation so with the slave trader among those whom he selects there wil be many whose constitutions show signs of disorders which may break out and prove fatal during the voyage many sintk under inevitable illnesa produced by the change of chmate the change from exercise to confinement or by the difference of temperature and oter inconveniences which cannot be guarded against he therefore takes supernumeraries to fill up the vacancies that happen on the passage but that provision only aggravates the evils ainst which it is intended to provide the stow age of the vessel makes all these causes of suffering and dase worse and the result is that hardly a day or a night passes without a dead body being thrown overboard but is it dead bodies only that are thrown overboard i i am sorry th say far from it the living are often committed with the dead to the bosoni of the deep the progress of disorder is rapid a negro who is weeu in the morning is sick at night and expires the next day there can be no doubt of that but it aso frequently happens that the disease is a ingering one the experience of the slave trader saysthe negro may linger for a week or ten days or a fort night bnt he is sure to die before i can get him to market or if he lives he wil not be saleable he remembers too that the negro wgill eat a quantity of provision and that provsions are failing be i determined not to incur any additional loes and overboard goes the negro hear hearjthis byno means an oncmon transaction hear it was by no means uncommen i am ashamed to say amongstthe shps of our own country when the slave trade was permitted to be carried on there is on record the case of a ship in re ference to which a trial took place in  the ship was bound to jamaica she sprang a leak was short of water and disease had broken out the captain reflected that if the negroes died the insurers would have nothing to pay as the ioss would fall en the owners but if on the con trary he could show that the negroes were thrown over board to lighten the ship the loss would fall on the ineurers accordingly in three nights  negroes were thrown over board into the sea these causes produced treat mortality sometimes ophthalmia broke aut there was one instance which happened in  ophthalmia broke out to such an extent on board a french ship the rodeur that only one man remained capable of steering the essel the rodeur fell iu with a spanmsh vessel the st lveon wrhich wa drifting at the mercy of the waves and it wras discovered that all on board the st leon were so aflicted w ith ophthalmia that not a manu was left to direct her course the ships parted the french slhip reached guadaloune but the snaniah shitnwo aever neara ot those causes were bad enough but they were sometimes worse the places in which the regroes are confined are bad the hold is fiiled with casks which contain provisions for the crew over them is laid a platform of rough planks on which the negroes are com peled to lie and sometimes this accommodation is want ng and nothing but loose mats are spread over the casks theshare for each negro never exceeds three feet and a half and sometimes it is less than two feet and it has even been stated in evidence before a committee of this house that a negro in a slave ship has not so much room as a man has inis coffin how intolerable must be the heat endured by lthe slaves under a vertical sun in atropical clime how pestilential must be the effluvia create by the various circumstances connected with their condition and their confinement  to remedy this as much as possible the hatchways of slave ships are larger than those of merchart men and are covered with oaken gratings inastead of close hatchways in moderate weather this precaution answers its purpose but in a storm when the sea runs hi h and is breaking over the vessel the hatchways must be closed to prevent the abip from filling and going down the scene of i horror that ensues the strugges the horrible agonies of the negroes i will not attempt to describe but those who wish it may see a case of that sort re corded by captain hill in his interesting pamphlet caued fifty days of slavery hear hear from all those various causes i reckon that onethird of the negroes who are embarked on the coast of afri
