bfjmnob in af ricafrom our own corespondentalgiers juvy mesiees the adminittators of the berlinr poste informyou that there is jst five das journey from the paris in europe to the paris in africa what then ought to be your senations in stepping from the marseilles steamer upon the terstr jlma of the paris in africa i nothing very perti cular you see yourself in a french town and thats all on arriving at the place royale the only object which shakesyour faith in the french town is a large moeque which forms x very striking and novel feature in the emembzc of the place you muet then picture to your self a tolerablyzed square open on one side to the sea where you look over the mole and the harbour and a hundred merchant ships and half a dozen steamers and filled up on the other sides with hotels and shops and cwfis of four and five stories high with an esplanade or parade lined on two paths with growingup orangetrees nd you have the place royale there is another square as you advance upon the hiu of house where a market is held in the centre having a fountain which is also enclosed by cafas and shops there are two widish streets babaazours and babaouled running east and went which commnuni eate directly with the place royale these streets are lined with htels cafes and shops teeming with french good as cheap as in any town of france there is scarcely a street where building up and pulling down is not going on goternment is also building barracks for soldiers on the top of the city and churches of all sorts and sizes in different part of the city for the worship of every religion under the sui in the narrow streets of the eitywhich are as narrow tortuowu and dark as moorish streetscan bethere are several very strong and handsome houses buil and being built in fact the rage and anxiety to make paris in africa deserve its name is beyond all conception and many millions of franca must have been spent by priyate individuals there is an immense faubourg mustapha springing into life all along the eastern coast like a yankee city of the far west there are at least some  carriageomnibuses running to this juur parr or the environs imust not forget also that the government to please the moore have besides repairing their mosques built them two or three handsome bazaars in their moresue fashionthe bustle and confusion in this african paris is beyond description it is like a great hotel or an africoeuropean bazaar a fellow traveller of mine could not think of any thing else to compare it to but epsom races of course as prench spniards maltese arabs moors and barbary jews constitute nearly the whole population the variety of their costumes has a very droll if not pleasing effect the more respcctable natives the mussulmans i mean whose calm and retired habits feel offended at this epsom races bustle from morning to night retire within their houses and are rarely seen in the european part of the town a great many of the lower classep however are everywhere seen  and little mooriah shoeblacks follow you to black your shoes in french style the number of cafls and resaurants are to tally beyond calculation added to this as the crown of french civilization in africa youmust listen to with amorous delight an coquette the singing girls of the musical soi res of the cafs it was mentioned the other evening as an astound ng proof of the progress of civilization in the interior that italian music and singing was to be heard at blidals a town about eight leagues from thiseverybody seems to live at the caf or restaurau s very smaau houses are inhabited by half a dozen families that is of europeans for houserent is exceedingly dear i dont know whether you will be able to form any con ception of paris in africa from this lame description i should add however that algiers is essentiauy a gar rison town and is ful of the military it must not also be forgotten that the dau dorhians had a portion of the suburbs on the west devoted to a jardim des plantes which is open every sunday to the public i only men tion more that very formidable fortifications are being constructed on the heights the mole is gradually being enlarged and everything wears the appearance of the determination of the french to retain their algerine conquest we must not nevertheless disguise the fact that french eivilization as above set forth goes more than any other system of livingif i may eo sayagaint the grain of the moors they flee it it hurts it shocks them  the noise the bustle the cas the singing women the women run ning everywhere and doing everything the shops the pic turesnaytheroman catholc worship the cross the images the processions for processions have begun here al these and ton thousnad other things exasperate the very soul of the moor and he shrinks bark into the retirement of his secluded home and tries to dream that the french have never touched the soil of algeria it is because the french have been carrying en a desperate war in this country for the last  years and have driven away the peaceful objects of commerce from a soil stained with blood unrighteously pilt they turn round upon us and bully us because the arabs of the interior prefer to go and buy goods from morocco and tanis in safety but which goods it turns out come chiefly from england this is the way in which we rob our neighbours of their natural and legi timate rights as to the arabs themselves they are free agents and we have no control over them one way or the other surely they may be pernitted to choose the best market for themselvesbut there seems to be something like fatality in this frus tration of frances natural and legitimate benefits not satisfied with driving away the commerce from the soil of algeria by a cruel war the french were determined to give it the coup de grace by fiseal regulations are not the port of oran algiers philippevilie and bonr open  cries monsieur the member of the scientific commnnssion  no i answer you have effectually and hermetically sealed them by the late law of the customs of algiers the arabs dislike a dear article as much as war and certain it is that there is not the remotest urosneet nfrenvnvig the trade with the inhabitants of the interior or of the soutb whilst the new tariff of customs is in force the aigerine sahara will now indeed more than ever pursue its relations with tunis in the east and morocco in the west for the supply of its european manufactures no razia no war no earthly power wiu turr an arab from a route which leads him to a cheap mar ket i mentioned however in my last that the tariff had begun to be felt so perniciously that it was likely to undergo importat modifications the fact of the matter is that tariff was made against england to keep out her manufac tures but it has and ever will prove a failure english manufactures cannot be kept from the arabs of the sahara and the mountains of northern africa for if france pro hibits their enatry direct into algeria they wil find their pas sage sidewaybpav aa voix ktaks as m carette says they do now from the south the sooner therefore that france adopts an inevitable course of liberal policy in rela tion to the commerce of this country with other nations the better it wiiu come with a better grace if done at once and when already the necessity of the policy is clearly de monstratedwhilst wetting about the commerce of this country it may be as wel to mention that the export of native productions amounts to absolutely nothing all that is now is the ex port of a little oliveoil a little wax and a few shins all in the very small way and which is in the hands of jews and so madc smaller and worse by thati must now add a word upon the prospect of the security of life and property in this country i am assured that during the last year the colony has greatly advanced in se curity theakkbar of the th ultrelates the circumstnce of a man who not being able to leave bona for debt by sea left that town and traversed the country from bona to philippeville in perfect safety and this he gives as an arga ment of the security of the country the distance which the man traveued is some  riles the son of the british viceconsul also traveled from cherchell to algiers the other day a distance of about  miles with only two moors and another european in perfect safety the furthest post occupied in the interior is biskara lately taken possession of by the due daumale the distance from the coast in a direct line is about  miles the arab chief acknowledg ing the sovereignty of prance who is most distant from algiers the city is the emir of elaghouat which district contains a city with a population of  souls it is quite evi dent thenthat the frenchpower inafrica is auiring stability and only abdelkader prevents this colony at least appa rently so fromrapidly advancing in the security of life and pro perty of agriculturalprosperityi can saynothingat present towns and villages however are springing up in this neigh bourhood and the number of new emigrants is estimated at about  per month the spaniards and the maltese have been most successful amongst the strangers but i believe the germans are doing pretty well as cultivators of the soil government gives a free passage to every french emigrant who applies for it and takes with him a certificate ef character on arriving here they shift for themselves certainly the shortneswot the psage is greatly in favour of emigrationalways within three days and in steamers so far it must be confeised that the frencuch govement is liberal
