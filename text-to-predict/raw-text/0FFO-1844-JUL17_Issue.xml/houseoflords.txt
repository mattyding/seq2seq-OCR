prooessionsirelandthe earl of wicklow would take that opportunity to draw the attention of her majestys govermment to a subject which appeared to him to be intimately connectea with the peace of ireland when some years ago the party processions prohibition act was passed although its as evidently directed against the orange party in ireland yet it was so framed that it might be extended to all pro cession of political parties in that country unfortunately since that time a new party had arisen and the right of meeting had been turned into a curse a description of pro cessions was now common in ireland which tended to ex cite nothing but animosity and illwill amongst the people the noble earl was understood to advert to the repeal pro cessions the whole of those who attended the meetings and processions to which he referred were of one particular religion and of one political party and they had their distin gtuishng emblems and bannere under these circumstances and in this state of things his obiect wa to ascertain whether it was the intention of government to renew the party processions act i and if so whether under this alteration of circumstances it was intended to put down this new description of processions  if these pro cessions were allowed under the act a new principle would be introduced by the government that would tend exceed ingly to lower their character for impartialty for his owe part he was perfectly convinced that there was not the slightest danger to be apprehended if this act were not re newed the partes against whom it was originally directed placed the utmost confidence in those to whom they con ceived confidence to be due and they had not shown any dis position to march in procession he thought therefore that the government might abstain from renewing the act alto gether but if it were renewed it ought he submitted to include the processions of all those societies and associations that had recently sprung up he begged leave to observe that he had abstauned from putting these questions until the an niversary days had passed when certain processions formerly took place in irelandand those days so far as he was yet informed had gone by without the slightest breach of order having been committedlord wharncliffe said he thought his noble friend had gone something beyond the strict bounds of order in the manner hich he had adopted in puttingbis question hear from earl fortescue still he would endeavour to answer his noble friend a bill for the renewal of the party proces sions act was now before the ether homse and stood for committee this evening in what saape that bill would reach their lordships house he could not say it was the intention of government to continue the exist ing act for a short time tiu the st of june  he did not think it at all necessary to enter into any obser vation on the effect which renewing the existing measure without extending it to every clans and description of meet ing was likely to have but he could assure his noble friend that it would be extremely difficult to frame a maeasure to put an end to processions of every kindthose of temper ance societies for instancewithout prohibiting public meet ings sltozether hear hearheze the conversation endedmr alexander odriscollearl fortescue said he would make no apology for the moton which he was about to bring forward because he was persuaded that few queations could be submitted to that house of greater importance than those which related to the appointment of magistrates in ireland he should brefly state why he felt it to be his duty to cau for information with respect to the restoration of mtr a ddriscoll to the commission of the peace the lord chan cellor of ireland in the opinion which he had expressed of that gentleman said that mra odriscou had not that com mand over his temper which he easl forteecue would ven ture to say it was essentially necessary for a magistrate to possess he thought therefore that their lordships would reel with him that some information or explanation was due to that house and to the public of ireland as to the grounds apon which in the face of this opinion of the lord chancellor of ireland mr odriscoll after having been dismissed was restored to the commission of the peace he should now shortly refer to the facts of the case it appeared that en the d of last november a man of the name of dineen was sent to distrain on certain lands some property was seized and afterwards rescued by parties unknown to dineen he afterwards received a summons from mr odriscoll calling on him to attend at mr odriscolis own house he attended accordingly when he was re quired on oath to btate who the parties were who com mitted the rescue on his answering unsatisfactorily he was taken before another magistrate  and his conduct not being deemed satisfactory he was placed in the bridewell at skibbe reen and confined there from the th to the th of november mr odriscoll was reminded by the magistrates that he ought not to act in his own case the magistrates did not consider that there was sunicient information for a criminal information but they remanded the prisoner for the purpose as he considered of obtaining further evidence he was ac cordingly remanded to the bridewell from the th to the th of november on which day without any application from him he was set at liberty the lord chancellor of irelaad sent this memorial to mr odriscoll for explanation and he received an answer giving a different colour to the transac tion but admitting the main facts mr odriscou adding that he had suspected the man of instigating the rescue the report of the magistrates was very nearly to the same effectexcept that they stated that it did not appear from the evi dence that theman had instigated the resene upon a revi sion of all the circumstances the lord chancellor of ireland made a communication to mr odriscou to the effect that he ought not to have acted in his own case but that he the lord chancelor of ireland did not intend to interfere any further in the busines but would leave the man to what ever remedy the law gave him this to a poor man was ia deed no remedy at all hear hear whilst this inquiry was pending mr odriscoll was again brought up before one of the magistrates on a charge of assault under the fol lowing cicumstances it appeared that a gentleman was shooting in the neighbourhood of skibbereen and seven or eight boys were looking on mr odriscoll who was hunting near the spot hearing a shot rode up to the boys who dis persed in alarm one of them named dempsey he pursued to the cottage of a poor woman the boy ran into the cot tage aud hid himself under a bed mr odriscoll called on the woman to turn the boy out and the womran as she stated liu consequence of her own and her childrens alarm did force the boyout whereon mfr odriscol asked him wihere the gun wfas the boy answered and he earl for tescue believed truly that he could not tell as he had no thing to do with it mr odriscoll then accordingto his own account gave him a blow with his vvhip but according to another account three or four severe blows it also ap pearel that language was used by mr odriscoll both to the boy and afterwards to the poorwomanwhen she told the boy to quit the house so that he might not be killed at her door such as he would not disgust their lordships by repeating it was utterly unsuited to a person holding the office of a magistrate and unbecoming any person of common feeling on the evidence brought before the bench the raagistrates unanimously convicted mr odriscoll in the fine of  one half of which was allotted to the boy as an indemnity for what he had suffered on this decision being announced to mr odriscoll he resumed his place on the bench and stated in presence of all the court that justice had not been done and repeated this statement more than once such conduct as this could not have been very edifying to that portion of the public which was assembled in the court hear hearbut mr odriscoll was at last forced to make a public apology to the bench these circumstances having been brought under the cognizance of the lord chanceuor of ireland that noble and learned lord felt it necessary to notice what had occurred and he called their lordships at tention to the noble and learned lords minute on the subject after detailing the particulars of both cases the lord chan celor of ireland proceeded to say that in an ordinary case he should not have felt caued on to take any further notice of the charge but that from mr odriscolls explanation it might be inferred that he would not have struck the boy if he had told the name of the person who had fired the gun now he earl fortescue contended that there was no proof that the boy knew the lord chancellor of ireland in his minute proceeded to say that mr odriscoul stated on the honour of a gentleman that he merely gave the boy one slap with the thong of his whip across the shoulders but this like the first act ppeared to bear the character of a pu nshment upon the boy for not giving imr odriscoll evidence in his own case and that after his conviction mlr odriscou openly accused the magisrates of not doing justice he was however greatly excited and shortly i afterwards admitted his faultnot however let him earl fortescue observe until he had repeated it two or three timesby returning into court and making a public apology which was kindly received by the sitting magistrates and though he the lord chancellor of ireland under ordinary circumstances wvould be most unwvilling to advert to mr odriscolls prior conduct yet that all the charges taken together satisfied his mind that ir odrisco had not at present that commnand over his temper and actions either when acting in his magisterial capacity or appearin as a defendant before the bench wiich was so essentiafto the due administrtion of justice the lord chancellors minute then vent to say that as he was informed mr odriscoui was advanced in years and an occasional sufferer from illness he therefore suggested that mr odriscoll should retire from the bench and that if a supmsedeas issued it would be solely on these grounds  hear hear from the noble lords on the opposition benches now with all due respect for the eminent person who held the great seal in ireland to whose ability in the discharge of his high official duties no one was more willing to bear testimony than he earl fortescue was he must say that this minute appeared to him a most undignified iconsistent and ineonollislve docu ment harhea ia aseof hiskind had occurred in thisuounrywhic hethaked odhe thxought to be im possbleas te mgisrate inenglnd erebetter ac quaitewithpai mor

administration of justice should have superseded him not on thbt ground but merely on the grounds of age ana illhealth hear hear he should ao have been more astonished if after having got rid on any grouad of a persun who had azwed his functions the noble and learned lord on the wooleack should have within dx months with out any disproof of these facts reetored him to the commis slon o the pee hear hear such was the case as ap peared from the papers on their lordships table but if he was rightly inforned this was not the first time that mr odriscoll had fallen under the censure of the executive government nor the first time that he had been erased from the commission of the peace ial addition to this he must observe that during the progress of these proceedings mr odriscoll had taken so improper a part in the proceedings of the magistrates at macroom session and a part so at va riance with the provisions and intent of the arms bil u to call down on him the pointed aniadverion of the noble lord the ecretary for ireland on these grounds le called upon their lordships to support him in the motion he was about to make for information respecting the ground of mr odriscolls restoration to the commission of the peace hear hear the irish government he was afraid had within the last  months done muck to impair the confi dence of the great mass of the people of ireland in the ad ministration of the law in that country by the sveeping re moval from the commiasion of the peace on the grounds of political opinion of many gentlemen well quahinedto be in tt by character sation and property some of them alsotg much experienced in the discharge of magisterial duties and endeared to the great body of the people by the profession of those opinions which had led to their dismissal but the government would destroy all confidence in the ad ministration of justice and would take from the people every inducement to obey the law except the fear of penalty if they retained on the grounds of personal favour or personal partisanship in the commission of the peace men who like mr odriscoll outraged the law which it was their duty to administer and who in their conduct displayed a spirit utterly unsuited to the magisterial office rear hear the noble earl concluded by moving that there be laid before the house copies of any memaorials or representationsi ad dressed to the irish government recomoehding the restora tion of mr alexander odriscoll to the commissioni of the peacelord wharncliffe conceived that the noble earl had stated no parliamentary ground for his motion he apyre hended that the lord chancellor of ireland like the lord chancellor of england when he dismissed from the bench any individual or restored any to it acted judicially and un less it was shown that he acted from personal favour or po litical motives there was no ground for impeaching his de ciion on the subject but not urging this obiection which was of a technical nature he lord wharneliffe would come to the facts of the case it was true that mr odriscollad acted in a manner which he lord wharncliffe was far from defending but both the case of dineen and of the boy dempsey had been exaggerated he did not mean to say that the case had been exaggerated by dineen but by others for it was clear that dineen had been made the tool of somebody else anxicus to make a case against mr odris cel it was stated that mr odriscoll took dineen into his room and asked him who it was that rescued the cows there was nothing very unnatural in this nor would it be thought surprising for any of their lordships if an offence were committed against their property to inquire of one of their tenants if he knew the offenders he admitted that there was something to find fault with in mr odriscolls conduct and the mode adopted to procure information was certanly not such as would be pursued in this country and he thought that the lord chancellor of ireland was bound to take notice of it and to reprimand it dineen in the course of his memorial took notice that mr odriscoll had on a former occasion been censured by the lord chancellor and at an other time dismisesed from the bench for improper conduct now when this charge wvas made it was but fair that mr odriscoll should be heard in his own defence and he stated that he was for a short time suspended but that the suspen sion arose from a mistake and was on explanation taken off mr odriscoll also stated that the censure alluded to also arose from mlstake whether this explanation of mr odriscoll was true or false he lord wharncliffe did not know but if true it certainly toek the sting out of the charge now with regard to the case of the boy dempsey it appeared that mr odriscoll was out hunting and heard a shot fired he went up to some boys one of whom es caped to the house of an old woman he told the woman to sturn d the aboy ot and whlentdhe b oy was fturned out it w as b state that mr d rac cord i dgto the la sho t of his w hip over t ne boys nckand acoringto he ccunt of dineen whoekq vgl las case witl which he had nothing to do he beat the boy most cruelly let them consider whether this case was made out in the fit glace the boy stated that mr odriscou struck him at th eutmost only two or three times with the thong of the whip and mr odriscol stated that he oaly struck him once it was likewise stated by mr jones the stipendiary magistrate that the case was exagerated and that thouch mr odriscoll undoubtedly struck the boy there was no reason for calling it an aggravated aesault he lord wharneliffe put it to their lordships whether they had themselves never seen great irritation on the part of gentle raen interrupted in their sports  laughter noble lorda opposite might laugh but they must recollect how strongly persons felt on this subject he stated this rather by way of palliation than defence for he did not mean to defend mr odriscolls conduct in this particular it was his duty to have commanded his temper then came the scene before the magistrates and he lord wharueliffe agreed with the lord chancellor of irelanid in thinkling that whatever might have been mr odriscolls faults before his greatest fault of all consisted in his conduct to the bench of magistrates but for this he made an apology such being mr odris coils previous conduct he would now advert to that gentle mans restoration to the commission of the peace mr odnscoll remained for some time off the bench the lordancellor of ireland having no intention or at least tak ing nosteps to restore him bnt there was an application made to the lordlieutenant of ireland on this subject by the lordlieutenant of the county backed by a strong me morial in favour of mr odriscoll the noble lord here read the memorial which stated that mr odriscou was not so old as many on the bench that he had recovered from illness that he had generauy conducted himself on the bench in a manner wnich inspired confidence among all classes i nd that all parties whether protestants or roman catholics believed that they would get justice at his hande this memorial was signed by  noblemen  clergymen  esquires and  other persons were they to suppose that a memorial so signed stated that which was untrue  he must say that some credit was due to the statement of the persons signing that memorial that the character of mr odriscol was not such as to incapacitate him from sit ting on the bench the lord chancellor of ireland having seen the memorial did restore mr odriscoll to the commis sion of the peace and in doing so he made a minute setting forth that he had considered that memorial with atten tion signed by  persons at the head of vwhom was the lordlieutenant of the county and that he couected from the memorial that mr odriscolls general conduct as a ma gistrate was such as rendered it desirable that he should be restored to the commission of the peace that he had mainly attributed mr odriscolls previous conduct to irritation occasioned by ill health and that as he was now restored to health he the lord chancelor of ireland reinstated him in the commission of the peace feeling confident that on account of the experience of the past and in consequence of having nearly  sureties for mr odriscolls future conduct he the lord chancellor should hear no complaint rspecting itim he lord lharncliffe admitted that mir odriscolis conduct justly exposed him to reprimand  and he thought the lord chancellor of ireland was justified in dismissing him from the bench but on receiving such a memorial as that he had referred to the lord chancellor might fairly thinkc that after having punished the indivdual by reprimand and dismissal from the bench he was never theless bound to give credit to the statements in the memo ria ese were the reasons of mr odriscolls restoration to the commission of the peace and as the noble earl had stated no parliamentary grounds for the production of the papers ht had moved for he lord wharneliffe must decline to give themthe marquis of normianby was surprised to hear it asserted that no parliamentarv ground had been laid for the production of the papers hear hear he believed the noble lord wharnelle had though boldly throwing him self iuto the breach disapproved of that conduct on the part of the lord chancelor wvhich he had laboured toefend hear hear when the papers originably were moved for they had not been pressed because substantial lustice appeared to have been done by the removal of this gentleman from the commission hear but now that this extraordinary reinstatement had taken place it was time to press for further information on the matter hear hear it was said that political motives had not produced the restoration of that gentleman that was not charged still it was expedient to learn if possible how many of these three thousand memorialists were parties whom the govern ment would rather gratify than offend hear party spirit ran very high in ireland and this was exemplified in recent removals from the commission there hear hear on such slight grounds as those nowv stated so solemn a decision as that which had been pro nounced in this case ought not to halve been reversed hear the statement of mr odriscollihimself showed that he had used his magisterial power for private purposes as he stated that he hadissued a summons for the attend ance of the boysurely aa official course hear hear it was astonishing to hear the occasional irritation of sportsmen appealed to as supplying a palliative by com parison for the offence in this instance why every one knew that it was riot at al likely any ebiglish gen tleman wonld have under any such provocation acted as mr odriscoll had done he the marquis of nor manby had seen the deposition as taken in court and must declare the language deposed to have been used by the ma gistrate to awoman who protected the boy was suchas utterly disqualified him for the magisterial office now as to the alleged apology it had not by any means been as prompt and instantaneetns as mr odriscoll had stated for it ap peared that this gentlemau had accused the bench of acting unjustly towards him and upon an appeal to him for retrac tation repeated the insult nor was it until mr gore jones had ealled him out of court that mxrodriscoll could be induced to apologize it was remarkable that the lord chancellor of ire landlwho hadundertaken to give a sort of summary of the case hadnot at allalluded to the discrepancy betwveen these facts and mrodriscolls declaration that he had instantlyapologized and were those who memorialized aware ofthese facts above alwere those who had been insulted by this genleman on the benchand those who would have to associate with him on magisterial businesswere they concurring in the prayer of the memorial for mir odriscolls reinstatementi he the marquis of normanby knew weu the way in which memo rials were got up in such cases in ireland poor old dris coll it wourd be said  hes breaking his heart  a good old fellow  what a pity  wonb you sign l laughter and if the question were asked if tbe late government would have acted on such a memorial he boldly replied that he should with the facts of this case before him refuse to restore mr odriscoll and let it be marked how this con sistent government had aoted on other cases that of lord lucan for instanee hear who had been very rnused hear having for a single word uttered under extreme provocation from a party who was misbehaving himself exceedingly been disrnissed from the magistracy hiear that noble lord no doubt could have bo difculty in getting up even  better memoral than tbat in the present instance yet theoffer of his restoration was coupled with the condition of the same course being adopted as to i pagentthe persn of whose conduct he had to cdlab ie the transaction and who owed to bimsel the mea n qli for the magitracy was there s zegonfr consi dering tht

reinstating him would nov be proper and praiseworthy certainly if mr odrit coil were restored it would be unjust not to cosder their cas with respect to the pretences about that gentleans healtb why the whole beneft of dinis sals consisted in a clear understanding of their grounds and reasons whereas the irish chancedor in this case seemedl to attempt to place the dismissal upon the reason of illhealth ca reason not substantiated by facts there was about it appeared to be a change in the goverment of ireland for tne noble earl who at present occupied the lordlieutenants office he the marquis of normanby en tertained the kindest feelings it had however been noto rious that for some time the noble earl had not been able to afford adequate attention to the business of his department  and it was highly injurious that there should be anything approaching to secondhand or underhand intriguing in the govemment of ireland which should be conducted ou the individual responsibility of the lordlieutenant he was not quite prepared to say he agreed in the propriety of an abolition of the lordlieutenancy though to that probably the courtry would come while the office lasted as a prac tical protection to the people it could not be otherwise than beneficial to bring forward cases of this nature which would tend to increase their security he knew not if the papers woutld be opposedlord wharncliffe explained he had said he considered no parliamentary ground had been made for the production  meaning this more however as agprotestthan a refusalthe marquis of normanby would advise that if the papers were not given a division should be demandedthe earl of ripon said nothing could palliate at all events excuse mr odriscolls conduct as to the sum mons it was an inderensible use of it while as to the assaut it was an intemperate violence and no doubt regre hensibe as indeed ever intemperate language was ut some allowance must be made for irritation and provocation hear with respect however to what had been said as to the ilhealth of the lordlieutenant he must disclaim any excuse on that ground hear hear for though all who pproached the noble earl on business knew the sufferings he endured they equally knew that nothing ever induced aeiciencyof energy or attention hear and no doubt whatever the course the noble earl had taken on this occasion he had acted on his own conscientious convictions not on the representations of others hearthe earl of wicklow also declared he had never heard of any such insinuation as the noble marquis normandy had introduced with respect to the alleged eftects of the lordlieutenants i health on the contrary he believed the noble earl was indefatigable and irreproachable in his attention to the duties of his office hear he did not consider that to lord lucan justice had been done and in the case before the house he did not think there was any reason for a permanent exclusion from the magistracythe marquis of clanricarde said the noble earl had argued that mr odriscou had not misconducted himself magisterially as he was not acting as a magistrate but he was sitting upon the bencht the earl of wicklowhe was not acting as a ma gistratethe marquis of clanricardehe said  let us do justice differently from the last case  so that no doubt he did misbehave himself as a magistrate a person who acted as mr odriscoll was proved by the evidence to have done on that eccasion was incapacitated by his temper from being a good magistrate no man was entitled to be a mazis trate by hispropertywho was disqualified by temper butmr onscoll was convicted of two or three untruths in his report calculated to mislead the lord chancellor that alone rendered him not a fit person to be continued in the com mission not a shadow of a justification had been shown for restoring this gentleman to the magistracy all throueh he had not shown the leaat compunction as to his condet    puaccang urcmn as he termed the boy or thought he had acted wrong as to his temper being  inflammable he had said  that is a fact i entirely deny except in one nstance before my brother mnagistrates the noble lord the president of the council bad faid no parliamentary foundation had been laid for this motion had the noble ord forgotten the attack he made on the late government for their appointsments to the nagistracyllord wharncliffei grounded my attack upon their putting men upon the bench on account of their poli tical partisanshipthe marquis of clanricardeand i say that mr odriscoll has been restored to the bench on account of his political partisanship if he had been restored on account solely of the number ef persons recommend ing his restoration that would make the appoint ment of magistrates elective if  signaturea to a memorial were sufficient to restore mr odriscoll on what ground could the igovernment justify the turning out of popular magistrates merely for entertaining an opinion which any persoa might honestly entertain that the repeal of the union would be beneficial to ireland l he thought it was a most unfortunate act for which nothing approaching to an excuse had been offered the circum stance of the man being a poor man and a marksman only strengthened the case there was another circam stance which though not stated in the papers had been mentioned by all the newspapers at the time thaz when the boys case camne on a complaint was made of the officer of the court refusing to serve the summons upon mr odriscoll and his party and what excuse did the officer of the court make i he stated that the person wvho was in the habit of serving summonses said he dared not serve the sum mons upon mr odriscoll becauee he would drive a bullet through him this was said in open court and practi cally speaking it was admitted by the court as an excuse for not serving the summonsthe earl of bandon said he would not enter into the merits of the case but
