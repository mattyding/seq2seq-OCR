latter flung the by into the river and passed on whih his barge that the deceased got out of the water and after the pri soner had gone a considerablc distance undressed himself and went in a second time to recover a jacket he had lost and was then drownedmr binohass then said that the charge against the pri soner of wilfully causing the death of the boy had failed to be established by the evidence and whatever feeling might be entertained upon the case he was bound to acquit him of that offence but as the prisoner bad thought proper to take the law into his own hands and punish the boy for pelting him he should remard him upon substantial bail to await the result of the inquest upon the body when the parenta of tho aooacedq might prefer aiy subsequent charge they thought properthe prisoner was therefore remanded to yesterday when he was again brought up andsergeant mawkes stat d to the magistrate that since the last examination a coroners inquest had been held upon the body of the deceased at which all the evidence in relation to the case wvs fully gone into and the jury had returned a verdict of accidentally drowned but accompanied it with a very severe censure upon hulls
