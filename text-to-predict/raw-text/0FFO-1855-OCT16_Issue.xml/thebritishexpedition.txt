except our allies and the enemy t is whispered that on thun day next there will bes secret expedition for a place the name of which ilby nii means secret and that  french and a english troops are o go on board the fleet rith all posible expedition on that day again nt is eaid  orders have been received from eng hand by electric telegraph to kieep all steamers ie balaihlava or at kamiesbch but if such orders were eent they were assuredly disobeyed for claamerz leave balsiava dailv and the great britain largest of themn a is getting ready to qiturn home on saturday next and will be pre ceded by the colombo and several others the ealegraph has many evil qualities attributed to it quick as is its agency it is sometimes too slow or example it is stated that orders were eent fromu aome to spare the houses public buildings and locks of sebastopol it was only in our power to comply with the latter part of these idjunctions for jme bombs and shot of our batteries aided by the cneinya detructivenea had laid all in ruin and the docks only require a lighted match to fire aihs train and these models of grand design and of beautiful worknanship will be mere craters of blecks of red granite fine sandstone and granite another indlication of an intention to move is sup pcsed to ba conveyed by the fact that returns have ween required from each regiment of the number of oat horses belonging to lts but those returns are not asked for in anticipation of any expedition what ver actually the v orl of the army is one of pre sorsation not for motion but for stagnation the maen are engaged on great roads from the ports to the front which will be permanent marks of the existence of the allied armies on this spot for cen tariea in fact with eo much labour at theirifsposal our authorities are determined if pos j sible to atone for the apathy of last autumnn it mlust be remembered that the enemy has an equal amount of labour set free for the accumula ron of stores and the formation and repair of roads and that they can now cover the crimea with depots and fortified lines from simpheropol to the belbek the roads which we are making are emoat beyond the requirements of an army of temporary occupation they are broad and well gpavedso faras they have goneinsome places they arelevelledthrough therock whichhere andtherecan only be removed by heavy blasting charges the rail way is now assuming an appearance of great solidity besde it winds the centralroad and frova the new central depot under mir brew which has been removed from the col de balaklava to an open space in the rear of the second division and between lbe guards brigade and the fourth diviaion fihere are divlsional roads in progress which will also communicate with the divisional depots vhen the railway is worked by locomotives in stead of horses the permanent vay will endure much better and a great deal more vork will be got out of the line all these preparations are ioeing made to enable the army to exist comfortably en its winter cantonmenta to bring up hute food clothing and fuel snd to remove guns mortars and moatiiel from the front the trenches will be left as they are except in eo far as the parapets will ibe affected by the removal of the gabiona vhich the en are permitted to take away for firewood for theee peaceful labours we have been blessed by the most lovely weather the days are warm and the air is charmingly freshand pure the autumnalor zeccrad summer of the crimea has shone upon ua with all the delightful influences of repose the earth teems again with herbs and flowers of autumn numerous bulbous plants are springlng up over the ateppes among w hich the  colbiclum autumnale is prominent and the hill sides ring with the frequent volleys directed upon innume table quail against which our army wages fierce ibattle at presentihe demolition of the houses in sebastopol goes on but it is not so safe to visit the place as it was tormerly inasmuch as the russians now shell vigorously and throw shot at any considerable group in the streets the french have two mortars which belonged i believe to the russians among be ruins of the earabelnaia and bombard

their shot went crashing through the rulaed houses but did not create any very serious injury an enormous convoy was seen going out of the northern camp tovwards simpheropol but it wva imposible to ascertain whether the carts were full or empty as it was an exceedingly clear day vz e could look into the rosaiau camps as clearly as lf they had been our own and tbrough my glas i culd makse out the

smoking his pipe till ho came to come ass gunpowder on which being of a sdentificand experimentalizing turn of mind be tried the affects of dropping several sparks from the burning tobacco the powder

quitecertain that the man who cansed the accident was a sailor some people say he was a navvy of the army works corps whoever he was by the act for which he so dearly paid he destroyed not less than  cartloads of wood which vrould have been made available for hutting and fuel it is on the whole a miracle that more accidents of the kind do not occur owing to the neglect of the autho rities and the carelesaness of the men no one seems to take any care to destroy the great quantitiez of powder loose and in cartridges which is to be found in all the rusian batteries and in every nook aud corner of the place it was only the othler day a naval officer pointed out to me the danger arising from the number of live shell lying inside the redan the fuses are open tubes of wood and have no caps so that a spark setting fire to one fuse would blow all the sheds up these live shelis are to be found in all directions and are generally ijicely imbedded near small magazines or piles of cartridges it is now supposed that the explosion which took place in the strand battery and hurt so many men was a fougasse the russians teem to be strengthening their campa near yac henzies farmmondayintelligence has bsen received today that on friday or saturday the french troops near eupatoria surprised a rumsian detachment and convoy and took six guns  prisoners and some carts and horses there was a coincil of generals today at beadquarters at which marshal pelissier waa present and there are strong asuspicions that we are at last going ite do something orders bave been sent to the french fleet to prepare for the reception of  men tomorrow the con ferences between the generals have been frequent of latethe detachment of royale doing duty at head quarters as guard have been relieved by  ien of the rifle brigade under the command of captain fyers there has not been much firing from or on the town today but the french at inkermann are annoying a newr rusalau camp at the other side of the ravine by constant discharges of long ranga rockets we hear that general bentinlck is going home and he will probably be succeeded by lord w paulet in his command lord west an able and diitinguished officer is also going home and today the name of colonel norcott appears in orders with leave of absence on urgent private affairs colonel norcotts services in the field are matter of history except when stricken down by fever for a short time he never left his mea since the brigade landed at gall poli primus in turcis with equal gallantry and skill heled his wing up the steep of the alma in advance of the light division full in the throat of the russian batteries and advanced to the vine yards where the terrible fire of his men caused the enemy the loss of most valuabie officers and soldiers it needs not to be said that the temporary absence of such an officer would be a eevere loss to the army if there was anyhlng to be done but the reasons wbich induce him to leave the field on which he won so much renown and esteem are imperativemr hayter the young commlssary officer re ported as killed on the th in the telegraphic de spatch from headquarters is alive and well and was never in the way of being hit although several officers of the commissariat department have been under fire only one of them mr blane has ever received any injury and his  wound was a slight scratch in the face received as he was going to his own tent in the third division late at night by a stone which was knocked up by one of the long range round shotstulsdayat  oclock this morning a general commotion arose in camp in consequence of the sounding of the amsembly and the turning out of all the men at the same time the light division was inspected and the artillery were reviewed in the open space in front of our lines towards inkermann the ist brigade of the fourth division received orders to hold themselves in readiness to march at dawn tomorrow morning it is evident at last that some active operation will be attempted ere winter sets in so sudden waa the order that all the various working parties were interrupted in their work and marched off to their regiments after they had been roadmaking only a couple of hours the men detailed to the land transport corps and to the commllqsariat depart ment were sought out and told to rejoin their regi ments at once there is now a general parade and inspection of french troops of the divisions of inkermann it is conjectured that we will go to theodosia kertch or eupatoria the telegraph will inform you of the expedition and possibly of its results long ere these lines can reach london
