tomication there bas been a change for the better in this respect and the cafe is believed to lhave  contributed to it the liquors there sol aro of wholesome quality spirits are only to be obtained mixed with water and the facility of getting coffse tea and other sober drinks doubtless induces many a man to take these when he would otherwise take wine or grog the shops where raki and other bad and unwholesome spirits were sold have been shut up since the cafe was opened i believe the ides was once put forward of opening this for the sale only of nonintosicating drlnks but i think the esta blishhment would then have proved a failure or at least that the good it iwould have done would have been sensibly diminlished teetotalism in the army is all stuff the soldier wilz have his grog when he can possibly get it and if you lnaduce him to take it in moderation and keep from dramdrinkling it is as much as you can expect to do except in a few iso lated cases the rule at the inkermann cafe is that no man is to be served with more than two glasses of spir ts and water at least this regulation is posted up but i believe it has been found imprac ticable always to carry it out for reasons that are obvious the prices of all the articles supplied at the cafs are extremely low so much so as to render it doubtful whether the establishment will ever be selfsupportingit seems the fate of the uufortunate turkish con tingent to be kicked about like a football from corner to corner after such long detention at the bujukdr camp that it began to doubt whether an intention of ever moving it thence really existed it was told that it was going to balaklava this anticipation unpleasant to the turks sufficed to produce or at least greatly to increase deser tion when this crime favoured by the vicinity of the capital had taken ten per cent from the numbers of the foroe orders came to embark for varna a battalion accordingly departed but before a second could sail down comes an order to embark for kertceb eager for motion and action the leaders of the contingent lost no time and in a very few days the whole of the firt division part of the second and some ar tilery went on board in good spirits band playing aud men cheering and quitted the bosphorus for the western crimea when behold  again the wires quiver and general vivian is informed that he is forthwith to embark his corps for shumla rvia varna what wonder that the general although the most amiable of men and obedient of soldiers lost all patience vowed that he would not be thaus treated as a shuttlecock and hurried off to the british ambassador to tell him so wita a decision and energy that are said to have somewhat startled that diplomatist a message from the crimea then summoned him to the head quarters of the allied armies where it is to be hoped he will be able to convince the commandersinchief that it by no means conduces to the good condition comfort or contentment of troops to be bowled about the black sea attthe time of the equinox from south to north and from west to east and then off to the west again i do not speak of the unneces sary expense thus incurred since there seems a sort of tacit convention that john who pays for all is to grwmble at nothing it is reported that the last ordercountermanding the troops from kertch to shumlahad its origin in a belief that it would be impossible to provision them during the winter at the former place if this be true the opprobrium was unfounded there will be no difficulty in storing six months provisions at kertch before the bad weather sets in and there are con tractors here quite ready to undertake the work should the commissariat deem it too great an exer tion meanwhile the contingent is away from this with the exception of some  men or little more  the same steamer that took a battalion to varna went back as aoon as it returned to the os phorus to convey it to eertch where some of the troops that left bujukler last week have pro bably by this time arrived should they again have to traverse the billows of the black sea bound for the anubes banks we can but wish them light breezes and strong stomachs and that the higher powers may know their own minds better another timne for truly a heavy transport in a chopping sea is but a weary abode and  poor  bono johnmnes all cascading at once and wish ing themsalves in their secret sonls at the bottomof the sea or in the maw of the dolphins that cut i capers round the vessel is a sight that might move to pity the hardesthearted commanderinchiefor minister of war who ever changed
