frora ballyconnell was met in the line or avenue leading to her house by two demons in human shape who at once dragged her off the car hisocked her down with loaded sticks and then deliberately fired no fewer than three pistol shots into her face and head after which they walked quietly away leaving her for dead the unfortunate lady was shortly afterwards carried on a door to her own bouse where she now lies in the most excruclating arany having besides the beating from the sticks received no less than four bullets in the face and head one of which is lodged in the brain her miedical attendants entertain not the slightest hope of her recovery some  months ago sworn information was given thas this ldy was soon to be shot and a communication to that effect was then made to the government who ordered that she should ge a police escort at all times she might call for sueb but she only avaied herself of the privilege on one or two occasions miiss einds dared to exercise the

at the approaching session of this townfbom our own coop eondbtdublin mordnay momic g reireseintationt of tub county of duiblinthe prospect of an infusion of new blood into the dormant body of the irish representation at the next general election seems likely to be realized to at least a small extent aleady one of the der hyite strongholds is menaced by an opponent who takes the field with the ad vantages of yonth wealth high connexions and advanced political opinions on his side the candidate thus recommended is afr c c w dornville on of sir compton domville one of the wealthiest proprietors in ireland and in former times a strenulous supporter of the extreme tory party but we now live in a different age and accordingly mr domville in his electoral addres thus enunciates the principle upon which he rests his claims for the auirages of the electors of the county of dubin tobaleo olentlemenat toe next eclection i hope to bo able to offer myself as a candidate for the honour of representing your countv an haonor very frequenltly conferred on my family in former times sly principles are liberal but bynao means these of either english or irish radicalism indeed i believe that all the really large propesetors of thecounty writh one exrception hold similar opinione i think that protestants add roman catholices in this country should receive equal favour from the crown and tbst parliament should meke grants toinstitutions whether roman catholic or protestant if it is otherwise advisable to do so and i am on principle opposed to any measure tendjng to revive the irritation which the policy of the last  years has done much to allaywithout belng an advocate for tenantright i think the value of improvements sanctioned by the landlord should be fully secured to the tenant and i venture to hops we hall one day eee our cnadition in this respect amended not by any of the measures hitherto propoeed but by the in troduction of that practical eystem which bas brought the more improved parts of england to their present state i think a very comprehensive administrative reform is neceseary and nowhere more so than in the poorlaw de partment i venture to hope gentlemen that the vievs i have put forward vill prove to be thoea held by the majority of the electore of this county and i think i have an additional ground for anticipating success in the fact that most people agree that one of your members has no claim what ever to his present position   c w donrarme irisi atorivygenimala local paper states that mr keogh has inti mated his intention of meeting

notwithstanding the pressure in england tbere is not only an increase in the circulation as is always the case at this period but this increase in the present instance is greater than either in s or

partly to the payment of the october dividends which comprise the great bulk of those paid here as the july amount is small but of conae much more to the operations consequent on the barvest should it not fau serlously short of the usual amount it may be taken as an indication of the correctnues of the general im pression that trade in this country is on a tound footing and unahaken by the crisis on the other side it fs pretty palpable that there is an inquiry for bullion here and it seems a pity that ro large a sum ehould lie useless here when it is so murch wanted elsewhere as these appears every reason to think ve could with per fect convenience spare a million of our present stock of gold not only have wve the notes but gold is dot in favour in ireland as a circualting mediumi the

paper thus reports the general result of the harvest in that county there are few men now who during t�eir experlence can tell us of a finer harvest time and an equally fine close the spring we need not say was in our naid southern and sea surrounded county late beyond the average of many years and had not cur farmers ehown themselves to be among the advanced in the progrees of the day by taking care to sow hardy cereals and pulse crops befove winter sat in cur crops would have been truly deticent so fares the above descriptions are concerned and we regret to say that in most of the cold and exposed situations tho produce is light in weight and conseoently deficient in qulity though the apparent bulk of atraw would tell to the con trary the fact however is too well proved by the weight wben ascertained by the imperial busbel hut the extraordinary price for grain of all kinds and qualities makes up for the deficiency the erop however is decidedly below the average here both in quantity and quality and in many districts the poorer clam of landholders will not have a potnto of their own remaining at the end of november the root having in many instances totally rotted away beneath the decayed zemaining stalk the blight we must observe this year did not destroy branch and root as in late years the leaves went away the atalk or baulm remained whitened as in the olden time when the potato formed the main food of the irish peasant and of his stock too with tbe exception of some moistard warm weather before the ripenin g of the crops which caused them to fall and eend forth fresh shoots from the knots or joints much to tbeir injury no finer harvest eeason has been experienced
