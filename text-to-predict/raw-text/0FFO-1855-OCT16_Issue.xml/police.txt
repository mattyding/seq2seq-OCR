with the pieces of mutton for a customers dog and he must have put them with the meatm ar artinthe man may sir have stolen a pound of meat and put the mutton in to make up the deficiencyalderman ssdsxthat is possible but i thinl after what the defendant has now stated that he ought to have detained him and made him appear here today i am satisfied that the meat was not tampered with for the
