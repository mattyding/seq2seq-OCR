a cablnet council was held yesterday aller roon at the foreignoffice it was attended by viscount palmerston the lord chancellor earl granville the earl of clarendon lord panmure the chancellor of the exchequer sir charles wood the right hon r vernon smith viscount canning and the earl of harrowby the council bat two hours and ahalfthx cost of tes wanto those who doubt the ab lity of the country to carry on a war at the cost of  or  ayear as long as shall be nocese sary we would observe that if england coald boar tax lotion to the extent of  in  it would not be oo much to say that we could with equal ease bear taxation now to the extent of di when we bear in stind the increased population wealth and trade of the coumtry xn  the income assessed to the property tam was  ayear mow competing itupon the same basls it cannot be less than  again with regardl to the extent to which it is possible to abstrct from the capital of the country we hive had experienoe in the con itractlon of railways during the last  years when therefore we speak of our ability to conduct the war it is obvious that whether we look to doing ho by means of tax ation or by loans it ia ample conomistthe co cobespondss  mr a cbaunit would be well to consider calmly and dispvsalonately urbe ther the letters written from the seat of war to the london papers can ravlly interfere with or damage the operations of the allied armies general della marmora has aready de clared that they do and it is said the french and english commanders have begum to consider whether they should not summarily put a stop to the transmission of such cor respondence the question is a harder one to be answered than is generally imagined and cannot be disposed of by the choleric  d the fellows  with which veterans of the old  bloodandthunder school are motly in cllned to treat it in the countries now allied against itusda it has a different aspect from that presnated ia despotic nations in euginud france or sardinia there is nobody wiho can nsy  lei catst moi ix the united kingdom everybody has more or leea ab place and interestin the commonwealth and it is to ima gine an impossible state of things to hold that the public in generalwillbesatisfied without hearing how the good of thie commonwealth is cired for in warfare but then it may be said  theae are the official despatches granted  we have them and priclhn documents theyhave been since the very commencament did the thermometric epistles of lardraglan give any accurate ideaofthecampigu and has not general simpsons correspondence been as confused as his generalship  in fact it is needless to speak farther on this portion of the subject we write now in reference to our part of the alliance alone and everybody knows that the depatche of the english commanders have ipoint of information been seldom worth the paper on which they were written but it will bs urged what they concealed it was right should be concealed and the public onght to have been satisfied with what they told and nothlng more we appeal to past experience for an answer to this who told ns of the soldiers perish ing in thae trenches from sheer lnanitionof the murderous mi management of the hospitalsand of the preservation of that senseless routine which almost destroyed a fine army twas it lord raglan wam it general simpson wan it dr andrew smith and if wo had been dependent on those official sources how long might the duke of new caatle hsve continued  to make things pleasant at the waroffice why we firmly believe that but for the nawspaders and their correspondents we would have had his graco at the waroffice still ay  and aberdeen in dreams of peace in the treasury too with mr gad stone and his friend at the admiralty carrying on sham hotilitlesa through the medium of a willing dundas and a reluctant napier we leave people to discover for themslves now that the peelites have gone out of office and throwrn off the mask what soer or a calamnty this would be and to discover if the correspondenta of the vmss have told anything eo valuable to the ruelana that it ihould counterbalance the discomfiture of this herd orussdas english alles and what after all have they told the russin the bloodandthunder vetera the lewises and the brights who hate the prnef would find it difficult to give to this a definite and tangible response they might be dsfid to erecify any one single plece of in ctrmation to thno nemy that was worth the carriago hack to sehastopolb isit ever considered or is lt not rather altogether kept out of dight that the

truth of the matter ill fit in a mthell com meandersinchief do not likc adverse criticim on their sbortcomings war ministers have a similar failing sad a egmilar need of it and chancellors of the exchequer donrt wish it to be known that taxes are squandered in the maic tenance of incompetent cousins since the present warr commenced there is hardly a aingle statesman or pubuc man of any pariy who haa not had his fing at the press and in the end they have all had the worst of it there is indeed one exception more honourable than the restwhom we mention with gratified feelings that ia lord palmer ston amid many and severe comments on his political conduct he has attributed neither cornption ribadry zor presumption to the erpositors of public opnion he aknowa teo well that suoh sccusations would be without weight and his pride never got so much the better of bis judgment asi to beget ridiculons charges on the contrary he has coniessed that by the views of the publio he baa ever tam pered his own opinions and one of the consequences is that there is now no more popular member in the house of gdmmonpl sinsw expresifatail exrfosion in a coafltyeetfrdsy orning about
