austriailaou our own cmpohdmvienna ocr about three weeks or a month slnce tlw times contained a leader in which it vas said that au vessels of war built at nicholaleff were floated on camels machines for lifting ships into the black eea and the following passage occurs in a letter signed  balliolenais which was contained in your edition of the thall the veasels constructed here at nicbolaieff are trans ported many versta down the river to gltbokoye whera they tuke in tneir canmon tackle c and proceed thence to the black sea upon camels on account of a sandbank near kinburnthe foregoing does not agree with credible private information that has recently been acquired on the subject and is in direct opposition to the account of nicholaieff given by the late miarshal armont duke de ragusa in his work on southern russia tldhe french general in  wrote as followsthe arsenal of nicolaieff did not appear to he in keeping with its destination or with the part which it wiu eomre day be caled on to play it oeems that there ought to be eovera covered docks large enough to contrin several veossls at tho eamo time the locality pzeuents eight spots which would be fitting and convenient one thlng of great utility has been donie the isaue from the port has been deepened  ea to render unecezary tho employment of camels for taking vessels to sebastopol in order to have them arme  vesels of  guns can now get out to sea without meeting i nith sny obstacles the marshal then drocecds to say that the outlay c of a few rallions roubles are probably meant would make nisholaieff a gnificent establishment as a port de conarudion in order that you should not auppose your oormppondent  balllolenzsla right and the dake de ragusa wrong it may ba as well to state that admiral lazareff himself showed the latter nicholaieff and its establishments the russian commander was so attentive to his dietia guished guest that he eent an order to the squadron then cruising in the black sea to return t sebato p so tham the marhal might be able to see it on his arrlval there tae warsw gun ship was launched and sent to sebastonol soon after the french general quitted smcholaieff the russians take their soundings in arshines which are  english inches in length in the west of europe it is supposed that the russian army in the crimea is in a great dilemma but here it is positively known that sucd is the case the day before yesterday princa gortschakoff was extremely dejected and bis friends are almoat as much cast down as he many austrian military men who even at the beginning of last month professel to believe that sebastopol was im pregnable and prince gortschakoff a great com mander now find fault with his more reeent disposi tions anddeclarethatbe has conmittedunpardonable blunders according to these tactlcians the large russian army on the tchernaya instead of remain ing inactive on the sth of september ought to have made a desperate attack on the lines of the allies another charge brought against the unfortunate commander is that be only had pontoons enouch to form use bridge across the sebastopol roads t is asked what wfould have become of the gar rison of sbastnpol if the enemys shells bad de stroyed its enly meaus of retreat  a few days sincea the military men of my acquaintance were divided into two parties the one did not doubt that prince gortechakoff was gradually faling back on perekop the other that he was resolved to maintain himself in the crimea but within the last t hours they have completely changed their opinions the party last mentioned novw think that the russians must quit the crimea and the other flatters itself that prince gortechakoffs line of retreat is already cut off the severe censure wbich is passed on the russian commander by his austrian friends must be considered an infallible sigu that his star which by the by has never shone very brightly is becoming extremely dimthe mysterious movements of the allies  bother the llussians sadly as you wl see by the following pessage which is from thellmilitar zeitsengas tha allies are concentrating their main columns on the skelia tho river stelia is probably meant it appears that mlarshl pelmsaier has reolved to tura the lefc wing of the erusisns a direct attack on the rusaian army from the lower valley of the tchernaya is not likely as up to the tb no proparations for
