the allied armicamp of the allied aims onrtah tchernaya oct fromx ou own corihspondentin the absence of stirring events on this side the news from eapatoria has rivetted the whole atten tion for the last two dayson saturday last the french and turklsh cavalry went out fram eupatoria on the road to perekop after having crossed the ztone bridge which leads over the creek running inland from sasik they formed in three colamne with the french cavalry in the centre and the turkish eavalry on both wings and pushed forward the russian outposts fell slowly back drawing up by degrees their reserves on all sides and bringing up their horse artillery they had however with a turkish commander no more to do and a succession of welldirected manoeuvres forced them to stand when the french cavalry charged in the most brilliant manner broke thera and took six guns and  prisoners the frenclh and turks follo wed them up nearly  miles inland and then returned with their trophies to epatoriait is stated that general dallonville the french commander of this expedition has pledged himself to cut off all communication with perekop if they eend him a division of french or english infantry or some more cavalry this statement is not so surprising as the fact that for nearly four weeks after the fall of sebastopol no measures have been taken to effect this object which must be always of the utmost importance whether one is of opinion that the russians iatend to evacuate the crimea before the winter or not in the first place a large cavalry force on the flank would be much more efficient in hastening a retreat than large columns of infantry or even cavalry in the rear and in the se cond a considerable force in eupatoria princi pally of cavalry at the present momentwhen the harvests north of the isthmus of perekop afford the best opportanity for filling the rus sdan magazines in the crimea and when the state of the roads facilitates the convoy of provisionswould force the russians to send an army with every convoy or else convince them better than anything else of the impossibility of re maining in the crimea during another winter the force which is now at eupatoria may inflict losses on the russians in the immediate neighbourhood of eupatoria but it is scarcely sufficlent to injure seriously and permanently even the communication by the isthmus of perekop now it must not be forgotten that this isthmus is not the only line of communication of the russians with the nortb without taking into consideration the spit or isthmus of arabat which from its precarious cha racter can scarcely be reckoned as a permanent line of communication the russians constructed in the course of last year a military road acroms the peninsula of tchongar to the east of perekop which leads down directly to simpheropol run ning nearly parallel bat not uniting with that coming from perekop to simpheropolhalfmeasures tterefore cannot greatly hinder the russians in their communications such en counters as that on saturday last will undoubtedly inspire the russians with considerable respect for the cavalry of the allied armies or ratner for the french cavalry for there is not a man of our splen did cavalry in eupatoria they will unless they have an immense advantage in numbers most stu diously avoid them but as soon as they retire the russian cavalry will come back in fact it is the best and easiest way of securing the safety of their line of communications to amuse the forces at eupa toria which are not strong enough to venture to send flying columns into the interior by a wiliothe whisp system of manceuvering even at the risk of heing like lost time caught occasionally and of losing a few hundred men and some gunsbat even these partial efforts of the french are better than the complete inactivity in which our cavalry passes its days in haranyi a look at the map or a ride about the baidar valley which at least ninetenths of our officers have made must convince everybody that although there are spots in which cavalry charges might be effected yet that this part of the country is not fit to act with cavalry on a grand scale besides as it could neither be expected that they should distinguish themselves in the trenches nor scale the heights of mackenzie or aito dar it seemns certainly strange that such a large force of cavalry should have remained without employ ment when there was scope enough for it in another place and when every one was burning with the desire to show that the charge of balaklava has not at all shaken the confidence of the men and officers un lets one supposes that the anxiety of avoiding one fault made us fall into another last year the re sults of the battle of the alma were certainly crippled from want of cavalry and might have created a conviction that it is very undesirable to de prive an advancing army of a proportionate force of cavalry but this year we have together with our allies cavalry enough for both purposes and cer tainly government cannot be accused of short comings in this respectthere were already several days ago rumours of an affair between the detachament of the th hits bars at xertch and the russians whicb as they were rather vague i did not mention in my last letter they are nvow a fact the details of which are i learn as follow the detachments of chas seurs dafrique and of the th hussars went out for a reconnaissance the former as first column the second in support the chasseurs dafrique being as much as  or  miles shead fell in with a body of russian cavalry numbering nigh  men and not being able to encounter them with such odd being only a troop of scarcely more than  men they sent back to the place where the husars were stationed to get reinforcements the commander of the latter unwilling to leave the position which was to insure a safe retreat unpro tected left one troop there and advanced with the other but as the distance was considerable and it was essential not to fatigue the horses he could only arrive at nightfall at the appointed spot the french chasseurs in the meantime had found means of retiring and when the morning broke the troop of hussars found itself alone and its retreat cut off by the russian cavalry whioh in following the french had come into their rear so nothing remained but to break a way through the enemys squadrons and this was done moat gallantly with the loss of only  mena niew proof that russiau cavalry has not the least chance even with such great odds in its favour in encountering english cavalry whether dragoons or  ussars light or heavy but it is likewise a slight memento of the oftenexperienced one might say atale truth that divided command lis just as bad if not worse for cavalry than for infantry and that it does not an swer better in field than in siege operationnothing new on the tchernaya the time passe in drilling and rifle and band practice enlivenedocasionally by a shot from one of tho russian iff i batteries on liackenais ridge they greet us every morning at daybreak as if to refute the idea of an iatention drf the russians to retreatthe piedanmuteae are busy with the railway and with huttihg if one sees the huts gradually rising and seemingly without trouble one cannot help d ating melancholy reflections remembering the difference from last year when trenches and want of tools and materlals made the construction of the most wretohed hovel appear a woik of glgantic efforts but the difference suggests on the other hand an agreeable prospect for the winter pleutyof wood and leisure enoughfor the construction of a town the sardinlans have evidently followed in tee construction of their huts the system of tartar shedssticks planted in the ground andinterwoven with branches the whole plastered over with mud and then the roof covered wlth earth or if possible wilth tiles collected from the rained houses in the xighbourhoodiihe french have now nearly completed the road across the valley which connects the feduikhine heights an the bank of the tchernaya with tneir rain road lrom kamleach which hitherto did not go further than the col de sslaklavathe turks zane have not yet made any arrange ments for the winter except serving out the short sheepskin coats to the men the cause of this is that their fate seeza not yet to be deeidedwhather they will remain hers or be sent to uia s the latter alternative is however the more generally as sumed and hopes are entertained that hy the end of this month the last fezcapped soldier will harve left this part of the crimea in the meatima only the chasseurs have goneat baidar the french still occupy their postion on the heights commanding the two roads to the north making occasional descents into koukoloussa and markoul on oneside and ozembash on the other they are still occupied in making the roads across the valley as well as up the heights pra ticable for an army the main road used by the tartars from baidar to bakshiserai is that which leads by ourkusta to ozembash and thence across the tehouliou and up by aitodor to the plateau but even this is wretched or at least was so before the french laid hands on it the other which leads up between the trvo points called by the tartars yaila bashi  head of the yaila aud te kuibair from its shape resembling au inverted wash ing tub is even worse and as it is only used occasionally as a cart road needs even more repar tion than the formerthe russians have entirely retired from markoul and koukouloussa and have with the exception of tneir outposts retired to fotsala at the confluence of several mountain streams with the belbek they have thrown up batteries to command the defile of the river and the two roads branching out from that point one along the banks of the belbek to alband and kutschuk sioren and thence to bakshiserai the other towards airgoul leading into tne road between bakshiserai and simpheropol besides the fort at fotsala the russians have likewise forti fied the passage near airgoul and kermentahik on the one sideaud near aiband and kutschuk sloren on the other the disadvantsae for an attacking party on this side will always be the want of space for forming for an attack and thus bringing up at once a sufficient number of men to carry a pointbut if report be true the russians are not about to be satisfied with the defence of their strong posi tions they intend pushing back the french divi sions from the threatening position which they have assumed on the heights above the valley of baidar they have sent for this purpose about  greek voluateers on the mountain of yaila that they may in case of a successful russian attack in front fall on the flank of the retreating french this movement may however be only to lnaure complete security from an attack on that side  for although there are no other than foot paths over these mountains yet where shepherds and cattle can climb up there is no reason to sup pose that an active chasseurapied or an enter prisiug zcuave could not climb up toonothing can exceed the willingness of the tartars to help us by giving information as well as what is left them of provisions it would be only de sirable that a greater strictness prevailed about pay ment for the people in the villages although rich enough before the war have been exposed to the exactions of russian troopersyesterday in riding over the position there i was told a tragic story of one of the tartars em ployed by us which seemed to have produced a great sensation among the people although as you will see he and not fate was in fault he was a native of the village of baza and was engaged to some tartar beauty at markoul when the french occupied the heights and the roads and when tho russians were no more seen in markoul itself his desire to see his bride was greater than would be warranted by prudence which is under ordi nary circumstances the prevalent feature of the tartar character and a natural consequence of  years of russian rule so he went down he was seen by some prowling cossacke who shot at him wounded him in the shoulder and then carried him off
