that the learned recorder spoke o ticket of leave as if it were established by the act which substituted penal servitude for transportation that was not eo and he the asdstantjudge believed thatno person sentenced to penal servitude bad yet received a ticeet of leave the systemnassumed throughout that the narties were simply individuals and not forming part as thzy did of a body of thieves who

loose on the town with ensu of money in their pockets on condition that they re turned to their former place of residence where they joined their old companions in crime and began their career again however bie might differ with other authorities on the system iteelf he thought they would all agree that wvhen tbeee men abused the leniency which had been shown them and returned to their old habits they should be severely punished ehe should sentence trelawney to eeven years penal servitude and roberts to eix and if tae authorities thought fit to reduce that term and again set them at liberty that layv ith them the court in the discharge of its duty considered those were the terms of punishment the cases merited as to williams be would be remanded for further inquiry as to nis previous
