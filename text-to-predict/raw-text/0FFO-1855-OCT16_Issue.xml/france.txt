which had marched through the valley of baldar was then  leagues distant from the general headquarters it occupied an excellent position and was in possession of the threa passes leading into the valleythe weather was fine in the affair of koughiu general dailonville only com manded  squadrons of cavalry whila the russians brought  into the fieldletters from asia mentioned that omar pasha was in stalling his army at batoumthe constififtionnel has the following on the move ments of the allied and russian armies iln the crimea the despatch of prlnce gortechakoffenables us to follow accrrately the progress made by the allies in tha interior of the crimea a long chain of mountains from which succes sively dezcend he tchernaya the tchonliou a tributtary of the tchernaya the belbek which owes ita origin to the jnnction of the ozem and the ozembaseh and fnally the ratcha rans in a parallel line with the northern coast of the crimea aul these river fotming in their course concentric eemicircles flovw from the south to northwest a little below the point of junc tion of the ozem and ozembash the belbek receives at jannissalla on its right bank tho kolukouloussa the russian army was poated along the tchouliou extending from the vilage of that name to aitoor it had its left vin along the belbek  its extreme left at kokkoz at the source of the ozem and its outposts at koukonloussa at the eource of the river of that name we are aware that the vangnard of the allies under the orders of general de salle had left sebhatopol in its rear and descended by varnontkh to baidar on the great highway which extends along the southern coast of the crimea at baidar it changed its direction tutned to the east pazsed thaelttle river baidr and rccrpied all the upper course of the tchernaya establishing itself strongly at binkmiskomia at teilon at the imeeting of the rivers baidar and tchernaya and lastly at savatka near the source of the tchernaya the extreme vanguard was pushed on to baga about five leagues beyond the river at the base of the range of moun tains which separates tho upper valley of thetchernaya from the valleys of the tchonliou and the belbek the de epatch of prtnca gortechakoff lead us to believe that the advanced guard ef the french army had crosed without resistance this ridge of mountains and that driving back the russians from roulcouloussa to janis ealla it had made itself master of all the positions along the river koulcouloursa andhad ultimatelyarrivedat the belbek itself if the french succeeded in establishing themselves at janissalla or in its environs the extreme left of the russians would be seriously compromised at kokkor it could only avoid being cut off by falling back on the ozem bash or on the katchs however that may be it is clear that the french are in possession of the district surrounding the sonrce of the tehoulion and have penetrated into the upper valley of the belbek they have croceed the chain of mountains which was the chief obstacle to their move ments and renders a campaign in the interior of the crimea very difficalt suppoing that they have not yet occupied janniealla btey can whenever they please descend either of the two valleys and attack the centre of the lueseians at aitodor or turn the left wing of the enemy by operating on the belbek the crimean campaign it is clear is carried on with vigour and commences under fortunate auspicestwo detachments of troods consisting of  men and belonging to the d and th regiments of the line arrived in paris yeaterday morn ing coming
