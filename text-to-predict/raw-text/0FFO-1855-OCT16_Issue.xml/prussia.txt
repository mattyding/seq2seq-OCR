prussiafrom our onvl corpxspotdxntberlin oct uyeterday the royal bank of berlin raised its rate of discount for bills from  to  per cent and its rate of interest upon security of goods lombard to l in august and september the bank had endeavoured to restrict its extent of business by increased tightness but towards the close of the last month the fear of the rate of discount being soon raised and the facility for employing money elsewhere at a higher rate than ruled here com peled the bank to enlarge its facilitiee the re port of the state of the institution at the cloae of last month shows as compared with the same data of last year inspecie a decrease of    bills discounted increase   advances on goods increase   state securities c decrease  i  notes in circulation icrease   deposits at call increase   gro and other liabilitiea increase the practice of giro i as far as i know peculiar to this country and consists ia a species of bills lesued by the bank accepted or not according to certain arbitrary rules and payable any time within a certain term fixed after which the bank does not hold itself unconditionally responsible for the amount these bills are drawn against cash or blus sent in for discount and furnish a circulating medium apart from the issue of notes by which the customer avails himself of the balance to his credit without diminishing the immediate resources of the

are now known but the difficulty of forming an opinion on the probable constitutionk of the fature chamber is increased by the circuma starce that of the  elections published  are of men as yet unknown to parliamentary life the general opinion seems to be that the result can hardly be other than a great gain for the liberal cause it not being in the slightest degree pro bable that of the remaining  elections chiefly in the rhine provinces and westphalia any additional superiority wiu be gained by the right side the catholics have almost to a man sided with the liberals who it must be borne in mind are the real conservatives whilst the other party who have arronated to themselves this denomina tion are the real disturbers of the constitution in a retrograde seneethe king aud queen left schloss bruhl early last tuesday morning and after visiting the cathedral at cologne returned to sans souci where they arrived the fellowing afternoon having stopped tbe evening of that day with the king and queen of hanover baron von manteuffel went as far as magdeburg to meet the king with whom he conferred during the farther ride to potsdam prince friedrich wilhelm joined his parents and the rest of the royal family at schloss brubl in the evening of the th inst and on the following morning accompanied his parents to bonne and thence to mayence the princess louisa who had not accompanied her mtother in her attendanea upon the quieen while ill at bruhl was to join her family at coblenzit appears that some considerable attention has been excited by a version that appeared in a london paper of a speech said to have been made at a pri vate dinner at homburg by our representative in frankfort sir alexander malet it is held here particularly in official circles to be highly improbable that a diplomatist who has hitherto observed all the rules of dis cretion and courtesy should use language cal culated to offend a government with whom we are still on terms of official amity and as further more the affair was a private dinner and sir alexander not accredited here this government unreservedly expresses its unwillingness and in ability to make of it any ground of offencethe resolution that the directors of the royal bank of berlin took a few days back to raise the rate of diacount has not been confirmed by the minister of commerce the reason he is said to assign is that the present position of the bank in view of the existing financial circumstances is not so anomalous as it was visavis the then state of things when the rate of discount was last raised i trust for the credit of herr von der hieydts practical common sense that he can give some batter reason for not confirming the resolution of the directors such for instance as the consideration that the frankfort fair in septein ber always causes a dimninution of the bank fuands here wbich howvever return after a few months that the drain of silver to austria is likelysoon to diminish as well as of paper money i towards the south of germany for both forms of prussian money have for a long time past borne an agio in those localities the cessation of these disturbing influences would doubtless render any such measure unnecessary for berlin is too little affected by the political and financial affairs of europe to make it expedient to provide against emergencies arising out of themberlin oct with very few exceptions the results of all the elections are nowv known but yet it remains an im possibility to form any reliable judgment as to the proportions of parties in the future house of deputies out of a elections s have fallen upon men new to public life while this furnishes a satlsfactory evidence of an awakeniog spirit in the better classes of the people it leaves it to the future to showv in what direction these rising energies will be exerted count sch aerin has been elected five times eherr von patow herr otto and herr rhodew each three times and seven others among whom is the minister of finance have been elected twice looking solely to the known principles of such members of the former chambers as have been elected on this occasion it would appear that the future house of deputies will be split up into fewer socalled fractions than has hitherto been the case the main divisions of the right side and the left which are styled respectively conservative and liberal but which are in fact reaetionary and conservative will for the future form the sole hos tile camps the fractions that formerly took up middle ground between these two camps have lost most of their adherents thus the carl fraction an intermediate between the extreme right and the right brings in only eight out of  of its members the bethmaunhollweg party whose ground was between the right and the centre has brought in only  out of  it has been mainly against this party that the machina tions of government officials have been directed its little band containing exclusively men of talent respectability and fitness for office to which also they openly aspire the socalled wilden or savages members who have not attached them selves to any faction have only brought in  out of  while the polish fraction which was always shillyshallying between its duties to the catholic chursh its fealty to the prussian throne and its leaning to its own nationality has pro cured  out of  to be reelected the et outstanding returns of elections that hava already taken place and the supplementary elec tions that will have to take place where various districts have elected the same man will doubtless somewhat vary the figures already obtained but the main features will remain unaltered the right side has brought in  out of  of its former members the left side  out of  the catholics however have succeeded with  out of  of their former strength and the extreme right the gerlach party has only lost two oat of  however satisfactory the awakening spirit may be and the earnestness that has led to the rejection of men who have taken up unde fnable intermediate positions it is already put beyond doubt that the future house of deputies vwill be couservative in itb majority of

more importantthese continued imputations to prussia of peaceseeking meddling propensities all proceed from auktria who thus discredits her rival with the western powers covers her own machina tions and diverts from herself the indignation that is due to her in far higher degree than to prussia for her duplicity and pusillanimity it is of im portance to us not to be under any delusion as re gards
