mr sidvsey hgrbert ard thr rev s aosborb at wiltonthe triennial commemoration of the opening of the wil ton parochial library and reading room was celebrated by a public tea party in the national schoolhouse at wilton on taesday last the wight hon sidney hlerbert alp presiding thero were about  persons prosent ircluding the family and visitors of mr and dlra herbert and among them mrs bracebridge the coadjutor of miss nightingale at the hospitale in the east and the hon anud rev s g oaborne as weu as nearly all the lending fami lies ine wiltou and its vicinity the tea being overmr sidney heibert said he had been asked by tho commiittee to preside over the meeting and had great pleasure in complying viith the request three years singca meeting was held to consider the best menus of establish ing in wilton a parochial readingroom which might give to all classes the opportunity ofgetting accs not only to book but also tothoes periodicals which were of somuchinterestby thoir accounta of those occurrences iwhich from day to day were taking place around us the reult of that meeting had been the establishment of the readingroom which he believed had been eminently successful the members now numbering  they lad a good supply of booke but tht supply was lirited and it was of importance to find meaws of increasing the library by obtaining fresh works when the old onea had been read this might be done by connoctlng themselves with a similar society and so making an ex change ot voluames when tae old stock was exhausted it was for them to consider what were the beat measures to adopt to make the readingrooa more efficient the resd ingroom was under the management of a commlittbe elected by the members in whose hands it rested to take what mes suros they shoald think expedient to extend the usefalness of the society at the same time ho would just thsrow out a suggestion from what haa been doae in similar insti tutions and if they thought the suggestion a good one they might consider how best to carry it into effect the eng gestion was whether it might be worth their while to hire books by doing which thsy would probably obtain a greater variety than was attainable by other means hle had himself brought some books with him which ho hopea the committee would do hitm the honour of accepting as scme contribution to the stock of the library cheers they must recolleot that while the managing staff of the readingroom required but few persons it they wanted an increased supply of books periodioals or newspapers the first thing was to increase the number of subscribers the chancellor of the exchequer of that institution a lnaugh bad placed in his hands a statement of account and ho thought there were not many chanceuors of the exchequer in tbese times who could perform such a feat as to produce a budget in which the expenditure did not emceed the income by more than s cheers and a laugh another subject they would have to consider was how to obtatn the means of having a series of lectures at thelr readingroom he thought when they compared the present state of wilton with its state three years before they would ese a great improvement in all things for instance the town itself wa greatly improved he remembered when it was thought a very great effort of municipal energy in wilton to have a watercart laugh ter latterly however they had not only got the water cart but they had gas and were about to have drainage and other sanitary means of improving the health of the town to return to the snbject of lectures he was informed bat by putting themselves in communication with the society of arts they could get lectsrers from london per fectly masters of every subject on which they were selected to lecture and supplied with extensive apparatus for illne trating them any of them might take down a book from the sbelves of their library and malke himself master of its ceutents but if thev got down a lecturer from london who was thoroughly master of the subject on which ho lectured he would give them a condensed impression cf it they would hear hts leatutre bnd that would give them an interest in the subject upon whicb he treatwd and would lead them to study and read till they also were mas sers of the subject in considering the suggestions he had juet made it had occurred to him to write to a gentleman wvbo had always taken the liveliest interest in matters of this hind and ile had naked him to come over and give them a lecture on the present occasion on those great events which durirg the last  months bad filled every household either with the greatest exultation or the deepest grief hre felt proud of the coursge and conduct so nobly displayed by our army during the war in the crimea hieconfi seedhe was lat ono of those who were disposed to fibd fault or to dapre cate theefforts made by the eoglish army in the late siege fe thought upon looking back uponthe history of the britishwars they would hardly find an instance in which in so short a time such eminent and decisive successes bad been gained as those lately achieved by our army in the ciimea choars when did tbey ever see in so brief a period such victories as were commemorated by the names of alma balaklava and inkermannames whieh would ever be household words in england s cheers they had on the walls of that room pictures of thoee battles and tboee great events and they had also the portrait of a lady wlom they all knew miss florence igebtingale whoas exertions whose sacrifices and whose selfdevotion had won for herself an undying name cheers miss nightingale was not among them that evening though they had among them a friend of here who had sbared with her and could bear testimony to the dangers and horrors which she bad gone through in the discharge of her higb miszion to that friend he wonld tender hts thbnks on their common behalf  but yet they might believe him when he said that whatever thanke whatever honour whatever reward they might give here would be as nothing compared to the reward hereafter when he wished to open that evenings meetizhby some ob servatlons from one who had himself visited those scenes of irterest it occurred to him that the rev s g borne also went out on a mission of mercy to mir osborne also he vwould teader his thanks for the efforts he had made on behalf of the suffering army that gentleman had vwit nessed thoee ecenes of suffering and had shared in thelr alleviation he had coneented to come over to wilton that evening and he was glad of the opportunity of introducing hins to his friends present hear hear he was sure they would give mr osborne every attention while he made some observateone on what he bad eeen they would listen to him with the greatest pleasure while he wee addressing them on a suhject of so much interest as those scenes which be bad pereonally witneseed and was nowabout to describe cheersthe eon and rev s g osojruc then came forward and was received with loud cheers he said he had unex pectedly received a letter from mr herbert asking him to come over and give the people of wilton a little crimean talk the only mistake mr herbert made in that applics tion was that be mr osborne had never been in the crimea and consequently could not of his own expe rience tell anything about it bnt if he had not walked in the scenfs of war htimelf be had walked in the dark shadow sf warif he had not witnessed the charge and the gory of the battefield he had seen the wounds and suffer mngs which succeeded it allusion had been made to one not there presentmies nightingalebut tbere was one among themmrs bracebridgewho had nobly supported her in her labours the work tbey had done the toils they bad undergone seouldhavebeen toosuch forthe endurance of an enelish manbut they were not too much for that of eug lieh women cheers when the future historian should give an account of that campaign not the least proud passage in it would be that which told how englishmen fought at inkermann and alma and amid the fearful fire of the redan aud bow english women also were found to shrink from no work however appauing to which duty called them cheers to those works they were movel by no motives oi worldly fame but by those only of tried christian feeling there were some things in which when men failed women could succeed and miss nightingale and mrs bracebridge who supported her would not be the leasthonoured in the history of that eastern campaign at the time those ladies went to the east the condition of the hospitals was mnost dreadful he himself saw them under the most trying circlmstancesafter the battle of inker mann at that battla the number of the wounded was  and there were no preparatlons made in the hospltalsfor anything like that number had it not been for miss nightingale and mrs bracebridge he could not conceive  arything more terrible than the english hosuital would have been  they who were at homa saw but oso side of the battle they rejoiced in the victory but had little conception of the woe attending it the popular idea of the eoldier was connected too much with his pension and his laurel leaf men did not think of the soldiers sufferings in the battlq field and after it in the hospital wbere on the long lanes of beds were to be found every idnd of woundl nd mutilation agai it was not at home that we could judge rightly of the character of the british soldier it wa ony w en really and earnestlyoengaged in his countryb defence fighting her battles and enduring wounds and privations for that countrys canse that we could see the good stuff of which the british officer and soldier were made cheera ihe would eppeal to bliss nightingale or mrs brecobridge if as much honour wvere not due to the soldier for hi gooad conduct in the hospital as in the field se could not tell them of the gallant charge in which the british cavalry faced the artillery which mowed them down on all eides nor of the gallant guards who left england their countras trid rising in the same clothes in which they had sanded au the month of august after going through very suffearing sp tto the day when they repelled thejsusanarsotsat nkeman h was not present to wt nesa those exploits but be did see the hospitals be could bear testimony to the sufferinga of the wounded within tbem to the efforts of miss nightinzale and mar braca bridge in their behalf no one could form an idea from the inspectionof the comfortable wellmanaged hospitals of england of the state of the military hospitals in the east those who had only seen their cleanly and orderly wards little knew what those ladies went through in their work of reforming and purifying the hospitals in the east lot them conceive what must have been the sufferings of the wounded when they amounted to thousands and when thoee whose duty it was to attend to them were as haraswed as themselves it was at such a moment that theee ladlies ttepped into the gap restored order and made these honi tale wbat they ehouid have been they infesed hope by their presence when withont it there had been despair it was not without cauee therefore that he said the future page of history would hand down the names of these ladies as the beat and noblest of their sex they sought not however for famethey aked not renowvn their only motive bad been the love of god and obedience to tho divire commandto love thelr neighbour as them selves to turn to lighter sabjects he had brought with him two or three things trophies of war and which might posslbly be of romui interest for instaneo there was a iabre taken from a ruesian on the morning of the battle of inkermaun it might be ssid thore was nothing remarkable abouttbat piece of iron and brass but hb thought everr tbing was of intereet wblih bad bee coilgraed lu taq dstruction of human life in a cause which its owner no doub as much believed to be right a we ourselves helleved to bs wrong yes we might have our opinion on the warvwe might deem it our duty to shed blood to drive the russians to those terms which only for the safety of erjope could relizea lating peace but theenemy alsehad theiropinaios however bad we might deem the iuasesul cause we mut admit that at all events they fought like men who felthemeelves in the right we could not dispute their bravery though we deprecated its direcblon and however proud ve might be of having conquered them we mustown that they are an enemy worthy of our armn hear hear no doubt the hand which held the sword he now exhibited was actuated by the same emotion as the english solcier it was very true that we were free ana the ruslans wera slaves but they were stillrmen lihe ourselves and there was no reason why they sbould fear death more than wo thea while wve were glad to procleim ourselves the conquerors let us still honour the brvery wbich bo long disputed our victory england and france had found no common enemy and the more honour wfas there in the vmtory they had wion cheers adverting to what he called the fanaticism of the russians lr ozborne proceeded to bay tbey were fighting for their czar whom they worshlpped with a feeling of ave and reveronce for his poswr scsrcely less than they felt towards god him self that monarch wvhom they had so blindly zeversnctd had been talien from them many other names since the commencement of the war had become names for history rather han of living men tfe coiuld recollect many with whom he had himself had to contend on certain points who sincethe campaign commenced were among the dead the russian czr whoee ambition had originated the war was gone to his account we as a christian natlon had felt it our bounden duty to make the canes of liberty our cause to protect the weak against the oppressor tht nothing wrong should be done he trusted that we felt so on sure and certain grounds we must not forget howevr that the russians also went to battle for what they felt to he tht caus of religion and justice thay had all heard of ths great mass wbich was clebrated by the russian army before they attackedus at inkermann there was real if mistaken religion in that observance and aw auth we were bound to honour it therussians had a strongfeeling that they were right and in that feeling they went to war uporn the bodies ofthe slain rulsians were found charms some of them were fostened round tbe head and others composede of enml pieces of brasswero round the breast it was the custom in war to pillage the dead and gur men got hold of these cbarms in a somewhst summary manner taking them from the necks of the elain and awouded r osborne here exhibited one of these charmp being a smail picture of the virgin and child which he stated to have oeen taken from a russan officer that officer was killed by a bayonet thrust and they would obssrve that the blow passed just above the charm the russians considered that if thb blow had rtcackthe holybody of the image the wearer would have bean safe the next tropby he had to show them was as they would see nothing but a leather bag used ordinarily to contain tobaecoin fact wiat as familiarly called baccybag he would however sooner part with all the relics he had brought from the east than that bag for it had belonged to one of the bravest of men a man who had even arousted the apathy of the turks and excited their admiration ho meant the gallant butler whose energy had saved silistris and compelled the rus sians to raise the siege cheers it had been given him mr oborne by major nasmyth the next thing he had to show them was a pair of boots mnade of russien leather by alu ler of st petersburg who he supposed was the  lloby of the russian capital they had beionged to no less a man tban prince menschikoffthey were in fact blensebikoffs boots found in bis carriage when it was taken by our troops after the flank marcb the way in which they came into his hands was this orders had been issued that there sbhould be no plunder but it urluckily hap pened that an english officer was seen early in the morning veith a turkey in hbi hand whereupon the soldiers followring the presumed extample of the officer proceeded to plunder also among others major na smyth got hold of those boots which he gave him with an intimation that they had been taken irom mlenchi ikoffs baggage certainly neither the prince nor his shoe maker would ever have anticipated when he first put them on that they would be produced for the amusnement of a tea party at the wilton readingroom laughter it was an exemplification of the one btep from the sublime to the ridiculous he had seen accoawn in the times and other papers that certain meda h were gven by the czar lnicholas to his troops vwhen they interfered in ehngary on which medals was an inscription in ruesian aecribing the subjugag tion of hungary to gad himself he hol also one of them inhis pposeeeion whiali he would send round the room along with the baote for their inspection mr osborne then after expressing his reeret that he had too short a notice to prepare a regular addres and thanking his audi ence for the kindness with which they had received him proceeded to advert to the conduct of the british army in the east those wvho had only seen the soldier in the barrack or in tbe street shiuld see him iu tho field or on the bed of suffering ehe bad seen while in the east a coaustaut stream of o ficers going backwards and forwards and so na exceptionable were they in conversation and deport ment that he would not have cared to take his own daughters to dine with tbem for a more christian feeling he had never witnessned a any table place the soldier in the field surrounded by dangers anduriation and he vras a very different being to what englishmen generauy supposed the english bsodier wamlight of heart but once ssthim to tbe serious work for which behad enlisted iand bis character became changed for he felt that the interest and honour of hi country w ere involved in his own he mr osborne went to the east with a very diffrent feeling towards the soldier thaii the one he now entertained he now honoured the sldiers for he could realize the feel ing uder which they went forth to suffer and to die in the discharge of their duty to their country cheers he trusted that when the war was over honour woull be done to all alikethat they should not have soms greeted like the stars of a theatre while othera wee neglected  but that one and all in the english army would receive the honours asd rewards to which their valour entitled them as to the working of institutions eimilar to the present the anniversary of which they were met to commemorate he had always felt much interest in read iugrooms for the working classes  as he never could se vwy the comforts and adantages of education should lie confined to tbose of his own condition in life iholdin this opinion he believed tht be was hound to extend thoge blessings as far as it could be done towards others he had observed one siogular thing in those who had not bean regularly educated he had noticet among the attendans upon the classes of cify inotitatioes that sometimes the most intelligent and sbrewd answers to different questions were given by wehing men they seeered to have a kind of microscopicfaculty wzhich enabled them to see the ons fact presented to them more plainly than others whoso minds were diverted into a variety of channels he cauld no believe that the extension of edacation among the laboarirg clessea was calculated to makethem agit torsand discontented subjects education had of lhte years been largely extenied among ail claes but he would awk had itmade the higher or middle chlsses any ee loyal than they forerly we the coontended on the contrary that as education tended to make its posessors more tbonsbtful and frogal than the ignorant it was more likely to place them in a position where they would not envy tho vwhl owned broadlane or becomo low wild feeptice he avowed his belief that no class had any more rght to  mnopoly of education thai to a monopoly of the light of heaven cheerson the motion of ir hf lllackmore a vote of thrinks was acorded to mr oaborneforhis interestingaddress and thre cheers were severally proposed and given for mrs bace bridge and for mr and mrse herbertmr sidsey hsituxre after briefly acknowledging the compliment proceeded to sy that never was therea greater proof given of the value of efucaftion than wab supplied by the letters sent home by british soldiersa sic the com mencement of the war he thonelt that there never was a more justifiable war then the present one cheers ha would say that even those whn thought no war justifiable could not but feel sympatby with the merits of such soldiera as those of england he found in tloae lettes evidence both of the tenderest affctlon and the deepet and most earnest piety in all ranks he ssid this with the greatest pleasure because he had himself laboured in the caes of army education and the result showed what coul be dono by educating the minds of their soldiers wwhle they were still as able to do their dutyg a before some persons thought the life of a soldier was incompatiblh with that refinement bestoweed by education and believed tht edu cation would nmake him lees prompt in the discharge of his dutles in the bottlefield hot never did any men do their duty more nobly than those men did theirsmen who had received that education which enakbled them to write de scriptione of battles which the pen of the historlau himself might well envy he did not know if there were any eoldiers who had gone from wilton but he trusted that whenever england wanted help the stalwart arms and stout hearts of her eons would nevar fail her cheera the rlght hon gentleman concluded by asking the assembly to give three cheera for the armythis appeal vws heartilye rsponded to followed by three more for the navy and a final round for the qaeen after whlch the meeting separated
