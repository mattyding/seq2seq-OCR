enirely sub dued the insurgents are stil scattered over the country but the outrages with which their career commenced have in a great measure ended the hope of supernatural aid has failed them their leader has been captured seven thousand of those ngaged in the outbreak have surrendered they find tnat their bows and arrows have not the slighteat chance against our musketry and that any mass of them however large is scattered by any detachment of our troops however small as the movement has thus become as purposeless as it is im potentas the malcontents are without a guide or a purposeand as they find themselves shot down or made prisoners whenever they are overtaken all idea of serious danger from them has ceased they are said to be endeavouringto emigrate withtheirfamllies deeper into the mountains in hopes of finding a placs of refuge so remote that justice will not reach them their recent outrages cannot be overlooked and the plau formerly hinted at of deporting them wholesale to

trifling outbreak in the rewa caunta a province belonging to the guicowar between a couple of rival sects of ilahomedans the political agent miajor wallace to avert bloodshed called outs couple of
