down to them and proceeded to detail the difficulties which mlis nightingala and her nureslid to coutende with on their marival in tw east when they first mad their appearacoo at scutari thera wae neither kitched coals nor candlesnothing in fact but the naked walds they sdon sat td work however to snake the place comfortable and in tvr days they effected a great chbnge in the interior ppsaranca of tho building they had at one time nearly  sick and wounded ana if the bed had been placed at feli length they wvould have extended tbree nmie and  yards many of tho aseistantsurgeonsvery young meaware attacked with fever fronm sleeping in the corridors that ran round the hospital these rooms were so situated that when fires were lighted in them the draught brought all the impure air of the bospital into them caesing fever ant other diseases the consequence was that  of tbese young men were attacked by the disease and of theae four or five fell victimsn to it when the band of female nurses nirat arrived they wera desplsed for their want of medical slkill add tisliked for their womanly cuneosit but two or three days after when  wounded men were brought down they dresed the wouede of  of them and waited upon them with the utmdat ten derness and ssiduity the nedical men then began to think they might be of some nse as an instance of the usefulness of those nurses he might mention that  paus of arroviwcot and  pails of milk were ervu odt ill ledeg td the pa tvm every uay in acdition to a great quantity of eago aztd that this lasted for many months xad it not been for tslc tpces fond many things of rhich they stood in urgent want couid never have been obtained so dw fective were the arrangements that he himself had been eniployed with  soldiers to help him for aboat a fortnight often standlng all day in the water landing the stores at balaklava which had beer purchaeed by ilac timie fund a great number of thlnughsd been procured bymis nightingale through the instrumentality of the fand which could not have been had from any other source cheers mr bracebridge then ernmerated the day consumption iae one hospital with the view of showing the quantity of stores required among the various artcles of diet were  zicb puddings  gallons of sago  gallons of arrowroot  oottles of port wine  of macsls  dozens of eggs  chickens and other things in ptoportion this was not for one day but continued for months he next referred to the manner in which the commandant the commitssay and the purveyor of stores executed their duty there were for istance orly three cnus amona  men and no knives and forks being a witnesw of the inconventence entailed by this scarcitr he went to the purveyor and told him of their want the answer ha got w  it is not my busnees it is very hard on my department to have to find such things he dir brace bridge thought it much harder on the poor men who wore sick and who stood in need of those necessaries he next visited the commandant of the hospital who said that roldier had always knlves and forks as well as spopos in their knapsacks it ws in vain that he informed thi gentleman that the soldiers had been ordered to throwaway their lknapacks by the direction of iord raglanthat somea ofthe pour men had not a clean shirtior six weeks and that many of them were even without a shirt the cdm mandant however would have nothing to do with it merely reiterating that it was a general order that soldiers should always carry knives abdforks and spoons in their imapsacle if ever be fdt disposed to qgurrel with any ione it was with dir wreord the purvevor but his orders from liss nghtingaie vwerenever to quarrelwith zany one and he was obliged to obey orders his only reply tothere genutemen was i am very glad i knoe your mmnd we will nov come to a hotter understanding they had many friendly converstions after this it ws of no use whatever to tell the functionaries at the hospltal i that the men had been told to abandon their knapsacks as the only answer was that every soldier was supposed to bave them in his knapsack and that however necas sary they were no more could be served out lib nlightilngae however took a different view of the subject and manaad to supply batween novembar and febhoary  shirts and  flannel shirts and from february to midaummer  more another want which they felt in the hospital was the scarcity of ampata tive tables a greek and an italian carpenter were directed to make some and after some trouble in making plans asd frequent consultations two were made one of them proved of great service but the other met wlth a most re markable adventure some young gentlemen in the hos pital who wanted firewood sawed off one leg for that pur pose and the practice was continued until the legs were all gone and the table was rendered worthless miss nightingale expended the sum of l in form stools and tables which showeed the wretched condi tion in which the hospital mnst have been asd te nsecesiy of sending otut nuarse and persona unconneoted with the government as a proof of the obstinacy of the english medical daprtmnt he might meation that they continued to pursue the old system of treatment nowith etanding the advice of the french physiclans fronm this casee alone not taking into account the climate many par snns perished who might have bean saved had it not been for those prejudices many of the poor men brought td the hospital were completely worn out and au the mnelical skill in the world wonld not have restored them to health many men whose ages varied from  to  looked when they were broughtinto theboospitalfromn  toslyesr of ege tais appearance was caused by bad food want of proper clothing exposure in tbh trenchoe and overworl the list of deaths at this time was terrible the average being for many weeks  aday upwards of  gallant soldiers wera buried in the cemetery at scutar which had bean ceded to her majesty by a firman from the saltan a waul was built round the cemetery to protect it and this piece of ground in which the bodies of  gallant soldiers reposed wsothe only piece of land which the british crown could cal its own in asia minor he had a word or two to say in dispraise of some of the medical gentlemen he would not mention names bat though one of them was of superior rank hts deeds were far from being supetior he actually took the butterr from the poor sick men and threw it away this butter had been given them by miss nightingals ordered by the medical men or purchwsed b themselves the excuse which he made for this heartless action was most frlvoloms the men he said ought not to have butter as it was against medical ctiqostte ifz they had bultter they would be having cakes next and from that jr bably they would have nuts and afterwardis perhaps take gin hie therefore took the butter from them end threvit away another cruel act of this man was worbhy of smntion at the head of each soldiers bed was a shelf placed on purpose to hold any little things that the poor eek men might want one poor fellow had thee bibles and three tracts on bis shelf and this doctr when visiting him said  what is the meaning of this litter the man replied that two of them were bibles given him by bis comrades as keepsakes and that the other was his own the answer was you dont want three of one sort the doctor then took two of them away and placed the other on a table in the centre of a room whera the poor man could not get at it having undergone two operations and hbaing had his feet amputated the poog man however recovered notwithstanding that a thid oreration was imminent and ho was noe in englsnd he ir brscaebridge took the two bibles and kept them tul the man left the hospital when ha returned them to bim the third b ibl that had been romoved was bronuht back and placed at his bedside by miss nightingale mr bracebridge then referred to th quality of the bread sand beef which had como uiderhiss owu notice the beef was tough and tasteless and so hard that it could be chipped vith a knife like a piece of word the pudding could scarcely be eaten as it was impio ssie ta soparate it the fault was entirely in cooking but when hl syoyr came out things went on much better themeat before he made his arragemnents was so bad that the mea ate part of it raw and burled the remainder in the trenches the mnen had no fuel or proper means of cooking and from their excessive work in the trenches were notable to go in search of fnel to cook their meal the frenolrwerwt much more expert at making a fire and cookingvictualsand they always managedgan well that every man hadl cup of hot coffea from a boiling caldron before he went ta the trenches and a meal of bread and soup on his return prepared by a comrade whose duty it was to attend to th cultnary department of the regiment the french too wore shoes wvich they pulled of when tbey came from the trenches and drew on dry stockings the english soldiers would not pul off their bootsand hence they got hwd feet dirllracebridge next alluded to the dook a balakiaa and spoe in high terms oi the arrangementa made by the late admlral boxes and hias indefatigable zeal in endeovouring to get thiings into some degree of order mr bracebridge concluded avery interestingaiddressby expoes ing hla conviction that the means thlch the alliea wrere nowr
