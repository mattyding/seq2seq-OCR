the probability of her arrival here had ordered her to remain to be paid off on christnmasday during a most dreadful gale ithe tynei fell in with a french bar in great distress evidenced by her havisg the national flag half down on her three mast heads the tyne a once closed with a veiew to bail her and endeavoured to ascer tain the extent of her distress but isuch wvas the violenice of the gale that all attempts at verbal communicatioft were impracticable the gale raging furiously wvith a heavy ea it was considered next to impossible thiat a boat could live on the water if any attempt sthould be made to board the bark at this juncture idr james penn master of the tyne grandnophew of the late wvell known intrepidkigspilot of cawsand seconded by lieutenant selwyn of th same ship at the imminent risk of their lives nob volunteered to board the vessel supposing her crew wishedl to abandon her and take refuge on board the tyne on reaching the bark it was ascertained she had lost her rud der and the whole of herbulwarks onth starboard side she was also in a very leaky state short of provision and water and her crew so exhausted fromn pumping c that the were totally uinable to continue their exertions or in any way assist the vessel lieutenanit selwyn promised on the part of captain glascock that the tyne should stick by him and render himn every possible assistance as seen

estimated at  from uarseiues to havre she was quite a new vessel copper bottomed and fastened there can be little if any doubt that if the rudder had not been supplied sho must have been lost either off ushant or scilly nothing culd exceed tho disinteroeted and generous conduct of captain glascoek his officers and crowfor had they brought the vessel into a british port a large amount of salvage must have been their reward but like true british sailors they sacrificed all pecuniary consi derations and devoted themselves entirely to pre serve a valuable ship and cargo belonging to the merchants of their once powerful enemy captain glas cock was not in bed for five nights and was on bdatd the bark superintending the shipping the rudder and ren dering his best assistance we sincerely hope that king louis philippe will duly appreciate this noble conduct and prevail on lord a ckland to promote lieutenaat selwyn and itr penn fox their intrepid conduct in first boarding the bark and
