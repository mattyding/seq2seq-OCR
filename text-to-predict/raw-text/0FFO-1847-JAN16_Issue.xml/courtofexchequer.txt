the club in question was a common gaminghouse and the firat question was whether his lordship was correct in ruling that that plea was supported by the facts proved which as was contended went to show that whist and hazard were constantly played in the house in order to support the plea it was not necessary that tho house in question should be shown to be open to au the world it was enough if it

the corit roseit appeared that the plaintiff waa the administrator to the estate and effects of a porson who in fact ras his own brother but who adopted tho name of jackson and became a hnrsedealer and kept a yard in oxfordstreet at this period a woman of the namo of barnes lived and cchabited with him as his wife mrs barnes whoad husband it was stated is still alive had several children of whom two were daughters who in couse of time were sent to paris for the porposo not only of acquiring the language but of learning the parisian style of drossmaking at length about the year  jackson launched forth as the proprietor of tho hippodrome hore the business was tery successful until the hand of a railwav company grasped at a large portion of the land andt from the mo ment the great western railway company took poses sion of and cut up his land the eatablishmont began to de cline until notwithstanding ho had then only devoted them as hunting stables he became a man of ruined circum stances whereupon he transferred the property to mrs walpolo the mother of mdrs barnes and went over to france where he with that lady commenced the business of an egg merchant in  he returned as that under aking had not proved favourable and going to mrs wal pole who had some time previously been accepted as thee of tho property by the agent of mr neild the land lord claimed to be taken in as he was in a forlorn state this demand was acceded to and presently he was appointed the manager of the concern at a salary of  s per week in the meautime the two aisses barnes who had gone to paris with a view to the perfecting of their education and dressmaking acquire ents bad both married the one to a m cheronnier the other the defendant in the present action to a lir walker both resided in frauce but upon the death of mr lvalker in  the latter came over and resided at the hippodrome or hunting stables establishment with her grandmamma mrs walpole who as has already beon stated had become the recognized lessee of that property and whose cmie upon jackson going to france had bleen put up on the sth of may  the whole of the property was by deed transferred over to the diefendant and one of the conditions of that assign ment hads been that jackson should be retained as the manager of the establishment as he was then at a salary of z s per week with a continuance to himself and his family of the apartments they at the time occupied on the promises and furthermore that should the defend ant subsequently let the property that that same condition should be one of the provisions in the deed unless jackson should be inclined to forego the claim the concern at this penrod was not overprosperous and with a view to the obtainment of a subsistence for herself and parents and the hope of getting sufficient to carry on the concern until a more favourable day should arrive the defendant went upon the stage and enterel into engagementsat the birmingham and cheltenhamn and also at the mlarylebone theatres at each of which she played with considerable success the defendant when in the country sent remittances home almost every week and on one occasion had forwarded as her sister said the sum of t as tho profits of her benefit at cheltenliam in the year  however it appeared that the brotherin law of the defendant hm cheronnier moade several pecuriiary advances to enable her to carry on the business with betcer effect anl the result was that a marked incroaso thereon ensued in  the sn of the plaintiff the nephew of course of jackson went to live at the concern to assist in its conduct and about that period be stated in his evidence thero were between  and  subscribers to the  huntingstables and ridingschool the latter branch having shortly before been added to the concern it was elicited in the progress of the evidence that upon one oceasion cheronnier had sent over the sum of  for the purpose of enabling the defendant t purchase a horse called pygmalion  guineas were paid for that animal but in a fewmonths afterwards it was sold for i at thlis period the defend ant opened an account at the london and westminster bank and the first um paid in was this ide tical  there was a short time afterwards a sum of  s also paid in besides other moneys a portion of  of that particular amount having been lent by the plaintiff to his brother the deceased h jackson and that loaa was repaid akvances all this time were being made to the defendant by st cheronnier until at length the amount had reached  and in  a deed of partnership was entered into between the defendant and xi cheronnier on condition of bis mraking a further advance so as to make his capical in the conmcrn as much as  in this deed of copartner ship however there was inserted the old proviso that jackson should be retained as manager of the con corn at a salary of  s per week and the consinance of the apartments to the uses of himself and family unless he should think proper to forego the benefit jackson died in the month of july  and about a month afterwards the plaintiff and his son being on the premises inquired how be had left his property  to this query the defendant replied that he had left it all by will to irs barnes or mrs jack son as she had long been called the plaintiff thought that such a course was somewhat natural considering the terms upon which his brother had been living with mrs barnes some months afterwards however he discovered that no will had been made and therefore he had administered and in the character of administrator it was that he now sued in detissue to recover either the property or its value which had belonged to his brother at the period of his death after the demise of jackson the defendant had disposed of five borses for  and then with the value of the remainder and the furniture the claim appeared to amount to a vmst mass of evidlence was called on the part of the plaintiff of course to prove that even up to the day of his death jackson had acted as and was the proprietor of the establishment and therefore that the plaintiff was entitled to recover as the adrmirnistrator to his estate and effects and on behalf of the defendant to showv thatseveral yearsago in  he had assigned over to his motherinlaw mrs val pole all his right and title ad thatthatladyhad ubsequently reassigned it over to the defendant by whom as by mrs walpole jackson had beea paid a weekly salary for acting in the capacity of manager of the concern it was proved too by the taxcollectors that the defendant was assesed for the payment of their respeetive taxes one of them went on to say that in  when be had had occasion to press jackson for his arrears of the poorrate that person had said that the establishment was not his although the assess ment at that time was in his name but that he was like prince albert he was paid so much a week and had the run of the kitchen it was further proved that the de fendant paid the rent and all the taxesthis was the outline of the casethe jury retired at a quarter to  oclock shortly after halfpast  oclockmlr baron rolfe who had some hours previously quitted the court leaving word that he
