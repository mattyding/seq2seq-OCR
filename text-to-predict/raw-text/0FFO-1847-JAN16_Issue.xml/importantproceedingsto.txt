importanvt proubbdings to mercantsfactorls and brokbrsin consequence of a dispute having arisen in the city among the several brokerm engaged in the hide trade on the one hand and a numberof leather factors and country dealers and tanners on the other relative to a brokerage charged by the brokers to buyers of that article a large and namerous assemblage of au parties concerned took place on thurs day at the london commercial sale room mincinglane on the occasion of a public sale of a portion of that descrip tion of merchandise the auction took place in the room no  by mr nalder of the firm of dyster nalder and co and the objectionable clause in the conditions of sale was the following the goods to be taken with all faults and defects as they are lotted and to be cleared away at the buyers expense in  days from the day of sale and the remainder of the purchasemoney less  per cent discount with at brokerage of ahalf per cent to be paidbythebuyersinto the hands of the seuing brokers en receiving the order for the delivery of the goods or on the prompt day at the option of the selling brokera  and the roweighing recounting or delivery of part not to be considered a delivery of the whole ifo allowance of interest on any payments made prior to the promptat a few minutes pastl oclock the room was oponed and immediately after a general rush took place and the room was soon filled loud and general were the complaints and protestations on the one hand and the determination to re st all aggression on the other every man prepared him self with a catalogue and a pen to prepare for the sale but it was easy to perceive that more interest was excited by the expectation of a coming contest than the price of the hides or the competition for the article which was aboat to be put forward to the highest bidder there were noise uproar confusion laughing talking and lances of suspicion ox changed on all aides and looks of defiance on the part of the belligerents but in a few moments all these varieties of feelig disappeared whon the  business of the hour com menced n the midst of this mercantile babl mr nalder ascended his chair and was about to proceed whenmr

care about you cheers countercheers and the usual con fusionthe proceedings were carried on in this mannor for at least half an hour when all except those immediately engaged in the conflict enjoyed themselves with the scene and at last it was resolved that previous to any sale being gone on with mir tanner should be alrowed to make his statementmr tagner accordingly proceeded he should he said regret very much if in the course of his observations any thing fell from him which should at all be personal to mr nalder or indeed to any one with whom he might differ on that occasion he had received great kindness from him and it was therefore not his intention to say anything to cause him the slightest pain he did however think that when they came there as buyers and heard from the broker that he represented the body ofmerchants he was entitled to claim for himself and his friends and for a body equally as large many of whom came at a great expense from the country some consideration and to protest against not being permitted to say anything on a subject of such vital impor tance to their interests until the present sale was over they said it was nof in the power of the broker to enforce guch a condition legally that it was new as a rule of con tract and that if the resolutions of the board of aldermen were worth anything this regulation could not be enforced the ninth rule of that board saidmr nadxerit is not worth a bit of papermr riggif wo have done anything illegal you have your remedymr mortimonredont interrupt mr tanner we shall hear you afterwardsmr taicnmt continuedthe th resolution of the board says that no broker shall take or receive double brokage that is to say from both buyer and seler of the seame article but from the buyer or seller only whichever it may happen to be that shall employ him and that no broker be employed for both buyer and seler in the same transaction except only in regard to purchase madoeby brokers at public sales and then always in such cases that the said purchases be made boi f de and that tho name or names of the principal or principals be entered in the brokers book immediately after the conclusion of the days sale or the space of  hours next after every such transaction and the brokers oath is as follows whereas a b ia by the court of lord mayor and aldermen of the city of london allowed to be

as aforesaid then this ebligatiois to be void and of none effeot o else to be and remain infol force and vrtue having read that rule let them now look al the second condition of sale a et down in the catalogue they were charged ahalf per cent as buyers and the sellers or owners of the article another brokerap aud wea lt not le would confidently ask directly at variance with the article he read sud grosely illegal there must be gome mercbants preseet and he saw one just below who must be aware that such a practice as that must eventually shut out competition for goods that it must be at a loss to their interests and it waswelu known that hideewere always sold at liverpool without such a charge cheers then why should any broker attempt to do not only what was clearly illegal but what was not prsctised elsetwhere cheers it might be sid that it was a custom but tnat was no ground for its coatinuance nor was it any reason wh an unjust charge should be made cheers and cries of no no he for one was sorry to see men who caued theitselves free traders and who argued a good desl about free trade clamour for and carry out an object which was so much opposed to their professions hear hearmr powxzdo you refer to me mr tannï¿½ryesmr laionewe wish to be as friendly as possible with every one but lawyers will tell you when we do an illegal act at the same time i can give any instructioa i pleas to my broker and you cannot prevent memr tahneain the observations i made i alluded to the sworn brokersmr lafoxei conceive i havc a right to direct my broker to demand  per cent if i like above the pricemir mioaronsthen you destroy the london market and make one in liverpool cheers mnmr laponxyes but i can stiu act as i please oh and as to the assertion that the london market would be destroyed by that of iaverpool that could never be lon don would always be the best market because there was more capital and more regular sales during the time the commission is paidmr tanteiabut surely itis not fair to charge brokers commission and make the buyer pay for it the broker ought no doubt to be paid we dont refuse to do so but what we contend for is that if we go to the docks and pur chase according to our own judgment and ability without the aid of any broker we have no right to be called on to pay him it is illegal to inflict onehalf per cent on us in any case for exercising our own judgment and we contend that comning to a public sale we being factors have no right to be made liable to such a chargemr naldelyes but you have raised your commission mr tanneryes but we give a guarantee to our cue tomers there was a gentleman in the room that moment who laid out from  to   ayear in liverpool which he would then lay out in london cheersmr nalnde was anxious to say a few words in explana tion particularly as there were some country gentlemen present the charge now made was called a new one al though he believed there was net a ma present who did not pay it over and over againmr mortmnorer have not we must not be put downwe nmut be heard continued uproarmr tannea again proceededthere is no precedent for this charge in any branch of trade in the city alany per sona at great expense were obliged to abandon the london trade and believing the system to be most unjust he trusted they would yield to the demand made upon them particularly by those gentlemen from the cotmtry several of whom were presentmr naldese observed thatit was his duty to disabuse the minds of those country gentlemen wh were present that the brokers did not chargre the half per cent for nothing he should therefore state the factsmr tamxeedo do  great clamour i should not have risen at all but to request he would name the party to whom he alluded for i shall not sit here and listen to an insinuation of that kind thrown outmr nalder continuedhe should like to know where the present proceedings bean or where they were to end but at all events hc sho d go on with his sale for he was certain the country buyer paid his factor for all chargesmr moamoanyes but that is no reason why we should pay uiproarmr nalderit is the constant practicemtr mioavuonnit is not the constant practice for i never paid it contined cheering and confusionmr riogon what ground did you refuse to paymr mloatioaabecause i refuse it you have no right to call upon me for ray motives or intentions i have a right to exercise my own opinion either to pay or withholdjust as i pleasemr powell said that they wished to do what was best for their counntry friends and yet see what a noise was made absut a half per cent they were charged as free tradera with following a practice contrary to the opinions they held now he was a liberal and a reformer and no doubt the ancient rule of the city was that no broker should receive brokerage from a buyer and seller at the same time as had been alluded to by mr tanner but that law was repealed by the reform act if it were a rule there was not a broker within the city of london who did not break it on every article every day and in every hour of the day there vras only the exception in favour of slavegrown sugar and tallow and it was well known that the question then under discussion had been tried in the queesa bench where it was held that custom overruled any enactment whatever which the city might make besides if the factorswere net called on to pay they would nct charge it to their cus torers and believing therefore that enough had been said on tbo subject he would urge them to proceed at once with the sale mr monixonie wished to ask a few questions of mr nalder he wished in the first instance to know if he would read the regulations relative to the half per cent mr naldxrtnomr mortmioaethen if i understand you rightly you mean to say that i must pay youfor doingnothing or what is it for great uproarmr nalderit is a condition of the salemr mortimorei it not anew one caeersmr nalderhow can you ask that question you know it is notmr mortirorethen why was the alteration made oeeramnaldril answer you no mere questions my merchant is satisfied with it and that is all i wishmr morltixorehow can i charge my principal for doing nothing how can a man charge me onehalf per cent when i have no need of his assistance in any way whatever  or why should i be called upon to pay a broker who bids against me eheers and cries of brave have they to suffer all their friends to go to liverpool instead of coming to london for their hides  he thought mr nalder ought to abandon such a cbarge and for his own part he did not protest against a man for charging a person for whom ho transacted business but he was not bound to pay a man who bid against him he could assure those who heard him that he took no part what ever then on account of any private or personal pique but he was actuated solely by the urgent remonstrances of his country friends many of them left him and went to liverpool in consequence of the construction of the railroads in the first instance which increased the facility of the communication and in the next that they objected to thisb half per cent which was more than all the charges incurred going there he and his friends would resist its payment in every possible shape whatever they would prevent the people of yorkshire durham worcesm tershire buckinghamshire and other counties from going to liverpool and induce them if possible to buy ther goods in london many topics of a general nature had been introduced into the discussion with which it had nothing to do what they were urging upon those concerned was the injustice of making such a charge as that to which he alluded a charge which he mr mortimore and his friends should resist to the uttermost and ia every possible shape he for one avowed that he had a great respect for the brokers as a body and he wished them every prosperity laughter he assured them he did but he had a greater respect for his own customerb and a higher regard for their interests cheersmr rrgo requested permission to say a few words after what had passed pnd particularly as he saw many countryentlemen present to whom he wished to give an explanation we held in his hand a document signed streatfield law rence and iortitrore which was circulated extensively among biose gentlemen in the country and the tanners gene rally it was certainly a very able composition and a praiseworthy document in many respects but the facts were no altogether correct lie mr rigg for one did nct think it fair or right that london brokers should be thus repre sented in so odious a light and no doubt it was issued with a vi ew to show that the half per cent was obnoxious in prin ciple and unjust in practice now he should just say that when it was considered they the factors gave credit without any security whateverforll days which was more than ahalf per cent if the usual charges were made he did not think so much ought to bo said against a charge so long in existence andbelieved to be fair by merchants generally besides he would ask why vwas not the question brought forvard be fore now the condition nowr complained of was not virtually different from that which always existed but as he had already stated the  days credit was nearly if not more than the half per cent they were therefore quarrelling with straws and merely the name of the broker age although perfectly aware in his own mind of the feel imgs wheich urged the opposition onwards he could nssute them all that he for one as a broker should not ask for such a paymnent or press such a charge unless he wvas justly and clearly entitled to it after all that had been saia upon the subject he thought the sale should be allowed to go onmr mortimoan replied to mr riggmr wetherell as a ountry tanner interested in the question under disoussion had listened to those observations which were made since the commencement of the dis cussion but he remained still unconverted and uncon vinced as to the justice of inflicting onehalf per cent on the buyer by the brokers hear hear o listened tothe calm and dispassionate statement o tr rige he leard his observations on the document he read with which he thought however the subject had nothing to do withgreat attention buthehadheardnothing to convincehim that the prsttce was just or proper he had complained of this practice several years before he conceived then that it was a great hardship and a very hard case and he con tinued tohold the same feeling to that moment cheers he sincerely hopedthat he should very soon see an end to it and that if the brokers were not fairly remunerated by that charge being done away with some othei more jast arrangement would be made with the merchants which should give satisfaction to au parties cheersmr s sronart was convinced the present system was an evil of the greatest magnitude to the trade generaily but in a particular manner to those who resided in thecountry see how v thue sayteu worked they could getgoods to lecxham necvastle carlislo and other places from london for ls per tonx while they paid s from liverpool yet notwrithstandin this in consequence of the charges at the london market and particularly that halfiderper cent it was more advantageous to go to liver pool loud cheers that charge was made against himself som time since and he withdrew altogether from london nor didho purchase a single pennyworth in the trade from that hour to the present hear there aas no doubt whatever that the brokers ought to be paid what was justly and fairly due to them if he employed men to do his work he ought and was bound to pay them re represented the feelings of the people of newcastle hex ham carlisle and other places and he was bound to say that the argunsentsbrought forward by lr rigg and those who supported him did not convince him cheers he agair admitted that the brolcers ought to be fairly and jusuy paid but those vho employed them ought to pay and surely it was no argument to say that because it was the custom it was just or ought to bo suffered to continue loud cheers it was the custom not many years ago to spend two days and two nights on the road coming from his part of the country to london a laugh but that was done away with and he was enabled now to perform the journey in as many hours hear and surely no one would b insa enough to say that such a custom ought to havo coutinil ln his opinion the practice wae wrong decidedly wvrong and ought not to continuemr lapoab said that although it was of no cansequence to mr stobart what brokers did yet ho must know many persons in liverpool wvould gladly pay one half per cent if they were treated wsith the same liberality as in liondon it was a great advantage for a man with a small capital when he demanded his goods that instead of being told to go to the merchant such men as mr rigg gave him at once an order for the goods and incurred all the responsibilitythe discussion thon dropped and tho parties retired from the saleroom they forthwith adjourmed to the lendon tavern where a numerous meeting of the town and country trade wvas held at which some spirited speeches were made and resolutions passed which appeared in our advertising columns of yesterday
