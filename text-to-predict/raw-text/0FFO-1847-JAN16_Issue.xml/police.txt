been summoned and examined aa a witness on the preceding examination appeared before his lordship to complain he said of a false and libeuous imputation made upon that occasion after he had left the justiceroom against his charactermr duncan for mr scanlan objected to allow any inno vation upon the usual courae of proceeding to be made by any personthe lord mayor said he understood that mr shuttle worths object was to defend himself against a false accusa tion brought against him ia his absence and which he felt bound in common justice to himself to contradictpmr duncan said he considered the application of mr shuttleworth to be heard was entirely against the common practice and submitted that what that gentleman had to say might li some degree prejudice the defendants he there fore should persevere in opposing the iaterruption of the csc wshich after having been once called on ought to be allowod to proceed wvithout being at all interfered withtlhe loand mayor said he certainly should take the liberty to exercise his discretion upon such an occasion and could not see how the natural desire to correct a calumnious mis representation could prejudice persons by whom it had not been mademr shuttloworth thanked the lord miayor and said the gross calumny of which he com lained was that mdr bevan the secretary to the cornpany hiad said in the justiceroom that he mr shuttlewort had fraudulently drawn checks to defraud the committee of the stock exchange here mr shnttleworth produced before his lordship five checks which he had signed in conjunction with two other members of the committee dated in january and february  and solemnly assured his lordship that he had never signed any other checks for or in con nexion with the company that application was not made to the stock exchange to fix a settlingdayuntil in the month of june following that the charge made by bmr bevan was entirely false and that the false imputation having appeared in the newspapers he felt it absolutely ne cessary to put himself right with his friends and the public by as publicly giving the most unqualified denial to the state ment convinced that however inconsiderate he had been in onnecting himself with the compony no imputation could justly be fastened en his honour or mntegity during the pe riod of  years in whidh he had carried on business in tho city of londonthe lobd mayor said he believed at the moment the secretry made tne statement that there was no truth what ever in it and ho expressed his disapprobation of the con duct of the secretary in speaking so injuriously of mr shuttleworth after that gentleman had leftthe justiceroom his lordship added that mr shuttleworth was known to him to be a man of high respectability and he was sure that the press would gladly remove the impression which the falso statement was calculated to makemr ballantine then addressed the lord miayor the iearned counsel stated that he believed the case was about to be closed in a manner the most agreeable to all parties it would be admitted by mr marxgetson that the defendants had shown every willingness to return the money which had been borrowea upon the shares and that gentleman was he believed ready to accept the ofer and abandon all further proceedings mr humphreys the solicitor to mr margetson was aware that thero were legal difficulties in the case which even if there were grounds of charging moral offence against the defen dants would likely to be ineurmountable if under these circumstances the lord mayor presented no obstacle the comiplainant would not proceed further and the immediate restitution to which his clients considered mr margetson entitled should be made his lordship had no doubt per formed his duty in investigating the subject of dispute and had executed the task in a manier which placed both parties under obligations to him in all probability it would be consi dered no failure of justice that all parties should be released from further responsibility of attendance and that the de fendant should be relieved from the chargemr duncan said he fully agreed with the learned counsel in what had been stated as to tho performance of the part which the lord mayor had found it necessary to take upon himself in the course of the painful transaction all he would say as to mr scanlan his client was that that gentle man felt himself altogether guiltless and was ready to make immediate restitution if requiredur humphreys ou the part of mr margetson said that that gentleman considered himself defrauded of ool and determined not to sabmit to the loss without causing an investigation to be made how he was deprived ef his moneyit was not necessary to state certainly he considered it to be a duty towards the public to bring the matter before the lord mayor and he had refused to come to any private arrangement without the sanction of his lordship and it was for his lordship to decide whether the case ought or ought not to be proceeded with mr margeteon enter tained no vindictive feeling towards the defendants but it would be madness to say that that gentleman would not be rejoiced to get back his money a laugh and he stood in the court to abide his lordshipspinion as to whether thecase ougar or ougrtx not to do aoanaonea ants to act accord inglythe lord mayor aid it was quite impossible for him to have anything personally to do with tho business it ap peared to him from the statements made of this transaction that a fraud had been committed against the complainantand he was determined to make every effort in his power as a magistrate te do justice in such a case however thero undoubtedly were in his belief difficulties which a jury could not easily overcome  one of the principal of which was the difficulty as to the insertion of the advertisement stating that tho comapany had deter mined to return  s gd per share he felt under such circumstances that the course he was bound to take was to discharge the defendants he at the same timo pro tested against tho inference that such a course was to be used as a means of compromising an act of fraud the justiceroom should not bo a place to which people would re sort to obtain restitution of money at the same time he should be always ready and willing to render every assistance to his fellow citizens against the machinatious of
