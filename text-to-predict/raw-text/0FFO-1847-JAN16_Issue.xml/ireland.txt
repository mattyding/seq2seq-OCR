upon the motion of the earl of charlexnt seconded by lord fagnxam the chair was taken by the mdarquis of ormondethe noble cinairaian said that he felt the importance of the position in which he was placed and he was prepared to do all in his power to carry out tho intentions of the com mittee hear hear they were all aware that the meet ing was one of a most peculiar constructiox there were persons present of every shede of politics in fact they were assembled together as irishmen on irish grounds for lrish objects cheers their sole object was the good of their common country and to carry out that great object unanimity of action was required and he was happy to see that the hatchet of political animosity was buried for that day at least hear hear the resolutions to be brought forward were all carefully considered by the committee and were brought forward so as to meet as far as possible with the approbation of gentlemen of every creed or class of polities no doubt many noblemen and gentlemen had a andoned certain views to produce unanimity and it shoultg be remembered that no one was bound to the exact letter of the resolutions but taken ge nerally he believed they put fairly forward the opinions of all ard would he was sure be confirmed by the assemblage he the marquis of ormonde saw around himls cheersmr m cnaphman first addressed the meeting ho said ho had been honoured by the committee wvith the task of stating the object which had led to the present meeting being held ths committee considered that the present method of supplying food was a complete failure they hoped by the resolutions to be brought forward at that meeting to pre eent a eeries of suggestions to the legislature at its ap proachiug sitting which if carried out would do much to alleviate the present distressed condition of the country which they considered attributable to the shipping of the country not being employed in bringing food to her shores to the want of eeed which was felt everywhere in the country and to the present neglected state of their agricul tural fields the learned gentleraan after recapitulating the several oiects contained in the resolutions drawn up by the committee entreated that there should be observed an abstinence from all party feeling by au persons who ad dressed the meeting cheersmr g a hamilton mp moved the following reso lution that in conelusion we deem it our duty moet esrnestly to impress upon our representatives our solemn couviction of the necessity of their now cooperating cordially together iu parliament for the ad vancement of the interests of ireland and of their uriting to advocate such measures as may appear calculated to raise the social material and moral condition of the people to save society from the ruin by which au classes in the land are now threatened and to preserve the property of the country from confiscationthey might rest assured that nothing but the formation of an irish party wvould make the influence of the irish felt in parliament an understanding amongst  irish represent atives would prevent any minister no matter what his poli tics might be from trying any more crude experiments on ireland anid irish interests loud cheere it would further have the important effect of creating and nurturing such na ttonal feelings amongst irishmen on irish subjects aq would insure to ireland its due wveight in the senate of the empire cheers and what was most important of all considerations it would have the immediate effectofcompelling the govern ment to avert from their starving population the dreadful prosuects which lay before them by the adoption of ener getic means for their relief cheersmr oconnell mp then addressed the meeting he was much pleased in seconding the resolution and ho was especially rejoiced in seconding a proposition for the for niation of an irish party hear vwithout such a com bination the people would die by thousandsin fact they were already dying by hundreds and without entering into particulars he would say that a flood of horrors was sweeping over the country which loudly demanded the ex ertions of every man hear hear what the people most needed was food it was most foolish to talk of draining and subsoiling which were very good under ordinary cir cumstances at present the object of the irishparty should be to forceithe govermnent to give food to the irish people this ought to be their first object  and if it was made their main object he would attend every meeting held by the irish party cheers wvithin the last fenw daya he had heard from an ofiicerof the boardof works thathe had sent  to a particular locality to be distributed as wages but there was not lod worth of food to be procured there hear hear there was money but no food and therefore food should be got at any cost to preserve the people from starvation mr oconnell then inveighed against the times newspaper with the view to prove that no distinction of rank or party was made by that journal when descanting upon the state of ireland the nobility and gentry of ireland had been foully calumniated and basely maligned by that newspaper ehear hear some might accuse him of bringing those libels ppon them if he was guilty he then begued leave to offer his sincere contrition for his fault under ordinary circuastances however he might attempt to show that he was not wrong but in the frightful state of his poor countrymen he would consent to listen to anything hear his very blood boiled within him wvhen he read in that journal the deliberate assertion that the landed gentry of ireland wero the worst aristocracy in europe groans and hisses a more base calumny had neverbeen uttered thanbythe writerof thatstatementhear that the peasantry of ireland were the lowest vermin that existed on the habitableglobe hiesanother foul calumny of that foul uriter hear bear he also dared to state that the middle classes were dishnest mean and servile wvhich was the most base false and malignant slander the vile wretch had given utterance to in his letter renewed groans the hon gentleman concluded by calling upon the mneting to be unanimous in adopting such resolutions as would show the government the course it ought to follow cheersmr osborne mp asked whether the irish party would pledge itself to oppose the government if it refused to adopt some practical measure for the relief of the people he was a supporter of the government and he represented an english constituency but he would unite with the irish party to eject the government if they refused to aecede to their fair demands hearmr monsell trusted that the hon gentleman would not press that topic on the meeting or on the committee being calculated to arouse serious diesentionmr snoanx then withdrew the questionmr dihllon caroer next addressed the meeting he had just come from cork and had brought with him many resolutions passed by committees there for the relief of the exilting distress he knew there wero other landowners who had also come from other parts and he earnestly called on them not to bring forwvard any resolution or suggestion which would lead to dissention in that meeting hear hear the speaker then spoke of the great distress which existed in various parts of the county of cork censuring tho government for not distributing the food which they had in their storehouses to the starving population of skibbe reen and other distressed districts nothing in fact but the most energetic and persistent pressure from without would compel the government to do its duty cheers  people had aready perished from want and disease fever had made its appearance in many parts and was daily cutting offthe people by hundreds hear hear thesole cause wvas wvant of food and food should be the primary object of that meeting and the government or the conse quences would be fearful to contemplate wvith regrd to the foul libels of the english press he could say that the house of every gentleman in the south wvas for the last three months a soupshop from which some hundreds received relief each day hear hear and it was not to be expected thu gentry could stand it much longer hearthe earl of alnay observed that he had not expected to be calcd on to move a resolution and was thereforeunprepared to make a speech however after reading over that which he had undertaken to move he felt convinced it wvas of such a nature as to speak for itself his mind was almost entirely occupied with the frightful condition of the people in his own neighbourhood in which many landed gentlemen resided but wrhat must be the state of other districts hear hear he agreed wvith llr oconnell that they stood on the brink tf a precipicenay that they vere half down that precipice and if they did not make a long pull a strong pull and a pull altogether theyv would soon fall to the bottom hlear up to the preceding nighb he lord arraa had been occupied going round his tenantry holding meetigsn with a view to obtain information and giving such advice and assistance as lay in his power where it wras needed cheers he vra sorry to say that he found the land everywhere neglected and a total indiffer ence to the cultivation of the soil he asked them what were they going to do with the land they replied in the majority of cases that they intended to troew the seed on the ground for manure indeed they seemed undetermined what course to follow hear hear he pointed out to them the terrible consequences that wvould ensue from the neglect of thoir farms this year he showved therm that by following the course they had meationed they would have nothing but stubble on their lands he felt convinced that unless the people ivere taken fromi those infernal roads and put at once upon the country the country itself wag ir retrievably gene cheers because the next year would be worse than the present fiar hear he called for imme diate steps for the withdrawal of the people from tho public roads and setting them to work in the fields and concluded by moving the following resolutionthat berore and beyond all othor oonsideralions ithe salvation o the lives of the people and wve therefore deem it our solemn dutythe present mstem having signally failedto call upon the government in the most imperstiva terms to take suca measures as i secure local eupplies of food uffioiet to keep ite people aive snd to aecide anquantity of money that may be necessry to attain that object declar ing as we do that any neglect or delay in tht master wil render the government responible for tbe safety of the people of ireland who must perish in multitudes unless supplied with foed that as the people of this country vre sufferiig from a mogt extraordinary and in calculably extensive deficiency in the stock of foed we farther call upon the government to remove all sxtliceal impediments to the supply of that deficency by the temporary suspension of the navigtion laws and the duties on the importation of corn and awso to give increasel faeiiities to that importation by permitting such vessels f if er a jestys navys scanbe eparedto be employed inthetransportof provasion that we consider it would be

had now become in almost as bad a conditior as some of the sauther and western counties of irelsnd hear hear agriculture was totally neglected and persons well able to give an opinion believed that there ws not one months provisions in the eounty hear let the labourers then instantly be removed from the roads and employed in the fields on task work hear hear if this was not at onco done the country would b conerpletely ruined he trusted the committee wrould take means to carry out his suggestion hear hearthe motion ivas then put from the chair and carried with out dissentlord bsieward then rose to address the meeting he re joiced to see guch unanimnity existing amongst that meeting the unanimity which marked aa assemblage of gentlemen of variougt opinions on leading subjects it augured welt for the country that all differences of opinion were merged for the purpose of joining in the struggle forthe sal vation of the people his lordship then proceeded to do tat the coledition of the people in tho county of cork which he described as being very wretched the importation of indian corn amounted to nearly  qutr ters to replace the loss of the produce of about a similar number of acres of potatoes hundreds of peoplo had pe rished from want and ho was terrorstricken at the contem plation of their present position his lordship concluded by moving the follow ing resolutionthat while we affirm th lt it is the clear and paramount duty of the state to take care that provision be made for the destitute we regret that the means hicherto adopted for that purpose have on the one hand proved incommensurate with the evil and on the other hand have induced the expenditure of vest sums of money upon useless or pernicious works that this mest wasteful expendituwe tending as it does to diminish our resources and to increase the probabilities of future famine has not been the result of neglect on the part of the resident proprietors of ireland but of an impo litic and pernicious law which they have been compeled to carry into effect notwithstanding repeated protests to the contrary that though entirely acquiescng in the jattice of imposing upon thelandthe repayment ofallmorey advanced for reproductivepur poses we slemnly protet in the name of the ownaors and occupiers of land in ireland ageinst the principle of charging exclusively on their property the money which they have been forced to waste on un productive works that the destruction of the staple food of millions of our fellow subjects cannot be considered in any other light than that of an imperial calamityl and we claim it as our right that the burden arising from it so far as it tas been expanded on unproductive works sbalt fall on the empire at large and not be throwa upon ireland alone much less upon those classes i irceland which have suffercl most severel from ito trhat though considering the present labour fgate act as a mest mischievous measure to be laid rside whenever a better system can be introduced yet in order to prevent the continuauce of the treent waste of money we call upon the legislature to amend that act by enabling each proprietor to take upon himself hib proportion of the baronial asesement to be expended in reproductive works upon his own property and thereby to diseharge himself from any further tax tion in respect co that particular assesmment an that the objects to which this taxation shall be applied should be extended to all perma nent improvements of the landmr wynnis dl seconded the motion which was car ried unanimouslylord fartiham proposed the next resolution as follows that we have heard with alarm and regret that in many districte o ireland the useal extent of land has not been prepared and cannot be prepared for cultivation owing to the poverty of the occupants rnd consequently will be waste during the ensuing yealr and while we con fidently rely on the exertions of the landed propietors to protect thk country from the great evils which must foelow from such a neglect we cannot avoid culling the spedal attention of government to the alarm lnu reports which have reached us on that important stzbject that it is an ascertained fact that the sudply of seed in this country will be deficient and to nmeet this evil we earnestly recoommend that seed depsts be established by governmentthe resolution having been seconded by major blacg hall dl of the county of wexford wag unanimously adoptedmr beitinal osbonnb addressed the meeting he said he could not agree with the pasage in the foregoing resolu tion hich called upon the governmenst to supply seed tothe people the government ought to preserve the people from dying of starvation but ho wvould notgo to london to ask seeds for his tenants he would give his own tenanta seed and hc thought every landed proprietor should do themr monsell begged to observe that the seed was to be purchasedir osbortns in continuation said that if the resolution was sent to england in its present state it avould justify a renewal of the attacks made by the english press hear hear the learned gentleman after some further observa tlans concluded by moving the following resolution that powersshoeld begiven to the treasury to advance money by way of loan to railway companies that have attained their acts such money to be laid out in making the earthworks of the railway that as there must be a large amount of populationrdependent for subsistence during this yer upon public or private charity provision should be made fornassisting those to emigrate twith their families who cannot be supported in this country by the exercise of indepeadent labourmr moore seconded the motion wvhich was passedlord miltoun moved the first of a series of resolutions termed  permanent measures as follows  that the direct employment of the great mass of the ablebodied people by the state hasgan unavoidable tendency to paralyze industry and to substitute artificial for natural labour that any system of relief to the ablebodied that does not lead to the increase of food or articles that may be exchanged for food will diminish the capital of the country and that just in proportion as cipital decreases poverty will in croase that therefore any measureslofotr for theablebodied ought tohavefor their object the encouragement of the emploment of labour by private individuals in productive works and thoatthe efficacy of theiractionasastimulus to encourage and force such employment witibe the measute of their utility that in order to place the owners and occupiers of land in a position in wbich they caun be acted upon by such a stimulus the whole energies of the state should be applied to the absorption of surplus labour to the affording facilities for private em ployment and to the removal of the impediments that now obstruct it his lordship inrmovingthe aboveresolutionexpressedhis delight at witnesing such unanimity in the meetingmlr mohysgat

security for such loans to be eonfined to the land improvedand subject to duo protection of reversionary interestb every possible facility should be afforded them of alienating their waste lands for the purpose of rclamnation that with the further view of aosorbing labour our representatives be instructed to lay claim to such expenditure upon works and objects of a national charactersuch as navnl dockyards safety harbours and packet stationsas ought of risht to be allotted to ths country that in addition to these measures a schere of systematic coloniza tion would in our opinaos provide the means of subisternce to a large portion of our destitute population  would relieve many districts in this country which are now unable to support their inhabitants would bene fit the colonies by supplying them with labour wvould increaqe the sup ply of food throughout the world by bringing fresh land into cultivation aud would largely extend the market for home manufacture that the class
