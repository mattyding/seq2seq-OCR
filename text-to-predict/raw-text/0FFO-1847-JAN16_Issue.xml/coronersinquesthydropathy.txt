recent inflammation of the pericardium and arach noid membranes and pia mater with congestion of the brain brought on by the transfer of a chronic constitutional diseae of the skin to internal membranes and organ ending in acute disease and death the transfer facilitated by the continued application of cold water ho had never seen the case living and his opinion was founded on the poss mortem examination as to the general treatment holknow nothing of it except from the nurses from inquiries he understood that this girl as regarded the chronic constitu tional disease of the skin had suffered from it for several years that she was one of a large family and that several of her brothers and sisters laboured under some cutaneous disease she was in brighton hospital where he was told she was bled the diseaso in that hospital was callcd leprosy it was not for him to question the treat ment under these circumstances but it was not such as he should have adopted he could not comprehend wvhy any depletory system should be adopted in a system which indi cated extreme poverty and poorness of blood that was about two years ago he did not call the disease leprosy he had not the least doubt that it was a case of psoriasis guttata but it was first cousin to leprosy yet there was a marked lino of distinction and when it was found there ought to be a difference in the troatment psoriasis might porhaps be described in english as a species of scaly tettar the post mortemn examination showed a total deficiency of blood the blood in the tight ven tricle contained little or no fibrine the nutritious portion of the blood there was a perfect anemial or bloodless condi tion of body as there was a natural possibility that in cases of leprosy psoriasis or any diseases of the skin the disease might be transferred to the internal membranes he was glad when he found hereditary diseases of the skin taking an external form  dyspepsia affections of the liver and kidneys sc ceasinet al soon as th skin diseas ap peared dey should be extremelya autiouskin suchises ae shouldgiv directions to keep the external surface of the body warm order nutritious diet and an alterative system of medicine anin answer to questions from dr lovell whether he was awaro that at this momont psoriisis and other diseases of the skin were treated with water cold or hot in an institu tion in bridgestreet london  mr asbury replied that he was aware there was a place in london where diseases were so treated but his experience was in favour of warm baths as sargeon to the ensield union he had observed a great numraber of skin diseases in the workhouse and there was great difficulty in getting rid of them till warm baths were establisheddr lovoll wished to know whether mr asbury had ever tried the effect of cold water in skin diseases or whether he knoev anything of water treatmentmr asbury replied that knowing by the experiencoe of a number of years as well as from the opinion of thosb who had lived before him in the profession and among whom there was no difference that there was a tendency to the transfer of skin disease to the trunk of tho body he should never dream of using cold applicationsdr loveu observed that the practice had been recom mended from tho earliest times by celsus hippocrates galen and in later times by eminent authorities he never would order a bath till ho had made himself tho roughly acquainted with the system and for that purpose ho had gone some thousands of miles to a place where a great number of patients were always under treatmentthe coroner asked whether the application of cold water harmless in warm weather might not be injurious during hard frostdr lovell responded that three years ago he was abroad and there he had seen the tops of the pines covered with frostwork while the thermometer was seldom less than  or  degrees below freezingpoint when he took the coldbathmr asbury remarked that he had founded his opinion on sound physiological and patkological views of the human body since b of oxygen were consumed annually by an adult man it was necessary that a due quantity of food should bo supplied for that consumption otherwise the tissues of the body must be taken up and an anemial condi tion of the constitution brought ondr lovell thought that mr asbury wished to make it understood that there was a deficiency of food in the treat ment it was quite the reverse persons might eat as they pleasedmr asbury proceeded to stato that in this case the sub stance of the body had been taken up so far he agreed with dr lovel that in mosthydropathic establishments most extraordinary quantities of feod were supplied the water cure was a most dangerous and most powerful remedy if practised with great caution in cases where the disease arose from superfluous tissue the cold water supplied the place of exercise but when its application was carried out in other awes tho pationt was expod to great danger boibbroko out the inflammation indicated poverty of the system the deceased person in this case was labouring under here litary disease and the appiicatien of cold sheets to her would do injury the inflammation of the pericardium and of the membranes of thebraun showed that prompt bleeding shotald have been adopted the inflammation had ex isted only a few days in the constitutional diseasoin itr chronic form he should not recommend bleeding although the application of cold might not be usod to the patient and he should be under the most judicious treat ment the transfer of disease from ono structure to another not unfrequently took place otherwise it was impossible to arrive at the concluion that cold applications were a re mote cause of death in this casedr lovell expressed himself perfectly satisfied with the account of the post snoritenexamination which it was stated had been attended also by messrs tait and taylor sur geonsjobn sheffield who had been examined on the first day of the inquest was again sworn he asked mrs betts on tuesday morning whether ishe intended to have a doctor on thursday evening dr lovell saiadhad he been there he could not have done any more than mrs betts had done witness was very well satisfied with dr lovolls conversa tien but not with his treatment met dr lovell on friday morning and asked hium if he would allow witness to have another doctor dr lovell was quite agreeable to have another doctor if mrs betts was agreeable but said if there wore another doctor he would haveo othing more to do with it at christmas deceaeed came home with an abscess in her left arm she got well and a few days after had an eruption in her facemrs cole residing in enfield saw the arms and hands of the deceased sponged with tepid water and cloths put ronnd her head wet with tepid water she frequently talked in a delirious manner arrow root sago and boiled milk were prepared for her sometmes she could take a little kome times not sometimes it appeared impossible for her to swallowmrs hobbs wife ofedward hobbs farmer and rood man at piltown sussex and mother of the decoased was then examined she had not seen her daughter since  months last september heard she was ii and came down to see her arrived on sunday at  oclock when she found her daughter quite in a dying state her daughter died next morning every now and then deceased put up her hand to her mouth to have her lips bathed with water they told witness that they had a gentlemian down from london ivitness was perfectly satisfied with the treatment she had ex erienced it herslf deceased was about  years of agoeme further discussion aroso as to the cause of death when ir asbury stated that martha hobbs might have died if she had been bled the neglect of not adopting those means which on tho highest medical authority up to the present day were known generally to cure inflammation of the organs affected when early applied was much to be regretted no doubt the cause of death lay in the inflam mation of those organsthe coroner then recapitulated the evidence the actual cause of death was inflammation of the pericardium there was no proof of cruelty against mrs betts  and the question was whether there was ground for believing that gross ignorance or gross negligence had beon shownthe jury proceeded to delibernte with closed doors after a consultation which lasted for two hours they re turned a verdict of manslaughter in the first degree against dr lovell and againast mrs betts in the secord de gree it was understood that  of the jury which con sisted of  including the foreman were for and  against this decisionthe terms of the verdict not having been formally ad justed the proceedings were further adjourned to tuesday at  oclock
