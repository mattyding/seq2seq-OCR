bright on that ground the opposite party declare that in any case the return of their candidate is certainpainless surgical operastionon thursday afternoon an irishman wvas brought into the london hos pital with a compound fracture and dislocation of the tarsal tones of the foot the man after considerable reluctance at last consented to amputation of the leg provided the pain was in some way diminished the vapour of ether was bad recourse to and applied in the presence of dr pereira and a numerous assembly of medical gentlemen in live minutes the inhalation proved successful and in less than another the leg was amputated by mr adams the patient during the time giving sly winks and facetious nods to those surround ing him during the intervals of the inhalation his observa tions were of the most facetious character forcing from the bystanders involuntary laughter and converting that which to the poor fellow was a most tragical event into a scene little short of a farce upon removing the ether he called out  hold hard there a bit lets have another go at the grog wvhich he drew in with the greatest avidity not for one moment during the operation did he exhibit the slightest symptoms of pain but on the contrary his countenance was expressive of the greatest hilarity  and at the conclusion of the operation after the effects of the ether had pas ed off he could scarcely believe that his leg had been so painlessly removed his ideas whilst under the influence of the vapour were similar to those of a person enjoying a pleasant dream he had fancied himself walking in the streets of cork with his weetheart and to use his own expressions enjoying most pleasurable sensations he has slopt well during the night and is in every respect progressing favourablyoperations under the influence or ether jan a number of surgeons assembled this day in the operating theatre of the wyestminster hlospital to witness certain operations performed by mr hale thomson on patients rendered previously insenaible to pain by tho inha lation of ether the vapour iwas administered by mr ro binson dentist of gowerstreet to whom the society is much indebted for the invention of an apparatus by which the ether may be employed with security and certainty tho first patient was a woman of middle age suffering under condylomatous growths from the labia after an inhalation of about four minutes the patient was pronounced in a state fit for the operation the morbid growths were then drx terously removed by mr thomson without any expression of pain on the part of the patient and without any signs of suffering apparent on her countenance the only indication of the nervous system being awake to the operation was the spasmodic action of the lower limbs which took place at the moment of excision but it was quite obvious that this was an excitomotory phenomenon and had no connexion with sensation on the completion of the operation some wine and water wvas given to tho patient who seemed awakening from a dream and appearo for some minutes uncertain of her own idetity and of the reality of the new world which vras open ing gradually to her senses her manner was that of a de lirious person ceommuning with herself and exhibited a strong manifestation of dr wigans theory of the duality of the mind after sundry ejaculations of wonder and sur prise she turned her head on her pillow and recognized one of the physicians as a real man and discovered to her infinite delight that she was stil a denizen of earth although her next exclamation that she thought herself in a  beautiful heaven exhibited little ngratitude for her temporary transition to a celestial abode upon being told that she was to submit to an operation she said she knew it and was ready and when informed that the operation was over seemed unable to believe it a little hyiterical crying the combined result of apprehension wonder and delight followed and she wa taken bask to her bed be fore we left the hospita we learnt that she was fast asleepthe second patient a young man was operated on for phymosis hee was ready in about four minutes from the commencement of inhalation and the operation produced no evidence of the presence of sensation indeed in his case there wa an absence of the excitomotory movements exhibited by the female patient some little time elapsed before the ligatures were completed and the last was passed after he had to all appearance recovered from the stupor caused by the operation he evinced the return ofsensation by an ejaculation of pain but relapsed immediately into a forgetfulness of the operation being more intent upon the  delightful dream which he had just experienced than upon the dull realities around him on being asked if he had euffered pain he said that he had folt nothing and upon being further interrogated as to his sonsationg replied that he would answer the question tomorrow like the female patient there was a little hysterical sobbing after the operation apparently ceasioned by the recollection of pro rious illness and suffering so that in point of fact a sur gical operation has now come to be a source of regret as anenjoyment too quickly passed awtay the impression made by these operations on the mind of the gentlemen present among whom we noticed mr white mr guthrie mr for guson mr erasmus wilson and mir fisher appeared to be one of perfect satisfaction and mlr robinson was deservedly congratulated on the success of his mechanical contrivance for the administration of the vapourlascctlrverpool otprton
