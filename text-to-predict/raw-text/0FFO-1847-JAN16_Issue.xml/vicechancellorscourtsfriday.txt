order made appointing fourgentlemen accordingly there was a provision in the act directing the bank to transfer in certain cases but as no special case was made they refused to do so it was stated in explana tion that the original trustoee were all dead the last having died intestate and his next of kin havingrefused to adminis ter and the question now made was whether such next of kin wvas compellable to transfer the funds in the character of a representative of the intestate although he bad never ad ministeredmr mlalins appeared for the next of kin and submitted that under the cases of  ex pate winter   russ  and  n r e hagger   beav  the court had jurisdic tion to order a transfer by the bank in cases like the present even a person who was actually appointed executor if ho neither proved nor acted was not compellable to transfer stock under a will and much more where the next of kin could not be said to represent the intestate in any sense and the bank itself would refuse to recognize such a personmr b palmas appeared on behalf of the bankthe vicechscellor thought that he had no jurisdic tion to order a transfer this case not being within the act but a short act similar to that relating to deodands mightbe passed to meet such a case he could therefore make no order the order itself in fact for appointing new trustees fell to the groundin re northwestern railwaythis

the court could not make the order under the letter the case was within the spirit of the actbefore sir s w xiaxbull v pritchardin this case which was brought before tho court beforo the christmas vacation and has been since argued by mr romiuy and nr heathfield for the plaintiff and mr side bottom for the defendants his honour gave judgment as followsthis question arises under the will of thomas evanswhich of two claimarns is entitled to real estate a similar question relating to leasehold property of the same testator under same will arose and was decided in the case of bull y pritchardv  tusesell  and the course of reasoning by which in that case lord gifford arrived at his conclusion involved the expression of his opinion as to the construction of the will with reforenco to the real es tate when the case was opened in december last i thought it involved no question of difficulty whatever until my attention was called to the fact that sir john leach lord denman and mr jarman in his book on wiuls had questioned the correctness of lord giffords decision  and as the object of the plaintiff was in effect to have lord gif fords decision reviewed i directed the case to stand over in order that the plaintiff might apply to the lord chancellor to hoar it the lord chanceuor however thought it right that i should exercise my judgment upon the case and it was therefore argued before me on the th of this month thomas evans by his will dated in may  devised all his froehold estates to john millsom samuel pritchard and john gumbrell and to the survivors and survivor of

common in a subsequent part of the will there are powera to apply the interest of the childrens shares or so much thereof as might be recessary towards their main tenance education and bringing up notwithstanding such shares should not be absolutely vested i ahall first consider the case omitting the clause as to maintenance education and bringing up there are two classes of cases under which the present must fallone class where the devise is to a party at a given age or whenor if he attain a given age followed by a devise over if the first devsee shoald die under the given age the second class is where the description of the devisce is suclh as to make a given ago part of that description and the property is given over if the devisee dies under that age in cases of the first class the court has discovered an in tention expressed in the wil that the first devisee should take all that the testator had to give except what he had given to the devisee over and in order to give effect to that intention has held by foreo of the language that the first devise was not contingent but vested subject to be di tested upon the happening of tho event upon vrhich the property is given over in the seeond class the court has held the devise contingent upon the grounduti nu one jcoa claim who could not predicate of himself that ho was of the ago required that otborwise he did not answer the entiro description the question is under which class does this case fall i think clearly under the second class it is not necessary that i should say whether greater violence would be done to the will in this case thau was dono in some of the cases of the first class e g  doe v moore if i should hold that the children of the testators daughter took vested interests it is enough for me to say that the two cases are in principle widely different from each other and that this case in my opinion clearly falls under the second class then does the clause as to  main tenance education and bringing uv alter the ease i think not that such provisions are in many cases material upon questions of vesting cannot be disputed but there is nothing unreasonable or improbable in giving the benefit ofmaintenance and education find bringing up  to the davisee of a contingent interest the question hero is whe ther i can allow that clause to have anyefiectunon timw evieo wmflibout that pvjigon make
