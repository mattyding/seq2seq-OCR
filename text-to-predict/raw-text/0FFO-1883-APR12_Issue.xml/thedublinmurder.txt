the dublin murder trials dublint am fthere ws if possible even greater eagerness displayed to obtain admission to the courthouse today than yes terday and the attendance of the general pablic who were fortunate enough to obtain tickets of admission was far more numerous outside te building large crowds of the poorer people gathered and from an early hour small groups were to be seen scattered about discussing the forthcoming eventand eagerly watching the arrival of the vans with the prisoners and the approrers under their strong escort they made no demonstration whatever and when the vans had swept past slowly melted away to again assemble in the evening in somewhat augmented numbers for a similar purpose brady it may here be mentioned was conveyed down from elmainham prison about halfpast  oclock under the usual escort of mounted police and military snd with strongly armed police and marines following on cars brady had a van specially devored to himself while in the second vehicle were the four informers robert farrell james carey william lamie and michael kavanagh the carman the cavalcade attracted a good deal of attention as it swept through the stceets but no excitement was manifested whatever ample precautions however had been taken by the authorities who had place marines and police in pri vate clothes all along the routeextraordinary precautions are being taken for the safety of the courthouse by day and night during the progress of the sittings uniformed police and marines and detectives fill every passage and entrance while at night a strong force of military and police occupy and patrol the building at frequent intervals the learned judge took his seat on the bench this maorning a few miautes after u oclock and almost simultaneously the prisoner joseph brady was placed at the bar immediately the leading counsel for the prisoner rose and in an aggrieved tone complained of the refusal of the crown ofiicer to accord the usual privilege to the prisuners counsel of letting him have a copy of the indictment under which he was charged this complaint however was summarily dealt with by the law offictrs explanation that it was impossible for him to do as he was requested at the moment but that he would now at the earliest possible moment comply with the request handing over the desired document as he spoke this matter settled the judge directed that the jury panel should be called despite the announcement of the heav fines thaz would boinflicted for nonattendance there were many absentees this morning when the special jury panel was called even of those present there were many who wished to escape from their obligations but the judge was inexor able and no matter what the plea put forth refused to entertain any for withdrawal or absence the calling over of the panel ocupied a little ever half an hour and when the entire panel had been gone through the swearing of a jury was proceeded with this was accomplished with a good deal of expedition and shortly after  oclock the  men on whem will rest the issue of life or death in one of the most important and tragic cases which have ever occupied a jurys attention slowly filed into the box vith but three or four exceptions they are all men of mature age with gray hair and whiskers with the courtesy and consideration which have marked their conduct throughout the crown counsel suggested a shore interval which would allow of these gentlemen making any business arrangements they thought necessary in view of their coming confinement this permission was gladly made use of and for a sbort time the jury disappeared from the box they returned shortly and the attorney general imnmediately proceeded with his opeaing address it now being  minutes past  or a little more than an hour after the sitting of the court the learned counsels statement occupied exactly two hours and was a very able effort introducing the case in a calm and unimpassioned manner and sketching in a quick yet thoroughly clear and comprehensive way the evi dence which woald be submitted in support of the charge which he asked the jury to investigate and decide upon prefacing his remarks by an appeal to the jury for a fair calm and impartial consideration of the case he paid a graceful and ftting tribute to the qualities and worth of the murdered gentlenmen and proceeded to touch upon the circumstances connected with their poaiticn at the time of their awful end dwelling for a little on the occurrences preceding the committal of the crime with whichthe prisoner stood cbarged he spoke at some length of the formaticn and working of the conspiracy of which it aas the terrible outcome and tben entered into the details of the cridme itself describing in graphic and forcible language the eequence of the events from the entry of one of the mur dered gentlemen into dublin and the almost simultaneous gathering of the conspirators to the assassination in the parl and the subsequent fight of the murderers through out the speaker delivered himself with great clearness and power and although visibly affected as he referred to his conneion with one at least of the murdered gentlemen and to the awful details of te assassination he did not until the concluding portion of his statement allow him self to be somewhat overcome by his feelings it was then when in a splendid peroration he spoke of the forlorn coa dition of the prisoner deserted by his confederates and left to the mercy of the crown whose officials he hal con spired to murder but to whichcrownhebadnow to appeal for assistance in his defence he used vigorous and telling language which was emphasized by the spirit of its delivery and had a great effect upon his hearers at the conclusion uf bis statement which it may be mentioned was listened to with the greatest possible attention through out there was an evident desire on the part of the public present to give way to applause  but at the sound of the slightest marrmor it was immediately suppressed at the conclusion of the address a short adjournment took placea few words may here be devoted to the prisoner brady it may be remembered is a man about  years of age very powerfuuy built anld aboat five feet eight or nine inches in height ie has a shock head of black bair care lessly brusbed while some little whisker anl moustache cover the lower portion of a broad full and somewhat goodhumoared face he is dressed in the long frieze coat which he has worn heretofore and appears to bave im provpd in every way since his confinement he is by trade a stonecutter but his hands are and have always been since his arrest pretty white and free from all cuts and marks judging by his general conduct in the dock his spirits do not appear to have suffered in any way it is true the continual smile which was naturally attributed to bravado does not now rest upon his features still no incident having any leaning towards the ludicrous happenei but bradys laugh was the pleasantest and broadest this was especially the case when in the calling of the jury panel some of the answers and appeals for exemption were productive of slight amusement brady turned round and facing the place on which all eyes were momentarily turned apparently heartily joined in the laugh on one occasion however his unseemly mirth fied all beholders with a feeling of horror and dismay when in the course of his opening statement the learned attorneygeneral happened to refer to him as being present at a certain gathering of the  invincibles  on the th of miay he almost laughed outright up to the adjournment for luncheon he had remained standing in the dock not availing himself of the seat provided on either side of him save when be gave expression to his risible faculties already allued to he preserved the same cool impassive air which had characterized him on theprevious days while the jury were being sworn he rested his left hand on the rail in front of the dock while his right was placed behind his back idly playing ff a short piece of pencil ot till the jury had taken their places in the lox did he attentively regard them when bis eyes sharply swept their countenances and toolk in their different faces during the delivery of the opening address by counsel for the crown he rested his heavy body on his two arms placed on the bar in front of him and still idly played with the pencil yet now and again sharply scrutinizing the countenance of the learned attorney general as he spookc as the dread details of the awfal assas sinations were brought forth in the tatement he appeared quite unmoved and utterly regardless of the feelings of those around when the announcement of the adijourn ment was made he happened to look round and as oc curred yesterday catching sight of some familiar face he smiled pleasantly and bosvingleft the dolcwhen the court resumned after luncheon evidence for the crown was imnediately proceeded with robert farrell a young man of respectable appearance wbo it will be remembered was the first of the prisoners to turn approver was placed upon the witness table his evidence was simply a recapitulation of the testimony given at the second sitting of the preliminary inquiry and was not considered of very great importance at the present trial xs he coald not give direct evidence hearing on the assas sination with which brady stood charged this being the ease dr webb was afforded an opportunity of raising n legal question regarding the admissibility of such evidence the discussion which ensued thereon was not cf very great interest and it was consequently with some feeling of relief that the ruling of the judge permitted the direct examination to proceed this examination did not altogether occupy more than threequarters of anur a tldoese dr webb proceeded to crossexamine arreliat verv great length from the deposition made by bim naefme lr curran at the secret investigation at the caae wiha view of sbowing that his present testimony gm bdhmtg contradiction to that then given i  rosae w  ewreswhiatwas the object of the society to make history and to rtmove

lerwards be saw kavanaghs car in the park joe brady tim thy kelly patrick delaney and thoma caffrey were cn the car be had no idea of the number of men that would be there that morning but on the previons evening they were all told that any who would lose thei emplooyment by absenting themselves on that day need not go there snith was there for the purpose of identifying mr burke and the witness was to look after smitb and give the signal when they approacbed smith and others sat on a wooden seat and tbe i ormer presently said  here is lr burke the witness on looking down the road saw two gentlemen he and smith then got on kevanaghs car and told him to drive as fast as he could to the group of men who werehigher up the road the witness displayed a white band i kerchief iavanagh appeared rather excited and on coming to pthe men smith sai mr burke was the man with the gray suit brady curley and the witness then entered into conversation and discussed what they sbould do with smith brady said send him to hell out of it thereupon the witness told smith tv go home the witness asked what part wuld he take in the matter ard brady said  you can go away we do not wantyou the witness then walked away and as he did so said i lind the maan in the gray suit subsequently the witness saw bray and kelly getting nearest to the two lentlerren and then saw brady raise his left arm and strike m burke the witness saw nqo mere but went on to kil mainham and mecting smith they took the tramcar and proceeded to collegegreen aboet  oclock the same night he met curloy in hollesstreet

lord frederick cavendish who was with mr burke and brady answered i do not know who it is but only for himself he would not be the way he is nowbradly at this point took copious motes of the eviaence the witness went on to say that brady described how whea he struck mr burke the other centlemau lordiately afterwrxas his questions elcting from the witnes s that there were two i quiries before ir curran at which the witness made two depositionsthe second of a fuller and more trustful character thau the first the depositions were put in evidence and the witness was then told that he might leave the tablethe name of the principal approver james carey was then called and created a good deai of sensation with every head stretched forward and breaths almost held so great was the excitement the scene at this point was very striking a hush feu on au present and every eye was strained towards the door through which the witness was to approach the table in a moment or two after farrel had disappeared carey slowly and cooly walked in with hair and whiskers carefully trimmed and dressed in a suit of drab tweed with cloth upper bootshe presented quite a dandified appearance the  observed of all observers he coolly approached the witfess table and ascended the steps leading thereto with se right hand holding his hat swinging by his side and the left concealed in his trousers pocket still with hand in pocket he dropped his hat on the chair and lifted the sacred book to be sworn he kissed the book and sat down and shortly afterwards crossing his legs placed himself in a comfortable position he spoke at first in a very low tone of voice and had frequently to be directed to speak more loudly he spoke quite coolly and calmly and in an utterly heartles manner supplied the links of his story which rivets the guilt on brady if true and corroborated his examination of course was regarded with the greatest possible interest and every ear was bent forward to catch the words he uttered mr murphy qc had not concluded examining him when the ccart rosebrady still continued to maintain his lounging position on the front of the dock during the esamination of farrell he did not appear very concerned but on the entrance of carey into court he regarded him with a strong look in which there was a mixtore of contempt and vindictiveness aluhough by an assumed smile he sought to hide his feel ings during the delivery of his testimony carey had occasion to turn round and look straight at brady and for  moment their eyes met and brady cast a look upon the approver which spokevolumes careyvery quickly shifted his position and partly turning his back on brady looked at him no more tillwh en leaving the witness tablehe was once more brought face to face with him and again received the same look brady during his examination regarded him very attentively and waited with apparent interest the disclosures which succeeded each otherit may here be mentioned that extra precautions were taken today to guard brady in the dock in addition to the two warders who usually looc after the prisoners two policemen were stationed behind brady while two marines sat on either side of him no occasion however arose for their services careys crossexamination will take place to morrow and is looked forward to with a good deal of anticipation as it is expected that it will prove verysharp and lengthenedmr curran qc attended in court during the day with the original deposition made before him in case auy question shonld arise at the adjournment brady and the approvers were removed to kilnainham under escortthe crown was represented by the attorneygeneral for ireland the solicitorgeneral mr james murphy qo and mir peter obrien qc instructed by mr s w

the attorneygeneral protested against any such allegation as that just made by dr webb no refusal had been given to the priioners solicitor the matter then dropped and the calling of the special jury panel was proceeded with on penalties of � for sonattendance out of the gentlemen present a jury was sworn after  had been ordered to stand asie and nino chauenged by the prisoners connsel after a short intervalthe attorneygeneral proceeded to address the jury he said the law of the land had cast upon him one of the gravest and most responsible duties which could be cast upon a citizen they had been empaneued to try the prisoner at the bar for a crime of unparalleled audacity and he bepoke for him their calm fair and impartial cousideration they had al of them read rauch and heard mnuch in reference to the occurence which they werenow to investigate and he had to call upon them to forget as much as they could and absolutely to discard from their consideration everything they had so heard and read andi to inquire as they were sworn to do into the guilt of the prisoner upon the evidence and npon the evidence alone that would he submitted to them the occurence which they were now to inquire into took place on the th of last may some time pre vious to that date there hal been a change in the irish eecutive the distinguished nobleman who until re cently had filled the high office of lord lieutenant of tnis country had left shortly before that time his re signation having been preceded by that of the gentlemen who had filed the important position of chief secretary tieformerhad been succeeded bythepresentrepresentative lord spencer and the ohief secretary who had then been appointed lord frederick cavendish was a nobleman who was intimately connected with this country both by property and interest until that time he had had no connexion with the irish administration except so far as the duties of the office he previously held that of financial secretary to the treasury had brought him into con nexion with irish affairs ile was a man of extreme personal kindness and gentleness in the position in which it had been his duty to serve his sovereign and his country he had conciliated the esteem regard and affec tion of every one with whom he was brought into con tact and it was known personally known to some in the court that he had come to this country full of kindliness and of generous sentiments towards its inhabitants and with the anxious resolve to do his best towards the country with which it was hoped his name and his services would have been associated lord spencer and he made as was usual npon such occasions a public entry into dublin on the th of may this country had passed through a season of great political excitement troubles and great distress and it was hoped that the silver lining of the clond was beginning to show itself and that a brighter future was in store ihe reception which was accorded to lord spencer and those who ac companies him was brilliant in the extremehe might say enthusiastic lord spencer was received with the ac clamation of a people to whom and by whom he was knowzn and among whom he bad lived and laboored dturing a formler administratien and every one thoulght and hoped that we eere at an end of those horrors which bad disgraced oulr cquntry everything had passed off exactly as those who had the good of their country at heart wished and there was no one circumstance to in dicate alarm or suggest apprehension to the minds of any the oth of may was a naturday as he had before said and at that season of the year even without such an ex citing event as the entry of a lord lieutenant there was sufficient attractiono to bring a consiierable anumber of persons into the streets to enjoy themselves and welcome the sprig of the year the gentleman whlose death was the subject of this inquiry mr burke was upon that day busy at his usual ddties at the castle until a late hoar in the afternoon mr bnrke was a man well known to a large number of persons in this city and county and was beloved by ae who knew him be was an irishman and a roman ostholic and a man who in private and official life was beloved by au wvho met hirm to an extent unusual to persons who must sometimes be brought into contactoffloially with those with whom they cannot agree no man wa more popular in this country wvith those wlho klnew him than yom burke  straightforwar and honourable he was of firm disposition of character and possessed a sensitive and affectionate heart he never heard a tale of oppression withont feeling it and resenting it and he the  peaker might be excused if lie said that upon the last occasion he met him alone he was speaking of a case of hardship which ha dcomeunder his notice he was ever active and warm upon the side of the oppressed and never more so than upon the occasionhe mentioned nothing could be further from the thoughts i of any peron except those who wvere privy to the plain that any hatred was entertained against either of the gentlemen into whose death they were now inquiring lord f cavea dish left the castle on foot on the afternoon of the th of miay and wvas seen walking along the main central road to the phcenix bmonument that evening about  oclock feeling no apprebemion being conscious of having com mitted no wrong mr burke was detained a little in the castle and proceeding towards his residence he took an outside car at the parkgate the driver of which was a man nanred brabazon he irove past the equestrian monu ment of lord gough and driving on a little further he saw lord frederick cavendish walking along so he paid the carman jumped off the vebicle and joined lord frederick cavendish and walked on nvith him in the direction of the phoenix monument whether arminarm or not is not very material but engaged in conversation praising no doubt the conduct of the people on the occasion of the entry of the lord lieutenant and speaking no doubt in terms of hope for the future mr burke although a man ot nearly  years ooked mnuch younger forhe had a singularly erect carriage and active bearing upon the day he met his death he was drossed in a gray suit they proceeded along the path being seen by several persons who recognized them and by others yho of course did not his excel lency had driven on in advance uind if he was not at the scene of the occurrence at thetime itwasalmost an accident he at any rate was very near a ganme of polo was going on on the righthandsideof thezroad at the timeand on the left a game of cricket was proceeding and numbers of persons were going along the road on the leftband side on the path which was there there were vehicles in the park on the cecasion at such times there always were some ofestrs attraetd nto attentho observgtian whpthe two gentlemen had passed into the park and gone within a short distance of where the road turned in the directioa of cihapehzod a scoue enued which was wit nessed by two or three people at least it would be neces savry that he should call their attenltion more clcsely to the character of that scene but it was lhe might say a scene which left on the minds of those who sav it a belief that there was a rough scuffle going on on the path way two of the men were seen to fall but no one for a moment thought or dreamt at first of anything like violence still less of open or atrocious assassination the scuffle ceased and a car was seen to drive away on which some of those engaged in the scuffle went a cab was also seen to move off in another direction from the same place some of those who saw what passed and who saw two of those who had taken part in the scufle left behind on going to the spot found two dead bodies one upon the roadway within some couple of yards of the green slopes and the other that of the man with the gray suit of clothes lying upon the footway both of them were dead and both of them were lying in their blood that was all that was known of the affair at the time but so appalling was the circumstance discoveredso terrible and so horrible the tragedythat it had the effect at tbe timeoof paralyzing not alone those who were the actual or almost immediate witnesses of it butthe public mind and sentiment through out the whole country the unparalleled horror felt in the city sped like lightnmg all over the eivilized world and there was no quarter of the globe in whicb there was not a thrill of horror at this most foul and atrocious deed it came to their knowledge under circumstances unex pected literally like lightning out of a clear sky and it appalled and shocked the conscience of mankind through out the civilized world he had said that little was known at the time of the horrible event there wsa a rumour of a car driving off from near the plae there was a wvhisper of a cab going oi too and there was a hue and cry as to the occupcants of those vehicles but whatever else of uncertainty there was it wvas clearthat vhoever were seen on the car on the occasion were the persons who perpetrated the assassinatiosl of that at least there could be no doubt the impunity that seemed for a time to follow the action of the authors of the deed was the result of its very audacity it was calcu lated on by those who were concerned in it that pro bably the safest mode of despatching one who n was an object of their hatred was to chcose a public place and to count on the paralyzing of intellect and nerve for the success of such an attempt the medical examination of the bodies disclosed the fact that both gentlemen bad been despatched by the same means both had been stabbed to death by pointed weaponsweapona of great sharpness keenness and strength but not very wide nor necessarily more than  or  inches in length there was a wound in the back of nr burke behind the shoulder blade that traversed right through the body and the instrument which inflicted it had pierced through the heart and come out in front there were other wounds on the body but he would not harrow the feelings of tbe jury by describing them in detail there was one wound however which he would ask particular attention to and that was a wound inflicted not by a thrust or stab but by a cat and it was on the tbroatin ordinary language the throat of the gentle man was cut in the case of lurd frederick cavendish the wounds upon his body were also numerous the one frotn which he died was under the arm severing a large arterythat must have produced death by rapid bleeding but there was also a large wound on his personi to which he must ask attention becaulse it too had a full bearing on the case for the crown fon the left arm there was a wound which was a slash wound as it was described by the doctors it was not a stab but a slash and it must have been inflicted as they would hear from the doctors by a man of almost hercalean strength assum ing that it wras inflicted by a weapon of no great eight or strength this much was known to the public and no more all sorts of versions were afloat as to where the car had gone information was given within a few mnoments of the occurrence to some of therpolice in the park but it ras too late the asfssins vanished as if the earth had opened and swallowed
