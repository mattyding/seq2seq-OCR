mrs hopes maid took to the foundling iospital an infant which had been discovered she said about noon on the doormat of the fifth fioor at no  rue de penthievre the child wcs registered as  maurice

on the admirals testimony of his childlessness and the mannier of the childs dis covery and adoption as irresistible evidence that camille was not a carnegie and it was halfhinted that the choice of names indicated the child as one which had been born at the tuileries and that mrs hope had befriended it out of complaisance to the emperor or to a mother ashamed to own ittoday maitre gatineau gave a very different version of the affair according to hirm the plain tiffs action is not supported by her surviving chil drenmir john hope approving ii de billings distrbution of the preperty and his sister leaving the matter to the judgment of the conrt mrs hope the learned counsel says has squandered seven or eight millions of francs has foryears been in indigence wvas constantly applying to

from fear of his getting control of the child named the doctor who attended her and described the difficulties en countered in recovering the infant in paris maitre gatineau also read an entry from mrs hopes diary dated january   recording her daughters written intimation of her pregnancy and likewise the daughters letter which alluded with delight to the prospect of a firstborn child mirs hope even made the necessary preparations for nursing the child which was taken to paris and intrusted to a seamstress named castanet neice to mrs hopes chambermaid this woman went through the farce of pretending to find the child outside the docr and on the foundling bospital authorities restoring the infant they sbowed their expectation of having nothing more to do wvith it by giving up also the parchment strip placed on its arm on admission and usually retained to facilitate identitication the name camille was given because mrs carnegies maternal grandmother was camilla  lows because mrs carnegie was louisa  and napoleon because the emperor had interested himself in the matter the sponsors were mrs carnegie and m de billing alice knox remembered her mistress mrs carnegie bringidg an

one cannot help remarkingr how differently the english judge a crime accordinig as it is com mlaitted against their owvn or against a foreign country these  petroleurs  and  nihilits when they have carried on their operations on other than british territory the english regard as merely political criminals protected when in eng land by the right of asylum now that the dyna mite party threaten london and manchester with destruction the home secretary declares that they should all be  denationalized like pirates and treated as enemies of the human race but the english do not pride themselves on being logical and they alter tbeir views according to requirements and circumstances they do not pursue a policy of principles but a practical policy and this is per haps one of the chief sources of their siocressthe teidgraphe observesaccommcdating as the eeglish are and scoptical when conspiracies are carried on amng their continental neighbours they show plenty of energy when plots are revealed at homethey have not wasted their time and eloquence in historical and pbilosophical disquisitiona not content wvith exciting the police to greater vigilance adding to their numbers and organizing patrols they have not hesitated to adopt a nev law which may possibly at some future date over tturn altogether the english system of public and private liberties seeing that sir w harcourt has stated that this law is no temporary one but is to remain in force permanently    we do not wish by dwelling on the contrast of what is happecning in england with cvhat happens in france to fall into egotism for france too hag her socialsappers her revolutionary chemists and her pro i pagandists but what are their unechoed bravadoes their pitifully childish attempts in view of the unanimous inattention they meet with from all the advanced parties comipared with tbis vast social conspiracy in which legions of workers in destruction are enrolled and whichand this is a grave symaptorn

passages in thn speeches of the counrsel wbo naturally had access to informa tion at the most direct sources the general out lines of the case you have already published it arose out of the issue of a volumo of letters written in  and  by constant to madame rdeamier then at the height of her fame which letters sbe bequeathed to ber adopted daughter madame lenormant who published them a year and a half ago m destcurnelles constants grandnephewv attempted to prevent the publica tion  but having at one time givenl his consent without making any precise conditions he conse quently lost the caseas the deputyprocureur however pointed out no harm whatever has occurred to the family through the letters being made public for they have given rise to no animadversicns on tho character of the writer m destournelles con tends that it was from fear lest the letters which are love epistles througbout of avery ardent tone should subject the memory of his greatuncle to ridicule that he raised difficulties maitre le berquier his counsel said that many others besides constant had paid tribute to the same influence did not prince augustus of prussia offer madame recamier bis hand on condition
