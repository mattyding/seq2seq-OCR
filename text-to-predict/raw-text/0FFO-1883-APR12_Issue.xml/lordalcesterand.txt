very first to congratulate me im mediately after the battle of talelkebir and it would be impossible for me ladies and gentlemen to convey to you in suitable words the gratitude and pleasure which the receipt of his telegram afforded me on that occasion thear hear believe me that the first thought which enters into a british soldiers mind after any successful battle is the hope that what he has done and what he has achieved will be well received and be appreciated by his friends and countrymen at bome in england cheers i do not believe i cannot imagine that anyone my lord mayor who has not bimself experienced the sensation ean at all appreciate or realize the intense strain upon a commander immediately previous to and during the progress of an action and while the sounds of victory and shouts of success lre still riagiag in his ears can realize the great strain on every nerve and fibre of his mind and body when this takes place the receipt of a telegram such as that to which i have

alcester the master and wardens of the cutleas company formallv presented lord alcester as a freeman of their guild and a quaint proclamation attesting his lordships good name and fame was made amid some laughter by major sewell the clerk of the chamber lord alcester then read and subscribed the customary declaration in which he promised that he would he good and true to the queen obedient to the lordiayer of the city maintaining its privileges cstoms and bearing it harmless and tbat he would also in his owzn person keep the queens peace give due notice of any con spiracies and truly keep all laws and customsthe chberlalt mir benjamin scott addressing lord alcester saidmy lordin order that nothing should be wanting to the completeness of this days pro ctedingsthis honourable court has desired that your name may be enrolled on the list of honorary freemen of this ancient cityn compliment which as you have heard was paid on a former occasion to your gallant companion in arms lord volseley of cairo the duty accordingly de volves upon mue of addressing to your lordship a few wrords of congratulation and welcome tnese must be more than usually brief as this court has already expressed in ioquent and awprooriate terms its high appreciation ofthe dujce of oarmge who was received with cheers caidmy lord mayor your royal highness my lords snd gentlemeni have so recently had the honour of thanking your lordship and the corporation and citizens of london in this hall for compliments paid to the army that i really feel some diffidence in so soon again address ing you and those who are around me at the same time this gathering brings to my mind what i said on that occa sionthat it never happens in a large gathering of this rind in the uity that the army which i have the honour to represent is forgotten by our fellowcitizens of london at first sight there might be causefor astonishment inthat because we consider that the city of london represents the great commercial interests not only of this city but of the great empire to which we belong and to some it might appear singular that the city should have any sort of special affection for the military services which are entirely distinct from the daties avocations and ordinary daily life of citizens but when we come to look a little more closely at the subject it is not so singular after all now commerce depends upon security and security is the basis of commerce without security no commerce can thrive ans the reason why this great empire has such great commercial interests in all parts of the world is simply that our merchants can carry on their important daily avocations with perfect security and with the perfect conviction that no danger will arise to them or to the in terests with which they are identified one of our great objects is to exercise influencemoral inauence wve hear a great deal about moral influence in these days  i am all for moral inhuence laughter what does moral influ ence mean  it means physical force to back it cheers unless that physical force is always availableand in our days at very short noticeyou will find your moral ininu ence will be in a very uncomfortable position therefore i think the citizens of london and those who represent the great commercial bodies are all very wise in their genera tion lble and prudent men when they not only pay high compliments to the serviceswith one of which i am so im mediately connected and which i now represent but also feel that unless those services are kept in a proper state of efficiency the security of any commerical opera tions would be very different from what happily it now is again what is com nerce but power and what is power but empire let us look at this small island we hear nowadays that empire is not desirable but i am not one who agrees with that view confined to this small island we should be a very small people but now we are a great nationwith a great empire spread all over the world what does that represent but power ani influence  that isa great advantage not only to the pocket but also to those principles of liberty and justice throughout the world which we wish to see established among all nations that are civilized and even among those which as yet are not civilized therefore i say everything depends on power everything depends upon the importance and influence of empire they can produce moral influence but moral in fluence is not influence unless it is backed up by physical force assuming we have physical force it should never be exercised if it is possible to avoid it but that is no reason why it should not be put forward when it is neces sary abont this time last year who thought of a war in ggypt  at least it appeared so distant that no one thougt it likelyit came upon us suddenly sod we had to engage in wvar what was the object  it was to restore order to a conntry in vhich it was of vital imporaunce and interest for us that order should be maintained if moral influ ence could have done it we should not have used physical power muorl influence did not succeed  physical power became essential it was necessarv to tale the course we did nd her alajestys government in my opinion wisely adopted that course the result is this gathering to meet those distinguished officers whom the lord mayor delights to honour on this occasion i am quite convinced there is nothing that a soldier or a sailor feels more proud of when duties in the field have been performed than to find that his services are appreciated by his countrymen and of no appreciation is he more proud than of that of the lord mayor and citizens of london i hav e had high compliments paid to me  the sword i have in my hand was given to me by the ciizens of london in  i can perfectly understand the pleasure felt by the gallant and distinguished admiral and general who are now on my right hand i congratulate them on the just and honour able compliments that they receive on the present occa sion i congratulate the mnany general officers and officers around me who have had the honour of sharing in the glory of the recent campaign i am sure that tbey will rejoice with me in seeing their leaders honoured on this occasion and in the name of the army i thank the lord mayor for the high compliment he has paid to those distingnished officers and to the two services with whieb they are connected cheersthe eabl of noctvlnrook said he sbould very ill repre sent the feelings of the officers of the royal navy and of the royal marines if he did not say that they looked with pride upon the compliment that had been paid by the city of london to his gallant friend lora alcester if anything could add to the gratification of the navy it was that lord alcester was associated with lord wolseley thus furnish ing most appropriately an example of the harmony which had existed during the recent operations between the two servicesthe lorm mayot then said he had in propose a toast which would be received with the utmost enthusiasm he w as honoured by the presence of the distinguished admiral and the gallant generalwhose services had been so useful to the country during the receet campaign in egypt tlhe events of that campaign were fresh in the public memory but in justice to his noble guests he must refer to some of its leading inoidents last year things began to wear an unsettled appearance in egpyt and it became necessary to back up moral force by physical force hear hear moral force was exceedinglygood inits waybut solongas mankind remained in its present condition there must be something mrore potent behind it so the gallant admiral found him self at alexandria in command or a magnificent fleet but he exercised all the forbearance he could before striking a blowv showing that brave and valiant as he was he was human at heart in describing the further pro gress of the campagn his lordship touched upon the reported descent upon aboukir the supposed change of plan the seizure of the the midnight march and the fnal attack and he then remarkcd that he could not recall anything more successful in strategy and better carried out he bore hia testimonytothe valour of our indian fellow subjects  and he concluded by expressing the hope that london would always be ready to do honour to those to whom honour was due as it would to the chief guests of the evening who he trusted would long be spared to serve their queen and country laoud cheersloscd alcester saidno words of mine can express my feeling of the great honour conferred on me by the way in which the toast of my health has been received this evening i wish to express at the samae time my sense of the great honour i have received today from the city of londonan honour which in both the services is looked forward to as almost the culmination of a success ful career you have been gcod enough my lord miayor to allude in terms far more complimentary than i deserve to the services that we of the royal navy endeavoured to render to our country in the recent campaign i will say a word or two as to the earlier part of that campaign the extreme difficulty that attended the work i had to do was in the early part it was imnossible after the massacres that took place at alexandria en the llth of june to do anything in the way i should have liked ead it not been for the enormous european population and levantine population subjects of european powers i think it very possible that ivith the small force we had we snould nave endeavoured to have settled matters on the following morning but that was impossible in the circumstances there is a dis tinguished diplomatist present who will bear me out in saying that had we attempted to seek that redress which we were entitled to demand the lives of the enormous european poplilation of cairo and of egypt generally would have been placed in peril i was told in distinct terms that i must do nothingi was requested to do nothinguntil measures could be adopted to remove the european population the massacre of alexandria took place on the llth of june i will ask you to pay attention to what i sy lnow he last vessel containinerefugees from egypt was toweed out of the harbour of alexandria at  pm on the th of july and we at tacked the batteries at  oclock on the following morning therefore there was no lack of promptitude in endeavour ing to redress the grievances we had to obtain redress for the rest of it generally was an easy matter thanks to the gallant oficers seamen and marines under my command the task of silencing the forts of alexandria was a com paratively easy onetine that none of us had the slightest fear about wve had the very great advantage of being reinforced shortly by one of her majestys very best officers sir a alison and soon after by the most gallant and distinguished officer whom i had the honour of being associated with subsequentlygeneral sir garnet volseley to whom iovve every obligation possible it would be very wrong if i did not take this opportunity to return my thanks to those very gallant officers whom fortune placed under my orders l will begin by speaking of the admiralsecondin command admiral lowell and no one coild wish for a better second in commnand sir william hevwett secured the safety of the suez oaual under extreme difficulties sir francis sullivan left nothing to be desired in his management of affairs at port said at a time of difficulty it would be wrong if i did not speak of two ofrcers of other countries one is admiral conrad of the french navy ie was not respon sible for the change of policy which caused the withdrawal of the french support i know my gallanc friend wished to give us that support he wan not allowed to give nor couldi fail to appreciate what as ione by admiral nicholson of the united scates navy after the fring ceased when be got his ship under way in order to pass our squadrons and cheer them repeatedly be also landed his marines and assisted us in the prerervation of order and he did it well cheers he showed us every atten tion he could and i am sure he suffered for it ina the esti mation of the irishamerican party of new york no officer in my position ever received such support as i re ceived from my superiors and i beg to thank lord north brook sir cooper key and the members of the board of admiralty for what they did for me there was no wish of mine but wbat was almost antiipated the country naturally had its own opinion at the time about my pro ceedings but i was quite sure however i might be fettered at the start owing to the necessity of removing europeans if one endeavoured to do ones duty in the way of maintaining the honour nf england the country would back me up andthe countrydid backme up i would conclude by expressing the great pleasure with which i see so many officers of the sister service many of whom i saw under very difficult conditions in egvnt cheerslord wolseley who was enthusiasticauy greeted saidmay it please your royal highnesses my lord mayor my lords and gentlementhe highest praise and the greatest compliment that can be paid to a soldier no matter what his rank may be is to tell him that he has done his duty well and the fact of my being privileged to stand here this evening is to mue a proof that the cor poration of london believes that i have done my duty to the very best of my ability cheers i would ask for no other reward no matter how long i may have to live i can wish for no other glory i think thatif i may say so without being accusedof being selfglorious or vaini have gained the esteem of my fellow citizens of the city of london judging from the manner in which i was received this morning and the manner in which i am received again this evening as well as the way in which i was received upon a previous occasion many years ago when my lord mayor one of your predecessors did me the honour of in viting me to this hospitable hall and entertaining me here cheers a war that has been successftlly carried out and brought rapidly to a successful end is alvays i believe a very pleasant subject of subsequent conversation even to those who have taken part in it although in going through a campaign one has to face miseriesperhaps as we often had to do in egypt hunger and thirst and many otber discomfortsyet in talking of a war after it is over those miseries and discomforts are generally forgoiten and its glories and successes only remain in the memory i have never however felt the least sympathy for myself or for the officers associated with me in experiencing the privations of warbecause every english gentlemanand we know that every officer of the english army comes from that classhas for his birthright a devotion to his queen and country and a longing desire to do whatever duty he may be called upon to discharge the offiecer who takes part in military campaigns knows very well too that on returning home he will be received with outstretched arms by friends and acquaintances he knows very well that honours in war mean promotions and those things that are dear to monkind but the position of the rank and file of the army and the noncommissioned officers is very different every officer wbe is here knows very well that to the badly educated and poorly educated private soldier there is no great career open if he fall in doing his duty before the enemy of his country no monuments are raised to commemorate his heroism if he lives to go home even after a successful war he knows there will be no large number of friends and acquaintances assembled to meet him and greet him and to do him honour few honours and rewards are in store for him be has to content him self with that noblest of all convictions that of havin done his duty it is especially upon occasions like the present that this feeling oppresses me i cannot but always feel asbamed as it were to be singled out for nniuerous bonoura and rewards and to feel that those rewards have been won for me by others they have been gained for me by the gallantry of that splendid and daring little army with which i have recently been asso ciated and which i had the privilege to comnmaind cheers i should be unworthy i think of the high posi tion which has been conferred upon me by my sovereign if upon occasions like the present i were to foret those to whom i really owe that position i canndt help remem bering that the psition which i now occupy has not been won for me or gained by me by purchase by favouritism or by the favours of the great cheers i owe it to the valour of my comrades the soldiers of the army cheers i think i am therefore justified in saying that i ought to remember them upon this occasion and i am sure that i shall not be accused of any irreverence if i addmay my right band forget its cunning if i ever forget those comrades the men whom i love and to whom i owe so much cheers imy noble and gallant friend in the most excellent straightforward and seamanlike speech which he has made which fer bave all listened to with so much intere t has been good enough to refer to me with the generobity for which he is so well known by every man who has ever served with him he has referred to me in the most flattering terms it is not on that account i would say little about him it is because i feel that i and the men who marched with me from ismailia to cairo owe my friend and colleague lord alcester a deep debt of gratitude cheers it has been my lot upon many occasions during my life to take part m expeditions in which the army and the navy were most intimately associated together and i cannot recall any one single instance where these two ser vices worked more harmoniously together and with one common object in viewnamely the great inte rest of this country and the honour of her majestys arms cheers i have no intention to weary you by attempting to particalarize individualsthough i should like very much to do so but i would venture to refer to one name that lord alcester has recorded as being speciauy deerving of mention it is the name of one who has been a comrade of mine in previous warsa man whom to know as a comrade is almost to lovea man whose presence witb any military force is alnost itself a guarantee of victory so umnversal is the confidence wvhich ho inspires i refer to sir william hewett the commanierinchief of the east indian squadron it is not a novel discovery on my part but one which every officer present who has ever taken part in war will corroborate that you will always find in any war and in every army and i daresay in every navy any number of men who are most anxions tc take part in the proceedings in what is caled the front in constant contact with the enemy but in order that there should be a suficient number of men to operate in the front it is absolutely i spensable that there should be a long line of communications a tried body ot men working day and night in order that the front should bsproperlysupplied with provisions and au that they reqmire and that we should have a corresponding stream to bring back daily our sick and woumded now of all the disagreeable duties that can fall to either soldier or sailor this is the most disagreeable and the most trying and arduous and i thin that the men employed upon it deserve of au others far more than the men who lead storming parties the gratitude and praise of their countrymen cheers this work to which i bave referred was done by her majestys navy under my friend lord alcester in the recent war daring the advance from ismailia to caire we were in great difficulties as you know about trans ports lord aicester came to my assistance at once he placed the whole of his boats at mydisposal and owing to the assistance he rendered me we were able to maintain a sufficient force ini front cheers i think you will agree with me in saying that this alone entitles lord alcester and his gallant seamen and marines to our eternal grati tude as my gallant friend knows there was scarcely a day passed that i did not make some new demands upon him and no matter what the demand it was given with that boihomie and generosity for which he is remark able and so anxious was he at all times to meet those demands that i verily believeand i often said so at the timethat if i had asked him to drag his fleet overland to cairo he would at least have tried to do so iaughter i wish i could express in more suitable terms than those i have endeavoured to do so my feelings of gratitude to the navy but i can only gay this about tbem and especially about their gallant commander that should any general or commander of hler majestys troops in the field at any future day ever find himself in the samne position as that in which i found myself in egypt may he find in his naval colleague as able and as gallant a man and as firm a riend as i found in lord alcester there is one niore subject which i cannot pass over snd it is thisan army in the field that is not provided with a thoroughly and scientifically trained staff men wellnao customed to superintend the movements of troops in the field is in a very bad way indeed i am glad to say that i had a most efecient staff during the recent campaign when the expedition was neing organized his royal high ness the field marshal conmmandinginchief with that rnilitary intuition which all who have acted wvith him know him to be possessed of allowved me to choose the tools i had to work with and indeed i cannot fancy a greater cruelty and folly than to ask a general officer to work wvith instruments that he has no trust in or that he has not been accustomed to i can only say with regard to the staff who worked with me that none could have worked better i shall not refer to them by name except to say that they worked under one of our most gallant and able generalssir john adye cheers tie
