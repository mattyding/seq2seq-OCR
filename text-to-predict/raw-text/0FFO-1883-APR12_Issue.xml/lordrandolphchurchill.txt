lord bandolph churughill on thecounty franchtsrlord randolph churchill presided last evening at as intercollegiate deabate held in the botanical theatre d university college where a proposal was under discussici that the parliamentary franchise should be conferred uwpo the inhabitants of counties on the same terms as those ol which it is enjoyed by the inhabitants of borougis thi noble lord in concludirng the debate said it contrastet very favourably with one which took place a week ago ih the rouse of commons on the same subject during the progress of the debate in the llouse there were at ni time norethan  members present and it at last col lapsed through a countout while a very distinguishet liberal was addressing the hlouse if they had had tht erperience he had had in parliament they would he dik not doubt come to the conclusion he had arrived atviz that neither party or rather tha leaders of neither party were in earnest on the subject the present governmen said they would deal with the subject next year well rhe lives of governments in the present day were so pre carions that he thought if her liajestys govermmeni were in earnest in the matter they would not lose a mo ment in dealing with it the radical party were a littli in advance of the age on this question they based thei demand for an extension of the suffrage principally on thn great anomalies of the present system of voting  but then was no doubt whatever that their scheme for the extensici of the franchise and the redistribution of seats would i carried to its legitimate and logical lengths create annma lies even greater perhaps than those which they wishei to redress and would create an anomaly which hp thought would be more fatal to english political life thai anythindghe could conceive for they would absolutel abolish and destroy the great feature of the english par liamnentthe broad clear and definite distinction whicn had existed between the interests of the town and of thi country the anomalies of which the liberals principalli complained were no doubt very great but it had always appeared to him that tbey wore anomalies that could bi ramoved to a very considerable extent if not entirely bj a thorough rearrangement of their borough boandario and by a very considerable redistribution of seats on gentleman who had addressed them pointed out wha undoubtedly was a very practical grievance ble had tol them that their great towns were sd overcrowded thaltine artisans were anxious it possible to jive out of them but that if they livel in the suburbs they came nnder s higher franchise nd were liable to luse their votes that was a matter that could be entirely corrected bi altering the boundaries of boroughs which were now fai too narrow for the town populations compared to whal they were in s then they had another anomaly un doubtedly in the present distribution of tee representa tion the anomaly had olten been alluded to of smal boroughs returning one memnber no doubt if they wert going to enfranchise largely the agricultural community this wvould be an indefensible anomaly but if not tin rmall boroughs fulrilled the very useful task of represeni ig the agricultural population to which the suffrage ws not extended the town he himself represented fc instance woodstock almost entirely consisted of agr cultural labourers but there was one greater anomaj than small boroughs and that was the considerable nun ber of boroughs wvithi populations of from  to o returning twn members to parliament the question ha been discussed whether or no tile agricultural laboercr desired the franchise and iie would tell toem wvly he bhought they did not desire it very ardentlr if a large class of the people desired to exercise tie parliamentary franchise they could very easily shoy to those who had it in their pow er to confer it on then nut only their esire but also their intention to get ia they could show it in the same enthusiastic and decidde manner that the artisan classes of the country showel their intention to get the franchise before the reform bli of  there could be no dobt in the mind of parli ment at that time that the classes taking part ic thoe proceedings desired ardently to have and intended b have the franchise but he did not think they could poilt to any similar proceedings on the part of the agriculturil laboarer ile had never heard of a large meeting of agr cultural laboarers caued together in any part of eglad solely for the purpose of demandinsthatparliameentshanliexcend the franchise to them and he believed he w s stating a fact wben he said that no petition on the subje�t had ever been presented to parliament signed solely br agricultural labourers in favour of the county franchise if tben the agricultural labourer did not desire the fran chse there was not much good in bestowing it on him and in the absence of the desire it clearly did not seem to be expedient to the state to force it on and under such circumstances he should be unwilling to consider the en franchisement of  agricultural labourers another thing was this the reform bius of  and  in creased enormously the influence of the boroughs and inx the present representation of the country the borough in fluence had a distmet preponderance but if they enfran chised a million and a half ot agricultural laboarers they would altogether alter that balance lf then this matter were really placed before the borough populations he greatly doubted whether the question would be the ele ment of strength to the liberal party that they supposed it woald ba es did not believe the boroughs which were now to a great extent a trained electorate were prepared to see their power equalized at any rate and perhaps overborne by an immense acquisimion of country voters who were not in any sense of the word a trained electorate nor should it be forgotten that parliament uot only dealt with englsnd but with hcotland and also with ireland and he would point out tn them that if they went in broadly and largely for a great principle and said they would have equal representation in town and country in england they must either apply the sane principle to treland or do what would be one of the most fatal things they could doviz increase greatly the inequalities which existed already between the two countries was the most enthusiastic liberal prepared to face a larger measure of electoral reform for ireland in its present state  they had in ireland a borough franchise of e rating and a county franchise of � rating were they prepared to assimilate the borough franchise in ire land to tbat in england and then to go further and assimilate the county franchise in ireland to the borough franchise  the man who proposed such a measure as that in the present condition of ireland would be a very bold and enterprisir g politician the liberal party were desirous to wave the county franchise question before the electors as the cry that united them the most or as that which so far as they could see divided them the least and the conservatives on the other hand were also extremely anxious to show immense confidence in the bill but he was of opinion that neither party intended seriously to deal with the question at present that the conservative leaders had no more intention of dealing with it than they bad of disestablihirg the english church and further that all this political humbug existed because they had no real bead flde agitation to do away with it directly there was a strong feeling in the country among enfranchised and unenfranchised classes that this question ought to be dealt with toe political parties wonld he terribly anxious to deal with it hut until it showed itself by signs widely different from anything writh which they had been fa voured they would find the present state of empty professions and no performances indefiitely continued cheers and counter cheers
