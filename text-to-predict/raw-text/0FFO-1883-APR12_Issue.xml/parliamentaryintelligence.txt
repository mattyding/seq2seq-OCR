to introduce a bill on this subject ee was distinctly anxious to consult the hon member for carlow and it was also absolutely necessary carefully to consult the hon member for kildare to whom it was owing that the question had been so far advanced as it waselectivi councils ireland billmr barry in moving tbe second reading of this bill expressed his regret that the hon member for wexford mr healy the author of the measure who was so thoroughly acquainted with the subject was not present to take charge of the bill the prineiple of the bill that taxation and representation should go hand in hand was recognized in this country as a fundamental principle the question of grand jury and presentment sessions reform had been frequently the subject of parliamentary investigation so far back as  a royal commission consisting entirely of representatives of the grandjury class and therefore not likely to make any suggestions of a sweeping character was appointed in  that com mission reported very strongly in favour of an amendment of the law dealing witb presentment sessious the report pointed oat how the intentions of parliament to give the ratepayers some control over the expenditure of the rates had been frustrated the associated cesspayers being ap pointed by the grand juries there were instances of men so appointed being unable to road or vrite or being deaf and dumb while persons who had no prolperty in the dis trict sometimes outvoted those who were nominated to represent the ratepayers but tbough the royal commis sion had reported more than  years ago and though the flagrant evils of the system were then brought out in the eidence nothing was done in  the government by the hands of sir g grey introduced a bill the leading proposal of which was that twothirds of the ratepayers representatives should be elected that bill shared the fate of many others and was drodped sir g grey pro mised that the bill ehonld be reintroduced next session but the promise was not kept nothing was done umtil  when the initiative was taken not by the govern ment but by sir denham norreys weho introduced a bill very similar in its general principle to the bill brought in by sir g grey in  the bill was defeated it was reintroduced in  and  and met with the same fate ln  the late mir isaac butt then sitting as a conservative brought forward a motion asking for a com mittee to inquire how far the principle of popular repre sentation might be utilized in county goverenment in irelaad re was answered by mr cardwell that inquiry was unnecessary as the principle of popular representation in fiscal matters was already conceded and was invited by him tu introduce a bill based on the repesentative principle but mr butt who knew what the fate of such a bill would be in the hands of a private member pointed out that the duty of introducing a measure lay on the shoulders of her majestys government nothing further was done until  when a select committee over which the ocooor don presided was appointed to inquire into the whole grand jury system a copious report was issued in which it was shown that neither the grand jury nor the presentment sessions were of a representative character the grand jury being nominated by an individual and ics members not necessarily con nected witb the contry while the associated cesspayers were selected by the grand jury and therefore were not real representatives of the ratepayers ihey recom mended tthat the presentment sessions should be made independent of the grand jury and shouli represent the ratepayers of the barony but nothing was done in  the late mr isaac butt introduced a bill very similar in principle to the bill he was about to introduce the chief difference between the two schemes being that mr butta bill proposed to select from each barony three ratepayers and one magistrate he did not think anybody at this time of day could charge mfr butt with very revalutionary ideas or intentions and he thought his proposals would be now recognized generally as moderate and statesmanlike on the occasion of that bill which met with a good deal of support in the house mr hugh law now lord chancellor of ireland expressed a remarkable opinion to the effect that it seemed then to be universally admitted that the present system was one whieh could not be maintained and that the representaive system was the only one that could satisfactorily carry out tne fiscal arrangements in irish counties among other induential snpporters of mr butts bill he found the names of mr trevelyan sir charles dilke and a great many other leading liberals but then a tory gover nment was then in power rear bear nothing further was
