election intelligencecrotonsir robert eermoneodge cu candidates mr j e raphael li m frank smith lab pollnt odyujnionist majority at last election proz oyr speci conrespondentn croydon mrcih all sorts ancl conditions of men women children and journalists to quote mr asquith are engaged in forecasting the result of the poll and the individual elector who after all has something todo with the matter might be excused if he concluded that his vote could now make no difference either way i am not dis closing any secret when i say that not one of the parties in this contest has made anything like an exhaustive canvass of the constituency and that being so it is impossible to make a well grounded forecast of the poll there are  houses in the parliamentary borough and  miles of streets it would have been impracticableeven with more outside help than any of the parties here have had to go closely over such a constituenoy in ten days the unionist canvass as far as it has gonehas been thorough and if the bulk is represented by the sample it is also exceedingly satisfactory but if those electors who have not promised their support to any of the candidates go off to london tomorrow morning without having first voted andargue that as the promises are sufficient to settle the electioa indubitably they need not return in time to vote then the calculations which have been founded upon a partial canvass will be disappointed as theatres and theatre suppers in london naturally exert inereased attraction as the evening approaches and as a byelection tends to lose its commanding influence when the busy elector has been away from it for a few hours and becomes inunersed in other interests the rmost prudent courso for the thousands of croyden men who go to business in london is to vote before they go if they adopt this course they will not only make certain of having voted and baving contributed to the relief of the rush which there always has been at the polling stations in the evening but they w also have ensured their families a day of peace until the elector polls the agents of the candidates will never be off his doorstep the considerate husband and father should not only vote early he should take care that the agents outside the polling station know that he has voted then his house will be granted a valued immtunityif those electors who have been canvassed vote according to their promises and if those who have not been canvassed vote in similar pro portions to those who have there will no doubt be a great majority at the close of the poll for sir robert hermonhodge over the votes of the other candidates combined if the electors of croydon made the supreme effort which in the circumstances of the constituency would be necessary to give a  poll it is reckoned that the total poll would be divided in the proportions of   and  with regard to the last fiagre i believe the supporters of the labour candidate will be highly gratified if he receives  votes and it may be that the liberal poll itself will not be diminished in the remarkable degree for which many liberals are resigned in order to secure the largest possible total poll motorcars and helpers will be required in very considerable numbers and it need hardly be added that the candidate for whom they may be intended will give them a cordial welcomenow that an emphatic victory for sir robert lermanhodge is on all hands taken for granted dangerously taken for granted from i sir roberts point of viewit may be worth while to glance at some of the causes which have brought the unionist candidate the support of the populace to begin with sir robert hermonhcodge is an experienced poli tician an al eeable speaker and an exponent of moderate views his programme itself is the party programme with special prominence given to tariff reform and exceptional prominence to the navy it is these two questions which have really counted in his campaign the navy has never before been talked of so much in an elec tion and it may well be hoped that it may not be considered necessary ever to talk so much of it again the candidates themselves have not failed in sense of responsibilitv upon the subject but the promiscuous politicians in the election have used the navy rather freely for the liking of those who have a single eye to its welfare it is extremely probable that many electors will vote upon the navy question as the dominant issue and in so far as that is done the significance of theelectionl with regard to tariff reform will be modified but there can be very little doubt that if tariff reform had maintained its preeminence in the unionist campaign the result would still have been practicaily the same sir robert hermonhodge is known as one of the pioneers of tariff reform  he has given it a leading position in his election speeches and no one who has been in croydon for the last week can doubt that it has been far and away the most popular of the party policies before the constituencymr raphael being but a beginner suffers in contrast with the unionist candidate both in political experience and in readi ness of speech his athletic record and his pleasant manner have won him personal popu larity and he has had no occasion to com plain of his treatment at his meetinas but his defensive attitude in respect of both the navy and free trade has necessarily been uiheroicand even if it had been spiced with raids and forays of counterattack it would still have been unacceptable the people of croydon have no enthusiasm for free trade and they desire to express a view upon the present position of the navy they are thus led to vote against the freetrade candidate who holds that the navy is a topic for another time and another place mr raphaels positive policy the taxa tion of land values has not aroused any fervour and the dominating issueis aiunnecessary to say that i allude to the house of lords has hardly been mentioned at all in the election i ought to add in view of some misunderstand ing of the matter that mir raphael has denounced socialism as emphatically and as unequivocally as the unionist candidate himself mr frank smith handicapped by the laek of socialist or even labour newspapers in the district and with a very indefinite policy to present has made a very slight impression upon the constituencylast night a huge crowd in katherinestreet was entertained with two cinematograph exhibi tions two gramophone concerts one powerful searchlight and a doru hoarselyroared speeches it was probably lust as well that the voices of the speakers drowned one another the time is rapidly approaching when the respon sible political organizations will have to assume some responsibility for and control over thestreet corner speakers who under the presenwt arrangement of special societies for this that and the other cause may be very imperfectly acquainted with the general subjects which they discuss and very ill equipped for the task of presenting the views which they have adopted they rarely attract any but lads and a few argwnentaftive rivals and no cause would loseand the loeal authorities anld the police would be gratefulif they were with drawn from the streets it was a relief the other night to turn away from a freetrader who was speaking through a megaphone over the heads of a crowd which did not wish him to speak at all and listen for a moment to the rather fantastic vibws of mr stewart gray presented in a gentle and natural voie imr gray does not require his absurd white smock and brazen or golden cross to make him con eieuous he need only speak quiotly d without anger as he docs where all his coimpetitors are roaring hoarsely and he wil continue to be assured of his own marvelling crowd the woman suffragiste of course being for the most part cultured women are above criticism as speakers in the street or anywhere else like the atrange mr gray they speak witha pleasing quietness and invariably have attentive audiencee yester day after a round of processions and indoor demonstrations they were for the first time absolutely refused a hearing in the street and indeed were treated with some roughnessbut it was saturday night and the town was crowded with visitors it is agreed on all aides that the croydon people have conducted themselves in the most exemplary inatner throughout
