addenbrookes hospitalcambridgeit is a matter for regret that a valuable institution like addenbrookes hospital cambridge which is not only the county hospital but also the clinical hospital of the medical school of the university should constantly be in danger of having its useful ness curtailed owing to lack of funds three years ago it was found necessary to appeal to the public for an increased incomc and although the response was on a fairly satisfactory scale the resources of the hospital are not at the present time suimfcient to defray the expenditure the difficulty experienced by this institution like so many others of a similar character is to secure an adequate regular income from subscriptions it has only been possible in fact to carry on the hospital in recent years by the help of donations from generous friends like lord peckover and others and by using legacies at times for current expenses the committee regret the necessity for this course which however is not peculiar to this hospital on the other hand it is obviously desirable that as far aspossible bequests hould he put aside for the double purpose of giving greater taoillity to the income andg of accumulating funds for the capital expenditure which from time to time is inevitably required the committee realize this and in order to secure that this policy may be carried out an effort is now being made to render the subscription ist more worthy of the town and county of cambridge a committee has been formed with the mayor of cambridge r h g lvhiteley as chairman for the purpose of obtaining subscriptions and donations in an appeal which has been issued by the committee it is stated that the income arisingf from investments in  was £ and the annuaf subscriptions excluding a grant of £ from the university were £s the expenditure was over £ and for the balance of income to meet this the hospital was compelled to rdly mainly on colcec tions and donations the legacies received in the last seven years amounted to £ or less than £ a year unfortumately the hospital saturday fund which was organized by an outside committee has recently been abandoned and addenbrookes loses £ a yelar for the time being in consequence including this loss for the current year it is estimated that the deficit will be from £ to £in response to a special appeal which was made by the committee last september about £ has been received but only £ of this amount represents new and increased subscriptions which wil recur next year it is important if the usefulness of the hospital is not to be crippled by a rigorous system of  cutting down expenses which probably means the closing of wardsthat the annual subscriptions shall be increased by £ a year towards this as indicated £ has been promised and it is desired that before september next at least  new subscribers of five g uneas a year may be secured it is not unreasonable perhaps to hope that non resident members of tne university may realize the duty of helping the hospital at this crisis in its career
