with the state of affairs at the end of february field operations are now bakward and the land is so sodden that injudicious haste to recover lost groundin the sowing of cereals the cultivation of hopgardens and the prepara tion of land for potatoes and mangels might lead to injury to the mechanical condition of the soil and the welfare of the cropsthe adverse elements have been severe in al districts a northumberland correspondent writingonlady day states that upto theend of februarv farm work was well forward but now everything is backward a good part of the turnip land being still unploughed and not a seed sown or likely to befor some time in north lincolnshire also work was forward in february but was almost stationary for three weeks a prominent farmer in the neighbourhood of lincoln states that he began sowing spring corn on march  aiid that only twice in  years did he start laternamely on march   and march   he could have sown in february but does not care to drill so early notwithstanding the recent heavy rains the effect of the frosts is still visible in the condition of thelincolnshire soils which crumble into a nice mould he adds the snow and rain were badly needed but we should have liked them two months sooner the frost was severe upon the later sown wheat and rolling is urgently needed to consolidate the soil but as arule the plant looks well corn has made more money than last year and the worst feature in lincolnshire as in other counties is the drop in the price f sheep reckoned at s per head this means that many are being sold now at about what they cost in thoauturm in west hants and south wilts work was never in such a forward condition at the first of marlh aswas the case this year oat and barley sowing was well advanced in february but there has been sucha long birak this month that field operations are xtow backward andthe imme diate future is anticipated with considerable anxietv mik paoductionthough dairy farmers are anticipating with impatience thepromised milk bill the tedium of waiting is relieved by thenecessities of a trying period the past three months have imposed an exceptional tax upon the food producing resources of

movement in vegetation ilast week put a better complexion upon things and inspired the hope that the pastures would come to the rescue in time to avert the acute state that at one time seemed imminent midland and northern farmers will in the natural order of things have to wait a few weeks longer for grass and although theyentered upon the winter season with bountiful supplies of roots and an average amount of hay they are by no means sanguine that the reserves will last until the grass comes unless strict economy is practised the dairy farmer makes a point of keeping the food bill as low as possible but he has a wholesome dread of compulsory economy lhe knows from experience that if once a cow is allowed to fall off in her yield of milki is difficult to induce her to regain the former

prospects of the markets for their december and january lambs while in the southdownoxford down suffolk shropshire lincoln and other longwool flocks the lambs are sure on foot and released from the confines of the lambing pen the flocks that lambed down in march have had a very trying time artificial shelter from snow wind and rain having been essential for the greater part of the month and with vegetation inactive hand feeding was general and expensive the fall of lambs in theomidearly flocks was similar to that in the earlier districts the distinguishing features being the moderate proportion of doubles and the welldeveloped healthy condition of the lambsas lambing has only begun in the marsh hill and mountain flocks no details as to the results are yet available the prospect however is not reassuring as the recent severe weather left the ewes in enfeebled condition and at the same time depleted the storesof roots and hay in the few localities where provision is made against emergencies in the spring months in northumberland lambing has just begun a flockowner writes that turnips are getting scarce while the ewes are thin in conditibn and some of them milking badly lincolnishire flockowners have had a trying experience as the storm occurred in the middle of the lambing season the deathrate during the blizzard from miarch  to  was heavy according to a correspondent  thousands of lambs having died live stock as a rule are healthy but owing to the scarcity of keep it has been avery expensive season much artificial food being necessary turnips were plentiful in the autumn but arenow scarce and an erly supply of grass is needed in the hampshire down country also the health of the flcks is satis factory lambs however are a short crop owing to the scarcity of twins and many complaints are heard as to the scarcity of keep and the big bills incurred inf the purchase of feeding stuffs farmers in wiltshire and hampshire where sheep breeding forms so important a pursuit are anticipating small profits  in account of the scarcity of keep the low price of fat sheep and the high price of artificial feeding mateialszalm iiseasesanthrax was not quito

ewesthe experimentsini the production of fat lambs wluch have been in progress at midryn the farm icnted bytbe niversity coulege of north wales bangor were continued last year and the resuits have been published in leafet form by professor winter the ewes used in the experiments were of the welsh mountain breed and the object in view was to ascertain the brced of ram that would mate vith them t best advantage in begetting early maturing and marketabe lambs the rams selected last year were of the sotithdownl wiltshire dorset horn ryeland arid kerry hill breeds  ewes being set apart to each only eight ewes produced twins four each in the southdown and dorset horn lots and with dne exception the whole of the lambs were reared    thelambs were sold to the butcher as they became fat and the time of marketing was reckoried an iinportant point for or asainst the respective crosses the first selection for tue market was made on or before july  and the kerry hill crosses esaily occupied the first plaee no fewer than  per cent being ready at thatdate as corapared with  per cent of the nviltshire crosses  per cent of the southdown  per cent of the dorset horn and  per cent of the rycland crosses there was very little difference in the average weights the dorset horns averaging b live weight and the wriltshire b which were the highest and lowest respectively the second lots were sold on or before august and thelast onor before septem ber  when the consignment comprised  per cent qf the southdowns  per cent of the dorset horns  per cent of the wiltshires  per cent of the ryelands and s per cent of the kerry hill crossesthe first place is assigned to the kerry hill crosses wbich not only excelled in early niiaturity but also took aprominent place in the matter of live weight and quality in the rearing of lambs rapid fattening is a strong reeomimendation since it means less expenditure in food and higher rates of realization as prices fall in proportion to the increase in the supply hence the type of lamb that will come early to market will generallyprove more profitable than one capable of attaining greater weight but slower in reaching maturity tlhe dopset horn crosses were the heaviest but for some reason probably connected vwith the ram in service they did not fatten so readily as in the previous year the rcsults obtained however warrant further trials with this cross the wiltshire breed now met with in l worth les only has a high reputation for if crossins qualities but it did not excel last year although lt showed improvement compared with  the sotlthdown on the other band was disappointlng more especiall in regard to the rate ot mcturing a defect which again must be attri butable to the influences of the individual ram for in former years these crosses have sllovn a better record in this respect the ryeland crosses are escribed as of nice quality and of satisfactory weights the notewort y feature of lest years trials undoubtedly wa the success of the terry iiiu crosses which indicates that there is no need for welsh farmers to go outside their own country for rams suitable for mating with mountain ewes for the production of fat lambsexpenditure for agricultujraleducation a parliamentary paper cd  has been pre pared and issued by the bbard of education giving tables of expenditure for agricultural education comprising grants from the board of agriculture and the board of education with the disbursements of the various cqunty councils sir robert morant in a prefatory note explains that it is not possible for reasons mentioned to give an exact statement of such expenditure or of the grants ini aid and eypresses doubt as to wvhether the estimated figures can be regarded as more than approximations the chief difficulty in arriving at exact computations is tighe close interrelationship of the general scientificvork in most of the ujniversities and university colleges  in six of the nine institutions which make specific provision for agricultural education and re ceive grants from one or other of the state depart ments the work is so interwoven with the general scheme of the university or college that neither the expenditure norz the work accomplished can be measured by the definite information available therefore it is held that the only statement that can properly be made of the grants given by the exchequer inaid of agricultural education in theuniversity or university college plane is one which includes all the various government grants paid annually to all the universities and university colleges in england and wales which provide agricultural education total grants had been made to the nine institutions of £t £ of which is paid by the board of agriculture £bythe board of education

increasing number of the local horsebreeding clubs and societies prefer to make their choice of stallions at the london shows or other open competitions but there are still many districts in which opportunities are pro vided to stud owners for placing their horses be£ore the local farmtrs and hence the continued popularity of the local horse parade a marked change has been noticeable in the character of the exhibits at tlhese  local events in recent years horses of indifferent merit and pedigree are still plentiful but there is a much larger proportion of well bred weighty sound sires than was to be seen some  or  years ago the point upon which attention has to be mainly concentrated now is the freedom from hereditary unsoundness there is no scarcity of meritorious horses of popular pedigree but the danger of hereditary ailments still exists and demands resolute action onthe part of breeders the posses sion of a veterinary certiflcate of freedom from defects transmissible

that the public had been scared by newspaper reports about the supply of impure milk it was his opinion that more deaths vwere due to the want of milk than to the use of it as an article of food he regretted that in some instances dealers wero selling milk at a lower price than they paid for it which could be done only by adulteration he described how cream was adulterated by the use of condensed separated nilk a process against which there was no law he asked those present to appeal to membeis of parliament and the board of agriculture to pro hibit this in regard to the third report of the royal commission on tuberculosis and its probable effect on the milk trade mr sadler said he had carefully tead the report sand saw nothing to justify the recommendation of the committee the cllam£n mir c e linaker said that they should take care that the methods of milk production and tho housing of cattle were such as did not con duce to tuberculosis hei was of opinion that the high pressure put upon dairy cattle by certain methods of feeding helped in producing the disease experiments recently corducted showed that cattle kept in cool byres produced larger quantities of milk
