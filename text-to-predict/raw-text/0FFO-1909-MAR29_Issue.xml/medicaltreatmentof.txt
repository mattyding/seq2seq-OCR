medical treatmt of schoolcbiire nthe education committee of the london county council have issued a reporb with referenoe to the medical treatment of children attending public elementary schools which has been considered by a subcommittee consisting of members of the edruea tion committee and representatives of various insti tutions including ir n g bennett british dental association sir victor horsley british medical association lord choylesmore hospital sunday foand mr douglas owen london eospital aud dr  gray charity organization societytho subcommittee reporb that sufficient accom modation in hospitals dispensaries and infrmnrics exists to deal with the graver cases that require special treatment but that with regard to the more ordinary ailments of children a large amount of routine work is necessary the provision for which is inadequate and in many parts of london entirely absent they find that there is among the cbildren a prevalence of dental caries and that a large number of them suffer from defective vision in the case of both these defects the existing accommnodation in the hospitals and dispensaries for examination and treatment is inadequate they recommend that it is desirable that provision should be made for simple dental treatment of school children and that instruc tion in the hygiene of the teeth should be given to school children their parents or guardians and as regards eyesight that additional provision is desirable for the treatment in the vicinity of the school of all children sufferlng from errors of refraction and that ajl cases treated should be re examined every other yeardealing with ringworm the subcommittee state that owing to this obnoxious and contagious disease many children estimated at  annuallyinregular attendance are prevented from attending school and expose others to infection at home they report that the cure of the disease by lotions and ointments is a slow process but that by means of the xray treatment the disease can bepracticauy stamped out thus rendering unnecessary the present schools specialy maintained for children suffering from it they  consider that provision is desirable for the treatment of the disease by xsrays at air rxed centre or centres and recommend that powerjsoud be given to compel the attendance of children for treatment immediately on discovery of the diseasethe subcommittee urge that provision is desirable for the proper treatment of suppurating ears with wbich  cbildren suffer in the immediate vicinity of the school but that any cases requiring operation and all cases of enlarged tonsils or adenoids calling for operation should be referred to hospital or private treatment thev consider that it is desirable that further provision be made of schools on the rles of the existing openair day schools at which debilitated children could be admitted by the local education authority for short periods pointing out that such children like those suffering from the defects already mentioned are unable fully to profit by the instruc tion given them in the public elementary schools as to tuberculosis they come to a similar conclusion they find that many cases discharged after treatment from hospital and other cases not treated in hospital or convaesesent home require rest and sanitary surroundings for their effective and permanent cure and that the disease could in a large number of eases be arrested or cured if such means were pro vided for its treatment in the eatliest stages and that it is of the first importance that it should be so treated they recommend that children in whom tubercular disease of the bones or joints is detected should be sent to their private practitioner or to hospitals for treatmentthe education committee consider that the existing provision of private and hospital practice sufficiently meets the requirements in the case of children requiring operative and inpatient treat ment and do not recommend any action in this respect but they propose that to supplv the addi tional provision for the medical treatment of school children which has been found desirable the council should utilize existing institutions of the types now existing giving financial help if necessary and receiv ing special facdities but that in districts whero no suitable institution exists or can be provided the council should consider whether it shall make the provision itselfthe finance committee express the hope that in view of the prime ministers statement as to no increased exchequer grant being possible for medical treatment the adoption of which is optional the council would first consider whether they will adopt such treatment at all they point out that the education rate is rising and must under present conditions and in the absence of increased govern ment grants continue to rise they question whether there is not a limit to the burden which the ratepayer should be called upon tober in connexion with education and point out that at present it is impossble to aloulate the cobo te ucal taeattgtho dzam
