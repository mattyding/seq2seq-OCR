the amhst ilbrary the price of the caxtonson the morning of the first days sale december   we announced that the fine series of books from cazxtons press which formed an important feature of the library of lord amherst of haclney had been sold en bloc by messrs sotheby wilkinson and hodge to a private buyer a very handsome offer we stated was made to the auctioneers and submitted to lord amherst who wishing to keep the collection together decided to accept it and the transaction was concluded last night nieither the xiamb of the new owner nor the price paid was ststed the identity of the formermr j p morgan was sufficiently indicated at the time but the very natural curiosity concerning the price has not hitherto been satisfied this very handsome offer is stated to have been £ in any case it must have been far higher than the books were likely to realize at auctionin the case of such excessively rare books as those from caxtons press books whichalways have been and always will be in keen demand in spite of the everchanginag fashions in book collecting it is mogt difficult to arrive at even a satisfactory estimate of their approximate commercial value condition is always a prime factor and the difficulty with caztons is that they are nearly always more or loss generally moreincomplete nine of lord anhersts  may be described as perfect the absence of blank leaves not counting as an imperfectionhow it will naturally be asked does the price understood to have been paid for tho collection of caxtons compare with a reason able estimate of their market value of today  we think that this will be best seen by tabu lating the whole collection and by quoting the highest pnces paid for other or the same copies of the same works the amherst cas tons in the following list are arranged chrono logically with the lot number of each in the sale catalosruie apart from the godfrey of boloyne for which no recent auction price can be quoted the previous records for the bools in the above list show a total of only £ but there can be no possible doubt that the amherst copy of the godfrey of bolyne is idntical with the one priced at £ by mir qiuaritch in his  monumierits of the early printers which appeared in instalments between decom ber  and august  this therefore adds another £ to the above quoted total lfost of the  records as will be seen are a quarter of a centuiry old and for copies which may have been much more imperfect than those in the amherst collection but making every due allowance for the lapse of time condition and the enhanced value of these literary trea cures it may be taken that the auctioneers obtained an extremely good price for the amherst caxctonssaturdays salemessrs sotheby coneluded  on saturday the dispersal of the amherst library the days total of £ s bringing the amount realized by the seven days to £ ls which with the £ under stood to have been paid for the caxtons shows a total of £ s in many respects this sale will rank as one of the mostimportant ever held in this countryparticularly in the matter of average per lot at the eonclusion of the sale of the first part of the ashburnham library it was pointed out in these columns that the average per lot was as nearly as pos sible £ and that the previous highest average was that of the syston park eale in  when it worked out at £ s per lot but the sales of the second and third portions of the ashburnham collection greatly reduced the average of that library and the  days dispersal of  lots in producing the grand total of £ brought the average down to less than £ lord amhersts small sale of i lots shows the extraordinary average ofover £ per lotgenerally speaking the hbrary  of  col lectors  books has been a splendid investnieht and a profit of probably over £ has been made on the whole a number of instances of profits have been recorded in  our daily reports and several others occurred again on saturday lor instance the turrecremata questiones super
