the lesson for france andencilandfom oun owx c coiespodrntparis mice a service would be rendered to europe if when the present crisis is past some competent person were to write an authentic history of the negotiations which have occupied the different foreign offices during the last six months m andr tardieus books on the european balance of power and on the aigeciras con ference would thus be most effectively supple mented prince biilows suddeutschereichscorre spondenz announces that  at the invitation of german diplomacy russia has expressed an opinion recognizing the annexation of bosnia and hiersegovina as a fait accomipli and declares herself ready to reply to a auestion from yienna in the same sense this represents a new stage in the elaborate german diplomatic campaign which has been waged with varying success and under different forms since  with the object of separating russia from the western powers in order to facilitate the development of gernman continental and latterly german weltpolitik it is an achieve ment over which the german diplomatists are rubbing their hands precisely as they con gratulated themselves with perhaps inadequate selfrestraint upon the fall of al delcass in there are other parallels between the two achievements germany could not in  have exacted the resignation of m delcass if his position had not been already shaken botlhfrom the personal point of view and owing to the military diplomatic and politica unpreparedness of france for a serious inter national crisis today russia is mutatis mutandi in a like position the russian foreign miinister m isvolsky was no more prepared for the sudden aggressiveness of austria last october than was the french government for the german coup in  when he talked with baron von aehrenthal at buchlau last september he knew in a vague way as m bihourd the thea french am bassador in berlin lmew and reported in  that there was going to be a fresh departure he thought that he would talk the matter over during his impending visits to paris and london and meanwhile he gave pacific assurances and declared in general terms that the eventual anmexation of bosnia and herzo govina by austria would notbe regarded by russia as a caazs belli that is hardly the way to talk to a germanic power backed by germany horself if ultimately any serious opposition to its designs be contemplated perhaps the lesson will now have beea completely learned both in france and also in england where there still lingers in certain quarters a view of germany which confounds the pacifio disposition of large sections of the german people with the entirely independent guiding principles of german foreign policythere are other parallels between the french situation of  and the position of rnissia today in a statement issued last week and intended to enlighten the russiadn nation as to the reasons for m isvolskys atti tude attention is drawn to the fact that  the minister of war for his part pointed out at a ministerial council that the army was about to enter upon a path of reform per fectionnement which a war wvould obstruct fromcdifferent causesthe french army m  was not what it formrerly had been or what it is today the other russian ministers had each their serious objections to offer to any policy which might entail the risk of war the minister of finance declared that  the country was only beginning to reestablish its finances and to recover from the enormous losses which had been caused by the revolution and the war with japan a freslh war would therefore paralyse the efforts and the sacrifices which it had been making in recent years the mvlinister of commerce said that war would entail an irreparable economic crisisthe actiot oi geimaygermany and indeed no one else out of russia required these ministerial statements in order to be assured of the necessarily pacific attitude of the russian government the most pacific moments of other powersarehowever ermany s opportunity under the present regime she does not care to risk enterprises de zon gu haleine her diplomacy seizes any chance regardless of considerations affecting the remoter future in this respect it may be contrasted with the attitude of the present tsar during the south african war when he steadily resisted all solicitations to take advan tage in central asia of the temporary em barrassments of england elsewhere germany as the temps points out did not however identify herself entirely with the policy of austria at the outset she was doubtless engaged in bargaining with vienna for her price and she must at the same time have recog nized that in the position in which russia found herself it would be wise to give that power some rope so that in the end the coup might be more clramatic among the germans them selves there were doubts as to whether their government was playing the part of a faithful ally and a centre deputy comnlained in the reichstag last december that the imperial government had been very late in taking its place by the side of austria and had only done so after a great deal of fumbling prince bilow hifmself bad indeed announced his intention of  supporting austrian interests as far as possible but he at the sacme time somewhat demonstratively congratulated himselfwith what degree of accuracy it is at present imoos sible to sayupon not having been informed any sooner than russia and italy of austrias aggressive intentionsthe tempa by the way continues to main tain in spite of the berlin denials that there has been a frequent correspondence between the emperor wlniam and the archidule francis ferdinand the heir to the austrian crown ever since their meeting at eckartsau on novema ber  in this cornexion it may be worth while to mention that in the opinion of some very competent people there is more comedy than reality ia the ostensible differences between the emperor and his chancellor the necessi ties of the parliamentary situation in germany as well as of foreign affairs may have made it a matter of policy to emphasize the appearance of these differences for as the Â£orhgerman gazette observed on one occasion the hohen zollerns have never hesitated even to submit to apparent humiliations in order to obtain their endsengland and feancthe semiofficial havas agency defines with great preoision the attitude of rance by way of correcting certain fase insinuations it saysduring the whole course of this crisis the govern ment of the republic has ato for one instant ceased to setpport russia the alied power and to be in agreement with england the power which is itf friend today its action at vienna is still ezerecsed in complete agreement with the elnglish governtnentthis assurance was perhaps superfluous as regards the present moment since there can be no doubt that as the echo dc paris the temps and the figaro unite in pointing out france agrees with england that no demand for the recognition of the annexation can be entertained umtil an agreement has been effected with regard to the servian notegermany m in the cssw of russia has taken the initiativ in addressing the austrian demand to fhe powers of the entente cordiale the temps sayswhen on thursday evening prince badolin the geran ambassador in paris came to sound m plchon the french linister for foreign affairs of iles intom ii pichon umued that the dfor the recognition ought to procee from austria hungary and that it would not be acceptable util every risk of an autroservian conflict had been definitely eliminated sir edward grey replied in an exactly similar form to a liko suggestionin the echo do paria m andr mvil states that england and france made replies which were essentiauy identical though slightly different in form  the english thought that they ought to reply with a certain stiff ness while the french point of view is explained in a conciliatory fashion m mdvil is con vinced that if austria were to remain entirely obdulrate baron von aehrenthal would be making himself responsible for the rupture of the negotiationsitn the fgaro m raymond recouly after noting m pichons reply to the german demand adds that the french joreign minister spoke somewhat as followssince there are now only differences which are scarcely appreciabla between the english and the austrian proposals for the servian note let these differences be overcome and let us have done once for all with this imritating question once this has been achieved the austroservian question may be regarded as settled and the greatest indeed the sole risk of war eliminated this is essentially the first thing england and france will make no difti culty about giving their several adhesions to the austroturkish agreementsthe same writer thinks that austiia has per feotly understood the british and french replies since according to theo latest intelligence an agreement is upon the point of being effected between baron von aehrenthal and sir fairfax cartwright for the rest the characteristic attempte of certain german and austrian journals to differentiate between the attitudes of england and france are inspired by motives wshich are quite transparentthe tern traees the history of the fronoh and of the british attitude since the beginig of the crisis last october it would appear that at first al clemenceau and m pichon were inolined to think that the european negotia tions ought to be conduoted bya power wbich was not a party to the dispute but ai flroisky having expressed a desire to conduct the pourparzers both the quai dorsay andthe london foreign office retired into the back ground and left h a perfeotly ffee hand itwas left to him to endeavour to secure at berlin the acceptance of the programme upon which the representatives of the three powers russia france and england had agreed in london the solidarity of the three powers was manifest to the whole world im isvolsky encountered diffioulties in berlin it was impossible to make arrangements for the coni ference and the expedient of direot negotia tions was adopted after the conclusion of the austroturkish negotiations and the pre parations for the turcobulgarian settlement the conflict between austria and servia became acute and necessitated an active exchange of views in this second and more serious stage of the crisis russia was from the out set in a very disadvantageous position she had previously declared that she would not figlht and every oneexcept perhaps a remnnnt of germanophil politicians in englandknows what it means to negotiate with germany or with the ally of germany without being able in case of necessity to cast the sword into the balance again england and france made their policy entirely subsidiary to that of russia and carefully abstained from demanding anything upon which m isvolsky was not prepared to insist on the otlher hand they as scrupulously abstained from advising russia to recognize as she has now done the annexa tion without waiting for the conference russias ally france would have hesitated to advise a course which might have seemed inconsistent with russias original attitudereaiasle paalles ithe tempa might effeetively have compared this situation with the attitude of england in  when france accepted the algeciras conference which england had at first declined and remained with her diplomacy and hqrj armed forces at the disposal of france during tho protracted negotiations in paris between m rvoil and idr rosean the narrative proceeds to the remarkable confession that neither france nor england was consulted by russia before m isvolsky informed the german ambassador count pourtales of his acquiesc ence four days ago they did not hear of it until it had been communicated to germanyhere again remarkable paraleles might be institulted germany insisted that the recent francogerman morocco agreement should be kept secret until its conclusionostensibly on the ground that pangerman opposition was to be apprehended there were probably other reasons which would account for the german demand in the one case as in the other and it may be hoped with some confidence that the calculations on which they were doubtless based wlfl prove as false in the second instance as they have certainly proved in the first the russian government probably the russian peodle certainly will approve of the firm atti tudx wxhich after the german move the british and french governments continue to main tain both powers have still something toc cast into the balance  against german exigencies sthe temps speas of  preparations  for the russian answer as having been made in st petersburg if what i hear be correct there must have been very little time left for  pre parations the preparations as usual were all on the german side as already stated in the first section of my despatch the reports of the russian war dvlinister and his colleagues left m isvolsky hardly any alternative after his first interview with count pourtales he hastily summoned the ministerial council at which the reports i have quoted were made and after an immediate audience of the tsar gave his pacific reply to the german ambassa dors veiled ultimatumtin futuiwthe immediate future is being settled today between baron von aehrenthal and sir fairfax cartwright in vienna the far more momen tous problems of the remoter future will depend as they depended before at and after algeciras upon the patriotism the alertness the deter mination and the reciprocal loyalty of the british frencn and russian governments and peoples
