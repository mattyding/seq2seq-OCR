grma semoffcial tjbmlatonmaxour  rosspondd slblin ac the hope is cherished here that when prince builow addresses the eiohstag tomorrow on foreign affairs he will be able to announce in pretty general terms the success of the policy which after vanious hesitations and ex perimenta geraany has pursued in the near east the writers of semiofficial despatches which now appear every few hours in one or other of the foreign office organs cannot con ceal their jubilation at the success of the st petersburg cwup but they cannot rejoiee aloud until baron von aehrenthal has rounded off his successes after noting that russics recognition of the annexation was distinctly due to caution  from the german side  theorthgerman gazette asserts that there is  really no inner connexion between the recognition of the annexation of bosnia and herzegovina and the quarrel of servia with austriahungary the demand for prompt recognition of the annexation  had only the tactical purpose in view  of proving to servia  the utter hopelessness  of her attempt to ex ploit the socalled bosnian question it wi remain to be seen whether servia will draw the proper inferences from the accomplished clarifi cation of the international situation and meet aright the fresh action which the powers intend to take in beladethe german semi official organ remarks that the negotiations between london and vienna have in their last phase been based npon a draft in which austriahungary informed the british government of the minimum of her proposals as the difference of views between vienna and london has been oonsiderably reduced it may be hoped that a complete agreement which would not fail to secure the consent of the otner powers may be reached germany understands that a britislh communication is awaited in vienna today it is added that according to the pester iloyd if this communication should fail to bring about an agreemelnt austria hungary would give count forgach instructions to take action at belgrade ivithout regard to a  possibie  continuation of the negotiations between the powers because otherwise the powers by prolonging the negotiations could prevent independent action on the part of austriahungaryax attrcx o fowerswhile the northgerman gazeite refrains from discussing russian motives a berlin tele gram to the cologne gazette says that it may now confidently be inferred that r usia attaches importance to the dissipation of all doubts regarding her policy and the invalidation of the charge that her conduct is ambiguous with characteristic disregard of the nature and the value of the present laboure of exngland and of france an attack is made upon the powers which do not hasten to follow russias example it might be supposed that in view of russias attitude  otimer powers could no longer have an interest in hampering and delaying the work of peace by raising more or less formal difficulties italy is expressly shielded from this malicious thrustand it is stated that the negotiations between italy and austria are pursuiing a thoroughly friendly course anid giving rise to no differencesit would indeed appear to be the main object of germany at the present moment to turn her attention aulmost exclusively westward after months of violent abuse of servia the cologne gazette is actually informed from berlin that those who know the country have never believed that the real focus of the situation was in servia and that the decision between war and peace would be taken there only because the servians wrongly as is now made plam reckoned upon active support from abroad did they find the courage to main tain their pretentious attitude as might have been expected germany is wiuing to offer contemptuous congratulations to russia to give a eertiaicate of loyalty to italy and even to be polite to belirade in order to secure the judicial calm which is necessary for a proper estimation of the sins of london and of patis as was also to be expected a veil has been drawn over the authorship and the character of germanys intervention in st petersburg it is not possible seriously to deny that germanys policy was revised a few weeks ago with the result that unconditional support has been given to vienna instead of the support which was so long balanced by consideration especially for france it was because the revision was attributed to the emperor william that the announcements of the temps a few days ago were given ready credence until then the most striking evidence of the change had been the sudden disappearance of the assertions of closest intimacy between berlin and pearis which for some weeks appeared almost every day in the organs of theforeign offlce it is impossible to say how readily and how thoroughly
