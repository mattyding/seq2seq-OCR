high court of jtstioechancery divisionbefore m jusrcs swinsir eadlt monnongh company v obhntsremoval of lefferys almshouses shoreditchthis wa a petition by the ironmongers company as trustees of gefferys almshouses in kingsland road shoreditch praying that an inquiry might be directed whether it would be for the benefit of the said charity that the almshouses and site should be sold and the proceeds or some part thereof together with a sum of about £ now in court applied in the purchase of other land situated in the country but conveniently near london and the erection of new almshouses thereon and if so that a sale might be ordered and a scheme settled for the application of the funds in that anner or as the court might think proper for carrying out the inten tions of the testator the charity was founded by sir robert geffery knight and alderman who by his will dated february   directed that the residue of his real and personal estate should be sold and the proceeds paid to the ironmongers company to the intent that they should with the consent and advice of the executors and of one john midgleypurchase with part thereof a convenient piece of i ground in or near the city of london whereon to bid an almshouse for so many poor people as the moneys received at the rate of £ per annum each person and s apiece yearly for gowns might amount to and should lay out the surplus in the purchase of houses lands and groundrents in fee simple in or near the city of london to be settled for the erecting of the said almshouses and the maintenance of the poor people to be harboured therein for ever and for reparation as occasion should requirethe present suit was commenced in  against sir gabrid roberts and the other executors john midgley and the then attorneygeneral sir simon harcourt praying accounts of the estate and to have the charitable trusts established and by a decree in  it was ordered that the plaintiffs should be at liberty to propose to the mtaster a con venient site in or within ten miles of the city and that the master should approve the price to bo paid and the residue should be laid out as directed and the parties were to resort back to the court for directions on various points from time to time the renlts and income being in the first place to be applied towards the building of the almshouses accordingly the site in kingslandroad was purchased in  for £ and the present almalsouses for about  persons and their families with a chapel and residence or a mistercrected a further piece of land making an aggregate of about f acres being bought for a burial ground in  various applications and orders were made in the cause from time to time the last being in the year the petition set forth grounds on which it was now considered that remnoval of the almshouses was desirable the buildings erected nearly  years ago were without foundations or damp courses the result being that not only have the walls com menced to bulge but the dwellings are rendered damp they are of one storey only and consequently cover an unusually large area with a proportionately great expanse of walls and roof unduly increasing she cztof repair they contain moreover only one room for each inmate with a basement for washing and sanitary requirements and the foregoing defects are such gs cannot be remedied by alteration the neighbourhood too is unsuitable originally p laced among fields the houses are now in the midst of noisy dirty and squalid surrondings vwith tram ways mater omnibuses and a railway in immediate proximity while the inmates who are elderly and often tinid persons are deprived of the quiet necessary to the enjoyment of their homes and garden and are afraid to venture into the a jacent streets where they have been attacked by roughs and even robbed in  the charity commis sioners who had held an inquiry asto the charity wrote to the petitioners suggesting on grounds of economy a sale and the erection of new buildings or the substitution of pensions but the petitioners who had recently made a considerable outlay on repairs did not for various reasons feel able to concur until  when they wrote reopening the subject and asking for the sanction of the charity com missioners to a sale in reply the commissioners pointed out that the proposal involved alterations in the existin conditions so great as to make a schemee for future aaministration of the charity necessary but intimated that it a scheme were applied for they were prepared to entertain favourably a proposal for sale at an adequate priee tenders issued by the petitioners having failed to elicit any offer the latter opened negotiations with the peabody trustees which resulted in a provisional contract of sale for £ conditionally on the sanction of the commissioners being obtalned on or before january   by this timo however the views of the commissioners appeared to have changed and at an interview held with the petitioners it was intimated that the com missioners were strongly against granting their sanc tion to tho sale it appeared that they were inilu enced by the expression of public opinion adverse to the demolition of ancient buildings and especially by a memorial relating to this site and presented to them on behalf of the society for the protection of ancient buildings the metropolitan gardens associa tion and the national trust for places of historic interest which was published in the times for november   to a formal application for confirmation of the said provisional contract the comissioners replied that an inquiry would be held on the subject and such inquiry accordingly took p lace in january  the three societims named bei represented thereat by counsel and the town cerk of shoreditch appearing on behalf of that borough the result was a formal refusal of the sanction asked and the commissioners while admitting that the existing site had some disadvan tages intimated that in exercising their discretion they were not precluded from taking into considera tion the question of public policy which had been indicated by parliament in regard to the desirability of retaining open space i the metropolis and preserving ancient cbuildgs they subsequently refused to sanction an application to the court under section  of the charitable trust act  and the attorneygeneral on being applied to declined to take proceedings ex ovlciosm r frsiay x who with xr micklem kc and mr a adams appeared for the petitioners said that it was proper to make application first to the charity comrmissioners and the act also provided for the attorneygeneral taking action but failing these it was possible under section  to apply direct to the court in any pending proceeding and the petition was accordingly presented in the old chancery suit commenced in  this suit was still pending for the original decree directed the parties to  resort back to the court for directions from time to time and such resort had been had down to the year  sir gieorge jessel mr in  in re clagetts estate  chd at p  had laid it down as a test that a cause was pending when any proceeding could be taken in it adding that the word did not mean that the cause had not been tried and had referred to its use in this large sense in section  of the judicature act the attoamregrxeral sir w robson rc with whom was mr c h sargant said that ithe court was of opinion that this suit was pending he would not resist an inquirysipm r fanlkay said he would like to bring out the point that the charity commissioners had been actuated by considerations such as the preservation of open spaces which were not properly within the scope of the inquiry they had held mir justice chitty in his judgment in the case of emanuel hospital westtmibster reported in the tlimes for july   had said that these were objects no doubt laudable in themselves but that ali such topics had little or no relevancy in the question under consideration and persons entertaining such opinions could not ask that they should be enforced at the expense or to the etriment of the property of others counsel was proceeding to read the petition whenthe

to named institution or to charitabicworkthis was a summons by executors asking whethez the trusts of  certain legacy had failed and if uot to whom the income thereof ought to be paidthe testator george wilson of felton in the conntof northumberland directed his trustees to pay ox retain to themselves the sum of £ upon trutto inrest the same nd pay the net anznul lncomtto the tsurer or

charitable work for which the said nurse fund has been instituted from any cause ceaso to be carried on for the space of two years the said sum and income should fall into his residuary estate the testator had been a subscriber for manny years to a fund bearing the name mentioned which was an institution having its headquarters at felton where it originated being at first inown as the felton nurse fund and deriving thence the greater part of its resources one day in the week only of the nurses time being devoted to work in framlington this latter village ceased some months before the diate of the testatort will to be connected with the fund and started one of its own while the village of felton carried on its own work ia its own name associating with itself other small villages in the vicinity theo questions for decision were there fore whether the bequest had lapsed as being given to a named institution no longer in existence at the time as in cglark v taylor   drew  and in

there was the fgher question whether felton as being the seat of the defunct institution or felton and framlington as being both the scene of the work should receive the benefit and if so in what pro portionsmr g w eing appeared for the executors mir dwanel jones for the treasurers of the felton nurse fund mr p f stokes for those of the framling ton nurso efund and mir charles garnett for residuary legateesmet jtustie swnxmr eadr said the question was whether this was a gift to a particular charitable institution which ceased to exist before the testatoers death or whether he had not shown a charitable intention indicating particular charitable work and merely mentioning the fund which he called the feltoncumframlbigton district nurse fund as the channel for carrying out his charitable intention there was the further question whether in fact the articular body had ceased to exist when one co sdered the provisions of the will it was he thought quite clear that it was the charitablo inten tion that formued the motivethe wish that the legacy should be devoted to a particular charitable workand that the hand to administer it was a minor consideration it was the charitable work that he desired to be carried out he had em powered his trustees during the continuance of this particular trust to increase the number of the trustees and there was the provision that should the vork cease to be carried on the legacy should fall into residue in his lordships opinion the construction of the will as evincing a general charitable intention and not merely an intention to give a fund to a par ticular charitable institution was fee from all doubt then there was the question whether the feltoncum framlington fund had ceed to exist and he thought it had not but had been divided into two felton now associating with itself other places and franling ton doing the same but each havng a nurse fund thus instead of the work ceasing to be carried on it was extended the matter was too small to justify the expense of a scheme and the proper way would be to give fourfifths to felton and onefifth to fram lington those being roughly the proportions of popu lation he therefore determined the question in that way and ordered the sums to be paid to the respective treasurers for the time beingbefore mi justice evekilucic v oiraadispute between medical menthis was an action for dissolution of partnership it appeared that by deed of january s  it was agreed that the plaintiff the defendant and dr ussher should enter into partnership to continue dluring their lives as physicians surgeons and apothecaries in williton and watchet in the county of somerset and it was provided that each of them should employ himself diligently in the practice of the partnership and give his whole time thereto and use his utmo endeavours to promote tho interests thereof it was also provided that proper books of account should be kept by each partner which should be open to inspection by the other partners it was also provided that if either partner should fall to account or take his part in the management of the practice or should be guilty of conduct calculated seriously to affect the practice then the other partners might by notice expel him from the partnership on january   dr ussher retired from the partnership the plaintiff alleged that the defendanthad negleted the business of the partnership and had been guilty of conduct calculated seriously to affect the practice and in particular that he was in the habit of frequenting publichouses the plaintiff also alleged that the defendant had neglected to keep proper accounts or to give the plaintiff access thereto that it was no longer reasonably possible for thelaintiff to carry on business in partnership with the defendant and that the partnership ought to be dissolved the defendant denied the above allega tions and counterclaimed for an account of his share of profits there is a libel action pending by the defendant against the plaintifffr p  lawrence kc and mr mildyard appeared for the plaintiff and mr stewart smith ec and nr r e ioore for the defendantmrn justice eve in the course of delivering judgment yesterday said thathavingseen the plaintiff and the defendant in the witnessbox both of whom gave their evidehce with great modern tion and selfrestraint he was surprised that the matter had come into court but the parties had elected to have their rights decided by the court and it was for the court therefore to consider how far it was bound to grant relief to the plaintiff the plaintiles grounds for relief were several one was that the defendant neglected the business of the partner ship and that allegation was based upon the fact that he occasionally went out shooting for a day or part of a day and played cricket in watchet and thc neighbourhood it was said that the indulgence in pastireb of that nature tended to the neglect of business but in his lordships opinion conduct of that sort so far from being calculated to injure the business was calculated to enlarge the practice rural sports were not prejudicial and would not lead people to say that the man who indulged in them in moderation was an idle man then it was said that he had been away shooting rabbits but there was nothing in that indeed in the west of england any one who shot rabbits was regarded as a public benefactor then it was said that in  he was absent  or  days without making proper arrangements for carrving on his practice on the evidence however eo did inform dr ussher that he was going away and what patients he vished dr ussher to visit during his absence the allegations of neglect therefore were dis proved then there was the allegation that the defend ant had been guilty of conduct calculated seriously to prejudice the practice and that in particular he had been in the habit of frequenting publichouses on thc evidence it was clear that that allegation was founded on no substantial basis and had failed altogether ahd it was to be regretted that it had ever been made there were besides some minor matters of camplaint which however vould not justify the court in granting the relief for which the plaintiff asked tne net result was that no one of the allega tions talen by itself was a sufflcient ground for order ing a dissolution but it was said that taken together they rendered the continuance of the partnership impossible his lordship did not tikso separately they were minute and together they did not justify dissolution the action would therefore be dismissed wvith costs
