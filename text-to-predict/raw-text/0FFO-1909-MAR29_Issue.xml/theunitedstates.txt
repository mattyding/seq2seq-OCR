opposition is developing to the pro posed prohibitory increases in the rates on hosierv and wvomens leather gloves messrs marshall field and co of chicago have issued a protest against these duities

broidered gloves manifestly the rates are prohibitie and re intended to be so the ncrease in the rates for hosierv is also intended to excludo all foreign goods it is not suprising that the large american department stores aro declaring that this is not the honest revision promisedwhile section  of the payne bill does not apply additional duties in cases where the pre ferential dities to other countries are those which are gilven by a province dependency or colony to the mother country only it does apply such duties to imports comning from countries that give their colonies or dependencies preferential advantages over goods from the united states this i am informned will be chanyed so as to permit the mother country to giveher colonies the benefit of the minimum rates without sub jecting herself to retaliatory action on the part of the united states should the section be so amended it would encourage preferential trade between the mother country and her dependenciesmlit brlrouis posiroxthe tribune in a leading article yesterday on mr balfours address to the tariff reform leas gue says that it commits him  for the first timex in the most explicit and detailed manner to th e principles of tariff reform it places mr bilfouir squarely by the side of mr cham berlain as an opponent of cobdenism and an advicate of a rational protective tariff systemthe distussion here of the important question of discrimaination as an essential feature of the payne tariff adds a special interest to mr balfours ipeech and his  remorseless con viction  ot his ovponents of inconsistency and lack of accord on the question of com mercial retaliation is regarded as unanswerable i have repeatedly said in these despatches that it is a phase of the fiscal question which will give the free trade party in the inited kingdom the most trouble in the next cam paign ir balfour has shown wisdom in bringing it to the fronton this point even the trnntnc is impelled to sayfor the united kingdom to stand up alone before the world and leb all the other countries impose all sorts of taxes and penalties upon its commerce and do nothing and be able to do nothing in return may be magnificent from a cobdenite point of view but to the average englishman it does not seem to be  good business that is the attitude which to judge from the current drift of political sentiment it will not be easy to justify in the sight of the british nationcommenting on the effect of the payne biu in canada the emening post suggests that the two conditional offersmrinnum schedules and reciprocity in coalare likelv to cause the laurier government much embarrassment the post saysunder the psyne tarif if the canadian inter mediate tariff is conceded to either france or germrny the same concession must be made to the united states or the mnaximum rates of the payne bill will go into operation against imports from canadain the offer of reciprocity in coal the laurier government will have to decide between the canadian mianufacturers association and the coal operators of cape breton and the general body of caxnsumers in the dominion who presumably want free coal the evening post thinks that canadian protection interests will be strong enough to ignore the offer of washingtonelectoral reaorasmr hughes opened the direet nominations campaign last night at buffalo his method of going direct to the people has met with the bitter disapproval of opponents wrho appear to view such aetion as a violation of some fundamental rule of politics last night he did as he has done beforehaving made his recommendations he availed himself of the occasion to set forth reasons why he made them his speech was a candid explanation of the bill couched in clear and incisive english and it was marked by the convincing reason which is habitual with himmtr hughes found it necessary to say in proposing direct nominations that they were not seeking to confer a privilege but to provide for the exercise of a right there were those who were determined that this right should not be easily exercised not because they want the party to rule but because they want to rule the party under a pseudorepresen tative convention system experience showed that in the main parties were delivered into the hands of a few who made it their business to control the delegates and dictate the nomina tions for his belief in direct nominations he gave cogent reasons party voters con stituted the party and were entitled to select its candidates they made much more difficult the selfish control of party machinery the sentiment of party was better expressed and not left to be interpreted by those who would ignore it so far as they dared in order to achieve their own personal ends the candidate would owe his nomination directly to the voters and would have a corresponding responsibility and would enjoy a corresponding independence elected officers would have the opportunity of appealing directly to their constituents and would not be forced as too frequently was the case to act contrary to their conscience in order to save their political future finally direct nominations would block somo of the avenues by which special interests find their way to administrative favour and government controlthese are selfevident arguments to the english mind that mr hughes should have needed to emphasize them in this way illustrates how far removed from real representation the voters of this and other states are under the convention system in several western states direct nominations have been adopted and there is no disposition to revert to the old system the direct primary law of massachusetts according to its author mr robert luce has improved conditions and has led to cleaner politics at albany the opponents of mr hughes have virtually admitted that there is a public demand for this reform by introducing a rival bill but it is described as a feeble and imperfect substitute for the real thingmir hughes may not succeed in getting his mesure through the present hostile legis lature but that after preliminary failure it wili eventually pass the next legislature

having discovered a process by which wood pulp and paper products will be made much more plentiful and cheaper it states that his discovery males possible the manufacture of paper from firtree eswdust

results of his experiment with one cord of fir wood the wood cost him  and from it be obtained wood pulp worth  turpentine worth  and byproducts of less value the waste now burned or thrown away could be used as well as freshcut wood it is said the discovery means that every cord of fir timber will yield  on byproducts alone and that most of the  per cent of a tree now wasted will be
