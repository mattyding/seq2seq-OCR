 the adren act the children act  wvhich will come into force on april  has aptly been described as the childrens charter it is to the oredit of parliament that all parties in bothhouses should have recognized the importance of this class of legislation by treating the bill as one of a noncontroversial character it is true that the clauses relating to cigarette smoling evoked a certain degree of opposition and not a little ridicule although in the end they were alloweed to pass apart from these however the valuable provisions contained in the measure were the subject of general agreement how wide those provisions are may be gathered from the fact that the act repeals wholly  other measures dealing with children and over rides in a greater or less degree the provisions of  othersthe act is divided into six parts which are concerned with the following main subjects infant life protection the prevention of cruelty to children andyoung persons juvenile smoking reformatory and industrial sclools   juvenile offenders iscellaneous and generalfnqvat l protrooothe campaign against the evils of baby farmino  received valuable aid from the infant lifo protection act  thero was however one weak point in that measure and the new act supplies the remedy it provides in effect that every single infant placed out to nurse for fee or reward shall be subject to inspection the act of  dealt with foster parents who received  more than one infant  under the age of five years the important words in the new aet are  one or more infants and the age limit is raised to seven yearsaft er april

the performance of their dutiespreveniion of cruelty to cdbenthe second part of the act is designed to strengthen the law in punishing cruelty to chil dren it is aimed at  any person oveyr the age of  years who has the custody charge or care  of a child or young person if such a custodian shall personally or by an agent assault ill treat neglect abandon or expose a child in such a manner as to be likely to cause suffering or injury to health he or she will be liable on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding £ or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years and to smaller penalties on summary conviction further if it shall be proved that a person so convicted is financially interested in the childs death the fine may be increased to £ and the term of imprisonment to five years penal servitudeif a child under three years of age is suffocated by  overlaying and the person who causes the death was at the time of going to bed under the influence of drink he or she will be liable to punishment for neglect if a child under seven years of age is left in a room containing n open firegrate not sufficiently protected and is burned or scalded in consequence the custodian vill be liable to a fine not exceeding £ the act makes it an offence punishable with fine or imprisonment to cause or permit a child or young person to beg or receive alms in the street or to allow a child between the ages of four and  to reside in or frequent a brothel or to cause or encourage the seduction or prostitution of a girl under  years of agespecial power is given to the court to order the detention in a retreat of any habitual drumkard who is convicted of cruelty to a child and to order the removal of a child from the care of a drunken or dissolute parent or guardian it is to be noted also that in future any institu tion for the reception of poor children or young persons which is supported wholly or partly by voluntary contributions may be visited and inspected from time to time by persons ap pointed for the purpose by the home secretary where any institution is carried on in accord ance with the principles of a particular religious denomination the visitor will be a person of that denomination if the managers so desirejuventim smoxingthe powers contained in the act for the sup pression of juvenile smoking important though they are have attracted a disproportionate degree of public attention the idea that a policeman should have  authority to confiscate the cigarette of the small boy in the street has appealed no doubt to the sense of humotlr of the grownup person part  of the act however is the smallest of any of  the six divisions and the simplest in its application after the end of the present month tobaccohists must be carefulnot to sell to any person  appa rently under the age of  years  any cigarettes or cigarette papers whether for the young per son own use or not the penalty for such a sale may be £ for a first offence £ for a second and £ for a third for the purposes of the act cigarette includes  cut tobaeco rolled up iin paper tobacco leaf or other material in such form as to be capable of immediate ullse for smoldng this part of the act also applies to tobacco otherthan cigarettes with this difference that ashopkeeper will not be guilty of an offence for selling tobacco as distinct from cigarettes to a person under the age of  years e he did not know and had no reason to believe that it was for the use of that persontnitqwil be the duty of every constable and parkkeeper when in uniform to seize and con fiscate the cigarettes cigarette papers or apparently tobacco of anybody under the age mentioned whom he may find in the act of sfmoking he may search a boy thuscaught in the act but not a girl the difficulty of the automatic machine has been sturmounted in an ingenious manner it would have been unfair to the tobacconist to allow the small boy to replenish his store at the expense of  a penny in the slot it would have been a hardship on the other hand to suppress all automatcmachines because small boys with a fondness for tobacco occasionally find themselves in posses sion of spare pennies so it is provided that if on complaint to a courtof summary jurisdiction it is prbved that any atutpmatio machine qft the sale of cigarettesis being  extensively ed by children or young persons  the court may order those responsible either to take preautionsa abate the evil  or to remove the machidie aitozether the wner or custodianof the machine is given a right of appeal to quarter sessionsthe provisions of the act with regard to cigarettes and tobacco do not apply however to young persons employed by a manufacturer of or dealer in tobacco or to bby messengers in uniform employed by a messenger

habits are unfit to have the care of the child or if ste is the daughter of a father who has been con victed of certain offences under the criminal law amendment act  or if he or she frequents the company of any reputed thief or common or reputed prostitute or is lving in a house of illfame in all these cases the child may be brought before the court by any pinson in order that the provisions of the act may be set in forceparents who are unable to control their children may themselves take advantage of the act and in these cases the court may place the children under the supervision of a probation officer instead of sending them to an industrial school in all dases of children who are liable to be consigned to an industrial school there is given to the courts the alternative power of committing them to the care of relatives or other fit persons with or without the super vision of the probation officerjuvr e ofyendn rsafter the act has come into operation it will be impossible for
