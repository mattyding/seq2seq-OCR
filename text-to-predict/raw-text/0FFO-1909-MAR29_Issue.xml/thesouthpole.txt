the sotjr polelieutenant shaciletonsexpeditionfzom our colminspollpentweillington nz lcc through the courtesy of professor david i am enabled to give details of the principal scientifc results of the shackletou expeditionthe biological results are extremely interest ing the frozen glaciereroded lakes near cape royds abounded in diatoms rotifers water bears and infusoria numbers of rotifera which were examined microscopically had been frozen into the ice at termperatures below zero for three years yet after a few minutes thawing out they suddenly revived and began eagerly devouring the fungus which abounds in these lakes in some cases only the body not the head of the rotifer appeared to come to life several rotifers were similar to those already described by xurray as having been found at spitzbergen and franz josef land the water bears came to life in the same manneron the black lava rooks of mount erebus which liad absorbed the suns heat the snow melted at temperatures below zero and at a height of ft this explains how lichens and similar plant life are enabled to flourish in the antarctic regionsthe marine fauna near cape royds bear a resemblance to the types of animal life of tbe coal measure series found in australia and tasmania specimens will be examined by scientific specialists in new zealand nd aus tralia the results will be eagerly awaited by the scientific worldthe northern expedition found mnasses of marine muds ft above the sea level these coltained vast numbers of foraminiferal shells the biloculina type whichl form the biloetilina ooze of the arctic circle are specially abundantthe geological discovran sthe geological discoveries disprove thei antarctic archipelago theory and  show that the continental plateau extends from the newly discovered mountains  miles west of cape royds and the mlagnetic poe tq beyond tche south pole itself probably over  miles by far the most interesting geological discovery is that of coal measures in latitude  these measures ft thick contain seams of coal lft to ft thick the microscopic examina tion of the mineral charcoal wlieh has been secured may indicate its geological age rounded quartz pebbles and the great thickness of the sandstone formation implv the action of running water prolonged through many ages the limestone discovered at the farthest south interstratified with a remarkable rock of pinkish grey branded with dark green unlike any that professor david has ever seen may prove important under microscopie examination tlhe ancient rocks examined apparently contain nonazitenear moimt larsen an interesting deep green mineral wag found wbhich is almost cer tainly a compound of vanadium mount erebus like stromboli proved a good baro meter the steam column ascending and eruptions occurring with a low barometer at periods the active crater contained molten lav a the old crater was filled almost to the brim with layers of snow there are millioxns of felspar crystals in to in long and pumice lava is of a rare kenite type fossil radiolaria were found in erraties of banded chert near cape royds lieutenant shackleton is sending specimens of all these rocks to the britisl museum tho exact location of the mlagnetic pole was fixed by elaborate tri angulation by mr mawson extending over  miles from mount erebus to mount mel bourne it proved that the magnetic pole is no longer moving eastward as in rosss time but is now travelling northwestward in inuch the same diirection as the north magnetic pole this is specially interesting as an indi cation of the direction of magnetic variation in the immedate future in the southern oeninnhrtee activity of mount erebusanch in a further interview with professor david i learned that the summit crater of tlount erebus was very active as regards steam and sulphur gases no molten lava was seen but during a big eruption in june and until sep tember the steam column was glowing like a huge beacon fire indicating that there was mwolten lava in the crater recently ejected bombs  were found lying on the new siiow large quantities of sulphur being formed in the craterthe coal measures discovered far south are probably older than the tertiary period indeed judging from the induration of the rock they apparently date back to palaeozoic times no fossils to settle the point have been found but a microscopic examination of the specimens may solve the problem the presence of coal measures does not necessarily indicate a change in the position of the pole the vegetation may have been the result of a variation of the suns heat such as was proved by recent american investigationsprofessor david gave me a graphic descrip tion of lieutenant shackletons return he was long overdue and it was feared that he had met with an accident the nimrod went in search of him the captain discovered two dots on a barrier in the distance and then he saw a heliograph flashing the dots developed into lieutenant shacldeton and wvild where were marshall and adams  a boat put off and the explorers were taken aiboard their shrunk shanks and lean faces told a tale of severe work and privation yet after eating a lordly dish of fried bread and bacon lieutenant shackleton though he had had no sleep for  hours immediately started back over  weary miles with the relief party to marshall who was ill with dysentery brought on by the diet of horseflesh and had been left in charge of adams it took a day and a half to reach them then all returned to the ship exhausted but happy in the successful termination of the great enterprise lieutenant shackleton had performed the remarkable feat of sledging  miles with little sleep in three days at the end of a journey of  milessome scientific eustiltsthe adiit ion al inform ation received con cerning lieutenant shackletops antarotic ex pediition since our article of last wednesday which was based on a comparatively short telegram nmare than covrs the impresqion that here we have to deal with one of the most remarkable and successful achievements in the history of polar exploration that was evident from the long telegraphic despatch which we printed on thursday and if fugther confirma tion were ncessary that this expeditiox ivas not a mere dash at the pole it is furnished by the condensed account of some of the scientific rents which we are able to publish today through the courtesy of professor david the able geologist of the expedition tha impres sion of admiration produced by lieutenant shaciletons expedition has been worldwide and it is pleasant to notice that no one has been more cordial than his former leader ctptain r f scott the king is reported to have stated that it is the most remarkable expedition of his reign and the autograph tele graui which he sent to lieutenant shackleton is jigniert o£ his etimate of its importance naturialy the royal geogxaphlical society lost no time in sending it frmrstv cqngratuleaons through its president t but perhpps more signifieant than anything else o the wunually exeptod eharactee of this expedition is the fpt t tbhtathecouneil s a ryl soclatir attheir meeting iet wee dlecided to send lieu tenant shackleton a telegram of congratulation the message which we publish today from professor david will convince the royal society that the scientific results are more than likely to justify this unusual step on the part of thlat bodythe more we read of the methods and arrange ments of the expedition the stronger must be the conviction that success was largely due to the knowledge the foresight and the exceptional power of organization of the commander nearly every detail of equipment of provisions of arrangements for the trying conditions to be encountered of the field of exploration to be covered and of the scientific work to be accom plished had evidently been carefully and clearly thought out beforehanid lieutenant shackleton was also most fortunate in the staff of men whom he had selected to cooperate with him they are evidently ar men of keen ness of loyalty and intelligence working so far as the record goes in unison to carry out the plans of their leader they all had to endure trials and sufferings in many cases extreme but thanls no doubt to their splendid constitutions thev ajppear all to heae come out scatheless and it is evident that the leader is generous enough to give every man credit for what he has donethe fuller details wliich are now available enable us to correct one or two misconceptions due to the brevity of the telegram with which we had to deal on wednesday mention is there made of a northwesterly sledge journey lasting  days and covering a distance of  statute miles as a matter of fact this seerps a cormbination of the two expeditions one of which proceeded westward to the south magnetic pole and the other northward to explore the coast region of victoia land neither of these evidently got so far to the northwest as to sight the coast to the west of cape nortb which lies about vo s and  e ontheotherhand wvearenow informed that on the return journey in the beginning of the present month when in   s and   e lieutenant shackleton discovered a range of coast mbuntains trending south west and west  miles beyond cape north and rising to an altitude of some oooft to ft the outline of this motntainous coast line which is apparently part of a deeply eroded plateau was sketched by mr mawson with regard to the magnetic pole that has been located by mr mawtson with a lloydcreak dipcirole asin the vicinity of °   and in long  e as will be seen from professor davids cotmmuniction the south like the north magnetic pole is on the movetgf scierrc observationsit is evidont from the communication which ve publish today from professor david that materials and obeervations have been collected which will furnish specialists with problems of the highest scientific interest mr hodgson on the discovery expedition found in the shore waters a plentiful animal life which threw con siderable light on questions of oceanic distribu tioii it is evident that this has been greatly added to by the labours of the biologist of the pxesent expedition still more interesting perhaps is the strange diminutive life found to exist m the freshwater lakes on the land near cape royds here we are told that certain types of life can be frozen up in ice for three years and yet when thawed out are as lively and active and veracious as evera curious instance of the adaptability of living things to exceptional conditions that in past ages the climate of the antarctic may have been very different from what it is nowv may be proved when the specimens of roolks brought back by the furthest south party are worked out taken in connexion with the fact that the rounded quartz pebbles found and the great thickness of sandstone formation imply thle action of rmnning water prolonged through many agesaltogether professor davids geological report will be looked forward to with the greatest interest at headquarters meteorological observations were carried on from the very beginning and similar observations were talen apparently on all the expedi tions the constant blizzards and storms which lieutenant shackletons party en countered on thoir way south and back lead him to the conclusion that the belt of calms which was supposed to exist over the south polar continent either does not exist at all or is of very limited extent however wve must await the careful working out of all the meteorological and magnotic observations by specialists beforc we can draw any definite concltisions as to the resultsplentiful observations have been made on the ice conditionsboth in the neighbourhood of head quarters and during the progress of the various expeditions the conclusions come to in this respect by the discovery expedition that the ice is receding asn that there are evidlences of a much more extensive glaciation in the past are confirmed by the observations made during tho present expeditionthe very full details whvicll are given in lieu tenant shackletons long telegram with regard to the expeclition towards the south pole carried out by himself and messrs adams alakshall and wild increase our admiration of the pluck and deterpination with which vhat msay be regarded as one of the chief objects of the expedition was carried to a conclusion that may be regarded as practically silccess ful a mere dash at the pole is not in itself a very high aim but we must draw a distinction in this respect between the north and the south poles we may be assured that there is little mole to be known than we know at present by the attainment of the north pole which in all probability is situated in the ocean depths what we want there more than any thinp else and what it is hoped captain amund sen wiul achieve on his forthcoming expedition is as many soundings as can be oarried out all over the ltorth polar area in order to discover whether the deep ocean wlhich nansen found to the north of franz josef land exists over the whole area it is different with the south pole here we have to deal wvith the central region of what it may now be presumed is a continental area of land it is of real interest to know the coniguration of this land not only along the coast but in the interior and to ascertain as much as is practicable con cerning its geological structure thatwith the mapping achieved by lieutenant shackletons party with the numerous photo graphs that wvere taken and tho geological specimens that have been brought back we ought to have a fair conception of a land on which only fowr men have ever set their eyes it is possible thwatt if those four stupid ponies had not met their death by eating sand the party might have beenasble to tccomplish thehundred mies or so which separated their furthest point from the actual position of the south pole but that is a small mattertikn posivoxn of the souvn pomlieutenant shackleton has essentially solved the problem of the position of the south polo he may be aid indeed to have been actuallv within sight of it on a dreary plateau some looft above sea level he has been as successful in solving the problem of the south pole as nvnsen was in solving that of the character of thie ocean which surrounds the noxtlh ple lieutenant shackletons expediction was fortunate in the auroral phenomnena which it witnessed it has often been said that the antarctic aurora are not to be com pared in brilliance with those of the region in the north this can hardly be any longer maintained after the systematic records of aurora displays mado by mr mawson no doubt ample pieforial records have been made of these displays withnotes of the magnotic phenomena accompanying them which muat form an important addi tion to onr knowledge of a very puzzling and very attractivo departent of scientific re search gret eredit ia due to the determined porseveranca of the party which ascended mount erebus and brought back specimens of the materials found in and aroiimd its vast crterthe experienea wlhich the expedition had with the use of the motorsiectge and metorcar must be of great service to futtire expedi tions which may make use of this means of transport they were evidently of no use in making way across the surface of the ice barrier it was a happy inspiration of the leader of the expeditior to take a supply of the hardy siberianponies withhim there isno doubti that they have been of immense service and it is extremely doubtful whether without their assistance the expedition could have got nearly so far as it did it was a remarkable achievement that without such aid captain scott dr wilson and ieutenant shackleton should have succeeded in getting as far as the foothills of the great mountain system which lieutenant shackleton succeeded in penetratingthe omwasa glance at the map of captain scotts expedition will show that just beyonld his furthest point the mountains began and that on ° s he saw clearly further mousi tains which lie named after sir clements markham and mr longstaff in their exhausted condition without the powerful help which was available for lieutenant shackletons party it would have been mad ness to attempt to scale those mountains as has already been stated lieutenant shackle tons experience oa the discovery expedition has been of the greatest service to him it must be rememberedl that that expedition knew nothing of the great ice plain extending beyond the barrier they knew onily of the lofty ice wall discovered by sir james ross and had to spend much of their energy and their time in solving the problem of the vast ico plain of which it was only the outer facethe rapidity with which a high south latitude has been attained is remarkable when it is remembered that in the north polar area it was only after generations that ° w was reached and that it took something like a quarter of a century to cover another three degrees in  borohgrevink reached about ° s only about  miles further south than ross did in  two years aftor borch grevinl captain scott in one journey reached over  beyond borchgrevink in °  g seven years after scott shlackleton in about two months and a half ha done another six degrees reaching to within about  statute miles of the pole this of course is to some extent due to the fact that it was possible to place depts on the ice plain and on the land a thing which it woutcl be extremely difficult to do on the shifting ice of the north polar areathus it will be seen that lieutenant shackle ton has been able to carry out the essential features of the programme which he laid down for himself in plannixg his expedition ie has made a sohld advance into that portion of the south polar continent which lies to the south of new zealand for as has been stated there seems every likelihood that the land is continuous and is not broken up into islands by the intrusion of the sea a glance at the map however will show that in other directions we know nothing beyond thhe coast line if expeditions similar to that of captain scott and lieutenant shacldeton would pene trate into the iaterior of the three other quadrants of this desolate land and if means were taken to lay down as far as practicable its continuous coast line it mnight be left undis turbed through the rest of the ageslieutenant shackleton is expected to arrive in lsngland about june  he has accepted an invitation to lecture before the royal geo graphical society as soon after iis
