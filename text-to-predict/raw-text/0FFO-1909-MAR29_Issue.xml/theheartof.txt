the heart of hindustanpolitics in tiee united provincesfromi oui specia cqobesponnntmleerut mnch to pass from the contentious atmosphere of the two bengals to the comparative placidity of the united provinces of agra and oudh is like entering harbour after a stormy voyage these fertile populous provinces are the heart of hindustan and teem with historical associa tions calcutta and madras and bombay all cities created by the british sway the political life of india today but agra and lucknow and benares cities that were old and famous long before job chamock settled dowa amid the swamps of the hughli still embody for englishmen and indians alike the traditions and the memories of the true hindustan one does not move very far in the united provinces without discovering that they are by no means free from sinister symptoms but it is an unquestionable fact that there is less unrest throughout the vast territory govemed with so much firmness and ability by sir john hewett than in any other part of india oudh in particular migrht almost be described as probritish and there are very few parts of india of which so much can now be said the reasons for this comparative immuinity from political strife are not altogether clear the big cities of the united provinces contain masses of men who are more liable to fierce excitement more ready to indulge in turbulence when once aroused than any other classes in the country they are capable of a good deal more than flabby talk again the province has passed through a severe period of adversity in the last year or two it is only just emerging from the stress of a severe famine plague has takien a heavy tou of the people a peculiarly virulent epidemie of fever carried off over  persons in the agra district alone in the last three months of last year with a coincident heavry mortality elsewhere such visitations almost invariably tend to create vague unrest but they seem to have been horne with calm fortitude by the bulk of the peoplelessoms o rn klywrhy is it that these provinces which were the very centre of the tragic episodes of the mutiny are least affected by the political turmoil which has latterly disturbed so many parts of india  i should say after some inquiry among those better competent to judge than i am that one strong prleisposing cause in favour of quiescence is the vivid recollection of the stern reprisals wvhich followed the miutiny itself the greybeards have seen with tbeir own eyes the younlger men have heard from their fathers end grandfathers something of the terrors of civil war they do not forget the grim and lasting lesson of the strength of the british in the hour of trial te battered walls of the lucknow residency perhaps the rost touching monument of british endurance us the whole empire are ever before them as a reminder and a warning the old church in this great peaceful cantonmnent of meerut still standing as it did on the niglht of that first wild savage outburst bears abiding testimony to the permanence of british rule the lesson of the miutiny mnay have been evanescent elsewhere bht it has not faded from memory in the united provinces again these pro vinces have up till now beenx less susceptible to the wiles of the politieal agitator than bombay and bengal and the punjab interest in political questiona is languid except among a limited number of people in a few cities ii contributory cause in ihe case of oudh is that the pursuits of the population arc almost exclusively agricultural twothirds of its  inhabitants live in villages with a nonulation of less than q and thera ae onfive tows including lucknnw which have a population of over  but the loyalty of ouddh is due in a far larger measure to the dominating influence of the oudh talukdars these holders of great estates wlo were con firmed in their possessions when theo last king of oudh vwas removed to end his ignoble eareer in the suburbs of calcutta are amply awre of tho benefits they have derived from british control under their later kings they lived the life ofrobber barons at war incessantly witlh their rulers and among thenmselves they przeo highly the security of tenure they now enjoy they have been well treated and they lnow it there is no more loyal body of men in india that the talukdars of oudh and hindu and mahomedan talukdars are absoluteiv at one in their devotion to thne crown they do not sigh for a return of the old days of ling ship and that amazing warren of debauchery thle ksaisarbagh at lucknow still stalds in their eyes as a relic of a tue which they hope has gone for ever einally the united pro vnces have been fortunate in that they have been exceptionally wel governed they have had a succession of unusualy capable firm and sympathetic lieutenantgovernors and they have always attracted some of the best men in the civil service the direct revenue administration must be an enormous advantage in inducing closer contact with the people the bengal civilian owing to the effect of the permanent settlement learas to contemplate the poplulation far too exclusively through the eyes of the policeetients of urqnstyet as has been said it must now be assumed that the united provinces have been entirely free from discontent and unrest tney have had no bombs or murders or outrages they seem practically free from that steadfast subdued halflatent but per manent antagonism to the british raj which is traceable in some parts of the deccan where au men are politicians of a sort and in bengal but they are exposed to deleterious influences on two sides on the east they are in touch with a subtle form of politicai agitation which is slowly percolating in from  bengal on the west they are open to the advancing propaganda of the arya samaj which entering from the panjab is becoming increasingly political in characterstill when one endeavours to estimate with exactness the character and strength of the forces of unrest at present at work in the united provinces it is surprising to note how limited and unimportant they seem benares has a considerable bengali populatiod whieh largely lives apart but many of these bengalis are men who have elected to spend the evening o their days in religious meditation though some of the remainder may not be precisely apostles of peace lucknow in spite of its evil reputation of long ago is singularly free from political excitement the influeneo of the oudhi talukdars counts for much there but an additional factor is that the city has been well handled ir harcourt butler the dis tinguished civilian who has recently become foreign secretary was in charge of luckaow for two years he crowded a decade of work and improvement into that brief period he won and still retains the affection and venera tion of the people to an astonishing degree and when he left lucknow last year that one man held the great city of  inhabitants in the hollow of his hand luclnow shows that india can still be ruled allahabad is perhaps more prone to political agitation than any other city in the province the bar library at allahabad is not quite an innocuous institution and as is the case everywhere in india where many lawyers are gathered together there is always a certain amount of political ferment the city is a strong congress centre and probably contains a fair proportion of the extremist party meerut is another place which includes a number of disaffected politicianus wvho are not without influence among the people and the same may be said of agra throughout both provinces howvever the iural population seems to be largely un touched and this is the more remarkable because whereas in other parts of india the mutiny was almost entirely military in these provinces and around nagpur it largely partook of the character of a general rebellion of the peasantry and the townspeople at the same time attempts have been made and are still being made to get hold of the boys in the schools especially in the northern divisions sir john hewett alluded to this matter with characteristic frankness at a durbar held at meerut last month when he saidone master was discovered in the attempt to induce youths studying at another institution to leave their studies contrary to their parent wvishes and to join a political association in the punjab for em ploymunt under it as volunteers a number of masters have been found to be subscribers to seditious news papers to the knowledge of their own pupils night schools started ostensibly vith the laudable desire of adding to the education of thos whose time is fully occupied during the day have been converted into debating societies and given a politicalcharacter teachers o a particular reliions persuasion holding office in district board schools have been inown to encourage boys to leave those schools in order to join others maintained by their own persuasion one master was found to have on the walls of his classroom medallions of men some of whom had been actually convicted of sedition while all were notorious for their hostility to the british govern ment these instances all proclaim the existence of an atmesphere in some schools which is not con ducive to the developxment of proper ideas in tbe pupils as to their position in regard to the govern ment of the state ir which they livein this connexion mention may be made of the organization which ars annie besant is starting at benares with the object of counter acting the spread of seditious influences among students and yonngo indians it is to be called i believe the sons of india and though it has i fear prematurely received the blessing of the government of india the tendency of such societies is almost invariably to develop upon lines entirely contrary to the intentions of their zealous promoters the only safe rule concerning young students and politics is to endeavour to keep them out of politics altogether the  ntational volunteers  in bengal began as innpcent associations for physical culture the first wvas actuajly started by a wellmeaning bengali lady they ended by becoming nurseries for anarchiststhe anya saxajthe arya samaj to whichl reference has been already made is an organization founded in bombay more than  years ago by a devout gujerati brabmin who was born in kathiawar so far as i am aware it has few followers in bombay nowadays but in the last few years it has wvaxed very strong in the punjab originally it was a purely religious movement based upon the teacling of the vedas it promotes the abolition of caste and idolatry condemns early marriages and permits the remarriage of widows at the same time it is violentlv hczti to christianity tihere can be no question that large numbers of membersof the arya samaj  are only concerned with its spiritual side but there can be equally no question that the orraniza tion as a whole has developed marked political tendencies subversive of british rule it should never be forgotten in considering indian political questions that they are in extricably bound up with religion m a way which modern western nations utterly fail to appreciate religion even enters inito the motives of the anarcbists and their assoeiates arabindo ghose now under trial at alipur on charges which have still to be decided says in a remarlable defence published this week that at one tirne he contemplated organiz ing a large religious movement based on the vedas and he declares that be believed and still believes thlat  vedantism is the future religion of the wvorldas to the character of the political activity of the arya samaj considerable obscurity still prevails its adherents are now supposed to number about  in the united provinces chiefly ip the divisions adioining the punjab and its real headquarters are no longer in the punjab but at kangri in the bijnor  division of these provinces in a seoluded spot at kaisngri has been established a guruz a sort of teaching college where boys and young menre trained as miissionaries for the arya samaj bosa axe taken at the aste of eight aad pdathrough a long course of training which lasts until they are  years of age the whole period of this  nbvitiate is marked by the severest discipline the students live under the most ascetic conditions and are only allowed to see their families twice a year for haaf an hour they are never permitted to look on the face of a woman who is not a near relation if they are simply being trained as apostles of the spiritual faith of the arya samaj no exception need be taken to the xangri institu tion but the political proclivities of the leaders of the new religion preclude uch a supposition lala munshi ram the princioal of the chief guruku recently delivered a speech at lahore the whole object of which was to show that the arva samaj had no political aims the speech was in some respects re markable and not the least notable of its features was its repeated appeals evidently made in all sincerity to the kingemperor the veneration with which indians of all classes regard the throne no matter how bitterly they may assail the government is one of the most important factors in an extremely comaplex situation and the instinct that prompts that veneration is the growth of centuries and is not likely to be eradicatel but though lali munshi rams references to the itingemperor are impressive i have searched his address in vain for any dis proof beyond mnere assertion of the allegation that the axya samaj has a strongpolitical side it males converts chiefly among the intelligent middle classes who are outside the brabminlical pale the men it attracts wel come the opportunty of wearing an imitation of the sacred thread which is one of the symols which the aryas have copied from the brah mins and having no high caste to conserve they are eager to subscribe to the doctrine that caste should be abolished i shall deal further with the question of the arya saimaj after vtisiting the punjab but meanwhile i may say that its chief importance from the political point of view lies not so much in what it is today but in what it may become its influence as a source of possible trouble is not likely to diminishthe rrfolmsi have written almost exclusively about the general political condition of the united pro vinces because that is the subiect which chiefly required explanation wvhen one turns to the reforms now before parliament and inquires how far they are likely to affect current con dlitions in these provinces one realizes the difference in environment between these regions and the sea coast cities as i have already telegraphed the reform schemes have only lightly rippled the surface of such public life as exists in agra and oudh perhaps  more probably  people understand and are langiudly inerested in the issues raised such mild excitement as has been aroused among intelligent men in the cities centres almost exclusively upon the question of the relative representation of hindus and mahome dans that is the sole topic that has been discussed with any ardour politicians in the utnited provinces do not appear to be specially attracted by the proposal to give the lieu tenantgovernor an executive council with an indian member they have never asked for a provincial executive council the idea does not seem to have entered their heads and there is no present reason why it should rivalry between hindus and mahomedans is however a familiar theme in cities where the lineldlling agitation has before now set whole populations ablaze with mutual animosity the mahome dans know very well wbither electoral couleges or any system of joint representation in the legislative council would lead them there are nearly seven million mahomedans in the united provinces and yet not a single ilahomedan has ever gained access to the legis lative council except by the nomination of the local government in elections they stand no chance whatever they claim with justice that their seven millions includes a large pro portion of men of superior statu while the  milion odd hindus include a preponderating proportion of low castes wvith limited political intelligence thus the chamars or leather workers alone number nearly six milions and are regarded with contempt by orthodox hindus in a conversation i had with mr gunga prasacl varma the able editor of the luelmow advocate he drew my attention to the fact that the number of elected members of the  municipalities of the united pro vinces was  including  hfndus  mahomedans and  of other religious per suasions how then he asked could it be feared that the mlahomedans would not receive their due share of representation under a joint system upon the legislative council  the answer is of course that in practicallv all the municipalities the mabomedans are in a minority and further that in point of fact not one has ever been elected to the provincial body the example of the united provinces alone suffices to demonstrate the inevitable futility of joint electionsat the same time i feel impelled to close this letter with a few words on the embarrassing general issues raised by this question of separate mahomedan representation lord morley has quite rightly admitted the principle which in justice was bound to be conceded but while recogniing the principle as imperative one cannot but note vith apprehension the spirit in which it has been received by the hindus their con tention is that separate representation will intensify and embitter religious animosities and they are certainly doing their best to justify their contention the hindlu press teems with bitter attacks on the mahomedans and on lord morley i will quote twvo examples one writer saysthe victory which has been won has been wonl not with the help of the niahomedans but in spite of them and now they coolly come forward to appro priate not only their fair share but much more than their sharethe  gatekeepers bakslishl as it has been happily styled is it any matter for wonder if this attitude of the mahomedans excites anger and resentment in the hindu ranls another writer complainsthe demand is tantamount to saying that it should be declared that islam bas something iu it which is not to be found not only in hinduism sikhism and zoroastrianism but even in christianitya some thing that entitles the followers of mabomet to special considerationinstances of this idnd of writing might be multiplied indefinitely some experienced officials while urging the justice of tfhe maho medan claims regard with more than a little apprehension the enthusiasm with which their cause is being advocated in some quarters in england many years ago the late sir william hunter wrote a little book now almost for gotten entitled  the indian musalmans and in the opening chapter one readsthe musalimans of indiaare and hare been for many years a source of chronic danger to the british power in india for some reason or other they hold aloof from our system and the changes in which the more flexible hindus have cheetfully acquiesced are regarded by them as deep personal wrongsbut it must be remembered that since then the situation has been entirely reversed the mahomedans accept our system and it is the hindus who now hold aloof we are con fronted with a hindu revival but we must none the less take care to hold the scales even and not to alienate or embitter the teeming followers of the various forms of that religion which still claims and will always claim the devotion of the majority of the people of this country moreover a deepening of the lines of religious cleavage already deep enough might eventually be the cause of very grave embarrassment to the rulers df india that the new reform sehemes should already threaten to deepen them is an ominous svmptom had lord morley and those upon whose advice he relied had a more practical lknoledge of india they wrould ever have encouraged hindu pretensions by outlining an electoral scheme which they have been compelled to abandon in deference to the legitimate protests
