complete servia is beginning to discharge her reservists the british ninister at bel grade supported by his russian french and italian colleagues will tomorrow invite the servian government to supplement its last note to austriahungary by an explanatory declaration identical with the formula drafted by baron von aehrenthal and sir edward grey unless some unforeseen hitch occurs this declaration will be made to the austrohun garian foreign minister next wednesday by the servian representative in vienna upon the completion of these proceedings austria hungary will apply for and receive british consent to the abrogation of article  of the berln treaty including recognition of the austrotuirkish agreement sanctioning the annexation of bosnia and herzegovini the modification or abrogation of article  of the berlin treaty regarding montenegro will take place in accordance with promises previously given by austriahungary to italy whether a conferencea will or will nob subsequently be considered advisable is an open question the prevailing tendency here is to answer it in the negativesir edward greys reply to sir fairfax cartwrights despatches of friday was received at the british embassy late last night and was communicated by the ambassador to baron von aebrentlial at noon today the foreign minister laid it beforo the emperor this after noon and towards evening expressed to the ambassador his miajestys keen gratifica tion at the efforts of england in favour of peace there is indeed every reason to believe these final proceedings to have been entirely satisfactorysatisfactory to the emperor because they correspond to his pertinacious determination that there should be no war satisfactory to baron von aebrenthal because they set the seal upon a comparatively happy solution of the dangerous crisis which his poliey had engendered and satisfaotory to sir ledward grey and the british ambas sador whose joint efforts to meet austro hungarian claims while saving servia from humiliation have in spite of obstacles and difficulties innumerable been attended by final successthouigh its full text will not be published until its adoption by servia and delivery at vienna the angloaustrian formula is stated on the best authority to contain no feature unduly wounding to servian susceptibilities it amounts to an undertaling that servian armaments will be reduced to a normal level that servia will return to a friendly policy towards and preserve neighbourly relations with the dual mlonarchy and that she puts forward no claims in respect of bosnia and herzegovina the austrohungarian public which has been fed upon misleading suggestions industriously propagated from semiofficial quarters will perhaps be disappointed at the comparative moderation that baron von aehrenthal has been led to display but those subjects of the crown whose polizical judgment is not dependent upon the readymade wisdom supplied to the press will perhaps perceive that by asking less baron von aehrenthal may have secured a possibility of obtaining more in the shapo of a relationship with servia less strained and envenomed than would have resulted from imperious insistence upon every real or fancied austrohungarian claimsuxncr oxt o ponxrron one extromoly delicate point the docu ments communicated to the austrohungarian foreign mliister today are understood to be silent they do not nor could thoy fairly be expected to refer to any undertaking on the part of austrahungary that servia will not be exposed through disarmament to mili tary aggression or pressure it is manifestly impossible to demand from any great power an assurance that it wfll not commit an act of unqualified brigandage agaiust a small and all but defenceless neighbour but to the credit of baron von aehrenthal it must be said that in the course of the negotiations he has re peatedly disclaimed all desire or intention on the part of austriahungary to circurmscribe in any way the political and economic inde pendence or to infringe the territorial integrity of the servian kingdom there is room for hope that he will even find means on march  to prolong the provisional duration of the austroservian commeroial treaty in order to avoid a tariff war and to give servia a chance of making commercial overtures from the crisis now happily ended baron von aehrenthal may draw the moral that the southern slav question can best be treated in a conciliatory spirit and that a fruitful development of the relationship between the monarchy and the neighbouring serb states can best be encouraged by a policy which while care fully respecting their political independence should seek to promote their economic inter course with austriahungary to strike a balance of austrohungarian profit and loss from the crisis is no easy task on the one hand the title of the monarchy to permanent possession of bosnia and hierzegovina has been perfected the army has been put into thorough order and is readier for action than it has been at any moment since  and the peoples of the monarchy have been awakened to a belief in the vitality and power of their state organiza tion on the other hand heavy financial outlay amounting at least to Â£ has been incurred the diplomatic relations of the monarchy to other powers have been subjected to considerable strain and the austrohungarian foreign office which six months ago possessed a credit upon german diplomacy is now under a deep obligation which it rmay be assumed germany will not hesitate to draw upon the history of austro german intercourse during the crisis is too complicated and at some pointa too obscure for detailed discussion at this juncture the repeated assurances of full military and diplonatic sutpport that have been publicly and secretly given by germany to austriahungary have undoubtedly achieved their object of strengthening the austrogerman alliance and though there is reason to believe that anxiety not to put the german assurances to the proof played a part in the counsels of the austrohungarian government europe will have for a considerable season to reckon with the fact that another strand has been added to the cable that binds vienna to berlinax intennal side to tim brisisthere is an internal side to the crisis that will presently become apparent hungary wil assuredly demand in the form of magyar national claims compensation for the somewhat bellicose support given by the hungarian press to baron von aehrenthals diplomacy while the germans of austria will seek to profit by the reinforcement of the austrogerman aliance and the correction of their historical mistake of  when they lost the favour of the crown  by opposing the occupation of bosnia and herzegovina these are however questions of the future the feeling at presentamong thebulk of the population is undisguised ioy at the avoidance of war at a popular place of entertainment last night the announcesment that peace was assured because england and austriahungary were agreed and servia was about to disarm evoked a noisy explosion of delight in the military camp there is gaashig of teeth and moaning over lost oppor tunities but the masses of the people think chiefly of the opportunity that has been pre served of workdig steadily and living reasonakbly without loss of lives or further expenditure of treasure in an incomprehensible war
