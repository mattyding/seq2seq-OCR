polytical notesin the house of commons today mr lee will move a vote of censure on the government in the following terms Â± that in the opinion of this housethe declared policy of his majestys government respecting the immediate provi sion of battleships of the newest type does not sufficiently secure the safety of the empire sir edward groy is expected to take part in the debate before dinner and mr balfotlr and mir asquith to speak laterthe government and the opposition differ in opinion as to the number of dreadnoughts which germany and great britain may re spectively possess at different periods during the next three years with this importent exception the opposition claim that their case has been stated by mr asquith and mir mickenna in the debate on the th inst the passages in mir asquiths speech to which especial importance is attached are the follow ing referring to the speech which he made a year ago mir asquith saidi made two assumptions which have turned out i shall not say to be inaccurate at the time i made them but which have not been verified by subse quent experience i admit that to the full i spoke of course on instruction i got my information from the best possible sources and i am perfectly certain that the admiralty had taken every means in their power to satisfy themselves of the actual facts    the first assumption was that the german paper programmei think i described it as a paper programmewas one which mght not be reahzed and certainlywould not be exceeded that hasturned outnotto betruebecauseitisundoubtedly the casei speak with as much reserve as i can about it because i want to keep strictly within the verifiable truthit is a fact that during the autumn of this vear there was an anticipation with four ships which belonged to the germnan programme of  in the sense that orders wvere given materials collected and it may be that in one or two casesssibly in more snips were actually laid down mnen we had that state of things brought home to us it was a great surprise to us i confessthe falsification of one of the hypotheses on which we had hitherto proceeded the discovery of that state of things made it necessary to reconsider and to submit a different set of proiposals to parhament that was the first of my hypotheses the second hypothes is eoiuaily seriouswas a hypothesis as to the rate of hipbuilding if any one wvill refer to the speech i made a year ago he will see that i said with some con fidence that whereas it would take the germans  months to build one of these ships we couild do it in   was not of course committing myself precisely to the number of months but r did maintain that we had a substantial advantage in the rate of construction which would always enable us to quickly overtake them when the event occured i am sorry to say that is not the case i believed it to be the fact at the time at which i spoke but there has been such an enormous development in germany    not only in the provision of shipyards and slips on which the hulk or fabric of a ship can be built or repaired but what is still more serious in the provision of gun mountings and armamenta of those great monsters those dreadnoughts which are now the dominating type of ship such an enormous development and i will venture to say this without attempting to excite anything in the natiure of uinnecessary alarm in this country such an enormous development is so serious from our national point of view that we could no longer take to ourselves as we could a year ago with reason the consoling and comforting reflection that we have the advantae in the speed and the rate at which ships can te constracted that is a vital and moet serious factin the iiansard report the last sentence reads  this is a fatal and most serious fact but the word used was  vitalrthe passages in mr mfckennlas speech cited by the opposition in support of their case in clude the right hon gentlemans admission that  we do not know the rate at which the pro visions of this act the german navy act are to be carried into execution the state ment that in view of the increase in the number of german slips for dreadnoughts and of the extension of messrs krupps works it will tax the resources of our great firms if we are to retain the supremacy in rapidity and volume of construction  and the following reference to the maintenance of our superioritythere will come a day when by an almost auto matic process all ships of an earlier type than the dreadnought will be relegated to the scrapheap the maintenance of our suiperiority will then depend upon our superiority in dreadnoughts alone i have given reasons for believing that the german power of construction of this type of ship is at this time almost if not fully equal to our own owing to their rapid deveopment in the last  months and we cannot be assured of retaining our superiority at sea if ever we allowv ourselves to fall behind in this the newest and besb class of shipit is believed by the opposition that sir edward grey will refer to declarations by the german government with regird to their rate of shipbuilding on this subject the attitude of the opposition is that while they receive german declarations with all courtesy they take exception to such declarations being invited holding that this is equivalent to the action of one of two runners in a race who should request an assurance from the other that he will not outstrip him by some mviniaterialists it is denied that there is a raco between great britain and germany in ship building by the opposition it is considered that the fact that in miinisterial speeches the comparison of naval strength was confined to the progress in shipbuilding of great britain and vermany is alone sufficient to establish thisthe following are the operative clauses of the bill introduced by the prime minister the government whip and ar hiobhouse  to remove the statutory limitation on the salary of the president of the board of trade   the board of trade piesident act  which limits the salary to be paid to the president of the board of trade is hereby repealed and there shall be paid out of moneys provided by parliament to the president of the boaid of trade such annual salary as the treasury determine this act shall not apply in the case of the peison who at the time of the passing of this act holds the office of president of the board of trade so long as he holds that office under his presnt appointmentthe second order in the house of commons today is the third reading of the consolidated fund bill tomorrow and wednesday the second reading of the irish land bill is to be taken and on thursdav the second reading of the indian councils billtomorrow evening captain craigs motion raising the subject of tariff retaliation will be discussed wednesday evening it is expected will be devoted to the second reading stage of the great northern great central eand great eastern railways bill the rejection of which will be moved by sir p channing on friday the licensed premises election days closing bill is down for second readinga correspondent writes it is not so generally known in this coumtry as it ought to be that besides devoting two millions stering to the exctension of the great naval and military engineering works of krupp germany at about the same timne or earlier appropriated other two millious sterling to the puraiase of waterfalls and sites in the scandinavian penin swla and of the machinery required for theconversion of waterpower into electricity the immense supplied of cheap electricity thus obtained are applied to the p roduction of nitric acid from the air ostensibly the enter prise is carried out by three great colour factories which doubtless require large quan tities of nitric acid biut that acid is equally necessary and in equally large quantities for the production of all inds of high explosives hence the german government has a large interest in this scheme as in the extension of the krupp works this is merely an illus tration of the scientific prevision with which german industries are correlated to state purposes instead of being treated as in this country with dull suspicion and grudgingly called upon in some moment of crisis the german government takes the aniline dye producers by the hand becomes their partner mn obtainmng large anad secure supplies of an article equally indispensable in the arts of war and of peace and thus subserves the purposes of both pties in the most economical manner wihen the nitric acid is notrranted either for high explosives or for dyes it is sold in the form of nitrate of lime or nitrate of soda and goes to enrich gerrnan fields or to lay the foreigner under eontributiqn forthe eipan of german dividnds  x
