aerontauticsthe gover ents attrltedpfrom our abonautical cobrzspondentthe attitude of the government towards aerial navigation is still criticised by those interested in the subject as far as can be determined the sum allocated by the military estimates for aeronautical work this year is under £ and it is not clear how much of this will goto balloon work establishment charges and other items of expenditure which woould have to be met even if no work were done in connexion with dirigibles or aero planes the naval authorities appear to be prepared to spend some £ on aeronautical work but whether this is to be the first of a series of annual sums devoted to the same purpose or is to mark the total amount the admiralty feel disposed to expend at present is not clear the work of constructing the naval dirigible does not seem to havebeen begun yet and it will be surprising if any vemsel is produced this year lord crewe in the reoentdebate in the house of lords quoted the french i and german estimates for the present year and these are considerably more than the moneys apportioned by the british govermment he made no mention of the sum of at least £ which france had spent previously or of the £ which coumt zeppelin had in hand as against the few thousands of pounds which have been given in past years to aeronautical work in this countrya praccoai pnognamrit is estimated that a sum of £ would be required to bring us on a level with france and germany in plant and equipment and by laying out this sum at once we night be able to combine tlhe naval and military work for the present if the two departments work quite independently it wi mean that the admiralty will have to start at the very founda tion by erecting a factory laying down machinery and selecting and training designers and builders and this on a sum of about £v is hardly feasible my original sugges tion was an aeroplane factory on salisbury plain or some other suitable place and a dirigible fac tory at another suitable point each with separate staffs specializing in their particular work but under the general management of a board of aeronautical experts with £ both factories could be set going and then with an annual grant of another £ for a few years we might hope to produce efficient ships and after a year or so have a surplus for buyiother vessels from private concerns the these firms build better craftumsnvsnsmst mbtniodsthe point should be well understood that if we tinker with the work as at present we shall fritter way several thousands of pounds eaeh year in inconclusive experiments and at the end of many years find ourselves without ships or men who are competent to build them the judicious expenditure of £ in metting up modern faetories and getting the best men would soon repay itself as weith further sums of lesser amount the works would soon be productive and the nation would probably have the service of airships which would more then repay the total outiay wo are now working in a most unbusinesslike manner and our failures havebeen very costly antil the whole system is altered there is great probability of further costly failures being evolved whilst other countries will meantime progress from one success to another the better equipped our factories are the more cheaply can we turn out successful mchines andthe more rapidly eankwe duplicate them on she presentsipsshod lines even if we did arrive at a sucnessfud type of ship eventuallywe have such poorl facilites either srilitaryor private for duplicating airship work that the buiding of a fleet will be a very slow and costly procesis looked at from a purely business point of view it would seem sounder policy to work with up todate methods andappliances insteadof on the oldfashioned plan now in vogue if our authorities fear to take this step thenithe net best course is to buy wellmade and welltried ships from france or germanytx need of scietmrc assrswrcxwe have need for the assistance of moen like mr lanchester professor eeleshaw pro fessor bryan and the other men of science who are now directing attention to aeronautics for much good may be done by the happy co operation of the practical and scientifie schools ein any practical science we need three classes of workersviz the practical men the scientific men and a middle class betwveen them writh special powvers for transmitting ideas from one to the other and of regulating the whole upon a sound basis the exatreme type of practical man is of the ruleofthumb type usually but frequently he succeeds because in effect he has something of the scientific spirite ingrained within him e is too often intolerant of all work but his own there are aeroplanists who sneer at dirigible balloons without understanding them and balloonists who hold heavierthanair machines in contempt through similar ignorance the extreme type of scientific man is not easily intelligible and unless we have a middle class of helper he will not give much assistance to the practical man the three scientific men i have named are well qualified to help since they happily blend the practical with the theoretical if we had a college or council of this kind to act as advisory board more genuine progress would be mnadeathe folwn etrhsbeen received fromz a correspondent in derbyshirewould suggest that the district from which i wvrite the peakof derbyshire may be found to possess advantages for aviation purposes the highlfand of which it mainly consists is cut into on all rldes by deep valleys wvith steep sides which seem admirably suited for aerial harbonrs these are oftent treeless and have no obstacles beyond the stone wvalls dividing the fields they generally open into wider valleys below where we find the usual hedgerows but the timber is neither so large nor so abundant as in ordi nary lowland districts whilst above them the aviator can get into some of the wide tableland of wvhich our neighbourhood consists they are from fth to eb above sealevel for the mos part they are divided into large enclosures by stone walls and are nearly treeless there are also higher stretches running up to ft above sealevel of open moor land also treelessit is a question whether the wvind on these table lands is worse than by the seaside where most ofthe treeless country is to beifound but or ground has the advantage that there would be no dger of any air craft being blown out to sea ani shelter can slways been found in the deep valleys which exist on every sidethe vale of edale gives the best illustration of what i mean it cuts into the high tableland adjacent te kinder scout and is protected from wind on all sides by steep hills rising abruptly erom the level of the valley from it te rt it is aboutfourand ahalf miloe long by halsamile wide the underend which is specially wvorth attention is treeless and absolutely landlocked onving to a twist in the directibn of the valley the lower end pens out into the wide vale of hope connecting with the derwent valley where we fend a hedgerow country as described above this is towards the east over the edge of the vale to the south ybu come on to the wide limestone plateau extending beyond buxton a stonewall country nearly treeless the height above sealevel varying from ft to ft while over the vale to the north and west is the high tableland of kinder scout lsoft to ft a moorland    the midland railway from mat lock to sheffield and chesterfleld passes through the lower end of the vale of edalethis district certainly merits consideration for one must uot always look at aeronautics from the metropolitan point of view
