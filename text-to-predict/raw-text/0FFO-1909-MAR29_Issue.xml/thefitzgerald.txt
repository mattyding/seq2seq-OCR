corrective of ill sug gestive and illustrative of high aims and noble principles to him fitzgerald was one of gods master workmien who had his vocation and served his generation eccerding to the will of god mysteriously constituted to fill a positionunique in itselfof this aspect of fitzgerald there was perhaps not much thouight in the minds of the band of pilgrims who on saturday morpna glorious morning of bright sunsne and bue skies and white fleecy faroff clouds such as  the poet would have loved  for its promise  of springdrove the few mites of undulating wooded country that separate wood boridge from ipswich rather they mst have been thinking how fistzgerald if he had been there in the flesh wouldave shrunk from this curious visitation but thoei fitzgerald is not alive and it was not curiosity but a real spirit of reverence and true affection that prompted these few score of men and women representative of thousands of those who love his nanme and his writings in all englishspeaking lands they had come to see the quiet little plice in which he hid himaself from the world to stand inthe rooms in which he ate and drank  and slept and thought and worked not with vulgar feelings of impertinent intru sion but from a sincere desire to do honour to the dead and with some dim hope of arriving at a better understanding of the mail and his workthe story of his

fitzgeralds canie back towtoodbridge in  after edward had been to school at bury and to cambridge they settled at boulge ball only a few fields distant fromibredfiefd another fairsized country house in which colonel short and his wife from whom it was bought used to talk to and at each other by addressing their remarks to a dog anda cat  fitzgerald himnself only lived here for two years when he igraed to boulge lodge the little thatched cottage at the gates of the park with its walls thin as a siapence and ampwiero robin son crusoe settleddown tolive for  years from  to iwithshakespeares

period from  to during which he married the daughter  of bernard barton and was perhaps iunhappier for several reasons than at any other time in his life still there were consolations carlylecame here and smoked with him under thei great tree to which on saturday most of the pilgrims solemnly trooped as though to a shrine and barton himself was probably the mgst charming of fitzgeralds wopsdbridge

the  yearsfrom  to  that he spent in the two littie rooins over berry the gunmakers shop in the marketplace of wood bridge he had his boatman friends and his yacht the scandal did the good people of woodbridge know then why it was so called  and he could see the church and the shira hall from his window  still itis difficult standing in the poky little room about ft square in which he worled  to imagine just why it was that he chose it for his abode  perhaps itwas disgustit was in  that he slammed his parcel of  unsold copies of omnari ihayyma on quaritchs counterthat first  took him there and the ordinary human disinclina tion to moving that made him put up with its discomfort till a worse  trial the second marriage of his landlord sent him packing hot foot to his last home little

to the toiat of literatuire propdibyedb dr robertionnlcoll aid thatif he had reillzed that iraichtoastwould hiave beenproposedhewould have spentthe ater noon in a different way he had spentpartof tho afternoon at the crowvn inn woodbridge with his friend mr cobbold eating bread and cheese and drinking fine old colchester ale inthe most pleasant and agreeable way he bhad the moist delightful cbnipanyfor there was notronly mr cobbold in the room but a most excellent man who had come all the way from southend on amotorbicyclq andhad never heard of edward litzgerald lughter mr cobbold aulgcested to that excellent man on tho bicycle that thieywere in woodbridge to pay homnage to edward fitzgerald the motot cyclist not orlv expressed profound indifference but did not even ask who he was laughter has society however was most excellent and siniulating and he could not help thinking that fitzgerald would far sooner have me that motor cyclist than any one of those gathered there that night laughter it was most noticeable in fitzgeralds life thatitwaea happily spent life totally indifferent to literary characters they could count on thefingers of one hand the times fitzgerald and tennyson met after they left cambride i fitzgerald did not return tennyaons visit or invlte him to come again it was the same in regard to thackeray fitzgerald once ran the risk of meeting him in piccadlilly and he turiied round and went back again laughter his affection for his feow creatures was consistent with a disregard for all literary com p any that was an element in his character whih had endeared him to many could fitzgerald have gone into the room where he and mr cobbold were that afternoon he would have distinctly preferred the motor cyclist to either mlr cobbold or himself both of whomprobabmy in theira bookcases had one or more editions of his works oand writings he thought therefore that they might take a cheerful view of literature his notion was that they hadno need to worry about it authors would come into theworld and somehow or another by somo diabolic condition they would do the onlything they really could do well he knew some great writers who had been infinitely susceptible to criticism but authors were not the kind of people who would pay attention to criticism they did not like beihg criticized but to pursue their path doing the best things they were qualilled to do with very little regard to whatwas said of them mrshorteroffered some defence for their being there in honour of a shy and retiring man of genius  they were perfectly right in meeting together to do honour to fitzgeralds genius and expressing the delight and inflnite enjoy mentthey derived from his workswvhen fitzgerald wrote his letters to his frlends he did not contemplate that they would beeome part of the greatliterary inheritance of englishmen the odly remark of mrs carlyles which he could never forgive was thlt carlyles lctters were written for the purposes  of biography he claimed that lir shorter was severe when he soughti to limit their great letter writers to six hethought therewere more than six whowould struggle for preeminence in their minds at different times of their lives and in different modes fitzgerald was one f themost delightful letterwriters that had ever lived but he should not like to say he had only five competitori a man could boean artist in letterwriting and he suggested that it was a cruel and wlcked thing to publish all the voluminous letters a writer produced in the case oflettersonemustbe anartist and the only way one could be that was by the exclusion of much irrelevant matter and by the use as mr shorter had said of the blue pencil it was by excision that all artists produced their work and a letter was thus delightful and became a  classic when irrelevant datails were left out they ought to enjoy literature to delight in t and to live by it in ones highest life not for the sake of making money but for making themselves the men and women they ought to b e it was the literature of that kind that would alwais take care of itself he claimed thgt fitzgeralds character was essentially ai irsh character there vwerecertalii qualities inhis criticism indliterauy work for which he wasmore indebted to ireland than to itzgeralds country he protested against ay portion of this glorious country belqn to any hiterary man in particular he objected toshake speaire s country not that there was any doubfi about it butwarwickshlre was greater tian shakespeares country and suffolk whuch nurtured many great men was greaerthan fitzgeraldscountry suffolh would nurture othermcn and therefore he deprecated the association of any part of the worldexcept for an artistfor instanice constable and crome whq materialized on canivas the physical features of this beautlful part of the world all literarymen and great men of letters belonszee to their country they wvere no greater than their country and they couldi not stamp their individual genius oi any portion of the soil it was an enormous happincss to be horn into the world with a taste for literature nobody could do anything better for his children thanto sur round their homes with good bookes cheap editions of whichwere now to be had let the children have a chance of forming their own tastes and msialing their own selections and dwelling on the authors they liked best it was not given to many of them to look forward to belong to any great class of author still they might in their own lives and the lives of theirchildren enjoy the purest of joy that nationalpride i could give in the nfte variety of authors which this country provided
