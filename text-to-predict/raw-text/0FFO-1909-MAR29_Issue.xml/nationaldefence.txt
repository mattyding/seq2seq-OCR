national defencei r wyndhaa at wiganmr wyndhaxn hijp was the principal speaker at a large meeting held on saturday in the now pavilion wigan under the auspices of the lancashire and cheshire conservative workingmens federa tion sm h sstrozmn presidedir wvndhaa said that wr were living in a critical period of our nations history that critical period always happened when a liberal government had been in tower three years let them take the issues of national defence and unemployment for the masses of th population both of these things were menaced and neither could be dealt with unless this country adopted the first constructive item of the unionist policy as to our mleet unless supreme unchallenged and unchallengeable it could not protect us frora invasion and could not protect the food supplies of this country fourfifths of our food reached this country from oversea the navy alone stood between us and starvation and surrender rithin a fortnight of the declaration of war if we lost one sea flght within  hours we should be lost for ever we should bo faced by starvation we could not even fight for national existencewe must surrender or die of starvation like rats in a hole cheers they heard it said that the government had been taken by urise he could not believe that they were warned by mr bafour and others nearly  months ago why were they caught napping what were they doini during the autunm session passing a licensing bill which they know would not be ced and maling the question of the house of lords a predominant issue which they dropped as goon as it was announced laughter he did not know what they were going to do they told him that they had received declarations from another power which were not pledges they said that whatwas said the other day in the reichstag had an influence upon their action but it ought not to have any influence on their action hear hear for the sake of peace and of dignity of conduct we ought to attend to our own affairs without conducting a double debate one in one house and one in a foreign land checrs germany could build dread noughts as fast as we could and she said that she could build them faster if that was true it was not onlyindefensible but unintelligible for any govern ment to ask them to ride whatwas called a waiting race over the construction of dreadnoughts our efforts must be limited only by our capacity what we did must not be modified by any estimate we might form of their peoples intentions what the people said was we want eight and we wont wait cheers was the democratic government going so far as to condescend to carry out the wil or the people hear hearmr bonai law at dulwicfrwe have been mnpplied by a correspondent with tho report of a speech on the navy which mir bonar law mp delivered on saturday at a meeting of the members of the dulwich constitutional club from which we take tho following paseage the position to my xind is an extremely serlous one it is all very well to say  wo aro doing nothing to the german people and why should the german peoplo attack us   i make no attack on them but we have alu read history more or less we have got to look at tho world as it is and not as we would like to see it and we have got to judge of the future by the past for that is the only true test you remember the war between austria and prussia was thero anv special wickedness on the part of tne austrlan people to cause that war there was absolutely nothing except thisthat prusla had been graduauy growing in strength andtho time had come for her statesmen to assume the headship in germany for that reason war camo it was precisely the same in the case of the war between france and prussia looldng at the facts as they are today we stand in the way of germantys expanson in every direction is it too much to suggest that unless the whble of human nature is changed the very same motives which caused the war between france and prussia may agai cause a war with another country and if we do not take great care the result may be the same as in  the previous case cheer these are not rleasant things to ray i do not believe theapdoodle  arbout  the love of nations i do not believe that germany hates us but our duty is to be in a position in which we can feel that we can ignoro any hostie feelfngs aganst us and if we can defend ourselves our position is secure oheersmrt keir hardie ad the  naval scaremr krm hsnwr mp addressing a large meeting of his constituents at ferthyr tydvil on saturday night said the importance of the tines eight hours bim was that for the first time in history great britains parliament had intervened to ix a inaemum working day for the working mandr hazdie next referred to what he callel tho naval scarc he had alwayi protested against this terrmlcle growth in military expenditure they were told the expenditure upon the army this year had gor e down by £ that was not true wvhat had happened was that they had placed upon overburdened and heavily weighted india an extra £ so that really the expenditure on the army this year was £ more than last year he foresaw clearly that if things were allowed to go on on their present lines we were heading straight for a military destotism in which the civil spirit offreedom wou d be subordinated in every department of the stato to the despotio suirit of militarism to say that this country was in danger of invasion was a fiction and a discredit to those responsible for creating the scare both parties must take a share of responsibility it was not what r balfour said that frightened the house of commons after mr asqtiithsspeech such an effect was produced upon tho house as during the whole time he had sat thero he had never seen any other speech produce the scare had helped to frighten people itwasdriving thousands into the territorial army it was making it easy for the government to beat down opposition in its own ranks to further expenditure upon the navyand helping forward the time which he dreaded when the military element would predonminate hi the councils of tho nation they of the labour party stood flatfooted against the whole of it cheers they were prepared to take their part in defence of the country but not to have any share in cpeating bad blood between germany and england cheers he asked them to imagine themselves germans reading that england had declded greatly to increase its expenditure on the navy that plays like an engilishmzans rome were being produced on the stage that eti sections of the press were con tinually girding at fermany what would they as gfetmans think  would they not want a navy to protect their trade and commerce against all corners  that wvas what gfermany was doing there was no sane german no responsible authority in germanywho dreamt for a oment of the possibility of invading great britain a part from britains insular position the worlds poitics were such that any attack on thia country by germany would lead to european war out of which germany would emerge at the thin end of the thorn the  members of the labour party going to germany at whitsuntide intended to say to their comrades and coworkers in germany you and we have no guarrel cheers  we belong to the samne class we have the same interests let us bind ourselves together not to tihet each other but to ilght the commnon enemy

colonies vere being established se did not believe for a moment that the slight acceleration in germanys shipbuilding prograrme last year was part of a deliberate design to wrest the supremacy of the sea from england the kaiser certainly knew that however many ships he built england would build more and that therefore it was a  fools errand  to try and beat us on tha water he knew england would
