now passed on to the eccleslastical commissioners by the trustees of the city parochial charities under their act of these funds are chiefly used for the benefit of church extension schemes in the

varying from n up to £as this is the firt report in which it has been possible to give any detailed information as to the pension grants made to retiring incumbents under the commissioners regulations a may  lq and fnlly described in our columns at that date it is well to turn to table  which gives the names of the benefices concerned and the amount of the grants made to the retiring incumbent towards his pension and to the incoming incumbent lest he should be crippled by the payment of the pension to outong incumbents there have been  grants allotted during this first year the highest sum given by the commissioners in any such case is £ and the lowest £ and these are met by sums raised locally in rather less than half these cases  a grant has alsobeen made to the incoming incumbent varying from £ to £ and in the case of the latter sum the grant to the incumbent is greater than that to his retired predecessor these grants are well spread over the dioceses for instance salisbury lnorwich and worcester get five each oxford and chester four london and southwarl two and st albans onecroocpordthe issue of  crooldord  for  is the st of the series and therefore this familiar and inispensable directory in the language of its editor is now a quadragenarious institution the fact excuses some natural and legitimate expressions of satisfac tion on the editors part though it cannot we are afraid be held to excuse the somewhat indifferent english in which the expressions are conveyed increasing age he says does not render it an old and valued sereasnt approaching senility au contiraire each publication is as it were a newbom issue phcenixlike in character from the ashes of its departing predecessor this style does not matter much when one is engaged in harmless self congratulation but it becomes serious when one is defining issues thus with regard to the unbeneficed clergy and toeir hardships it appears to us says the editor  that the most nnportant questions for consideration are security of tenure of office and of the amount and method of payment of tho stipend ljnless there is a superfluous of  in thats sentence we have only one consideration namely security whereas he surely means that the assstant clergy have a right to see their remunera tion considered in itself as well as in its mode of paybut crockford is consulted for the sake of its facts not because of the stvle adopted or not adopted in the preface and it is rarely indeed tbat this great compilation fails small faults can be detected easily enough for instance the recent changes in the college of inor canons at st pauls are properly recorded but the editor has failed to revise his his torical note accordingly but of course the fact is that the very variety of the information in a book like this lays a heavy task on the editor and it isnot to be wondered at if he sometimes fails thus a somewhat enviable country benefice was described in last years  croclkford  as being in the patronage of bishop pro hrc tiice crown the last clause refers to the fact thaat some former incumbent was nominated by mr gladstone durlng a vacancy in the see a few months ago this benefice became void and those who thought it desirable were much exercised as to the authority that would assign it the error still remnains in the list of benefices at the end of the present  croclford and that is the part one turns to on peoints of patronage though the benefice of course is not put into the list of crown livings on the other hand st michael coventry does appear in the crown list though it has passed to the bishop of the diocese and is included in his list vwhich reminds us that the diocesan information about lworcester has an addendum in the shape of the arms of this particular  collegiate

renunciation of all pelagian arisn socinian antinomian and arminian doctrines and principles and should intimate his ex animno acceptance of  the fifteen articles or confession of faith containedinthe schedule hereunder written in the same way governors on appointment were to make a declaration of assent to these  fifteen articles or confession of faith of which one described the bishop of rome as  that antichrist the man of sin an son of derdition and another regulation excluded any one hodig the doctrine of adult baptism or of baptism by immerion the changes made by the new scheme mitigate the rigour of these requirements presidents and tutors and governors are to undertake to be and to act  in general accordance with the principles set forth in the said fifteen articles probationers before
