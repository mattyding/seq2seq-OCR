miltary preparations which during the past months have taken place in the servian army and which have generily been magnified in the austrohungarian press and elsewhere into offensive  pretensions against her powerful neighbour during moments when national passions rum high it is very imple for insufficientlyinstructed persons to read an exaggerated purpose into military movements which in ordinary times would pass without conment  the primary object for which ajl ststes mainitain a military force is defence the mean by which this object is effected vary by some states a prepaation for an offensive application of their military strength is deemed to present the best defensive measures by others who do not possess geographical peronal and materi means a purely defensive policy is deemed sufficient to prevent them from falling a prey to a sudden diplomatic or military dvenatre on the part of a neighbour servia belongs to the lattercategory but the sod of all national defence be it based on offensive or defensive intention is efficiency it is generally found that efficiency is strangest with the forxner of these intentions servs trouble is that the force of circumstances has rendered her institutions for lefenee weak and inefacient she was rudely awakened to this fact last autumn since when she has been engaged in the impossible task of attempting in a few weeks to correct the negligenee of yrso one has only to tun to the finding of the commission which reported upon the servian army in  and to read the professional criticisms of the last manceuvres to realize tfe state of inefficiency existing in the arrmy at the moment when the event took place which is responsible for the present situation con temptible would not have been an unfair definition of servias military forces the fevered efforts made by servia to recover the normal condition which her law provides has broulght with it a train of contingent evils in the first plaoe her military activity has been open to a false interpretation during a critical moment of her foreign relationswp in the second place tne sudden influx of new material has deceived the insufficiently instructed public into the belief that materialnmeas efficiency lastly the constant and repeated calling up of reserves for training with the colours has nnlecessarily inflamed the minds of the peasantry who are otherise uninfluenced by the political hysteria whi has racked the townwstan rmni or sara disecsi havo no hesitation in saying that during the past months servias miitary preparations never exceeded what may be termed her con stitutionalriglhtsfor selfdefence of thewisdom of her procedure i say nothing there is mnuch that urope may regret but nothing that she can justlry censure curiously enough servia appears to have no legal limitations for her standing army but on a  per cent calcula tion plus the contingent services it should be about  men with  reservists coming up for training in rotation it is open to i doubt whether servia has during the past five months ever exceeded the rough computation given above it is true that she has purchased imaterial but this is not a new departure certaiialy the duil monarchy can find no fault since before the untoward event of last autumn she was supplying much of the new material herself and placed pressure upon her little neighbour not to place orders elsewherc the austrian press complains of the distribution of servian reservists as menacing her ownfrontiers servia has a right to train her reservists where she pleases and as her military plans are all defensive it is not surprising that during the present crisis the majority of the reservists train in the drina and danube divisions austria complains of the distribution of arms to servias third levy of reservists servia has always armed this class on the frontiers which she considers delicatesince the situation on the drina and danube has now certainly become as delicate as those portions of the frontier pisavis to turkey or bulgaria it could hardly be claimed to be a menace on the part of tervia to exted an eisting system i do not pretend that these measures are altogether wise and i admit that certain natures may find them irritating but they do not and have never at any time furnished what in military sense can be justly termed a menacethe whole scheme of servias military measures for selfdefence is defensivetie iwvasiox of servlait must not be thought that because the servian armay is so rough and poor that austria would have entered into a campaign against it with a light heart the subjugation of servia by invasion fiom austria would present many military difficulties in the first place though the winter has vanished yet the melting snow has raised the danube save and drina in flood and for three weeks these rivers mav remain in flood although rivers even in flood ara negotiable obstacles yet the present condi tion would have rendered it practically impos sible for austria to effect anything by a coutp dc main servias concentration of the larger portion of her  exereising reservists in the danube and drina divsions would have pro bably enabled her to dispute the passage of the swollen rivers long enough to enable her to mobilize and to concen trate her real fighting strength upon the firsb lines of resistance selected in the rearif austriahungary had undertaken war her real troubles would have begun after she had occupied belgrade i cannot agree ewith the austrian train of thought that believed that with the occupation of her capital servia would capitulate the servian temperament is such that though her people may and will capitulate to the diplomatic pressure now upon them yet once a cartridge is burned in anger all sane counsels will be unavailing even if the austrian troops were exceptionally successful the operations which turn the servian first line of resistance in the mountains would take time but success here would not mean the subjugation of servia rather it would mean the commencement of that bitter partisan warfare which in these days of modern riiles is capable of provng a most difficult problem for a commander in the field to solve it is not as if the elements of this class ofwar fare were nonexistent in servia long train igingmacedonia and elsewhere would produce a large number of these guerilla captains who are expert in every degree of mountain raiding therefore it is quite possible that the servian army even in defeat might prove a mnore difficult military problem than when it was organized in mass all this must have been clear to the general staa at vienna they must have knowvn that the subjugation of servia leaving aside the possibilities of pan slavism forcing russia into the field would probably require  men under arms for perhaps six months to the outsider the financial aspect of this problem does not look encouraging especially when it is added to the bill which the negligence of treaty obliga tions has already cost the daal monarchyf
