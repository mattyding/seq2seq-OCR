germanandczechthe sudetenlandiforce of econonicconditionsfrom a special correspondentunder the terms of the treaties of peace some  former german subjects of the austrohungarian empire became citizens of the newly founded czechoslovak state the history of their relations to the czechoslovak state during the postwar period bears a striking resemblance to that of the relations between the germans of the reich and their former enemies first a period of noncooperation then from  corresponding to the stresemann period an attempt at cooperation rich in promise if somewhat disappointing in practice afterwards under the stress of economic crisis a period ofrevolt in germany hitler in the sudetenland henlein the resemblance is more than fortui tous it indicates that the course of events in the sudetenland is strongly influenced psycho logically if not directly by events in the reichthe principles which the czech leaders set themselves to follow in the conduct of the new state showed a wise appreciation of the methods necessary for the government of a racially mixed community in which a bare majority of the population belonged to the czech race in the benesh memorandum of may   occurs the following passageit is the intention of the czechoslovak govern ment to create the organization of the state by accepting as a basis of national rights the principles applied in the constitution of the swiss republic that is to make of the czechoslovak republic a sort of switzerland taking into consideration of course the special conditions in bohemiathe austrogermans of the sudetenland had demanded in virtue of the right of selfdeter mination to be united with the new austrian republic the allies having in mind the diffi culty of incorporating with austria the horse shoe of territory inhabited by the sudelen deutsche had acceded to the request of the czechs that the historic lands of the old kingdom of bohemia should remain a single unit the benesh memorandum was the reply of the czechs to the insistence of the allies that the german elements should be accorded the maxi mum of local autonomy within the new statethe first yearsunfortunately the atmosphere prevailing in the czechoslovak republic during the first years after the conclusion of the war was scarcely such as to place the relations between czech and german upon a sound basis civil strife in bohemia added to the legacy of racial bitterness inherited from the dual monarchy and in tensified during the war years the germans complained that they had had no hand in draw ing up the constitution of the new state the czechs replied that the germans regarded the republic as purely ephemeral and that they refused to learn the czech language the mis takes which the czech government committed at this time were perhaps only to be expected of a race suddenly entrusted with the govern ment of its former rulers it would have required a superhuman degree of fairness to resist the temptation to dismiss germans in order to make jobs for the czech legionaries returning from the various fronts and from their historic odyssey through bolshevist russia tens of thousands of germans found themselves dismissed in order to make room for czechs and their sense of having suffered an injustice went towards embittering the rclations between the two peoplesunder the treaty concluded between czecho slovakia and the allies at st germainenlaye on september   czechoslovakia recog nized that the treatment of her minorities was a matter of  international concern  and should be placed under the guarantee of the league of nations the fruits of this league guarantee have been disappointingly meagre the result has been a development whose possibility the treatytnakers of st germain no doubt fore saw and wished to avoid the germans of the sudetenland disappointed of the protection which they were entitled to expect from geneva came to look instead to their brother germans across the borders of the reicha better periodnor did the conception of the new state adopted by the dominant czechoslovak element contribute towards making the germans feel themselves equal partners in the rcpublic if the analogy with switzerland was to become a reality the czechoslovak element could claim no more than a position of prinlus inter pares in fact the czechs and the slovaks refused to allow the german language to be treated on a footing of equality with their own and insisted on regarding themselves as the one siaatsvolk in the republic thev found a tradition for the army of the republic in the story of the czech and slovak legions which had fought against the old austriahungary a tradition iii which the austrogermans couldhave no share as a result of this attitude the germans came to feel that they were being allotted a position inferior to that of the czechs and the slovaks and such a frame of mind was not conducive to the growth of a feeling of loyalty to the new statefrom the year  there were signs of an improvement in the atmosphere representa tives of the socalled german  activists  were taken into the government and by july  three german ministers had been given seats in the cabinet of these three onlv one dr czech the minister of social welfare has been entrusted with a government department his colleagues dr zajicek and dr spinabeing ministers without portfolioit was unhappily true of the relations between czech and german within the czechoslovaak republic as it was of the relations between germany and her neighbours that the period of economic crisis and of the rebirth of extreme nationalism came too soon for the spirit of com promise and cooperation to have achieved really concrate results national and racial anti pathics dic hard and time did not allow a spiritof genuine collaboration and mutual trust to replace the tension of the postwar years the nazi revolution in germany had its immediate repercussions in czechoslovakia a nationalsocialist party grew up in the germanspeaking areas of bohemia moravia and silesia in common with the german national party it was banned by the czech government the members of the two parties went io swell the ranks of the sudetendeutsche partei founded under the leadership of konrad henlein the gymnastic instructor of asch chair man of the german turn verbanrd in the election of may  the henlein party very much to its own surprise polled more votes than any other single party in the republic and was returned to parliametit with the support of  per cent of the german population of czecho slovakiathe workshopwhat were the elements which went tc make up this impressive majority  among them certainly were nazis and pangermans that the leaders them selves do notadeny pan germanism is nc new thing in bohemian politics separa tion from austriahungary and union with germany had been openly advocated in the austrian parliament before the war by wolff and schonerer the leaders of the german radical party in bohemia essentially however the rise of the hen lein party was an expression of discontent with two thingseconomic conditions and racial discrimination for the economic conditions the czechoslovak government need bear but little share of the blame bohemia the workshop of the old austria hungary had been deprived by the peace treaties of more than twothirds of its former internal market it had concen trated on export only to find its foreign markets reduced to a fraction by the world depression and the universal raising of barriers against international trade the competition of japan hit both the glass industry and the textile industry the cur rency restrictions introduced in germany struck at the prosperity of carlsbad and marienbad seeing that the german dis tricts in czechoslovakia present economi cally many of the characteristics of  dere lict areas it is difficult to believe in the possibility of a solution of the sudete ger man question which can bring real content ment to the german minority economic ally such a solution can come only through a genuine revival of international tradediscrimination in favour of the czechs in predominantly german areas played its part in giving to the discontent of the german population a nationalist character the writer was shown a vast hydroelectric plant erected by czech labour in an almost wholly german area the workmen were brought to their work daily in special trains and even the hawkers who provided them with food and drink came specially from the czech areas for the purpose as the district was one in which unemployment was high the exasperation of the german workmen may be imagined indeed the czech leaders themselves have admitted that such acts of discrimination have had a highly unfortunate effect upon the rela tions between czech and germanto be concluded
