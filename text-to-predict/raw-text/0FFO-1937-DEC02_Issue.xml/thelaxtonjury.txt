the laxton jurya survival of medievalenglandfrom a correspondenta ceremony unique in england will take place today in the nottinghamshire vil lage of laxton it is the election and swearingin of the jtlry to regulate agri cultural activities for the ensuing year the openfield system of farming survives at laxton and agriculture is the sole occupation of the villagethe homes and farmsteads are grouped in the village and the arable land is divided into three large fields which are cultivated in strips each farmer may have as many as  strips in different parts of the field and the idea is to disttibiite fairly the good and the inferior land some strips may be half an acre in extent and some much smaller at one time the manor was divided into four fields but it was found necessary to allot one of these as grassland and to provide permanent fencing it is now the arable land that is worked on the common system one field is left fallow for a year in turn and the other two are cropped by the villagers in commonit is the duty of the jury to peg out the land and allot the strips and to regulate every action which may affect the com munity in no other way would it be possible to proceed for instance stray ing cattle would damage crops and so there is an official called the pinder who rounds them up and places them in the pound near the church the jury will collect a fine for their release there are grass tracks for the convenience of all in the common fields and the owners of strips adioining must not encroach nor must they allow clods from plotighing to remain on the grass there is an auction when the grass is sold for hay and clods would be an inconvenience in mowing a man must keep his ditches clean and his hedges in order where his strips are on the outside of the field after harvest all the commoners have a right to turn their cattle on the stubbles and the jury decides on what date this may be doneon court day the bailiff warns all tenants to attend by ringing a bell those who cannot come are fined d at the court complaints are heard and fines col lected also matters of policy are dis cussed the court is held under authority of the king as lord in chief and of lord manvers as lord of the manor the clerk of the court is a lawyer the tenants are proud to hold their land under their lord and twice a year they attend a dinner at which they pay their rentthe system could not continue but for the rights of common the small farmer with too little land for his cattle has his common grazing rights which enables him to carry on laxton is really a com munity of smallholders and peasant farmers the largest farms are only  acres and more round the  line several are of about  acres many of the bigger farmers have graduated by way of the small holding from woodmen or other estate workersthe first corn drill to be used in england worked on the laxton fields and this year the tractor has found its way thither it remains to be seen how far mechanization can go work on common fields is essentially on a small scale but their interest in ploughing and hedging matches shows that the people of laxton possess the spirit of craftsmanship
