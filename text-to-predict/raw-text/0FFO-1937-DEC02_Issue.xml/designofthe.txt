design of the new buildingst andrewshill frontfirst step in a great schemefrom our architectural correspondentwhether or not  a machine for living in  is an adequate description of a house it is quite certain that a newspaper office should be and look like a machine for producing a newspaper this is particu larly true of the first section in st andrews hill of the new building for the times which has just been completed to the designs of messrs herbert  ellis and clarke ffriba with messrs trollope and colls as general contractors because in order of urgency it is specialty con cerned with the elaborate and complicated transformations for public use of that raw material of the printer which is engagingly termed  copy except for the readers room on the present top floor it contains no provision for those from the printers point of view vague and minor activities of journalism which the preparation of copy involvesbefore they enter this part of the times building the leading article the parliamentary report the news paragraph and the advertisement have all been rcduced to the common condition of  copy to be handled with skill a super latively high degree of skill but equally and irrespective of quality to be regarded as fodder for the machines the  copy  enters at the firstfloor of the building at the bottom are received those gigantic reels of paper or  newsprint which pro claim to the passerby the neighbourhood of a newspaper office in between the copy  and the  newsprint  are inex tricably wedded and thought is embodied in the printed pageplanning a machinethis great machine as the new building in st andrews hill might be called forms an addition to the existing premises of tlhe tines which face on queen victoria street and printing house square at some future date it is proposed to demolish these no longer convenient premises and replace them with a single building and as a first step in the re building project the st andrews hill block has becn designed with that end n viewthe site was formerly covered by a number of old cottages and courts and business premises which had to be demolished before the excavation by st amarys wharfage company which was carried down to a depth of about  feet below the old level at the top or north end of the site it is believed that the building was the first to have deep excava tions within the area covered by the st pauls preservation act and periodical visits of inspection were made by the engineers appointed under the act nothing special in the way of roman or other remains was found on the siteexcept in so far as the treatment may be supposed to forecast the appearance of the projected building as a whole this is distinctly a case in which working economy the planning of the machine is more important than external effectpar ticularly in the narrow quarters of st andrews hillbut a few words mav be said about the elevation from an archi tectural point of view it is designed in a traditional eighteenthcentury manner the ground and first floors being faced with portland stone with six exceedingly grace ful roundarched window and door open ings and the remaining floor faced with bricks the latter by s and e collier limited are handmade sandfaced and of a colour to be the most likely to mellow in the prevailing atmosphere to reproduce and preserve the tone of the brickwork of the period recalled every brick used was picked with great care the predomi nating colours being light brown tinged with tawny red all the bricks were manu factured considerably in advance of the time of being required for use and allowed to stand at the works exposed to all weather conditions which helped to bring out the true tone and take away the newly made effect and particular care was taken to employ a sympathetic mortar a detail that deserves notice is the fanlight overthe main entrance executed in lead it is a particularly interesting piece of crafts manshipat present the new building consists of six floors three above ground and three below but two additional upper floors have yet to be constructed to bring this unit into accordance with the complete scheme the allocation of the floors is as follows in the basement are paper reel store reel stands and heating chamber above is the machine platform level for presses foundry and switch rooms andexterior of the first section in st andrews hill of the new building for the times which has just been completed to the designs of messrsherbert  ellis and clarke ffribaabove that again a mezzanine floor for control gallery and ink tank chamber the ground floor is de voted cntirely to publishing room and vanway entered from the top of st andrews hill on the first floor is the composing room for monotype and lino type and on the second are the readers room and process rooms for preparing illustrations the ventilating plant by richard crittall and co and water cooler by heenan and froude limited are housed on the present rooftwo staircasesto serve the various floors there are two staircases one at thle northeast for worl ing purposes which is lined with glazed tiles of a golden tint and a main staircase at the southeast this last is one of the most attractive features of the building the well is oval in plan and the walls as are aso those of the entrance hall are lined with terrazzo or reconstructed marble by diespeker and co limited in a pleasing ivory shade of two tones producing a mottled effect vertical brass strips used also to divide the nonslip terrazzo tiles of the floor suggest upward movement the wroughtiron balustrade by c a and a w haward limited is finished in green and silver with a silverbronze handrail in satin finish and the electric light fittings by troughton and young limited are designed to harmonize with the decora tions incorporated in the planning of the main staircase is a highspeed passenger liftthe best way to get a general grasp of the building as a machine workingsmoothly and continuously is to follow the fortunes of the reels of paper which represent the material basis pf the tnes from the vanway which will enable seven publishing vans to be loaded or unloaded at once the reels are delivered by hoist into the tiled basement where as required they are lifted into the reel stands in triplicate so as to ensure unbroken continuity in action at once one is struck by the provision for the enormous loads of machinery to be carried moreland hayne and co beingresponsible for the constructional steel work the reel stands together with the presses are on an island consisting of reinforced concrete strip rafts very heavily reinforced to carry a load of six tons per foot run thus they are com pletely isolated from the rest of the build ing so far as the transmission of vibration is concernedthe hoe machines are arranged in two lines of  units each and one line of six units the whole having a total of nine folders which can be grouped in action electrically according to the number of pages the issue for the day is to contain printed and folded the papers are carried up on fork elevators and delivered on travelling bands to the counters of the publishing room on the ground floor where the printed wrappers are automatically supplied in response to an ingenious system of illuminated signalsfrom the nature of its activities and the horizontal run ofits equipment the pub lishing ropm gives the greatest effect of space inthe building everything being designed for rapid deliverythe composing roomwith the composing room on the first floor we are in contact with the conver sion of copy  into typography the copy  is distributed to the mono type and linotype operators who work at their miraculous machines in soundproof rooms on this floor is also the mpulding i foundry for the preparation ofthe papiertwo views of the new composing room of the times showing on the left a section of the monotypekeyboard equipment and on the right part of the battery of linotypes and intertypesmach matrices of pages from which in the casting room below the printing plates are made in metalon the second floor which is lit by a well we may be said to be between mind and matter for here is the readers room where proofs are scanned and corrected and also the process department for the photographic preparation of illustrations and the finishing of the blocks here quiet is the essential the walls of the readers room with its central dais and pickup conveyors for carrying proofs to and from the composing room are lined with panelling by w w howard bros limited of canadian rock elm the veneer being formed from the wood piles of old waterloo bridge the ceiling is lined with acoustic felt by h w cullum and co limited with a cribble cloths finish and the floor is of rubber by loco rubber and waterproofing company the furniture specially de signed for the tines is of steel finished with a gold and brown stipple to harmonize with the panelling and heights of desks and tables are arranged so as to make all operations as easy as possible at one end is a store room for  copy  in the original manuscript or typescript of the contributorin the process department special care has been taken to ensure good ventilation and resistance to acids whether in direct contact or as fumes thus the walls and floors are covered with acid resisting tiles by proderits and co limited bedded in acidresisting cement metalwork has been eliminated so far as possible and teak substituted but where the metal windows occur they have been treated with acidresisting paint the unusually large sinks ft by ft are of acidresisting fireclay and the air trunk ing which is here exposed is of aluminiumheating and ventilationthe building is warmed throughout by richard crittall and co by the patent embedded system of panel warming con sisting of halfinch bore special tubing formed into coils and cast in the ceilings thus the rooms are warmed entirely by radiation with the elimination of con vection currents and the saving of floor space the warming panels are auto matically controlled on the thermostatic principlefor the air conditioning of the build ing  centrifugal cased type fans are installed capable of supplying approxi mately  cubic feet of air an hour under maximum working conditions the machine room casting foundry publishing room composing department and process department are each provided with separate air supply and exhaust plants each independently controlled and a specially designed air extract system is installed for removing the acid fumes from the etching room in the process departmentthe building is protected from fire by means of patent automatic sprinklers so arranged that no matter where or when an outbreak should occur it would be extinguished automatically and at the same time a warning alarm would be sounded fii the casting foundry there is a special arrangement for a cur tain of water to come automatically into operation giving isolation until the workpeople had vacated the room dry risers are provided to enable the fire brigade to make external con nexions without running hoses up from the street fire extinguishers and buckets for the staff are placed in convenient posi tions sankeysheldon steel partitions on the upper floors provide a safeguard against fire spreading from one room tc another and to prevent fire entering the building from outside automatic drenchers are provided externally to flood automatically any window opening atfected by heat or flames the fire safety of switch gear and other electrical appa ratus is entrusted to pyrene fire extin guishers which create a heavy cohering vapour cutting off oxygenelectricity supplythe electrical installation has been carried out by rashleigh phipps and co limited the electric power being taken from the direct current mains of the charing cross and the city of london electricity supply companies reliability and continuity of action under any con ceivable condition of external failure of current or local internal breakdown have been provided for the two lighting section boards are each controlled b switches by which current is instan taneously changed over from one service to another in the event of failure of supplyfor the interdepartmental telephone service of a newspaper office the require ments are best met by some form of in ternal telephone installation separate from and auxiliary to the post office service so as to relieve the operator of all internal calls leaving her free to concentrate upon outside traffic an installation of internal telephones has therefore been provided by telephone rentals limited who as well as installing the apparatus will be responsible for its maintenance the system is of the automatic type with a full cormplement of tones  dial ringing and engaged similar to that of the post office automatic system but the principal feature of interest is the central automatic switchboard specially designed for this particular class of servicein addition to the ordinary lavatory accommodation where the finishings and fittings by pontifex and emanuel limited are designed to promote cleanliness and hygienic conditions the sewer age pumping installation is of unusual interest since important sections of the sanitary arrangements are at a level which makes gravitation direct into the public sewers impossible the automatic lifting devices by burn brothers limited are installed in duplicate control is auto matic and if for any reason other than the complete failure of electric current the pump on duty fails to remove the sewage the second or  standby  pump automatically comes into operation and it would also come into operation to assist the first pump if an extraordinarily large flow of sewage occurredthe new building for the times is in short a thoroughly efficient machine for the production of a newspaper not only in its practical equipment but also in its provisions for the wellbeing and comfort physical and moral of the people who do the work and the dignified modesty of itsexternal form is in accord not only with the function of the building but with the tone and traditions ofthe tirznes itself
