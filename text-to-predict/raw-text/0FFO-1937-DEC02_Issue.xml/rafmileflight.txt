raf mileflightsquadron to takeoff todayroute to sydneyfrom our aeronautical correspondentplymouth dec five flyingboats which may not moot again in english waters until they have finished a cruise of nearly  miles are lying fully loaded in the cattewater off mount batten tonight thirteen officers and  other ranks who are to serve as their crews have gone early to bed in the raf station here hoping that the weather at  tomorrow morning may not be quite so bad as tonights forecast suggests it will be if they can get away in the morning accord ing to schedule they will spend tomorrow night at berre near marseilles they will be in malta on friday and alexandria on saturday and a fair start on their long journey to australia around it and back will have been madesomething of the romantic idea of setting out from drakes port  years to the month after he began his threeyears voyage round the world may have appealed to the crews something of the distinction of taking part in the longest formation flight ever made has certainly impressed them it is significant of their keenness at all events that no change has had to be made through sickness or casualty in the crews since they were choseninspection of crafttoday they and the craft they will serve were inspected by air marshal sir frederick bowhill commanding coastal command the last of the stores rations and spares have been stowed after weeks of invention and contrivance designed to promote efficiency and convenience the five saro londons have tanks nearly full and are sitting solidly on the water they may need a run of a mile in the morning before they get off but there is plenty of room in the sound and by tonights pro mise there may be a brisk wind when they get away only one officer of no  squadron will be left behind with rather more than  envious airmen they are not likely to see their comrades again until the middle of may in the interval they will it is hoped have taken greetings to sydney and to new south wales generally on the occasion of the states th anniversary celebrations they will also have taken one passenger on his homeward joumeyair commodore s j goble of the royal australian air force who under the system of interchanging officers between the two air forces has just completed two years service with the raf with an officer of long experience like wing com mander k b lloyd who commands the squadron and squadron leader v p feather the secondincommand he will be flying with some who did not enter the service until the raf expansion scheme was under taken of the two sergeant pilots one was entered direct as a pilot in august  and six of the airmen were recruits of the expan sion period the squadron therefore is a typical one neither packed with special officers and men nor equipped with special aircraftspecial arrangementsthere have naturally been special prepara tions to meet its requirements at the various stages along the route spare engines to re place those which will have run for the pre scribed period between overhauls will be wait ing at certain stations and spare parts will be available at other places the officers too will find their parade uniforms mess kits and dress clothes at sydney and they may send home their european uniforms when they reach karachi and get into khaki but in all essen tial respects this squadron will be moving along a route mostly of british stations much as it would move on a reinforcement flight to australiait will cross the iraqi desert in two stages from alexandria calling first at lake hab baniyah and then at basra it will make the miles overland crossing of india with only the one call at allahabad between karachi and calcutta thereafter its route will be mainly over water it is due at singapore on december  and there it will remain until january  to carry out major overhauls it will fly from darwin around the north and east coasts of australia calling at karumba bowen and brisbane on the way to sydney where it will remain from january  to february  then its course will follow the rest of australias coastline halting at mel bourne launceston hobart adelaide cedlina albany perth carnarvon and port hedland it will come at last to derby whence it will head out over the sea for bima on the homeward runpetrol for  hoursall the stages set in the squadrons itinerary are well within the flying range of the londons which carry petrol for  hours at the normal cruising speed of  mph in some cases the crews may have to sleep aboard and they have cooking apparatus with which to prepare their own meals at most night halts they wvill be able to get quarters ashore but in readiness for the nights of camping out they have provided themselves with gauze mosquito nets to fit over the open portholes the boats have a number of special fittings to make the long cruise run smoothly and one concludes that the engineer officer at this station has spent a merry six weeks implement ing the bright ideas

undertaking that you are now about to begin will be written large in the pages of aviation in addition compared with what happened  years ago you will provide to the empire and the world a remarkable contrast of past and present
