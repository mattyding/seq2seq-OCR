majestys government to take the necessary steps to counteract the con tinued increase in the cost of living par ticularly in relation to its effects on certain sections of the communitythe noble lord said that very considerable anxiety existed with regard to the increasc in the cost of living government speakers said that it was unfair to conmpare present prices with those of three four or five years ago and that they should be compared with those of what the government called a  normal year say  or  it was true that wage levels were slightly higher than in  and price levels were about the same nevertheless even in comparison with  the prices ofbread cheese milk and potatoes were considerably up two of these four articles were articles ot primary importance in the diet of the poor and it ought to be the business of the state to see that the people had a sufficient supply of them at reasonable pricesreal wages had been steadily falling although many wages had risen some of them were anchored to the costofliving index figure a great many people were not entirely satisfied with that index figure and indeed the government had tacitly admitted that the figure was not perhaps everything it should be because they had set up a committee to inquire into it there were however many workers whose wages had not increased and the miners had actually suffered a decrease lately vast numbers of blackcoated workers had had no wage increase whatever the government might say those of them who had been round the country must be aware that there was a great deal of discontent among practically all classes on account of the rise in prices since  wages had risen about  per cent while food prices had risen t per cent and the comparison between those two figures was somewhat alarmingin addition to food prices the opposition were extremely uneasy about the question of rent he hoped that the government would be able to give an assurance that they did not at present contemplate any further decontrol where decontrol occurred heavy rises in rent followed immediately the rise in the cost of living also pressed heavily on the unemployedit was cenerally recognized that present con ditions in so far as they were good werc almost entirely due to the governmcnts re armament programme it would be for the comfort of the country if the government cotild give some assurance that they had a plan to keep industry at work when the rearmament programme was completedlord hornes viewcommodity price levelsviscount horne said that in normal times the government could do very little directly to influence prices as to the prices of the things which people consumed a government could only influence them by themselves becoming purchasers and being the sole selling agency the great majoritv of the people with a sound view on the matter were averse to embarking on any such disastrous experimentshe did not agree that they could have low prices with good employment and prosperity low prices were almost universally a symptom of depression rising prices were a stimulus to industry they meant that people were embarking on enterprises and that employment was better in the case of falling prices the reverse happened people went out of the market lived on their stocks and did not buv and factories began to work on short time unemployment became greaterthat was illustrated during the recent depres sion at the time when the cost of livino was lowest in this country  there were  more people unemployed than was the case today now that the cost of living was more than  points higher than in  there were  more people employed in this country than at that time the macmillan committee ascribed the cause of the depression to lowness of prices the pro ducer they said could no longer live the primary producer was the market for the manu facturer the price of primaty products fellto a low edge less than half what they were some time before there was a depression almost unequalled in our economnic history the committee advised that everything possible should be done to get prices up to the level at which they stood in  and to sustain them at that figureprices and wagesanother authority which would commend itself to noble lords oppositesir arthur salterfollowing on the same lines suggested a different year sir arthur saltersuggested that  might be the year to which we should try to conform in the matter of prices of course the way in which governments could do that was by means of currency alteration when we went off the gold standard that was the method by which we succeeded in starting a career of gradually increasing prosperity by which we had arrived at the stage which we were at todaythey would find that in  and  comparing commodity prices then with those of today that instead of those prices having been raised as the macmillan committee sug gested to the previous figure they had not yet reached that level he had taken the general level of commodity prices in  as  in  it was  and now it was only  so we had not yet got back to what the macmillan committee and sir arthur salter thought was the necessary goal in order to reach a comfortable positionwages at a level of  in  were ex pressed today by wages at a level of  so that they had got up till now a position in which the cost of living had fallen com pared with those important years while wages had risen there might be complaints to be made later when something very different had happened but he did not think any complaint could be made today sufficient margin existed for alteration and so far as they had seen recently the cost of commodities so far from rising had fallenposition in useffect on stock exchangehe supposed that some noble lords might think that that was a good thing fie thought it was not they could see what the results had been what had been the cause of the present malaise in america  it had been nothing but a drop in commodity prices that was what started it they had had of course something like a tugofwar between thc political and industrial elements in america but the thing that started this trouble there was the fail in the price of commodities and it affected the stock exchange in americasome people said  well what does the stock exchange matter   but in fact the stock exchange had a very violent re action on the condition of business and industry for the reason that when a man looked at the value of his securities one day and three months later found that it was only onehalf of what it was then he began to curtail all his expenditure they could see what had happened in the united states during the last few months whereas there was a tremendous trade being done in motorcars with great orders from the motor establishments to the steel industries they sud denly found themselves with the beginning of a depression and orders to the motorcar makers dropped off they began to work four days a week instead of five and orders to the steel makers dropped off with the resulthe thought he was right in sayingthat whereas about six months ago the steel workers were working to about  per cent of capacity to day they were working to about only  per cent of capacitythat was what occurred when they got a situation in which there was a lack of confi dence in the commodity marketsprices fell and immediately orders ceased they would see the psychology of that situation and that really was the spectacle they had seen before them curiously enough the macmillan com mittee warned us about that in advancean attempt at the present time to check price levels would onlyhe would not say bring disasterbring great disadvantages in its train for his part looking at the various levels of prices the cost of livingt and wages today he saw no reason at all why we should feel any sort of apprehension cheersthe consumers interestslord snell said that whatever might be the technical heights to which prices should rise or fall the interests of the consumer were of the very first importance the complaint of the opposition was believing that prices had risen and that wages had not risen in any thing like the same proportion and that the government had taken no necessary steps to deal with that imrortant situation the human side of the problem was not men tioned by lord horne who did not appear even to have thought about it america which had a slump deeper than our own had not the advantagesor disadvantagesof having a labour government at the time yet thesc things happened there and in other parts of the world and no one knew better than lord horne to attribute all to the labour govern ment was just political demonology he lord horne knew that the macmillan committee had actually said that it was not due to the labour government but was due to low prices lord horne could not have it both ways the government should not underestimate the swelling tide of resentment which present con ditions were arousinglord llutchison paymastergeneral said that it was undoubtedly true and it had always been so that the very poorest of our population had suffered from the lack of good things in this world he agreed that it was a human question and he suggested that the government had as fair a share of humanity as those on the other side of the house it was largely a question of balance the qttestion of the cost of living and the question of unemployment had to be very carefully balanced as to how far the common good of the population was best carried outduring the period of the slump when we had such large numbers of unemployed prices were naturally very low below the prices of production and we had all the misery that the period brought us with the rise of prices there had been a great increase in the purchas ing power of the people that produced a demand for goods that was all to the goodthe index figureallowing for the return of cuts made during the slump and a rise in wage levels those now in workwho reached the enormous figure of did not feel the rise in the cost of living taking the  figure as  other figures werethird quarter of   l    he agreed that for the unlemployed especially those who had to get public assistance and for old people with a jos pension a rise in the cost of living if it came would be a serious matter the govern ment were carefully watching the index figure lie agreed that los for old people was not enough but when the amount was increased to los the cost of living figure was  above prewar whereas today the figure was only  above prewaras to the surplus of £ on the unemployment insurance fund the statutory committee were now examining the finances i of the fund the committee would un i doubtedly take into consideration the rise inthe cost of living and also the various rates they had been paying in dealing with the stir plus as to the unemployed who were receiv iny assistance the unemployment assistance board had issued instructions that special cases of need were to be met the govern ment were doing what they could to see that the part of the population who might and probably would suffer most by a sharp rise in the cost of living were safeguarded so far as was humanly possiblethe motion was by leave withdrawntheir lordships rose at  minutes to  oclock
