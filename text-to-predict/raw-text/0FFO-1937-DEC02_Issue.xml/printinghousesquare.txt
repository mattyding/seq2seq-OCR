printing house squarethe times  officespast presentand futurememories of old blackfriarsthe site occupied by the times has a long and varied history every day until recently the times reminded its readers that it was printed and published in printing house square and play house yard in the parish of st ann blackfriars and these three names sum up three famous activities with which the site has been associated during the course of  yearsthose of a religious house a playhouse and a print ing houseblackfriars is a reminder of the domini can priory which was established in this quarter of london in the year  and continued until the dissolution play house yard commemorates the theatre which was managed by shakespeare and burbage printing house square recalls lhe occupancy of the kings printers which began shortly before the great fire and lasted until they moved elsewhere in g shepherds drawing of the times office in or a few years before the entry of john walter i another printer and founder of the timesfortunately not a little is known of the earlier tenants of the site of the tines and the immediate neighbourhood for a knowledge of the priory there are documents yet existing in some of the very stones of which it was built in the foundations of parts of the present build ings of the tinmes medieval masonry is visible and from time to time a good deal has been brought to light particularly a few years ago when excavations to the north of printing house square yielded relics of the chapel or church of the black friars again the alley called church entry which cuts across what was once the church and friar street still speak of the tenure of the friars cloister close however has now forfeited its identity to the tiuizesa dominican prioryin literature also there is preserved a remarkably vivid description of the priory as it was in its prime the author of the alliterative poem known as  the creed  circa  must have known his way in and out of the labyrinth of religious pre cincts intimately and to the eve of faith the layout of the alleys and buildings to the north of the times is such as to con jure up parts of that labyrinth to this day its boundary to the north was carter lane along the south side of which stood the church other parts extended over what is now apothecaries hall and over much that is now the property of the times and towards the river there was the friars gardenst andrews hill or puddle dock hill as it was anciently called on which the new extension of the times looks must have marked the extreme eastern boundary of the dominican territory if indeed it extended in this direction quite so far at any rate no relic of the religious past was dug up during the excavations for the new building of the times but it may be appropriate here to put on record the final disappearance in consequence of the newa section of coles map dated  showing midway between slioe makers row and the thames the kings printing house with a strip of garden on three sides of it and to the east small courts since appropriatedby the timesbuilding of a curious sample of an older london which lay hidden behind the west side of st andrews hill and was approachable from it through an archwaythis archway led into an alley named green dragon court which itself led into curriers row and canterbury court in a rectangle formed by these courts there stood a block of some dozen cottages once residential and standing back to back overshadowed by the neighbouring buildings they were airless and unhealthy according to modern standards nor was water laid on in them the occupants having recourse to a public pump which bore the city arms there need be no regret even among antiquaries for the obliteration of this cramped and dingy quarterpump and allinto which few strangers ever penetratedto return to the priory parliament occasionally sat in it down to the time ofhenry viii for there was a great hall there and in that great hall as shakespeare knew the trial was held of katharine of aragon soon afterwards the entirc quarter was to pass into the hands of the king who declined to assign it to the juris diction of the city this decision of the kings had important consequences because for a long time blackfriars remained a liberty outside and those who lived in it could claim peculiar privilegesburbages playhouseit was by reason of privilege that the second stage through which the site of thze tirnes has passed was made possible after edward vi had sold the former property of the friars to various pur chasers the quarter became and remained for a good many years a highly fashion able place of residence indeed some of the first personages in the land settled in it and it was in spite for the most part of these residents and by reason of its extraterritoriality that a playhouse was established in it for this purpose was used a large block running from north to south from what is still playhouse yard as far perhaps to the south as printing house lane which leads into the squarethe upper part of this block had been the parliament house below had been a parlour and a dining hall in an adjoining building it appears was the first playhouse it was opened by thomas farrant for the combined boys of wind sor chapel the chapel royal and st pauls in  but it did not last long although it had the advantage of being roofed in and therefore usable in winterlater in  the elder burbage hit upon blackfriars as a promising site for this very reason and also because it was outside the city where playhouses were forbidden on obtaining possession in  he threw together the two chambers under the parliament house into a theatre butt he died in  and in con sequence of legal complications it was some time before his son richard could produce plays in it himself he first letit to the managers of that private  aerie of children who according to shake speare  berattled the common stages but in  he recovered the lease and the kings men the company in which he and shakespeare were partners began to use the house in winter as an alternative to the openair globe shakespeare at this time had a residence of his own hard by in ireland yard on which parts of the premises of the tinzes now stand the residents in blackfriars however were never quite reconciled to a theatre in their vicinity or to the crowds which it drew but notwithstanding their repeated pro tests the theatre remained open until the closing of all theatres in  in  it was pulled downthe kings printersthen began the third phase when the kings printers came in set up their print ing house and gave its name to printing house square a likeness of their post fire building has been preserved it was of three floors with four windows to the floor the top ones being circular there was a pediment with the royal arms and on either side of the building at right angles were other houses of the same height the whole is clearly a small square here early numbers of the london gazette were printed as was also the  vinegar  biblethat  basketful  of misprints as it was nicknamed atter the printer baskett this printing house how ever was burned down in  and years afterwards there were found by the re builders of the times office remains of prayerbooks charred by the fireby  the premises were rebuilt and marc baskett had erected for himself that private residence which stands today and has been in the occupation of succes sive proprietors of thze times to the west of this house is a courtyard wherein two plane trees flourishthe modern re presentatives of other greenery which is to be detected in or inferred frpm old maps and drawings of printing house squarelet us look at one of the old maps coles dated half map and half architectural drawingdistinctly shows the kings printing house as a tripartite facade with a strip of garden on three sides of it while to the east are certain small courts since appropriated by the timzes and to the south are streets or lanes duke humphreys among them which have since given way to queen vic toria street the same tripartite facade with the royal arms in the pediment appears in g shepherds drawing of tlhe tines office in  and there are two trees or shrubs in the picture later draw ings are to the same effect and such re mained the outward appearance of printing house square until upon the construction of the new blackfriars bridge and of queen victoria street a new era opened for the whole quarter of blackfriars and john walter iii resolved to rebuild the printing house and the editorial and other offices of the timesvictorian rebuildingof this rebuilding which took place in the seventies and early eighties of the last century no mention apparently was ever made in the timzles itself mr walter as one of his biographers has recorded had a native inclination for building and there is a tradition that on one occasion he took to laying bricks himself when there was a strike of bricklayers at his own man sion at bear wood berkshire he could do without them he told the men but it would take longer in printing house square he was his own architect and his bricks and his ironwork and his wood work were all made or prepared on his berkshire estate or near it before being brought to london his workmen also were mainly berkshire men a solid struc ture he made of it and it was his boast that it was impossible to pass the blade of a knife into any joint of brickwork or woodwork and to crown the facade looking out upon the comparativelv new thoroughfare he gave it the pediment which exhibits the emblematic clock and the scroll of the times past present and future
