old buildingsrecord of drawings andplansthe increasing interest taken by the public in architecturel and its history is reflected in the increased attention being paid to the drawings and plans of build ings which might claim some degree of historic importance such drawings have never or only in the rarest instances attracted the collector expelled from their original offices or homes they join old magazines andvictorian theological books as the flotsam and jetsam of the antique dealers shop others such as those in the crown lands office the royal academy or with the london county council are not readily accessible to the public the society for the protection of ancient buildings the royal institute of british architects and other bodies have for some time past been alive to the value both for journalists and for practising architects of keeping some record of the whereabouts of these drawingsin  a committee was formed to arrange for a brief description of the plans or drawings of buildings erected in england and wales before  to be cardindexed and the work has been going steadily on for seven years each card gives the name of the architect the period in which the building was erected the aspect of the building drawn together with its mode of treatment the date and condition of the drawing the draughtsmans name and the place or collection in which the drawing now is photographs of buildings are not included within the scope of the scheme drawings recordedthe cards are filed in the library of the riba in portland place some  drawings bave now been recorded by voluntary helpers in london and the country the greater proportion are concerned with london but the balance should be adjusted as more voluntary helpers in the country are forth coming the work of reference is simplified by a topographical arrangement of the cards and by the use of different coloured cards for the different classes of buildingsas more and more drawings become classified the value of the work to architects should increase particularly for those engaged on work of restoration an illustration of this was recently afforded in the case of chingford church after the restoration of the building a plan of the original church was discovered which would have greatly simplified the archi tects task to people interested in the architectural development of a large city like london this index should prove a very fruitful field for research
