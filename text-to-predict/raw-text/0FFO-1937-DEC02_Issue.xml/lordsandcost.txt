lords and costof livingcauses of recent risea useful debatewestminster wednesdaylord faringdon today did a good service to public knowledge if not to his own cause by staging a formal debate on the rise in the cost of living which has lately provided the labour party with ammunition for a good deal of irregular snipingin the matter of statistics his most formidable figure was that since  wages had risen  per cent and the cost of food by  per cent but he attempted to discount less alarming comparisons by asserting that expenses other than food such as rent and the cost of transport had also risen or threatened to rise it was no use taking comfort in the fall in un emplovment because the cost of outdoor relief had nearly doubled since  moreover the unemnloyed allowances were becoming increasingly inadequate and the rate of oldage pensions was now spelling starvationthe farmer who was supposed to benefit by the rise in food prices had in fact received a very small part of the rise particularly disastrous was the price of milkthe highest in europeand yet dairymen complained that the profit was intercepted by middlemen and coopera tive societies were forbidden by the milk board to charge more reasonable dis tribution costs he asked that the huge surplus in the unemployment insurance fund should be distributed to the unem ployed that rent subsidies should be increased that pensions should be raised that factories should be made more cheaply accessible to labour as they would be in the special areas and that plans should be made to stimulate employ ment after rearmament endedthe right comparisonlord horne blandly shook his finger at this youthful advocate of methods which had brought economic disaster in  governments could in fact influence prices very little when they were governed by imports and governments would be very unwise to think that there could be prosperity with very low prices the lowest level of prices had in fact been the peak of unemployment and the mac millan committee had directly related the two the committee had urged a return to the price level of rightly because it was a prosperous time when nobody was complaining of hardshipthe present level of commodity prices was considerably lower  compared with  the cost of living was also lower and wages were slightly higher the macmillan committee had also pro pheticallyforeseen that premature attempts to check a rise in prices would be dis astrous it had been disastrous in the united stateslord snell welcomed this transfer of odium for  from the labour govern ment to commodity prices purely economic arguments left the human factor out of account and he asserted the standard of living was falling it was useless to say that the government were not to blame because they had delibe rately limited suppliesgovernment policylord hutchison pointed out that government monetary and fiscal policy which had so greatly improved emplov ment had singularly little affected the cost of living he did not think that those in work were grumbling at the small rise the governments plain duty was he agreed to watch most carefully the effect of any rise upon the unemployed and upon pensioners in fact the cost of living was lower than when the pension was fixed at los a week and in any case the government were anxious to avoid such increases in taxation as might damage tradeas for the unemployed the statutory committee were now reviewing the finances of the insurance fund and would doubtless take the rise in prices into account moreover the uab had already instructed its officers to do so when assessing unemployment allowancesthe government also had plans to deal with what might happen when armament production started to shade off finally he agreed with the nutritionists that the right kind of food might be of the utmost importance he had himself noted that the germans who were children between  and  and presumably underfed were today magnificently developed the reason might be that the quality of their food had compensated for the lack of quantitythere was only a handful of peers present and lord faringrdon did not attempt a division
