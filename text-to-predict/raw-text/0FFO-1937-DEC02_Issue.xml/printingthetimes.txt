printing  the times linesof giantpressesmodernequipment and speed inproduction what a funny watch  alice remarked  it tells the day of the month and doesnt tell what oclock it is the clock face on the device which has appeared over thefirst leading article of thle times since  has this advantage over some actual clocks that it does tell the correct time twice a day but its true function is to stand simply for the interval called  to day or  times present between the open book of times past the news which has become historyand the book of the future which it is a responsible newspapers business to open as far as it can in its editorial columns the familiar dial points to an hour sixpastsix in the morning which more than a century ago was the usual hour and minute of publication today to retain that significance succes sive editions would have to show the hands pushed forward from  at night when the earliest northern edition is shot into the waiting news vans to the time when the late london edition is run off after  amnew inventionsto maintain its lead over the flying moment the times has ever desired to create and foster rather than merely to adopt new inventions for the recording and disseminating of news in the open book of times past  is written the first chapter of modem history in the printing industry for in  the powerdriven  printing press was successfully given its chance at printing house square hence even the lay visitor to the new building opened yesterday will examine its mechanical equipment and functional routine with special interest knowing as he does that the visit will afford more than one glimpse into the volume of  times future  that will chronicle the multiplication of the printed wordthe mechanical side of creating each days issue of tlhe times is a threefold operation the composition of type pages including the reading and correction of proofs and the makingup of editorial and advertising columns into planned pages the moulding and casting of stereotypes from those pages and finally the actual printing which can occupy a surprisingly short timeand now less than ever for the two newly designed and specially manu factured unit lines of messrs r hoe and cos presses each ft long and as high as a small house can impress reels of paper at the rate of  cylinder revolutions an hourthe unit rotarypress plant is entirely new printing house square can produce more pages of fine typographical quality in less time than any other office in the country each unit of the hoe  super speed  antifriction machines prints two sections of eight pages each in one revolu tion of the cylinders each of the nine folders is capable of producing  copies of the times in one hourchanging reelsthe machines are mounted on mas sive castiron substructures to carry the threearm wittonjames automatic reel stands which feed the paper to the presses enabling reels to be changed without stop ping each full reel of paper weighs about cwt and is about five miles long when the roll stands are fully loaded  reels can be either in use or in readiness for running thus  printed sheets three thousandths of an inch thick are cut folded and delivered at the rate of eleven a secondto run the two lines of immense presses at top speed over  aggregate hp has been made available by the new  unit drive  equipment built by messrs j h holmes each press combination has a master control desk with push buttons opposite each folder deliverythese and other control buttons com plete circuits which operate various electri cal devices which in turn affect the supply to the driving motors the power supply is concentrated in a control room apart from the press room the main control board is oft jong carrying over electrical devices in all there are approxi mately  electrical contacts to give the necessary control to the presses and in the complete installation there are over  connexions using over  yards of wire the system is so designed that any fault can be localized and isolated in a few minutes thus the machines them selves are controlled in every detailto ensure even distribution of ink the best quality rubber rollers are made for the tines by messrs usherwalker their smooth surface does not accumulate fluff but will hold a sufficient quantity of inkthe paper supplied by the imperial paper mills of gravesend is the subject of periodical analysis and test for strength smoothness and colour it is necessarily tensile to prevent breakage during the run moulding and castingon the printing cylinders metal curved plates are clamped these plates provide the typographical surfaces the plates are stereotypes cast from papiermache matrices these are obtained by impress ing the characters forming the actual pages of type into sheets of flans flongs to the trade by means of  gigant hydraulic moulding presses the matrices thus obtained are automatically dried and simultaneously curved for fitting into the casting box in which the plate is made the five new junior autoplates are fitted with a novel patent antifume hooding system all hightemperature parts are heavily insulated and the furnaces which melt the metal for casting the plates are fired by pressure gasthe pages of original type from which the stereos are moulded are made up of  columns of text and headlines  illus trations and captions and  advertise ments each page of the paper has a distinct character and columns of news editorial letters financial and other reports are placed in their respective page chases or frames and given appro priate headings certain pages consist entirely of  small advertisements set in the smallest size of the text type on other pages displayed advertisements occupy such space as can be left for them these are either received in the form of papiermache stereo matrices prepared by advertising agencies and cast as whole blocks of metal in the foundry or else they are set by hand in the composing room of the times in any of the numerous founts of publicity faces which are made on the premises new for each use on monotype casters the range and modernitv of the type faces available to advertisers in the times are superior to those of any other newspaper and its  houseset  advertise ments have the benefit of expert advice from the advertising department in making both layout and copy as effective as possiblecorrections in proofbefore the pages can be made up a proof of each column or paragraph has to be scrutinized and any misprint cor rected in some cases by resetting lines in other cases by lifting out individual characters and substituting others chances of error at the composing machine key boards have been reduced to the mini mum by the perfection of working condi tions in the new building communica tion between proofreaders and composing room indeed between all cooperating departments is simplified by the lamson pickup and delivery carrier systemthe columnstext and all headlines which have been inserted as  passed for press  in the chase are all composed on linotype intertype and monotype key board machinesthe linotype and intertype do not com pose or arrange types but create lines of metal known in the trade as  slugs a keyboard is used for assembling the various matrices in the order required for making words the operation of casting the  lineotype  and returning the matrices to their original places is effected mechanically the   slug machines in the tines composing room are equipped with eight magazines containing different sizes and designs of matrices for type faces two of the linotype machines are set aside for the setting of certain headingsa new installation of monotype machines  casters and  keyboards has replaced in the new building the original battery laid down in  these monotype machines automatically com pose and cast single types and are used for a large portion of the composition required by tlhe tinesa monotype keyboard which looks like a giant typewriter has a separate key foreach letter of roman and italic lowercase and capitals small capitals punctuation signs c each key causes a particular combination of holes to be perforated in a paper roll unwinding over the machine this roll when transferred to the inde pendent casting machine acts on the principle of the pianola compressed air liberated by the perforations moves au parts synchronously so that one sees new types emerging as fast as they can be counted spaces of even width setting themselves between words and the com pleted line moving forward allowing a fresh line to formsoundproof windowsthe keyboard room is divided from the casting room by a newly designed set of double glass windows which render the sound of the casters almost inaudible without restricting the natural lighting from the main windows of the casting roomin addition the whole of the type required for correction of composed material for the handsetting of dis played advertisements requiring large sizes of letter is made from monotype casters the whole of the spacing material is also monotype cast the leads and rules are cast on the elrod machine but the traditional brass rules are stil pre ferred for separating the columns the large handcomposing department  case room is the old trade term has been furnished in metal by stephenson blake and cothe type of the times is never worn the linotypes intertypes and monotypes maintain an incessant supply of newly cast letters for the composition of the text the headlines the market quotations the prospectuses and the rest the design of the text type was created in printing house square for the specific use of the times after an immense amount of experimental work the journal deter mined to ease the act of reading the tiunes by designing and cutting an entirely new fount of typesuch iuustrations as are required for each page are photographed and made into halftone blocks in which tones of light and shade are created by minute dots chemically etched on the face of zinc sheets the camera apparatus lamps coating machine and other mechanical features of the newly equipped process department supplied by hunterpenrose limited and sidney r littlejohn and co limited set a new standard of accuracy in reproduction for highspeed news printingthus all routines of all departments interlock and converge upon the zero hour of going to press before the mechanical operations can begin the creed machines must have tapped out their news and the whole complex of newsgathering editorial writing and advertisementreception has preceded the selective and directive task of subeditors departmental editors and the general editorial control hence precision speed and quick intercommunication are vital at each stage and even afterthe con tinuous webs of printed paper have been slit and folded and the counted quires of copies emerge improved methods of carrying have been initiated in the new building the smith autodelivery elevator eliminates many chances of accident and the new lamson equipment in the publish ing room ensures instant controlled de livery to the waiting vans the contents bills which must go along with the copies to every newsvendor are worked off at the rate of  an hour on victorykidder and foster machinesordered speedan inspection of the mechanical typo graphical foundry and dispatching departments will reveal to the technician many unprecedented developments in speeding the news they cannot be adequately described to him in this brief account to the lay visitor the lasting impression consists chiefly in the ease and quietness brought about by the organiza tion of human and mechanical efficiency by releasing the human workers from con gestion strain and distraction the con ventional image of hurlyburly in news paper production gives way in the lay mans as also in the specialists mind to an image of scientific planned speed thus the new printing office represents the latest mechanical word in methods of organizing and disseminating the radio graphed telegraphed typed and written word of letters news and views which day and night and all over the world are addressed to the editor of the tines printing house square londona view of the machine room of the times showing part of a line of units with on the left the
