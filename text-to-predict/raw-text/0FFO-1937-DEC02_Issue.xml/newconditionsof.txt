new conditionsof farmingeffect of foreigncompetitionlabour difficultiesevidence about the present position of agriculture in england and wales and the way in which it is affected by centres of population and other factors of modern life was yesterday submitted by the ministry of agriculture to the royal com mission on the geographical distribution of the industrial population sitting at the institution of civil engineers west minster sir donald fergusson perma nent secretary of the ministry of agri culture and fisheries and mr r r enfield assistant secretary economics intelligence division attended as witnessesin the written memorandum of evidence submitted which was read by sir donaid fergusson it was stated that particular types of farming were subject to localizing influences comparable in a broad way with those affect ing other industries but agriculture in one form or another covered practically the whole of the land of the country that was not either useless or appropriated for some other pur pose of a total land area in england and wales of  acres  acres were devoted to agricultural uses the census of  returned  persons as engaged in agriculture while the value of the agricul tural and horticultural produce sold for the use of the nonfarming community or con sumned in farm households was estimated to have amounted in the agricultural year  to Â£ such a figure did not repre sent the net value of agricultural production since there was no allowance made for im ported store animals and feedingstuffs for fertilizers and other materials but it did form a basis for comparison purposes betweea the united kingdom australia new zealand and canadasuch a comparison could not be precise for the figures obtained differed from country to country but it seemed safe to conclude that the importance of the united kingdom as an agricultural producer was equal to or greater than that of canada and considerably greater than that of australia or new zealandland lost to agriculture as to the land lost to agriculture it was estimated that the net loss through building development was on an average  acres per annumanswering questions by sir montague barlow chairman of the commission as to the effect of mechanization and competition from abroad on farming sir donald fergusson said that owing to the depression of  the exporting agricultural countries were obliged to reduce very substantially their costs of production and they had therefore become to that extent more formidable competitorsthe depression and consequent competition had without doubt had their effect on english farmers and had made them consider how to run their farms with less labour to reduce their costs and there had therefore been the growth of mechanization in this country and the transfer of land from arable cultivation to dairying and grass farniing another im portant factor in recent years was the im provement in industrial prosperity in this country which had kd to labour formerly availabe on farms seeking employment in industrymr r r enfield added to this that mechanization had been the consequence rather than the cause of the shortage of labour in agriculture but there were also a great many other factors which had had their partanswering questiong by sir francis joseph mr enfteld said there was no country where under the pressure of economic conditions the farmer had paid more attention to the efficient working of his farm than in englandthe effect of industry on agricultural land was referred to at some length in the memorandum both in so far as it caused a drift of labour to the towns and its practical occupation of usable agricultural landrecovery of mineralsmembers of the commission asked as to the effect of the recovery of ironstone deposits from the surface and sir donald fergusson said that at the ministry they regarded that matter as serious formerly such recovery did not matter very much for there were provisions for the replacing of the top soil under modern conditions however machinery capable of scooping out the ironstone to a depth of ft was used in this method the top soil was lost the subsoil brought to the surface and a barren crater ft deep was left which would never be of use for any purpose such craters gradually filled with water there was in that way a gradual lossof something like  acres of usable land a year in the midland counties of england from oxford northwardssumming up the various factors at work on agriculture and dealing with land taken for building the memorandum stated that the incentive to economise space was naturally strongest where the land was highly valuable for that reason buildings were likely to be more compact and he use of land generally less lavish in urban than in country districts it would seem a fair inference therefore that industrial development was least harmful to agriculture when it occurred on the outskirts of moderatesized industrial towns particularly where the surrounding land was not of the best quality the establishment of new indus tries in the heart of a rural district on the other hand was likely to cause the maximum disturbance and disadvantage to agriculture particularly if the land was of good quality not merely would the new industrial buildings themselves tend to be spread over a wider area but further withdrawal of land was likely to be required for new roads and for the expansion of public scrvices the problem of rural housing also would be aggravated the movement of skilled agricultural workers into other employment would deprive agricul ture of one of its most valuable assets and the whole character of rural life might be profoundly disturbedthe sitting of the commission was adjourned till today
