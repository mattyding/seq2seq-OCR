i house of commonswednesday dec thc speaker took thc chair at a quartcr to i  oclockfinger prints onpassports insurmountabledifficulties mr de la bere evesham u asked the secretary of state for foreign affairs whether he would consider bringing in regulations as regarded stamping on passports alongside the signature the print of the right thumb of theholder of the passport solely for the purpose of identification when travelling abroadmr eden warwick and leamington u apart from the objection which exists in the minds of the public to any requirement of finger prints there are many insurmountable difficulties in the way of the adoption of such a system and i am not convinced that any substantial public benefit would accrue from its adoption hear hearmr de la bereis my right hon friend aware that at the international police con vention held at copenhagen it was urged that all passports should bear fingerprints with a view to preventing fraud with passports and that it is only prejudice that stands in the way of a practice which would prove to be a very sound one mr edeni am obliged to my hon friend for that information i did not know about that but i think that life is complicated enough already hear heargermany and coloniesmr mander wolverhampton e l asked the secretary of state for foreign affairs whether he would consider the advisability of making it clar to the german government that under no circumstances would the former german colonies be returned in full sovereignty to germany and that no possi bility existed of disctssion of the extension of tbe mandates system and internationalization of colonial administration except as part of a final settlement which would involve the return of germany to full cooperation with the league of nations and the putting into opera tion of a disarmament convention under international supervisionmr mander also asked whether the right hon gentleman would consider the advisability in connexion with a general settlement including the return of germany to full cooperation with the league of nations and the putting into force a dis armament convention with international in spection of proposing that colonyowning nations such as great britain belgium france holland portugal and italy should place their colonies under mandate from the league of nations and introduce the principle of international administration with a view to depriving those countries without colonies such as germany and poland of tfie grievances at present existingmr edeni have nothing to add to previous statements on this subject made on behalf of his majestys governmentmr manderwill my right hon friend be good enough to consider these txvo ques tions as a contribution towards the study of the problem sir h page croft bournemouth u is the foreign secretary aware that the mere fact that such questions are tabled suggesting the giving away of any part of the british colonial empire is resented in every part of the empire mr shinwell scaham labwill the right hon gentleman bear in mind that the policy of his majestys government still remains somewhat ambiguous lthe social services to be increased proportionately  regard must be had to the finan cial obligations of the country as a whole in considering this question today the social services cost £ many millions mnore than had been spent by any previous admninistration in the past the labour party had been unable to face the charge they were now asking the goverrnent to face and they never had to meet the present heavy defence expenditure the amendment faced reality the national government had given abundant proof of its will to maintain and extend the pensions scheme as well as the other social services to maintain and extend them however they must rest on the basis of sound finance without which the whole structure would crumble ministerial cheersmr dalton said that to the question whether the government proposed to do any thing to improve the conditions of the old people the answer was short it was  no they had had it from the financial secretary in the speech just delivered and they had had it from the prime minister at scarborough the choice before the country was the scheme now proposed or nothing at all and they would prefer the scheme to nothing the proposal submitted would raise the standard of living of the aged people from a condition of poverty and semistarvation to one of reason able comfortthe motion was negatived by  votes to majority  it being after halfpast  oclock the debate on the amendment under the rules of the house was automatically adjournedempire exhiition atglasgowobjection to drink barson the order for the second reading of the empire exhibition scotland order con firmation billmr johnston stirling and clack mannan w lab moved the following amendmentthat this house cannot consent to the second readinr of a bill which confirms a provisional order setting aside the law zoverning the sale of excisable liquors in scotland and which is contrary to the declared wishes of the inhabilants in the area affected by the orderhe said that whatever their views were on that particular bill hon members in all parts of the house wished great success and prosperity to the exhibition they paid a tribute to the enthusiasm and public spirit of the promoters however much they might dis agree with them in the proposal they sought to further in that billthe commission of inquiry acted to the best of its judgment and gave its verdict with good intention and every desire to serve the public interest many hon members had profound misgivings about the bill and it was their duty to state them in that high court of parliament he would make no aspersions on the bonafides of anyone who differed from his point of view he had to complain that no copy of the evidence laid before the commission was made available in the library of the house the house was called upon to take a decision of considerable importance to override a public general act of parlia ment but printed copies of the evidence in question could not be obtainedafter stating that he had been able to examine the evidence  clandestinely the right hon gentleman said that they protested against a form of public business which prevented members who had to cast their votes from seeing the evidence upon which the comnmis sion came to its decision he believed that the opponents of the measure could not see the printed copy of the evidence unless they were prepared to share the cost which he believed totalled £ it was a prohibitive charge £ before they were permitted to see the evidence laid before the commission which was appointed by the house parliament ought to be in possession of the necessary datareplying to an interruption by mr elliot secretary of state for scotland glasgow kel vingrove u the right hon gentleman said that he was making a reflection on the proce dure of the housescottish temperanceviewthis was not a discussion on total abstinence or on american or any other form of prohibition there were already granted eight restaurant licences to the promoters of the exhibition six of which had been handed over to one individual another restaurant licence for the employees of the exhibition was turned down by the magistratesat the beginning of this business the temper ance party in scotland did not object to restaurant licences being granted to the exhibi tion with a great display of worldly wisdom they decided that they would not oppose them but the exhibition authorities were not satisfied with that and promoted the provisional order whereby publichouse licences might be granted within the confines of the exhibition the temperance party of scotland took the view that so long as the fundamental structure of the scottish temperance act was not destroyed they were not going to try to  crab  the exhibition by opposing restaurant licences but the exhibition authorities not even satis fied with coming to the house with this request for publichouse licences apparently intended also to inaugurate club licences within the exhibition which would not require the consent of a magistrate but could be granted by a sheriffit had been said that these licences were necessary for the success of the exhibition and that the poor could not purchase a meal or a sandwich yet every direct representative of the organized working classes in scotland rcpresented on those benchesevery one with out exception total abstainers and nontotal abstainershad signed the opposition on the order paper to the measure now being brought before the high court of parliamentrights of citizensthe electors in this district had on three occasions decided by growing majorities under the scottishtemperance act to have no public house licences in their area this provisional order if agreed to would be an invasion of the statutory rights of the citizens they were told that they must surrender those rights to a wider national interest but the onus of proof of that rested on those who made the assertion there was no evidence to suggest that the presence or absence of licences was responsible for the success or failure of any exhibition in the pastcrystal palace andwembleythe crystal palace exhibition in  at which there were no drinking facilities had a surplus of £ the wembley exhibition where there were  licences resulted in £ having to be found by the govern ment and private guarantorsmr macquisten argyll uthe government would get their money back in the duty on drink laughtermr johnston said that nobody had proved it was essential that the exhibition at glasgow must have drinking bars or it would be a financial failure the glasgow east end industrial exhibition of  was such a success without liquoralthough a great struggle was made to get licencestbat it laid the founda tions of the peoples palace on glasgow green the  wet  exhibition in glasgow in  went out in a wild and drunken riot on the last nightmr macquistenno i was there loud laughtermr johnstoni havc press cuttings to prove my statementif it was granted that there should be bars the right hon gentleman continued why should the profits not go to the municipal treasury and the licences be under public ownership and control instead of being handed over to a private monopoly the exhibition was intended inter alia to promote the cultural development of scotland was the culture to be preserved that of the perpendicular drinking bar  was that to be exhibited to the world  it was a culture that should be got rid of at the earuiest possible momentthe motorist who took alcohol without food was a public menace if this proposal was carried he could not believe that it would be by scottish votes why should the house perpetuate outmoded habits and customswhich were repugnant to the majority of scottish folk  why should the lives of their citizens be endangered there was no intention to crab the exhibi tion or to prevent reasonable facilities for those who desired liquid refreshment with their food but they objected to private drinking bars and the ovcrriding of a public general licence by a private group of citizenswitnesses before thecommissioncatering for all tastessir s chapman edinburgh s u said that he was chairman of the parlia mentary commission which recommended the provisional order and he made a point of undertaking the work with a completely open mind this bill was not promoted by a company seeking private profit or by men of straw who were unknown in scotland it was promoted by the economic committee of the scottish development council on which were many of the most eminent and distinguished min in scotland representing industry finance transport travel and labour the chairman of the exhibition mr cecil weir had said in evidence before the commission jhat he believed it would lead to the better conduct of the exhibition to have these facilities inside the exhibition and that there was far more prospect of disorder and misconduct if no such facilities existedanother witness who gave evidence in favour of the proposal was the scottish secre tary of the railway clerks association who was also treasurer of the general council of the trades union congress he expressed the view that the exhibition would be a meeting place of people from all parts of the british isles and that it would be unreasonable unless these people were permitted to exchange hospitable greetings over a social glass of beer a lady a justice of the peace for the city of glasgow and an organizer of the trans port and general workers union stated that in her view as this was not a local but an empire exhibition they must cater for all the tastes of the people who attended and for that reason she supported the application for the orderthe commission had to look at this matter from a commonsense point of view and they asked the promoters of the order how it was that they had not tried to overturn the vote which had taken place and made pollock shields a dry area the reply was that if thev had taken a vote they might have reversed the decision of the district and that it was out of regard for the voters that they did not take that course these were the people who were running the national development of dear old scotland and the commission did not see why a small space should not be allowed to be wetmr barr cqatbridge lab said that it might be said that national or intemational rights might overrule local privileges but it should be done by the ordinary procedure pro vided by parliament the act of  allowed licensed restaurants but all through the pas sage of that legislation there was opposition to the drinking barmr henderson stewvart fife e lnat said that he not only supported but practised temperance as faithfully as any member of the house as a member of the management committee of the exhibition if he thought there was going to be any use of the exhibition to boost the drink trade he would resign at once every member of the com mittee was strongly of the view that temper ance must mark strongly every day of the exhibitionhere was a great imperial demonstration the greatest exhibition in the world since wembley for six months it would be the commercial centre of the british empire they would be hosts to people of all countries that was not the occasion for imposing nigglng restrictions hear hear surely because  people  years ago voted one way the exhibition authorities were not to be prevented from extending no more than ordinary refreshment facilities to the visitors of the world if the exhibition was being held anywhere else in glasgow or scotland the conflict would not have arisenposition of englishmembersmr magnay gateshead lnat said that it would be a step in the direction of scottish home rule if all english members abstainedmr westwood stirling and falkirk lab said that there was power under the scottish temperance act to provide everything that was being asked for nowthe petition against the order was based solely on the right or otherwise of a private bill to take away public rights granted by an act of parliament it was not a question of temperancemr elliots advfcemr elliot said that there was nothing unusual undemocratic or blameworthy in an order seeking to set aside the law governing the sale of exciseable liquors in scotland it was said that the order was contrary to the declared wishes of the inhabitants of the area but it could not reasonably be said that in  they contemplated that £ worth of public buildings would be put up in bella houston park for six months this was an exceptional temporary and unique position it was highly undesirable having regard to the generally accepted practice in connexion with scottish provisional orders that a decision should be taken which would inevitably entail implied censure on the commissionthe house would be illadvised to turn down this order and thereby cause great con gestion in the publichoutes which existed and would continue to existwhatever the house didwithin a stones throw of the doors of the exhibition within  yards of the gates of the exhibition there were publichouses and it was most inadvisable that the whole weight of the tourist traffic which desired a drink should be concentrated itieremr messer tottenham s lab what a drunken lot you qre expecting mr davidson glasgow maryhill lab said that quite close to bellahouston park there were big housing estates where hundreds of thousands of people lived and those people did not want to have publichouses on their doorstepsir a sinclair caithness and suther land l said the proposals of the bill were depriving the electors in scotland of the rights which had been deliberately conferred upon them by parliamentsir j gilmour glasgow pollok u said he believed that this was no real infringe ment of the rights of individuals when the exhibition closed their area would remain dry until they voted it otherwise he urged the house to vote for the order and he hoped that there would be no lack of good will to detract from the success of the exhibitionmr maxton glasgow bridgeton tlp said that this matter had aroused a large controversy in the west of scotland about a relatively trivial issue he and his friends strongly held the view that glasgow had greater needs in other directions than the expenditure of £ on erecting this great fun fair glasgow needed £ worth of houses if the energy enthusiasm and patriotism voiced in all quarters of the house in this debate had been directed to making glasgow a fine city to show to visitors from the empire and elsewhere it would have been something worth doing an exhibition with or without licences in glasgow at present was just a waste of time and monev and enthusiasm he was so much against the whole exhibition that he refused to cast his vote one way or the otherthe motion for rejection was negatived by  votes to majority  and the bill was read a second timethe house adjourned at  minutes past  oclockparliamentary noticeshouse of
