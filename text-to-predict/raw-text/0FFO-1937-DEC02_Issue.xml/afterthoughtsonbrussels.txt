afterthoughts onbrusselsthe duces outburstfrom our own correspondentrome dec the italian editorial silence of the last three weeks on the larger aspects of inter national relations was broken today by the popolo dltalia with a resounding unsigned article by signor mussolini on the failure of the brussels conferencethe articleas is usual in the case of the duces contributions to journalism was widely advertised before publication by posters and on the wireless it is sarcastic about the patent inability of the powers which promoted the conference to do anything to stop jatn in chinacollective action it says registered at brtissels a failure which amounts to afiasco and the italians would be hypocrites if they did not note the event with satisfaction the article adds hat it would have been absurd to believe that anything would be done at brussels with germany and janan absent nothing had come of the intervention of the united states and mr norman davis would now be con vinced that no conference the uselessness of which would be clear to a child should ever be called words of sympathy would not help the chinese or stop the japanesetne united states france and great britain either separately or together it is asserted are powerless in the far east the only menace is represented by russia which  cannot play without a mortal danger for her internal situation the card of war for china still to believe in any sort of help of a collec tive character meant that she would commit suicide it was clear that japan would win all the battles and force china to surrender china could only ask for peacehumanitarian spinsters japan writes the duce is changing the map of the far east    it may not please the humanitarian spinsters but it is common knowledge that the cannon which thunders in the far east will make itself heard much more than all the present and future resolutions of geneva or of any other placeone can only guess at the motives which prompted the penning of this article newspaper comment on the brussels conference coming days after the close of the discussions is distinctly out of date the conference would seem to have been simply taken as a peg on which to hang ridicule of the ineffective pratings of the  democracies  and glorification of military power and direct action it is as if signor mussolini realizing that the conversations at bcrchtesgaden and in london were to be the prelude to further consultations with other governments had decided that this sounded much too like a revival of the league of nations and that something must be done to remind the world that guns and fleets and not the talk of diplomats are what really matter
