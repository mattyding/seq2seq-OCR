advised a moderate increase upon the scale recommended by the council as being no real hardshaip on the payer and as being if adopted of vital importance to the ulniversityr raby of st johns took the same view and thought it wrong to hesitate about a small sum on one side or the otherthe master of st johns said it would much assist the deliberation of the council if the senate would intimate what they thought rightit being proposed to charge  to the university chest to al who proceed to the degrees of dd and lld professor selwyn most energetically contended for a sum of  guineas instead and he held up a cale elaborately drawn showing the inequality in the charge as compared with other degrees which created some amusement he insisted though it was stated that the same degrees at oxford paid the sum of  that it would prevent poor men from proceeding to the degree of dd and so operatehe was replied to by the mfaster of st johns mr c c babington and hmr campion of queensthe scheme proposes to confer degrees upon members of the ujniversity in their absence which will be a great con venience to those absent in the colonies
