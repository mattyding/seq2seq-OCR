of linerick dromises to be as hotly contested as though the winner were qluite certain of a five years lease of the seat the writ is hourly expected from the htanaperoffice and it is believed that the

from a lay quarts which may be fairly set off against the spiritualwsstance promised to mlr john brall following in a measure the tactics of the late electorgeneral for ireland mr smith obrien has just issued a manifesto favourable to the claim of mr spaight and as the latter is warmly supported by a large number of the roman catholic priests it would be strange indeed if the coming struggle should not be a close one in mir obriens letter to his  dear spaight the former thus states the case for the protestant candidate i have no desire to say anything that can offend fr ball or his friends but it is well known that he comes for ward as an adherent of the whigs and that he is an ex pectant of place under that party to me it seems that the interests of such a city as limerick ought to be con fided to the guardianship of representatives who are uite independent of all connexion with english parties it is perhaps unfortunate that in case yogl shall be returnedu us  ininuetis lur lmernck wiu ue rrotestants itis extremely natural that the catholics of limerick who constitute an immense majority of the population shoulad desire to be represented by at least one roman catholic  but on the other hand we have seen during the last  years that many measures which have been most disparaing and insulting to the catholic community have been supported by catholic members of parliament while they have been opposed by liberal protestants acting as representatives of a catholic population it is i think highly honourable to the roman catholic clergy of limerick that many of them have in your case given practical evidence that religious bigotry does not operate to prevent them from choosing a protestant ajhom they consider to be disposed to protect equally the rights of all classes of the population when i was member for the county of limenck i was in ke manner supportedby the roman catholic clergy vrith quite as much zeal s could have been sbown by them towards me in case i had been a roman catholic by none was this liberality of sentiment more kindly evinced than by my revered friend the roman catholic bishop of limerick i have myself no vote in the city of limerick but there are eight or nme voters on our property at lickadoon i have already intimated to them that i shall never attempt to coerce them to vote contrary to their consciences or even their inclinations but in case they be desirous to know my opinion with respect to your claims you are at liberty to show to them this letterthe pirce of wamseis royal highness has just forwarded a dona

political idols in its number of yesterday there is an angry diatribe in the course of which the writer after taxing lord derby with becoming the champion of popery and the patron of the ancient traditional policy of the brrish government in india turns round upon another late member of the cabinet in these termswe have read ith intense disgust the reply of lord eenboronghtothepetition ofthevarious religious societies respecting the government of india nor was this all lord ellenborough proceeded to condemn in unmistakeable language the conduct of lord cannig who when he became goverorgeneral did not forget that he was a christian and subscribed to the funds of the church ris sionarysociety the result of such conduct said lord ellenborough  would be the greatest danger to our interests in india p so we have got a key to the principles of lord derbys government ireland is to be overned according to traditional policy india is to be ruled upon traditional olicy it might have been imagined that one who ap d insuch solemn and eloquent termsto god for flis guidance and thai blessing wrould have moade some attempt to govern according to the word of god it might have been

secretaries to a movement at present in progress for effecting certain reformations in the rniversity the nature of which will be found embodied in the circular the present circumstances of the university of dublin and the announcement of mwr faggans motion with respect to it appear to us to call for some degree of watchfulness on the part of the clergy and electors it seems to us most desirable that there shonld be some external expression of opinion and that a committee should be formed for the ypurmose of securing that the changes which are now mietable and which are uon questionablybeyondthe copoe of the approaching visita tion should be such as would harmonize with the interests of both the university and the church as a basis for such a committee to act on we submit the following propositions toyour consideration should they meet your approval we earnestly request your counsel and cooperation in order that our measures may be matured before the motion is brought forward in the house lst that the doctors and masters of trinity col e dublin be put on the same footing with respect to university rivileges as the doctors and masters of oxford and cadbridge
