only arrived at the th of may accounts had been furnished which were so far satisfactory that the assignees were willing that the bankrupts should now pass their examination for this ithey were indebted to the counrse taken by the official assignee mr edwards who had taken the trouble to institute an inquiry out of court into all matters of account wherever inquiry appeared necessary requisitions had been tendered and had been answered the information thus obtained would enable every creditor to obtain every possibleinformation that could be requiredmr welch for the assignees said the case had excited reat local interest and in consequence of the great faci lities afforded by the official assignee he did not consider it necessary to examine the bankrupts today so far as figares were concerned it was not proposed to question the bankrupts accounts and he was willng that the bank rupts should pass all questions of conduct being re served for the certificate meeting there were several alleged cases of preference which so far as their informa tion went had been voluntary and not under any pressure these cases would require investigation and a private sit ting would be necessary for thatpurpose the great object of the assignees was to get as much as they could for the unfortunate creditors and at the certificate meeting such observations would be fearlessly made as

preferencesr welchthat is somr linklater who appeared for snow said the bank rapts would place themselves entirely at the service of the assignees every inquiry could thus be freely institutedthe bankrupts then passed and the certificate mneeting wil be held en the th of june at the present calculation is that the estate will pay s d in the pound in june and a further dividend of about s d m the pound at a more remote period the latter depending upon the expected setting aside of some of the alleged preferencesbefore mr commissioner evansin re ihe metropoltan saloon owmnus compayamnndthis
