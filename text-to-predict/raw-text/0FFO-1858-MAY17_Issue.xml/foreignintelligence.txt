in the habit lately of publish mgarticles with intelligence about indian affairs which to all appearance is derived from official quarters a good deal of this has turned out untrue butthe whole is generally marked by a most unfriendly spirit this intelligence is very probably supplied from the french foreignoffice today this wellinformed government print tells us with thinlydisguised satisfaction that the suc cesses of  sir campbell are changed into reverses that the taking of lucknow is only a burden that the english army isi decimated by war and especially by sickness that  sir campbell is isolated lost in a hosile country ever beating and seeing his soldiers perish in proportion as the enemy increase that the recruiting for india is null that the men who elist do so on condition of not being sent out to india that the recruits are only em ployed to fill up the places left vacant by the troops aent out that even these places are not filled up that the army at home is diminishing day after day that mautiny has brokenout on divers points of the march to india and that the greatest part gf the mutinous soldiers have refused to continue their route thepaysfurther statesthat fromprivateinfor mationuseful it says to publish at a moment when the existence of the derby cabinet is menaced for having done a political act the despatch of lord ellenborough courageously and loyallyit is en abled to inform its readers that after the sack of lucknow disputes arose between the english and the ghoorkas about the booty  that serious conflicts ensued which would have grown into a regular fight between the englishandtheirallie if the general inchief had not sent away the soldiers who took part in these quarrels by incorporating them in the movable columns he was sending to rohilcund where the insurrection is more intense than ever that the excesses committed during the pillage of lucknow were followed by increased sickness in the army and that up to the th of april the principal quarter of the city was one vast military hospital iastly we have the comfortable assurance that the war in oude is far from being terminated that the severe weather has set in that the heat would soon be more terrible and that the difficulty of the operations of the english will be enormously increased whereas the natives who are accustomed to the climate will not be affected by it the pays whilersketching in the most sombre coloursmour present position and faithfully following the hints of its informants or inspirers allows not a ray of hope to rest on the dismal picture of our distrses the pays has a perfect right to give the information supplied to it and to take its own views of our condition in india i do not refer to it merely on account of this but to point out the fact that vhile it thus exhales the malevolent spirit of its patrons it denounces at the same moment the british parliament for presuming to censure lord derbys government which is the only government the pays and its inspirers seem disposed to regard with favour the cause of all this is of course the detestable parliamentary systemwhichprevails in englanld  whst is the opinion of parliament on the proclamation of lordcanning  it is difficult to know amid a series of i strange and confused facts and of miserable i subtleties to which the quaiessential practice of the parliamentary rdgirnw gives place whether we at last succeed in getting out of our troubles in india or whether as one would suspect the pays beeeves we are doomed to perdition one great fact is undeninblenamely that if the british parliament censure lord derbys government and force it to retire the british parliament must never look the ministerial pays in the face again much less ever hope for forgivenessgovernment influence is now directed to insure the defeat of m migeon who having completed his term of imprisonment has again come forward as a candidate for belfort in the department of the hautrhin the local journals under the control of the prefect have declared in an unmistakeable manner that m migeon is not the person for whom the electors are expected to vote and as if that functionarys authority were not sufficient the minister of the interior himself has announced his will to them the alsacien newspaper publishes the following letter written in replyto an old mili tary friend who asked his former commanding officer what way he should vote ministry of the interior paris april my dear kollit is the emperor himself who has de signed m keller haas for the electors of the hautrhin this year as last year attempts are made to deceive the electors theemperor reigns and governsnothing good is done in france without his consent and if he had preferred m mligeon the administration ocal authorities wouldnot have been permitted to patron ize any other candidate i authorize youto show my letterto your brave fellow citizens athousand compliments espinassethe aidedecamp minister of the interior has at all events the merit of frankness in what hedoes he intimates his will very unnistakeably just as if he dictated a brigade or general order to his troops with this letter and the exertions of the prefect of the department i shoulld like to see what elector will have the audacity to vote for m migeon this offhand manner of doing things will not how ever preventtheministerial journls  from eulogoizing the complete freedom of french elections and the superiority of universal sufinage aspractised under the french empire over the english systemthe irritation of the government at the defeat it has suffered so lately in parisis very great nothing will be left undone to prevent anether vexation of the kind in alsace and m migeon will be fool hardy indeed to think of facinig such formidable opponents as the minister and the prefectthe uniivers too issues its orders to the clergy on the same subject it comes to the assistance of the minister and warmly recommends the opponent of m miigeon who it says has thought proper to present himself again notwithstanding the prosecu tion against him which occasioned his resigning the government brings forward m kellerhaas and the catholics must support him the univers admits the services to the department rendered by m migeon but these are not enough to recom mend a deputy m keller only and not m aligeon can now represent and defend catholic in terests m migeons fate is decidedthe moniteur contains the following article on the financial state of the country in the month of october last the manister of finance in depicting the financial situation proved by facts and by genuie results that since  inclusive the dcouverts of the budgets had ceased to increase that the floating debt would in a short time be reduced to the moderate figure of about f that the grand livre of thepublic debt might be closed that in all probability the budget of  would be balanced equally that moreoverthemostprudent calculations justified the anticipation of a surplus for  of f of which f might be applied to the sinking fund which had given no signs of vitality since  this flipancial review created general satisfac tion in france nevertheless the public at home andabroad had been so often told of pretended difficulties experienced by the treasury in collecting the subscriptions to its loans of their insufficiency to extinguish the expenditure of the war and other extraordinary expenses created by public calamities of the everincreasingdeficiencies and of the enormous extent of the floating debt that these ideas in spite of their falseness and exaggeration finished by the obstinacy with which they were repeated in assuming to certain minds an appearance of truth all the figures which served as a basis to the calculations of the minister of finance have now passed through the triple iriai of the examination of the council of state and of the commission on the budget and of the discussion and vote in the legislative corps this examination lasted over five months the investigations were extended to every thing connected with the financial situation the past pre sent and future of our finances were scrutimnizea with atten tionby themostenlightened and competent authorities a summary of the results of this long elaboration wil not be without interest in all that concerns the past it is be yond doubt that the treasury thanks to the loans which were paid up with an admirable punctuality thauks to the increase of the indirect revenue and in spite of the enor mous burden imposed on it often unexpectedly by war famine cholera and inundations was always enabled to meet completely and punctuarly all expected or unexpected ordinary or extraordinary expenses and that in definitive the ddceuuerts of the budgets have not since the close of the budget of  been increased by a single centime that on the contrary asumof f availablefrom thebalance of theloans hasbeen assigned byabiulrecentlyvotedto new works againstinundations everythinginfact encourages the hope that the above balance will be more considerable ar d wil supply funds for the war in china it is more over admitted that the dcouverts which had attained a sum of fwillbe shortlyreduced bymeansof the measures prepared by government and without a shock to of and later by means of reimbursement to the bank to f this liquidation of the past will gra dually reduce the floating debt and particularly the trea sury bonds to about their normal limits the budget of  has up to the present moment worked in the most satisfactory manner the administration reaps the fruits of the moderation with which it had calculated the revenue this is proved by documents submit ted to the legislative corps respecting the amount of in direct taxes collected during the first two months of the year the results obtained in march and april are not less favourable the four months united offer an increase of f over the corresponding period of  but as the receipts of  have been calculated according to the amounts realized in  the plus value is about f which will be added to the f of sur plus applied by the budget to meet the supplementary credits only more or less approximate conjectures can be made with respect to the months still to run but it is undeniable in presence of the results ob tained that the equilibrium hoped for in the present year gais daily a more certain character government with a view to the future had to reflect whether after having stayed the progress of dcouverts insured their reduction and balanced with care the wants and resources of  it should confine itself to endowing  with the same ad vantages or whether it should not apply all its efforts to a still greater improvement by seeking to obtain a surplus of revenue of sufficient importance to restore activity to the sinking fund in order to ascertain if the ques tion has been solved in this favourable sense it is neces sary to put aside au theoretical definitions which par ticularly on such subjects may be misinterpreted and may mislead public opinion it is by diving into the groundwork of the question and by consulting undoubted facts and figures that an exact idea may be formed of thedistinctive character of the budget of  the sinkng fund since  has been a dead letter and the ordinary budgets often exhibited considerable deficits the budget of  will on the contrary present the following results ordinary receipts f ordinary ex penditure f surplus f it is this perfectly correct surplus that will providefor extraordinary works f for the transformation of the fleet ooof for the sinking fund ooof over and above these extraordinary grants there will re main in hand ooof the commission on the budget has declared that by means of these grants the ordinary services have been liberally provided for while a probability exists that the receipts will exceed the sum calculated it cannot be deniedthat the budget of  villproviding the reasonable anticipations of government berealizeddomore than balance itself in its ordinary elements forafter having provided the funds for extraordinary works and for the transformation of the fleet it will be enabled to contribute cooooof towards the extinction of debts created by former budgets these are positive consequences which no discussion has been able to destroy for the cilculations on which they are founded have been preparedby government verified by the council of state approved by the commis sion on the budget and sanctioned by law there is therefore nothing toretrenchorto modify in the financial cpoi of the month of october the commission on the budget while recognizing with government the necessity of per severing in the path of improvement and of restoring as speedily as possible by means of pradent economy healthy action to the sinking fund has taken cae to dweeu on theprogrems already accomplished it has acted well for
