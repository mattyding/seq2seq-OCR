fpatal sifirw a on te irish coasa correspondent writing from dandalk thus refers toa lamentable wreck with the loss of  livesit is my sad duty to record one of the most distressing shipwrecks attended with loss of life which have ever occurred in our bay during the recent heavy gale which visited the irish coast the bark mary stoddart got embayed in dundalk bay and dragged both her anchors she went ashore on the south ball where she lay broadside on to the sea which made a complete breach over her on hearing the news i took a car and proceeded to the blackrock on the opposite side of the town where i could clearly see her crew clinging to the rigging it was blowing at the time a complete gale of wind from the se to which our bay is all open with a heavy sea running i mustered two boats crews of hardy willing fellows to attempt the rescue of the p oor men i took charge of one of them myself and both boats proceeded out in the teeth of as heavy a gale as ever blew on this coast the boats were only common open yawls eachmanned by six men they manfully pulled through the heavy breakers for nearly three miles and within a short distance of the unfortunate men but to our great grief we were compelled to put back as the sea was now actuauy running mountains high and both crews were completely prostrated and exhausted and were hardly able to keep the boats from filling captain joseph kelly of the steamer pride of erin also manned and commanded another yawl but like us he was obliged to return unsuccessful to the shore by this time a steamers lifeboat arrived on the spot but she was of no more service than an ordinary boat and was com pelled to return to the shore indeed ib is to be feared that of what are called ships lifeboats few are deserving of that name we au now returned to town almost broken hearted compeled to leave the poor fellows to spend an awful night in that cold icy riggng a meeting of the inhabitants was immediately convened and three of the most experienced master mariners nobly volunteered to take command of three more ships lifeboats with a picked crew in each captain kelly again readily consented to take off one of the boats the oatspulledout of our river through as heavy a sea as ever men contended with two of the boats succeeded in getting nearly alongside the ship when poor captain kerys boat was overwhelmed with a heavy sea and went down stern foremost captain hlynds boat being nearly  yards off pulled up from the wreck dashed through the foaming breakers and succeeded in picking up all kellys men but the noble man himself had sunk to rise no more exclaiming as he went down lord have mercy on me farewell boys take care of yourselves a hraver man never breathed he had on many previous occa sions risked his lfe to save a felowcreature three of his crew soon died in the boat from cold and exhaustion one left a widow and si orphans a second his widowed mother a sister and two little children and a third an aged father and mother and two sisters to mourn his loss captain keuy was unmarried but has left a widowed mother to lament the loss of an affectionate son the other boat retmrned to the shore com pelled to leave again unaided the shipwrecked crew to their fate the new lifeboat of the royal national life boat institution at drogheda which is about  miles off was about to be sent for the next morning when to oureat joy we perceived a boat commanded by mr robert bhankey of the coastgaard which had left the north side of the bay and was seen struggling nobly with the foaming waves to gain the illfated bark which was now on her beam ends her mainmast having been cut away and her unhappy crew stil in the rigging the boat succeeded on the first trip in taking off seven of the crew who were brought on shore more dead than alive not one of them having had any food for three days the boat again com m anded byl the brave shankey returned on her errand of mercy and succeeded in takdng off four more of the ships crew the master being the last to leave his illfatedvessel seven of his crew had perished on board the bark on shore every attention was paid to the shipwrecked men by theagent to the shipwrecked fishermen and mariners society it should be stated that  boats including shankeys had put off during this long interval with the view of rescuing the unfortunate crew and that the royal national lifeboat institution has presented its silver medal to each of the men who took charge of the boats and  in aid of the local subscriptions now raising for providing forthe families of the drowned and for rewarding the boats crews that society has also offered to station a life boat in the locality if the inhabitants wiu cooperate with it in the undertaldngadvertisementthe
