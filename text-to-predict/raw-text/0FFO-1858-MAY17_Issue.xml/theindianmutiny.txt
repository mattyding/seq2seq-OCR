draw a brief sketch of my travels and ihope the people will pay attention td what i say before the destruction of the english i went on a pil grimage to liecca and on my return i observed that the english were in a bad and hazardous position i therefore offered thanks to god because it is in my nature to follow the principles of my religion and to promulgate justice i persuaded many at delhi to raise a religions war i then hastened towards gwalior where the majority of the military officers promised to ildl the english and take up my cause a small portion of the gwalior army accom panied me i had not the least intention to announce war before i had every thing in order but the army became very enthu siasic and commenced fightingwiththe enemy the english though our army was then but a handful and that of the enemyvery large in numbers still we fought manfully and though apparently we were defeated in reality we were victorious over our enemy for we killed  of them since then i have been collecting as well as exhorting the people i have exerted myself in procuring ammunition up to this day now four months since the commencement thank god an army of  old and new men are now bound by a solemn oath to embrace my cause i have col lected considerable treasury and munitions of war in many places and in a short time i shall clear the country of all infidels since the real purpose of this war is to save zeligion let every hindoo and mussulman render assistance to the utmostthose that are old should offer their prayersthe rich but old should assist our sacred warriors with money those in perfect health as well as young should attend in personbut all those who are in the service of eitherlerza birlish kadur bahadur in lucknow and of xban baha door ehnn at bareilly should not venture out to join us for these rulers are themselves using their best endeavours to clear the country of all infidels au who join us should do so solely with a view of pro mulgating their religion not with that of worldly avarice thus victory will certainly smile upon us then distinguished posts will be conferred on the people at largo the delay in defeating the english has been caused by people killing innocent children and women without any permission whateverfrom theleaderswhose commands were not obeyedlet us all avoid such practices and then proclaini a sacred war lastly the great and small in this campaign will be equal for we are waging a religious war i the price do now proclaim a sacred war and exhort all accordig to the tenets of their religion to exert themselves the rest
