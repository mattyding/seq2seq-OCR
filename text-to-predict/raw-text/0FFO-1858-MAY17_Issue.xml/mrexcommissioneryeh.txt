mb excomssioner yehfrom our speoal colrrespondent ran nr cacalcutta abnmr let me nish what i have to say of yehno longer  air commissioner yeh for his degrada tion has come downsince i last wrote a change has come over the behaviour of our chirxse dtenu at that time he would scarcely answer a question a celebrated eastern scholar called upon him to try to learn bhuddism from him yeh would not know any thing about it mr layard tried to get him to admit that he knew of such an assembly as the british parliament or of such a thing as public opinion in england yeh knew not of such things mr layard told him that thinking he was in the right he tried to prevent the expedition to china yeh answered him only by a grunt the fat un wieldy king of oude who occupies the house immediately opposite and g rumbles all day long at being deprived of the solace of his zenana manifested a curiosity from which it seems crowvned heads are not always exempt and actually applied to the town major to have some trees cut down which intercept the view of yehs verandah the king would have caledupon the mandarin if the latter had given him the least en couragement but yeh treated all mention of him with the utmost scorn refused to believe that he ever had been a king and wouldnot look towards his dweding an englishman pointed out totyeh the minister of the king of oude ally nucky khan the talleyrand of the east he was told that this thin wily asiatic was known to have been deeply implicated in all the intrigues which preceded the late mutiny yet has trod the maze so cautiously that not a foottrace of his presence can ba found  i will make a report upon your applica tion said dr macnamara the other day in answer to nuckykhan report  said the minister with much scorn  i withdraw my application and take my advice young man never make reports never write a letter yeh however could not be interested in these black potentates lie has great contempt for us that we have left any of their heads onsuddenly however all this apathy has given way the mandarin now converses with freedom he condescends to deny all knowledge of the hong kong poisonings lie endeavours to explain away his proclamation for english heads lie expresses  a special contempt for the east india company andtheir magnates that is a very stupid man was his short observation after he had chinchined to the door of his apartment an official of high rank who had paid him a visit of ceremony it is evident that he has no talentthe change has been brought about by the cal cutta journals and the british house of commons with the desperate hope of amusing his fellow prisoner mr alabaster translated to him a few phrases from the debate upon the india bill from that moment yeh has been a transformed man he gets up early and is restless until the cazlcuttenglishman is brought he is miserable if it does not contain its usual modicum of parhiamentary elo quence his particular delight is in the speeches which are most vehement against the company he thought mr ayrton a great orator when the interpreter came to that paragraph of lord pal merstons speech wherein he says that nations have buffered much by ilconsidered changes he was much excited and said  good good good but when the translator completed the sentence  but they have suffered much more by obstinate resist ance to necessary reforms he threw himself back and grunted le was delighted to hear that lord palmerston had been turned out and he chuclded all through his great body when he heard lord derbys declaration that he hoped for a speedy peace with chinathese readings are interspersed with many expla nations and inquiries and yeh is really beginning to acquire some glimmering notion of the british constitutioni am afraid i weary your excellency says the interpreter himself weary with two hours arduous translationn no go on i understand it all now it is much better than i used to get from hiongkong i never could understand them then you did get translations at canton  of course i did from your teachers had he forgotten what he had said to mr layard upon this or was he simply indifferent to the admission of having stated an untruth yeh was never so palpably moved as by the in formation that the letter which mr oliphant delivered at soochow contained enclosures from the ambassadors of england of america and also of bussia he started and rose from his seat it was quite evident that he had some secret cause for great surprise if not for great indignation you will recollect what the chinese believed and told me as to an understanding between russia and china i cannot help recurig to my early belief that count putiatin has cards in his hand which he does not show lord elginyeh gave us his version of the murder of the french missionary he says the man was dressed as a clinaman and spoke chinese and no one suspected him of being a frenchman that the people accused him of having stolen women and also of being a rebel so his head was cut off  if said yeh  any one had had a notion that he was a frenchman he woulld have been sent to the french consulthere is probably not one word of truth in this the two common stock accusations by the chinese against the missionaries of all denominations is that they steal women and that thney pick out sick mens eyes what they mean by this latter impu itation i could not discover but i believe it is in tended literally and not figurativelyyeh received the edict which degraded him with great euanimity sir john bowring had forwarded a copy m the original chinese i lexpected this he said  may i keep it some time to consider it  as long as your excellency pleases  then i will keep ita weekthe decree requires some consideration it is much milder than was anticipatedmuch milder than the translation which went to europe would lead us to think for the translator has interpolated some words of censure not in the chiese it doesnot appear that although yak is removed from his government he is degraded from his rank or from his post as grand counciuhor he read it so for he remarked  henceforward then i have nothing to do with foreign athirstyour excellency must be glad to have escaped from so troublesome a post ti am neither glad nor sorry it was at the emperors command i took them up and at his command i lay them downyeh has been tenderly dealt with ee has evi dently some great protecting interest in pekin and will probably become again a great power in china
