billbroker and agent carrying on business in broadstreet city on the th and th of ouctober last for the purpose of getting them discountedthe one lewis a tterbusy jun ando co for l  and the other cromwell and co for   both of them new york firms and at that time of the highest eredit and respectability the bank required as a rule that the last endorser should be some english house both the abovementioned houses were represented in this country by partners in these firms carrying on branch busi nesses in manchester but the endorsements which stevens had most distinctly represented as being the endorsements of the manchester branch were those of the american housesthe plaintiff was sworn and saidi know the defend ants firm they are merchants at liverpool carrying on business under the firm of b f babcock and co  at glas gow they trade as j f jamieson and co and at new york as babcock brothers and co i know mr j r stevens of broadstreet the billbroker i have been in the habit of discounting bills for him since may  t have had as much as  or  worth of bils from him it is not the practice for the broker to endorse or gaarantee the bills i remember his bringing me some bills on the th of september last one was messrs denis toun wood and co upon denistoun cross and co for accepteddenistoun and cross andpayable atglyns and endorsed i said  who are the endorsers as i did not

of babcock and comr jtwesais there a known custom among bankers in discounting foreign bills requiring the name of an english house as endorsers mr widei object to that question the modo in which people do their business is not a custom which is bindina in lawmr sesthen i propose to amend the question by substituting the words  known practice for custommr widethat is worse than it was

brought a great deal of paper to the bank i am not aware that brokers endorse bills and they do not always mention who they are doing them for in fact they never do messrs denistoun at that time were in as high credit as any mercantile house in the kingdom denistoun cross and co are the london firm their transactions were known to be very large in the month of september their bills as far as i know were not refused i have discounted  of their paper there was at that time a manchester house named cromwell and co and in good credit lewis atterbury jun and co were also in good credit at anchester i kmow that atterbuy of the manchester house lives in england the qestion was who are the endorsers i did not know they had houses in new york the question i asked stevens was who are the endorsers of these bills  i am certainofthat stevens answered theyarerespectable houses in manchester that ibll swear it was not that they  have  houses in manchester but they  are houses in manchesteriteexaminedlif i had been told that the endorsements were the ncw york houses i should not have discounted thembaron iblmtthere was no obligation upon stevens to say where he got the biuls

the plaintiffs casebaron martnthere is no case yetmr jameswc say that it is clear that stevens was intrusted by the defendant toget the bills discounted and that the representations alleged were made by him and we have proved that the endorsements are not the endorse ments of the english housesbaron maxvnthereare three fatal objections firt there is no evidence of any fraud in stevens secondly there is no evidence to show fraud in the defendant and thirdly the answer given by stevens was a true one he said the houses were respectable houses in manchester and that was quite correct you must show that what stevens did he did in bad faith and that the defendant acted in bad faitha verdict was then entered for the defendant mr jtozs tendering a bil of exceptions to the learned judges rulingsaturday lay sitings at nisi prius before mr baron mabny atguildhallbueside v hastemr g denman was counsel for the plaintiff mr pryce appeared for the defendantthis was an action to recover  for four years salary fromlmstol andloi for extra services atvarious times the defendant was the surveyor of taxes in a district in yorkshire and the question in the cause was whether the services in respect of which the plaintiffs claim was made had been rendered gratnitously as the defendant alleged and swvore or under a reular contract for the amount now suedfor itbeing clear that the statute of limitations barred the plantiffs action in respect of the first three years salary the cause lasted a long time and resulted in a verdict for the defendantwestropp v rbhodesmr lush and mr hawkins were coumsel for the plain tiffs mr edwin james and mr holl were counsel for the defendantthe plaintiffs are stockbrokers and they sought to re cover the sum of  is d from the defendant who is a soicitor and had as they allegged instructed them to sell and buy certain stock on behalf of certain trustees who repudiated his authority to act for them and had inetructed other brokers to make the same purchases when the case had been hardly openedhis lordsnap suggested that as the plaintiffs had a clear right to recover the ioss from the defendant or the trustees the cause had better be referred to some gentleman who should decide between the three parties the trustees joining in the order of referencethis course was after some discussion adopted by all the parties and a verdict was taken for the plaintiffs for the admitted damages  is d subject to the award of mr coleman
