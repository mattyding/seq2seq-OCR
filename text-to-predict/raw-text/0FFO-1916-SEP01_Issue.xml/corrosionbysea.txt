corrosion by seawateriinew research station atbrightonaian important development of thc experimental work of the corrosion rsesarch committee is to be begun next month tho committeo is investigatirg thc corrosion of condenser tubes by sea water a problem of the highest interest to naval architects and marine engineers and a grantinaid of Â£ a year from the government jesearch council to getber with an offer by the brighton corporation to allow experimental work to be conducted at tho clectricity generating station at southwick has enrabled the committee to organize a corrosion re search station under conditions whicl should mreatly increase the value of the vork which has hitherto been carried out in the university of liverpoolso far corrosion has baffled engineers a ship may steam between this country and south america for two yearss with hardl any corrosion of condenser tubes while thl tubes of a sister slip may corrode  all to pieces  in the course of a few voyages ono object of the committee is to see if a momr satisfactory alloy than that now used in the manufacture of tubes can be made commercially practicableat liverpool research has been handicapped by the fact that tho experiments have had to be made with stored sea water brought in carts from the estuary of the smersey at southwick water pumped direct from the sea will be availabile other advan tages are that electricity is available for experiments in electrolytic corrosion and that a highly qualificl staff of electrical engineers will be ready to give assistance to the committees investigators captain  d bengough anl dr  f iludsonthe transfer of tho experimental work to south vick coincides with a reconstitution of the corrosion committee formcrly a committeo of tho institute of metals it has nowv been enlarged to include  mcniberr  of whomn represent the admiralty the admiralty air service tho board of trade the nationil physical laboratory lloyds register tho institution of electrical engineers tho institu tion oft mechanical engineers tho institution of naval architsects and the instivtition of marine engineers tlhero is also to be coordintation of the research work mnadp possible by tho cooperntion of the imperial collepe of scienc i and technology south kiensington corroded condenser tubes will be sent fromi brighiton to the college for scientiflc and microscopic investigation professor h c if cnrpentertho head of the metrllurgical department at south kensington is chairman of the corrosion research conmmittee and nr john christie the zmunicipal electrical engineer at brighton is a member captasin bengougl has been temporarily relieved of his military duties to conduct these important researches and dr hiudson haa given up his position as lecturer in mtetallurt in the university of birmning ham
