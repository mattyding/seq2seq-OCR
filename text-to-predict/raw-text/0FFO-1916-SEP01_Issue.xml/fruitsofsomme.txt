fruits of sommebattletwvo months fightin revilevedour splendid infantryfrom our special correspondentbritish headqujaters auo rain which has hardly ceased falling all day continues fo make operations difficult in spite of the weather our guns aro active they have been booming continuously all day long with occasional bursts of greater intensity st one part of the line or another the ground how ever is everywhero slippery and deep in mud the trenches are generally flooded and shell holes full of water no infantry movement except of tho most local character has been attemptedthe battle of the somme has now been in progress for two months tezfirst great infantry attack was delivered on july  but for some days before that tho fierce artillery bombardment had been in progress and this was a real if pre paratory part of the battle itself the opera tions to date may be divided into threo fairly clearly marked phasesas indeed i have divided them in my dispatchesin the attack of julyj we shattered tho main german front line protepted by all the elaborate defensivo works which the encmy in a year and a half of hard work had been able to put into it from above la boisello on tho left to near carnoy east of alametz on the right where the french carried on the victory the villages of la boisselle fricourt mametz and ontauban fell into our hands with all the intervening ground which was one vast net work of trenchds and fortificationstho front which we broke through was something more tlan  yards for the whole distance tho german line ran along a valleytho valley of the ancre and of one of its small tributariesand behind that linethe ground sloped slowly with many undulations upwards to the north and northeast to a fairly welldefined ridge and plateau some  yards on tho average beyond our first attack gave us all the fiat land of the valley and carried us up the beginning of tho slopo tho depth of the gain boing on tho avorage about  yards the impetus of that attack was continued in local fighting and very desperate fighting all along the front in which in thl coursn of tho following  days we forced our way over suecessic lines ot verb strongly held posi tions and added to our former gains ground of roughly hn averago of about  yards in depthin tho courso of theso  days we took tho village of contalmaison tho wholo of iamotz and bernafay wvoods tle latter on the right of our front and tho villago of ovillersla boisscllo on the oxtrome left where howovr the enemy still clung to one strong fortifiod position this brought us to a front within striking distanco of the niain gennan second lino which was only less formidablo thani tho firstbreaking the second linegiving the enemy no timo to rest with hardly  hours in many of oui nowly wop positions we mado our second gran attack on july  and shattered tho second line on a front of about  yards as completply as we had dono the first a fortnight earlier this attack gave us immediately tho villages of bazentin legrand and bazentinlopetit with the woods which bear their respective names as well as the greater part of the village of longuoval and the lower edgo of delvillo wnood in tho centre of tho attack our patrols reached high wood on tho very furthest summit of the ridgo but no attempt was made at that stage to hold it on tho right we cleared and captured trbnes woodanother period of fierce local fighting followed in which we wero making good our suc cess and ostablishing ourselves on a line above tho two bazenbins to tho top of longueval and thence down to tho eastern edge of trones wood a subsidiary and very successful attack on july  on the left of the main attack of two days beforo gave us another  yards or so of tho german second line and brouglht us to a point due east of the village of pozieres on the extreme left we completed the reduction of ovillorslaboisselle and thon by a rerios of direct drives mado oursolves maasters of poizoros gh operation which was completed by july the lino on which wo now found ourselves was in general close to but still below tho crest of tlho ridgo at nearly all points almost along its whole extent except at the right the summit of tho ridge was opeox ground while the next series of villages lay well down on tho further sido nor was there along the line any sucit formidable line of defonco to attack as had been furnished by tlhe first end second main enemy linesworking up to the ridgethe third phase of the battle then which has oecspied over a montlh has seen us steadily eating our way up the final slope and over the bare shellswept summit of the ridge if less spectacular than the other periods it has certainly not been less slccessful and perhaps has been the most creditablo to our arms it has seen no grand attack on the whole front though a serie of disconnected pushes on august  covered practically all of the front and made gains cquivalent to any wliich could have been yielded by such an attackconspicuous also has been the succession of stunning blows each with its hurricane bom bardment of unexampled intensity during the  days which have carried us frorn a little above ovillers to some  yards belowv thiepval very fierce fighting in the delville lvood region culminated in tlho triumphant action which cleared the wood and pushed our line well out to the north of it on august  equally brilliant has been tlie hard ceaseless hammering by which we have forced our way frorm pozieres to mouquct farm and over the high ground at and beyond tho point knovvn as the windmill on the bapaume roadthe essential feature of this nonth of tensoand aslmost bodytobody strtuggle however has been the fact that we lhave not failed on i believe any singleday to make some ground nosvhero btoe wo been thrown back wne have not in every case made all the ground whichin an individual action it had been hoped to mike and somotimes a part of an advanco bas been held up rendering it for the time impossible fo another parb of the line to retain the fruit of au that it had won but not only havo the gersnans nowhero thrown us back they havo beer nowhero able to pre vent us from comingon theintonsityof theflghtinghas been shown by the number of prisoners whom we havo taken fw ays havo passed without tho capture of a respeotable number on one day they amounted to nearly  on soveral other days we have taken from  to decay in german moralthis fact is significant i have warned readers before against building on it too largo assurnptions as to t he genoral derhoralization of the german army wvhat is certain how ever is that the moral of tho tromips inme diately opposed to us has becomo badly shaken the pitilessness of our attillery has much to do with this and the onemys unseen casualties from gunfire must have been extremely heavy undoubtedly also the german sqldiers nerves havo been shaken by the obvious domi nion of our airmen in the air letters and diaries found on prisoners have borne emphatic testimony to the discouragement which they have experienced from seeing our aeroplanes always overhead and never or rarely ono of their own but more than these things has been the splendid behaviour of our infantrythere are certain kinds of wild and dangerous animnals which rarely or never charge home every biggame hunter knows that with how ever much ferocity they start if he can only stand his ground ther odds aro fifty to one that their heart will fail ihem in the last few yards and thoy will swerve before thay arrive there are others seemingly less formidable which never swerve but get home to the bitter last alwriys it is that knowledge which puts the shooters nerve to the supreme test the certainty that if hp misses the enemy will get himthe german knows now that the british soldier never swserves if he is not stopped he gets home unvaryingly it may well be that before this battle the germans may still have cherished somnc illusions about the quality of the british voldicr for they had been told often ezouglh that tho noev armies would not be like the old thoy can have no illusions now the enemy must kill the british soidier as ho comes or he must face his bayonet and the german does not love the bayonettho enemy has been throwing in and taking out his troops with extraordinary rapidity so that there is hardly a division in the geiman army now which does not know something of what our attack means the knowledge may very well have shaken them pounded and bat tered as they havo been day after day no matter what they did our men still coming on and coming again trench by trench and yard by yard but never stoppingit tnay weu be that the germans havo not the heart to fight as theyi fought twvo months agoview from the ridgeand we have won the ridge at high wood and by ginchy tho enemy still keeps a footing on it but nowhere on the circuit of the ridge does ho loolk down on us as we look down on him the result of the five weeks of silent stub born fighting lhs been that flers and couree iette and martinpuichtliose villages which were so far away on the other side of the hill but a short wlhile agonow lio open to our gaze our soldiers from their trenches look dosn into themn all day and while we are thus enthroned on the mnain eircuit of the ridge on the left where the slope falls down to the ancre wo are close under the outer defences of thiepval and on the right we alrcady hold the nearer part of guille montwve know from many captured orders of the day and other documents hoiw muzch importance the enemy attached to the ground which we have conquered hq has proclaimed that on the holding of it the  very existence of the empire  was at stake he has put forth his uttermost strength to hold itall the might of all his great military machine and he has failedit is two mnonths work of which the army has every right to be proud and of which tho empire will be proud as long as history lives and i repeat never was the army more ready and more fit to fight than it is today
