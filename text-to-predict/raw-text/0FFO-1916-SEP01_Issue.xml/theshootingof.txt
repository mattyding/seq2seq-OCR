sad this gentleman let him do itr hcalyls it your view that you had no authority except to accept what captain colthurst hal caid but i had no authoritybut captain colthurst said  i think it is the right thing to do that is rather a consultative question is it not neodid you think it was the right thing for him towhy did you not say so i was not in a position to ay so to a superior ollicer i also heard a rumour that captain colthurst had shot a boy in tho street after i had sent lieutenant wilson to inform the adjutant of what captain colthturst had said i heard the tramp of soldiers

lnghting or of shotq tired in anger or in defence up to the timo of this inquiry ho bad never heard it mnooted that thero were more volleys fired than ho had describedstt join ltxiwx re n z tlrmfr powell for the military authoities generally observed that the evidence had shown a terrible state of affairs the whole chapter which recorded this robelion vwas a tragedylie had been asked to express every sympathv by sir john miaxwell and the headquarters staff thle oflicer who was responsible had been convicted of wilful murder and he had gone to that which was worse than deaththe awful seclusion of the mad house ihe didl not agree with mr mealy that a rebellion in which there were s casualties was an insignilicant thing he did not believe that the dublin police force brave as they were could have restored order and it could not be forgotten either that the rebellion was ushered in by the coldblooded murdecr of an unarnied policemnan who stood at the castle gates dealing with the deaths of mr skeflington and the other men afr powell said it was admitted that the action of captain colthurst suffering as he was from some mental disturbance at the time was wholly illegal and unjustitlable tho a ct in regard to tho boy coade was equally uniustirtablcsir john simton interposed in regard to the shooting of coade that it was impossible to reconcile the two statements as to whether it was dono with a revolver or rifle and there might have been more than one shooting in the course of that excuraogn
