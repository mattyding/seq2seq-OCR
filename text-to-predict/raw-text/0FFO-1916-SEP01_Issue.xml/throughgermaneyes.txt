through germaneyesiitaly and rumaniaslaves of englandthe germaili papers of monday and tuesday vero devoted almiiost excluively to the italian and rumanian declarations of war as the rapid sequence of events las to some extent obscured the fact it is initeresting to note thlat the italian declaration mnadc a very deep impression in ger many on mionday the inspired explanation hlurriedly given by the whole press was that italy had acted reluctantly inder the pressure of her allies and especially of englaiidthe semniofficial organs adopted an attitudo of sprrowv rather than of anger that  poor ltaly  should have sunk so low and become so entirely the tool of an alien will  and the slave of england at the same time italy was assured that sle wvould be duly chastised for her faithicssness andto quote the lokalanzciger for her ingratitude to germany in particular  to whom she owes venice to wvhom she owes rorne and to wthom she owes in great part her econonic expansion almost all the papers were made to say that italian troops might now le expected on the western front but that they could not be numetous iwhile many riters were particnlarly shockeld by the fact that italy declared war on goethez birthday the most amnusing comment came from the notorious herr bernhard of the vosiachc zeitung wsho saidone may almost assert that by their declaration of war the italians have made us a valuable presena for the subscription of the fifth german war loan ror while the german loant are mainly based upon the unshakable strcngth of the german economic system and upon its inture prospects a not incon siderable part is played by the claims which we shall make against enemy states and by the pawns of theirs which we hold the higher the amount that we are able to realize from these claims and pawns the smaller will bo the burdens which we and our descendants shall have to bear and so it suits us weu that ihtly should now male the volun tary dcclaration that she desires to take part in the payment of the intrest on the german loans and in their redemptionadmissions of surprisehe press comment on the intervention of rumiania almost defies analysis it is extra ordinarily confused and contradictory most of the papers calmiy forgot what they had been writing up to thes very eve of the event and pretended that rumanias action was tlioroughly expected only two papersthe conservative kreuz zeiteng and the frank furfer zeitunqghave consistently expressed pessimistic views they both nowv say that although they expected intervention they w ere surprise d that it took place so soon the kreuz zeitung wvhich as a military organ cannot admit that the crman general staff wvas surprised argues that the rumanian government itself cannot have intended to act so soon and that the wvhole change in the situation was produced by the bulgarian offen sive the press notes that tlhe rumanian minister in berlin was spending a holiday on tho baltic coast when tho news came and accoed ing to the berlina lokalanzeiger the rumanian military attach was until sunday evening together w ith the other neutral military attaches taking part in a tour of inspection of the industrial

to the obvious inference that germany is now losing he can only declare that rumania so far from haing any doubts abouit german victory is merelydraggedas the iast victim to the slnughter  under the increasing pressure of england and russia other papers describe rumania ascornmittiugsuictdeoptimists and pessirmistsit is remarkable that the jewvish organs wvhich have hitherto expressed the deepest admiration of rumania as a field for cerman financial enterprjses are now the most furious the frankfurter zcilung uses the language of the gutter the voasischc zciung on the other hand protests against all  easy optimism and w hile asserting that bulgaria positively desired rumanian intervention says that the turks are faced by the gravest anxietv  and that the intervention of rtumania mneans the closer approach of the russian peril for turkey the financial columns of the german papers are extremely gloomy it is pointed out that germany holds large quantities of ru manian stock although consfderable amounts have been boutght back by riumania during tho war the situation of tle important german banking petroleum and other comunitments in lrumania is discussed venr sadly it is also said that a good deal of german and austrian rolling stock is in rumaniaformal notice vas issued by the gennan government on monday night of the seizure of all rumanian ftato property anid banks and business firins wvere forbidden to mnake any payments to rumnianias fears of a food panicone of the most remarkable features of the press discussion is the feverish zeal to persuade the public that the intervention of rumania will not have a disastrous effect on the german food supply on monday night and tuesdav inorning thh papers were flooded ewith sudden and obvioulsly premature announcerents about the german harvest and the inspired telegrams sent out from berlin devote ahmost as mnuclspace to the food uestion as to the political and military considerations whereams the press has previously boassted of the enormous value of the corn exports from rumania tley aro now writtenl down to the most trifling propor tions at thef same time the governnent hturiedly announced that a considerable in crease of the bread rations in germany is to be expected immediately that labourers and children are to receive permanent additionis to their rations and that it has at last been decided to lay a heavy hand upon the agrarian distilleries and also upon the breweries in order to inerease the available supplies of fodder the treatment of the whole question in connexion precisely with rumanias inter vention is so clurnsy that it can only have aroused fresh alarm
