house of commons monday july ho of commons monday july  mrcberkeley presented a petition from  inha� bitants of cheltenham complaining of the ld extra charged by the postoffice on generalpost letters in cheltenham the bon member said that the present was one of the hardest cases of the kind in england he certainly should have felt it his duty to bring the subject before the house in the shape of a bill ayere it not that the whole subject of the postoffice was underthe consideration of his majestys government and he hoped that some remedy would be applied to this evil dr bowring said there avere complaints frora allparts of the country on this subject he knew of parishes where the additional penny was charged and though strong reprcsold smuggled whisky and the man who sold unstamped newspaper they avere hoth alike a frautl on the revenue and upon the fair trader he did not think that thc penalties were by any means too severe as nothing but severity could put dtvn tliis illegal tratric jlr maklev vras triad to hear that it was the intention of the riirlit hon gcntleniau to put down the uustaniped prese but he thoutlu that the cxistinr law was quite strong enough for this purpose ifthe right hou gentleman chose to carry it into efiect the government avas to blame for not enforcing the law when it was lirst violated butthe causcof their not doidg so the ti a as easily explained six years ago agitation was very convenient antl useful but it was not equally convenient now to have a free press and that the mass of the people should know what avas going on in that house if any tight hon gentleman from the other side of tlle house had brouglit forward this bill tllc whole country would be in agitation this bill was the most severe against the press ofthis country that hadevcr been intreduced into parliament he shouldbe pad if thelaw were rendered satisfactory heshould be glad if every faction of the country felt satisfaction  but he contended and insisted that tiie peopic of england had a right to enjoy a lree press andno government avould d its duty in allowing the enactment of sucr laws as these dr bowk ing vas happy to see that the revenue was at this moment in a very flourishing condition and as they had been told tiat this was a fiscal question and that in the then state of the revenue it was not possible for thc government to spare tiie whole of the duty upoi newspapers lie thought that all they required was sa� tisfactory evidence to show that the government from the improving stato of the revenue could grant this boon he knew there were men vho deemed the diffusion of politi� cal knowledge so important that they wereready to incur any ot tnd sacrifices for its sake cheap newspapers avere con� sidered essential to the diffusion of political information amongst the labouring classes and many avho had great in� fluence amongst their fellowlabourers dwelt upon the great injustice of not allowing them to have political information at their own homes if unpopular laws were made they aaould not only be without effect but would diminish the respect paid to the lav the new powers given to collect a smaller revenue were a gteater evil than was remedied by tlle reduction of the stamp duty to a penny ivir rice said that the hon member who had just sat down had made use of an argument under circumstances in which he had never heard it used hear he mr rice could understand the argument if it had been addressed to thc question avhich had been proposed by the hon member for finsbury for the abolition of the duty hc dif� fered fiom him on this point he retained a duty or one penny and he gave the press an equivalent in the free circu� lation of papers throughout the land but the hon member not airoves to the total repeal of the duty but apropos toa reduction of the duty objected to thc clause containing a penalty for violating the law and selling papers avithout stamps let the hon member bring forward a niotion for a repeal of theduty he liud said that the prisons of the country were crowded wiili persons for offences against the existing law he mr rice admitteti it anel it was his anxious hope that this evil would be prevented but in  cases out of  these prosecutions were not bv the public but wcre vex� atious proceedings by common informers  and bv this bill prosecutions would bc instituted by oflicers of government it vras odd that a contingency should happen which for the sake of thc logic of the objectors he hoped would not often bc repeated that whilst tle object of the bili avas to relieve the press hc should be told that this was a measure to fetter and restrict thc press he had intended thts as a measure of relief anil as an honest measure and an operative measure and he knew that if the law remained in its present state and the stamped press had a reduction of duty the unstamped press would still go on gentlrncn might think it very easy to reduce the whole duty but did they think he could carry it  tvould they prefer an entirely free press unaccompanied avith a free circulation  not a single individual conversant with the subject avhom he had consulted had not said that the i less had a deep interest in a free circulation of newspapers threughout the empirethat this was a greater benefit than removing the penny stamp mr wallace was of opimon thatit was much better to have a free circulation under a stamp he was not prepared to say that we were in a condition to have a free postage and no stamp  when he saw ave were in such a state he should be prepared to support the repeal of the stamp  till then he should support the penny stamp he did not think that those who disobeyed the present laav would disobey the new ono  but that many who evaded the fourpenny stamp would pay thc penny mr c buller said that though hc was on principle an advocate for removing all taxes from newspapers and did not concur in thinking with the right hon gentleman tbat the free postage was an equivalent for the penny stamp but he thought that a farthing stamp would cover postage yet he accepted the boon of the right hon gentleman this clause only gave the power to retain the revenue and it a tax was to be raisedjit was essential to provide a sufficient power to secure thc taxbut not beyond that thepart of theclause which he objected to was tbat which enacted that if anv person shall have in ms possession and without a satisfactory excuse the proof whereof shall he on the party accused any newspaper not duly stamped he shall forfeit  for every newspaper  and that any constable or other peace officer might seize and apprehend any such offender this was monstrous  it gave a right of search and the number of offenders against the clause would be so great that it would bring the law into disrepute it would be moreover impracticable a keg of whisky was not half so portable as a newspaper and yet smuggling of spirits was carried on  and when the importa� tion of bandana handkerchiefs was prohibited mr hus� kisson saw that every gentleman could produce one from his pocket lt was utterly unavailing to attempt to enforce alaw against so many persons he proposed as an amendment of the clause to omit tre words  or if any person shall have in his possession any newspaper not duly stamped mt pr m said he had had sent him copies of unstamp� ed newspapers and under this clause he might be sent to hard labour for a month a laugh would tt not be sufficient to impose a penalty on thesale or disposal or distribution of the papers  mr rice said thatif thc penalty avas imposed only on the sale or distribution of the papers and not on those avho had the papers in their possession would any gentleman think that the law could be enforced  mr jervis observed that under the new law an alarm� ing power was given to constables and peace officers too great a power than ought to be given for the mere collection of the revenue it was taken from a law which was not a law of bngland but an irish act  mr oconnell said that the first principle of british jurisprudence avas violated by this law avhich put the proof of innocence on the accused the present clause was assimilated tothe law to prevent smuggling but the possession of spirits withouta license or tobacco avithout a permit was a circum� stance avhich itself bespoke guilt but did the pos� session of a newspaper imply guilt he hoped the clause would not be persevered in mr villiers said that a law which like this ran counter to the general opinion of the people would be im rraciicable and would excite the sympathy of the public and ot mcs towards offenders this law would be looked upon by tne country as intended to suppress free discussion this clause exposed the poor man to great hazard and a law of so unjust a character could not be enforced mr rice said the clause was taken from the original acts  the difference was that in the act of lis geo ill tne words knowingly and wilfully were inserted hear  out t was a question how far the clause could be sufficiently operative if the onus was thrown upon the prosecutor of y owing a wilful offence he had however no objection to nse the avords � knowingly and wilfully because he was persuaded if a particular publichouse was in the habit of pos� sessing such papers there would be no great difficulty in say� ing it was done knowingly and wilfully i robinson said that there were preparations already made for evadm this law lie bad seen the pro sittdiilj paper t be �nducted bv a netriber of tha house the same

commenced at  oclock yesterdav morning and finished at half past  london tuesday july   ir the house of lords the south durham railway bill was thrown out by a majority of  after the presentation of petitions by various peers the lord chancellor moved the second reading of the imprisonment for debt bill the duke of wel� lington after a concise and lucid statement moved that the second reading of the bill should be postponed for three weeks the object ofthe noble duke is we nfer from his argument to get rid of the bill for this session on the rational ground that a bill of such importance involving tlie interests of all classes and consisting of a great number of compli� cated details cannot be advantageously decided upon at this late period of the session the bill was not ordered tobe printed till the th of june and contains iti clauses his grace was ably supported by lord abinger and his niotion was carried by a majority of i lord melbourne then moved the second reading of  the registration of births biu and  the marriages bill the archbishop of canterbury as we hinted yesterday offered no opposition to the second reading but ivith reference to the marriages bill  professed himself favourable to its principle but not to  tlie manner in which that principle was proposed  to be worked out he thought thai the mem  bers of the church ofengland should be continued in  possession of those advantageswhichlheynowenjoyed and with which in general the clergy aswellaslaitywere  satisfied but at the same time he repeated thathe did  not object to a plan for the relief of dissemersbutlet it  be confined to diem wi jj respect to the registration  of births he objected that it was compulsory aud as  the bill now stood was to be carried on in an inqni  sitorial manner which would be grievous to those  peisons and families on whom it would fall such  a system of registration could not avork in this coun  try it went to separate two things which had been  united since the earliest periods of christianitythe  naming the party baptized at the time of baptism the bills were then read a second time and ordered to be committed on monday next after some other business the house adjourned in the house of commons the irish church bill was reported and ordered to bc read a third time on friday the personal tithes bill went through committee mr walter moved pursuant to notice that � an humble address be presented to his majesty  paying that he will be graciously pleased to issue hi c royal orders that a placard entided emigration to an diemans land avhich the several postmasters  throughout the kingdom have been directed to put in  a conspicuous place in their several postoffices and to circulate among thc clergy and the parochial  audiorities be withdrawn we refer our readers to the hon members speech for an explanation of the circumstances under which the placard has been issued and of the grounds on winch he brought forward his motion connected with the subject of female emigration an extract which we publish in another column from the hobarttown courier will be read with interest mr o lushing� ton who appears to have volunteered a defence of this emigration scheme was so candid as to make the following admissions however distressing it might  be to his feelings to advert to such topics he could  not but feel it was due to truth and justice to state that  nothing could be more vicious than was the state of  society in that colony and that its vices were not con  fined to the lower classesthat he knew one case in  which an individual holding a judicial situation came  on board a vessel from england containing female  emigrants represented himself as a married man         d r m c h  d w d e t t r a l n a  i  t a a m  o t  t v l e w l a o s t m b b t e  a a c p h  w   a o o o n c h n g j o t t t o k l o t o c t o  p n e q r r o i a m s o s t t b p t   a b m b p a a w p f t g s d r m m a a r c r t t w o t a e t s r a b p d b l g s l hired one of the young women as a servant carried  her off with him and before many hours passed  away attenipted to seduce her he certainly lost his  situation but who could for a moment doubt that  tlie state of society at the colony was such as in a  preeminent degree required the interference of a  body like die committee with which he was con  nected  and who let us ask in our turn can doubt the humanity and the propriety of sending rcspectable young english women to such a place  the expenses at elections bill went through com� mittee after an unsuccessful attempt to get rid of the clause which limits the polling to a single day but the hour of closing the poll was altered from  oclock to  oclock previous to going into committee on the stamp duties bill a conversation took place from which it would appear that mr rice does not intend to press during the present session any part of thc measure except that which relates to newspapers accordingly the discussion in committee which we have not room to notice today was confined to the clauses that have reference to newspapers some of which were agreed to and the chairman having reported progress obtained leave to sit again on thursday words cost less than nothing to mr daniel ocon� nell yesterdays post from ireland brought with it another letter addressed to the  members of the na  tional association of ireland wherein a usual the incendiary instigates rebellion but professes to counsel  peace it is not difficult to perceive in this instance that the real object next the rapacious heart of the agitator is to lay his fingers on other peoples money and he therefore sets going a subscription there is much to be done by a subscription under thename of justice rent for ireland the handling of which of course is reserved for some creature or crea� tures of mr daniel oconnell  the amount for  individuals of the oconnell tribe which he tenders or promises as a decoyduck to liis intended victims being a sum which may be about lth part of what he has already in other shapes extorted from the paupers of ireland and no doubt he will make  a good thing of it the grave twaddle which runs through the present letter is not the least amusing part of it his new association is to partake in its character of the celibacy of the popish priesthood it is not to have any species of  connexion with any other body trades unions central committees parochial com� mittees registry societies all excellent all ravishingly beautiful in their wayare to be eschewed nd fled from by the abstemious martyrs of the national association the latter must have nothing to do with tliem what� ever any more than the virtuous father john with  the blueeyed nun of st catherinesthat is now and then drinking their good health yet if we set aside the trades unions central committees paro� chial societies and the rest of them it perhaps may puzzle the ingenious daniel how to fill the ranks of his projected association will it not be somewhat like  turning our backs upon ourselves  the agitator wih not suffer his unfortunate dupes  to endure for  one acquiescing moment the brand of slavery or of  unjust inferiority in speaking of the relations between roman catholic and protestant yesterday we stated that no inequality of condition existed but in two respectsthe practical one of the old corporationsthe formal and theoretic one ofthe protcstant being the established church now when the whig tools of mr daniel ocon� nell have themselves under his dictation refused to cooperate with the conservatives in abolishing the protestant municipal bodies and thereby effacing tliat practical brand of inferiority we diinkit a httle too muck for this mountebank to bring up the nonextinction of such corporations as a continued ground of discontent there remains then no second inflammatory topic just at present but the established church being tliat of the reformed worship  and what is this save the confirmation of all that we have been pressing upon the country for three or four years pastnamely that the real grievance of the papists was different from the professed onethat they pretended to want only a relief from tithe of which all the world knows that the burden falls not on them but on the landlords while the true gravamen was the existence of any protestant established church and that while they avowed no further wish than for the modification of the tithe system the only modification for which they cared a straw was the retransfer of all church property to thenown priesthood when therefore mr daniel oconnell commands his slaves to endure no longer the  brand of unjust inferiority it is obviously but another phrase for declaring war on the part of his socalled national association against that protestant church establishment which has already from the same quarter been the subject of such repeated and irreve rend calumny the remainder of the letter is mere rubbish unredeemed by one particle of reason truth or honour   he assumes with his accustomed modesty that all irishmenchurch protestants and dissenters as well as papistsare friends and abettors of his disloyal machinations  he abuses wholesale the county con� stituency of england and their landlords for being operated upon by the cry of no popery we congratulate our protestant countrymen that the shoe begins to pinch he tells the english farmers that tlieir best interest is the prosperity oflreland then who in that case is their most deadly f but the grand disturber and obstructor of that pros� perity  with glaring and ungrateful impudence he tells the people of ireland that  we know well  stanley peel and wellington  we know their  conduct when tlie two latter were in oflice ay and so do we for it was wellington and peel who brought daniel and his mob into the  house of  gentlementhough the mounted beggar in enu� merating their offences chooses to pass over that mistake he slanders and vilifies the irish bench because they are not yet papists he attacks the periodical organs of the conservatives for proposing to rule ireland by another crojwell a deadly poison requires a powerful antidote when a venomous creature crawls over and pollutes the land what so much to be prayed for as a gallant eagle to pounce upon and tear the reptile with his taloni as for dealing with ireland while a prey to priests and bru� tal demagogues by the mild maxims of free and popular government the thing appears to men of common sense more hopeless every hour such incendiaries do not tolerate in people of another faith those equal rights for which they themselves everlastingly cla� mour whileanythinglike independence is left mmw f engllsh protestants the oconnells and m hales raise an outcry against it as if it were an infringement of their own exclusive rkhts we repeat therefore that any shadow of power which can be turned to ofiensive purposes is to such men a ruinous concession they are intrinsic and incorrigible tyrants their sole desire is to make engush protes� tants tlieir slaves ifthe alternative is to come and whenever u does come of our being the depositories of despotic power or its irrecoverable victims we tell mr daniel o connell that our choice is made and he not england shall surely perish the letter of mr daniel whittle harvev to the electors of southwark announcing his retirement from the representation of that borough is a document de� serving of some notice at the present juncture if we remember aright mr harvey when impertinently addressed some time back by a body calling itself we believe  the southwark reform association very properly resented that impertinence and declared his determination to look not to a section but to theentire body ofhis constituents for a decision as to his parlia liamentary conduct the line taken by the hon gentleman on that occasion we thought manly spirited and of a nature to annihilate the de� legate system altogether it is therefore not jwithout some surprise that we find mr has stating his resolve to have been not to hold a seat  unsustained by the firm and entire sanction of his  constituents this we apprehend is a unanimity too wonderful to be expected in any elective body least of all in one so composed as that of southwark as to the personal considerations by which mr harvey intimates that he has been to a certain extent actuated we must say that as far as he leads us to judgeof their nature they existed in as full force when he first stood fcr the borough as they do now this however is a matter entirely for mr harveys own
