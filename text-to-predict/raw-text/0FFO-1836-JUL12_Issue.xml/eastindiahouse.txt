eas india houea special general court of proprietors of sast lincia stock was held yesterday in conformity wvith a requisition signed by nine proprietors duly qualified according to law for the purpose of taking into consideration the provisions of a bill which received the royal assent on the th of july for the equalization of the duties on east and west india sugars the provisions of which the requisitionists deemed to be inju rious and urjust with reference to a large portion of the companys lndian territories inasmuch as the bill gave ad vantages to the presidency of bengal which were withheld from the subordinate presidencies of madras and bombaythc czairtair sir j r carmac bart having stated the business for which the court bad been convenedmr weedixg briefly adverted to theproceedings which had taken place in tbe court of proprietors with reference to an equalization of the duties on east and nvest india sugars on the th of muay last petitions to both houses of parliament had been agreed to having for their object the attainmnent of thatequalization t had been announced to them on the d of june by the hon chairman that the court of di rectors hadl been in communication with his majestys government on this subject and that a satisfactory letter had been received fromu sir john hobhouse rwith reference to it the proprietors were of course rejoiced to hear that their efforts were likely to be crowned with success and they hoped that the principle laid down in their petition would be carried to the utmost extent on the d of june a bill the great ob ject of which was the cqualization of those duties was brought into the house of commons that bill which was the mca sure now under consideration passed both houses of parlia ment on the d of july and received the royal assent on the tll inst the hon proprietor concluded by moving the aiop tioni of a petition to the house of commons in which the peti tioners complained  that while under the act recently passed sugar was allowed to be cxported from bengal at the reduced rate of s per cwt the same privilege was refused to the presidencies of madras and bombay which imported very considerable quantities of sugar from bengal which they ougbt to he permitted to export when their own wants were supplied no doubt it was the intention of parlia ment to de equal justice to all parties  but the mea sure which had been passed was a denial of justice to the presidencies of madras and bombay inasmuch as it introduced checks of an oppressive nature and did not place those presidencies on the samc footing with that of bengal the petitioners prayed as the new mcasure might be altered or amended by any act passed in the present session ot par liament that a bill should be introduced permitting sugar to be exported from madras and bombay at the reduced duty the petitioners pointed out how beneficially this alteration would operate for the manufactures of this country at pre sent when cotton was to bc imported fiom bombay it was necessarv to take in a cargo of stones as ballast before cotton could be placed oni board whereas sugar might be used instead of ballast of that naturesir c foibes seconded the motion and expressed his belief that the subject had not been sufficiently explained tc his majestys mlinisters or they would not have granted te the presidency of bengal privileges that werc refused ta mladras and bombay he denied that the west india in terest would be injured by allowing the exportation of sugar from madras and bombay it would on the contrary be benefitted by that circumstancemr chtapma in supporting the petition observed that the shipoirner would derive great benefit if sugar were per mitted to be exported both from aladras and bombay he was not actuated by a hostile fenling towards any other body of persons ife conceived that the west india interest had been most fairly treated and he was anxious that the exten sion of commerce on just principles should be extended to every quarter of the globemlr fielder expressed himself strongly in favout of al lowing the same privilege to be extended to madras and bombay as was by the bill conceded to bengalcolonel syres argued first that the west india interect wotld have no cause of complaint if the privilege of exporta tion were not confined to bengal second that madras was at present in a situation to receive thzis boon  and third that it miiight also be extended to bombay with considerable be nefitllr hogg said he would while he was in parliament support on public grounds all measures that appeared to be calculated to serve the interests of india if the present mea sire dlid not assist those interests so much as hon proprietors wished lie was sure that it arose frons a want of correct infor mation on the subject and thatinflormation being once piven to flis miiajestys mlinisters he felt comfident that they would act upon itmr d cappbell defended the course taken by govem ment and as lie thought that it would be unwise to disturb the measure which had been carried in thepresentsession he could not agree to this petition dr carpue said that they owed a great debt to indis with reference to chirurgical operations the operation for li thotomy that for extracting the cataract c they owed to india  the art of performinig those operations was imported from india to italy from italy to france and from thence to lngland now as one good turn deserved another they ought for these benefits to exert themselves to the utmost to secure the prosperity of indiariveedinsg replied and defended the propositions con tained ill the petitionmr ii g ticrer said the petition contained three propositions the first a practical proposition of immediate applicationnamely that the sugar of bengal the surplus produce of that presidency slsould be bonded at thic other presidencies and exported from them the se cond proposition was founded on a just principle but did not rvisuirc immediate slsplicition it was that the surplus sugar of madras and bombay after providing for their own con sumptlion should be exported that procceded on the samne principle wvhichi applied to bengal and would ultimatelv be coneeded as it was in fact only a question oftime nteither mladras nor bombay had yet exported but the stimulus af forded to the cultivation of sugar by this bill would ultimately enable thcse presidencies to export and the restriction would of course be removed the third proposition reserved the right of the foreign trade as it at present existed on that point he conceived there would be some difficultv the first proposition hc thouht government could not refuse the second would no douibt be granted by and bv and he would ask witlh respect to that and the third whetler they would be acting rightly to stickle for them when in poiat of fact suchl a proceeding was only calculated to ellibarrass them he thought that they ought on the present occasion to confine themnselves to the first proposi tion and not to insist on tlhe othersllr wveeding though his opinion was unchanged was willing for the sake of unanimity to adopt the alterationthe chairitan said it appeared to him that the great practical object of the petition was to have sugar the pro duce of bengal bounded at imadras anti bombay to be exported from thience to this country and that object thev ought steadily to keep in view it was desirable having os taitied a very great boon that they should proceed in a cauti ous and prudent coumse and not to call on government to concede that which they conceived they could not with pro priety grant ie should therefore move that certain parts of the petition should be omitted and the remainder acreed tomir h g tuceeryes let us go to that which is of practical utility anti leave the other parts to a more fitting periolsir r cam pbeli objected to leaving out the parts of the petition referred to taking that course would have the eflect of discouraging the presidencies of madras and bom bay from extending thle cultivation of sugarthe chairman then moved  that the petition as he proposed to amend it be adopted wvhich was agreed to and the court adjourned
