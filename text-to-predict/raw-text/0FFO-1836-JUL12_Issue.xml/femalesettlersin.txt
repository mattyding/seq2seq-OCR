zemvale setlers d ajstzilifs from the hobart town courier of feb by the boadicea which arrived on thursday last with fct male emigrants we have been favoured with a packet fronf an unknown hand though we presume we are indebtea for it to the kindness of mru arshall the agent to the emigration committee containing a series of papers relating to emi gration to these colonies ordered by the house of commons to be printed and a pamphlet entitled a refutation of the slanders and meilfd miesrepresentations published at syd ney by dr lang lve have perused them with the utmost attention throughout and if any thing were wanting to con firm the arguments we have so urgently and repeatedly sub mitted to the government snd the public regarding the gross impolicy of the existing land and emigration regulations it would be afforded in the facts and statements contained in these documentsif the principle of interfering with the free agency of mart can be defended in any case we are ready to confess it woluld be in that of lone defenceless destitute young womenwhose conditon there might be some probability of ameliorating in removing to a remote colony like this where a disparity of the sexes is known to prevail but there is something so ex ceedingly repugnant to a refined and chastened mind in send ing out a shipload of females with this view that even on the score of decency we have never been able to look upon thc measure with any degree of satisfaction it is sufficient iryour opinion to shake the principle of purity and virtuewhich should ever be looked on as the main charm of the female character under the circumstances it is therefore only sur prising that so few nmiscarriages as alr marshall calls them do in fact take place even without the temptations of which we know none to which he says they are exposed on arrivali would ask he says p  ia it reasonable is it consis tent with everyday experience and common sense to expect that any body of men however inteligently anxiously and devotedly they may apply themselves to the object can suc ceed in sending out a large number of females under circum stances where comparative freedom from control the climate through which they pass and above all the temptations to which they are subject on their arrival at sidney peculiarly expose them without at least the extent of miscarriage which experience shows to take place in a similar number of persons placed under the most favourable circumstances in this country it is no longer pretended we observe from these docu ments that thlis forced emigration does good either to the mother country or the individuals themselves who emigrate no the incalculable blessing as dr lang calls itis entisely confined to the coloniesto us wvho are already their inha bitants these forced emigrants whether male or femae are  to diffuse a healthy stream of population amongst uswe are to look to them for reforming our character for banishing vice and immorality from our shores upon what grounds dr lang his alajestys government the emigration committec and alr ilarshabraise this position which they thus take for granted we have never yet been able to learn the chief reason given in their documents which we have been able to discover is afforded in the opinion of a lieutenant alarshall who it appears came out in charge of a female emigrant ship the david scottto sydney his expe rience of the colony was but short for in the course of a long letter to mr alarshall written soon after his arrival he says if so humble an individual as myself may venture to give an opinion i should most respectfully urge the committee not to relax in their efforts to forward as many free women as possible to this place although with all the circumspection that can be used some bad characters rill undoubtedly get inmr marshall adds and so in all sincerity say the comrmittee if they could get them in sufficient numbers to make any sensible inmprcs sion on the demands of society in australia but of all persons experience shows that individuals most bound to the spot of their birth are the inhabitants of secluded country villagesa little discrepancy however breaks out in the opinions thus laid before the friends of forced emigration for a young lady who it would appear had been sent out by the same oppor tunity is of opinion that sydney stands in no need of any ameliorating circumstances to be furnished by emigration being already superior to london and the  benefit is con feried on the happy emigrants themselves in a letter which the fair one addresses to her  dear father and brother and sisters all she says brother james when you come bring some brandy in case of sickniess in the ship and if it please god that you and betty should land at sydney you wil say you never saw such a beautiful place in your lives for london is nothing to itwith all the temptation afiorded by this  beautiful place however we rejoice to say that the voice of truth humnanity and common sense promulgated wve flatter ourselves in a large degree by our labours lattcrly aided in some measure by thosc of dr lang at sydney the delusion is passing awvay and the mistaken though we are most willing to allow well intended purposes of the government and the commit tee are nearly brought to a stand archdeacon broughton at that time th of august last residing at farmhamin sur rey in the course of a letter to mr aiarsball thus expresses himself p  the notice issued by the emigration committeedirecting the attention of married agriculturists gardeners sbepherds c to the advantages efsered in regard of a passage to the colonies has been and continues to be affixed and circulated in almost every town and even village in england but within the counties wvhich i am best acquainted withviz kent sussex surrey and hampshire not a singleinstance of a family of the specified description expressing a desire to quit their home has fallen under my observation though i have been on the lookout for them if therefore the public in new south wvales express dissatisfaction that the commit tee send them only unmarried females instead of married labourers the answer is very simplethat married labourers wiling to emigrate are very seldom to be met with in fact i must say that the value of the man as a labourer is general ly in proportion to the difficulty of inducing him to quit the place of his birthand sir edward parry in a letter dated from norwich august ll says in confirmation of this state of things since  undertook the dutiesofan assistant poor law com missioner in which it has become a very important part of my husiness to encourage the emigration of respectable agri cultural families i have been much struck and much disap pointed in finding it imposible in this county norfolk to persuade any of the labouring classes to take ad vantage of this mode of bettering their condition during three months that i have been engaged in this duty i have been able only to report one family thus dis posed and i am of opinion that until the new poor laws come fairly into operation so as to destrov that feeling of entire dependence on the poorrate and consequently those habits of careless improvi ence which now so generally exist a veryfew families in this county will be found willing even to cross the brook which bounds their own parish much less to cross the seas in searcl of independent employmentthe females which have come to us by the present oppor tunity are of unusually tender years to be thus launched upon the world contrary to the stipulation many of them arc under i and about  we lcarn under  or  will require to be kept like our own orphans and reared and educated for some years at the public expense until fit for service our old ftiend archbishop wvhately the news of our other friend the rev mr malthuss death having reached dublin had a principal hand we leam in this measure how reputable we leave his lordship in his  third  letter to earl grey to ex plain a few more thousand acres of pasture land will of coarse be sold to our large landed and sheep proprietors if they will buy in order to meet this additional expensea person of common sense whether male or female will naturally ask these urgers of forced emigration  if it be so fine a thing how comes it gentlemen that you are not gone  example is better then precept is much better than persua sion based on so rotten grounds but no in default of this natural and obvious inducement flattering pictures delusive statements and advertisements of all kinds paid for of course out of our poor acres are disseminated in all quarters most sincerely do we wish that their condition may be ameliorated thleugb with allthe welcome the disinterested and benevolent intentions for which the inhabitants of this place are proverbial much disappointment must ensue when we find that the heads of these young females are fiued with such notions as that van diemans land is a splendid litte spot filled with pretty white cottages each with single men of al ranks and cauings waiting for wives we cannot hold scathless the authors of such delusion seeing it is used to induce them to accept it in place of home and all those ties which in a female breast in particular are at once so delicate and so bindingfrom the papers now before us printed by order of the house of commons we learn that each of the female emigrant ships costs this colony about  and as it is orderea  unless the bubble burst which we trust it will before tbat time that two such ships shall come out to us every year we may reckon on a charge to be levied on us of on this accounf  ayear or at s each  acres of land now wp affirm that no tax which could beiimposed ona young colobrlike thb could by my podbility be so huinous allowing for the sake of arguent that the arrival oftthese females is a benefit though we dispute the alleged disparity of the sexes in our population unless the unmarriageable prisoners and the chain garngs be included it will not compensate for th part of this burden let but the home government direct the emigration committee topublish throughout thekingdom that land to the above extent i ready to be given annually to new settlers and you will speedily have ten times the nuaber of that very description of free and unrestrained persons male or female whose emigration would relieve elngland and whose arrival as dr lang says would be an incalculable blessing in van diemans land
