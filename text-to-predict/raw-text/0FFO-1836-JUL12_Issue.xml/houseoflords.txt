the marquis of londonderry moved that thc bill bc read that day six months in doing so the noble marquis entered into a history ol the bill avhich he opposed upon two groundsfirst because he believed most conscientiously that no public benefit would accrue from it and secondly because it avould prove greatly prejudicial to private property the railroad for instance would pas� through one of his own es� tates on which he had expended  to show that it was not however upon that ground alone he opposed the measure the noble lord referred to his conduct with regard to the great northern railway which also ran through an estate ot his but ehich he looked upon as of great commercial benefit to thc country lord wharncliffe also opposed the bill on the ground that it did not like other bills give compensation to landowners through whose property the railroad might run lord howden said a few words in support of the bill which were inaudible thc house then divided when there appeared

municipal corporations bill and praying their lordships to pursue the same line of conduct uninfluenced by threats or intimida� tion of any sortwhatever imprisonment for debt the lord chancellor presented a petition from  persons imprisoned in the kings bench in favour of the bill for abolishing imprisonment for debt a laugh his lordship then moved the order of the day for the second read� ing of this bill the order of the day having been read by the clerk at the table the lord chancellor rose to move the second reading of the bill but his observationsfrom the extremely in� distinct tone in which his lordship spoke were for the most part inaudible in the gallery he did not participate in the sympathy exclusively professed bv some for those suffering imprisonment for debt  whenever he considered the question how far it might be possible consistently with the interests of the counlry at large to abolish imprisonment for debt one of the most important elements of consideration always appeared to him to be how the creditor could best be secured and faci� litated in obtaining the payment of what was iustly due to him any measure therefore which proposedto do away with imprisonment for debt without enabling the creditor by a wiser better and more expeditious process to obtain pay� ment of what was due to him would never receive his sanc� tion and the ground on which hc called for the approbation of their lordships to this bill was that it aimed and he hoped successfully at the attainment of both objects presenting a better ind more available security to the creditor while it afforded relief to those who by misfortune became involved in debt from the severe pressure which in many cases the law as at present existing unjustly exerted upon them this sub� ject had to some considerable extent engaged the attention of both homes of parliament and thereport of the commis� sioners on which this bill was founded had been on tbeir table since  he called their lordships attention to the date of that report because from what passed on a former evening ho was led to suppose that objection would now be made more to the time at which the question was brought forward than to any principle on which the bill itself was founded since  the avhole of thc facts had been before the public the report had been in the hands of members of both houses  public attention had for a considerable time been directed to the subject and it was therefore to be presumed that noble lords had made themselves fully acquainted with all the circumstances of the case in the last session of parliament a measure containing provisions aery much of tbe same nature with those of the present bill passed the house of commons but did not reach their lordships house until the th of au� gust when in his opinion naturally enough although it had been made a matter of complaint out of doors they had de� cided it was too late to entertain a hill on so important a sub� ject he should have been glad had he been able to lay the present bill at an earlier period oe the session before their lord� ships but upon that point he had nothing to reproach himself with a noble and learned lord brougham whose absence had this session been frequently lamented undertook to bring forward a bill on the subject and he the lord chancellor was unwilling to takethe matter out of his hands until no hope was entertained of tliat noble and learned lords return to the business of that house before the close of this session with his other engagemenis it was impossible for liim to introduce it befere the th of june he hoped if no objections were entertained to the principle of� the bill it would not be opposed on the ground that it was too late in the session now to proceed with it the report to avhich he had alluded rendered it unnecessary for him to detail at ony length the objections which existed to thepresent system or the remedies which it was proposed to apply the question rfivided itself naturally into two parts according to the two periods at which the arrest might take place lt applied as well to arrest on mesne process at thc commencement of the suit for the purpose of securing the person of the defendant as the arrest in execution which followed the judgment and the object of the bill was to get rid of both he should first address himself to the latter because if it could bc shown that arrest in execution after judgment was not beneficial to the creditor it would follow that a great alteration would be required in the state of the law at the commencement of the suit nothing could be more objectionable than thc present state of thelawof arrest after judgment judgment having been obtained the law as it now stood gave the plaintifithe option of proceeding against the goods ot the debtor or of taking his person  he took his person he must be satisfied with that but of what avail was it  it ceuld clearly avail nothing whatever if the debtor had no property but then it was said if he possessed property the pressure of imprisonment would compel him to surrender it but strange as it might seem the law did not enable thc plaintiff except in a very limited number of cases to take the debtors proptrty at all he could take only half the income of the debtors land he could take ins goods and chattels but ho could not touch his property in the funds the debtor might be an extensive proprietor in the various public companieshe might possess shares and securities of every kind but thc creditor could only lake what came tinder thc description of goods and chat� tels  and cases were frequent of debtors living under the re� strictions or within the rulesof a nrison in positive affluence and setting their creditors completely at defiance should such a state ol thc law be allowed to remain  if the debtor had no property the creditor had the right to imprison him for life but for the operation of the insolvent debtors act which would expire with this session so very extravagant indeed was the state of the law that until  it was found necessary to pass bills periodically to clear the gaols the noble and learned lord then referred to some of the details of the bill but in such a confused and indistinct mariner that we found it quite impossible to follow bira he ridiculed the anomalous absurdity of the system which prevented a debtor unless he were a trader from dividing his property among his creditors without going several montlis to prison while a trader who owed ioo might do so without sub muting to that degradation he knew from a deputa� tion who had waited on him that the creditors were not at all anxious to retain the power of imprisonment for debt after judgment they would much rather prefer the means of getting possession of the debtors property but if impri� sonment for debt after judgment could not be maintained neither could arrest on mesne process the present state of the law gave powers to the plaintiff which in such a country as this tie ought not in justice to enjoy if a man were accused oe an offence he might be arrested to secure his person  but lie was immediately taken before a magistrate anl liberated unless a sufheient case were made out to warrant his commit� tal but if a petson swte that his neighbour owed him e he might be arrested and sent to prison and as the ma� chinery of putting in bail was so very expensive it was better forhimatoncc to pay  than have to prove at the trial that he did not owe  this systena was an obvious means of extortion and the oppression to which unfortunate debtors were exposed from sheriffs officers avas another great source of inconvenience he contended that arrest on mesne pro� cess was intended only to secure tlie person of the debtor not to terrify lum into the payment of what perhaps he did not owe the present system was only calculated to excite the bad passions without aiding the creditor in the recovery of what was his due but while the bill proposed to abolish imprisonment for debt both before and afttr judgment and relieve the debtor from unnecessary hardship it did not leave the debtor m a worse state with respect to the recovery of his just debts the present system did not enable the creditor to obtain payment of his debt although the debtor was exposed to useless hardships  there was the greater in� convenience where the debtor was anxious to cede his propertv  hc could not do so unless all his creditors concurredand without incurring two months imprisonment this bill was intended to remove those evils the first  clauses proposed means by which a more effectual execution might be obtained against the property ofa debtor instead of being limited to onehalf the creditor should be put in possession of the whole income of the debtor s estate landed property was also to a much greater extent than undei the former bill rendered liable to the payment of debts under thc summary and compulsory process now proposed to be adopted alter being in posses  sion of the rents for one year the creditor should be consi� dered as having an equitable lien on the property every other description of property the bill proposed to render im� mediately subject to the payment of debts means havibg been adopted m the first instance of compelling the debtor to dis� close the precise state of his aflairs if a party against whom judgment had been obtained did not pay within  days his nonpayment should be considered an act of bankruptcy the objectof preventing fraud on the part of the debtor was not he assured their lordships lost sight of by the bill for their lordships would find that fraudulently obtaining credit fraudulently concealing property fraudulently re� moving property fraudulently making false accounts or false statements fraudulently altering mutilating or falsifying books and fraudulently absconding to defraud a judgment t k tmi makna discovery of property were all stated to be misdemeanours for which the party was rendered amenable to the ordinary tribunals of the country there were clauses in the bill which would provide against all fraudulent conduct on the part of the debtor the creditors would also have a right to seize on the debtors property and to divide it among them if these provi� sions were raade law between the debtor and the creditor it would follow that as a general rule the law of arrest would no longer form part of the law of this country still there were some cases in which he thought that there must be exceptions to that general rule and in which the power of arrest must not be entirely done away with for instance if a creditor had reason to believe that ms debtor was likely to abscond to another country to defraud him of his debt it was only proper that he should have some means of gewng at his debtors person in order to prevent him the bill therefore provided that in such cases the power of arrest should remain and even extended it further than the law al� lowed at present under the existing law the creditor could only arrest his debtor at the commencement of the suif and yet in the progress of it he might learn that his debtor was about to abscondand then where was his power to prevent him  there was also opportunity given to debtors to abscond from their creditors especially if they happened to be in the country owing to the delays with which the suing out of bailable writs was attended this evil would also be re� medied by this bill for it provided that at any stage of an action upon making affidaait of the intention of the debtor to abscond the creditor should have power to obtain from any justice of peace in the neighbourhood a warrant to arrest the person of the debtor to prevent however this provision from being converted into an engine of opppression against the debtor it was also provided that this warrant should be liable to the supervision of the judges at westminster and that if the party were arrested without due cause should be dismissed with costs against thc creditor who had applied for it he thought that these provisions would be found a greit improvement on the present state of the law and would prove to be remedies highly beneficial to the creditor after some observations which were quite inaudible in the gallery the noble and learned lord proceeded to state that if their lordships should be of opinion that the bill did not give the creditor sufficient means to secure his debt another plan might be devised by which without in� flicting greater hardship on the debtor greater security mirht be perhaps given to the creditor that plan would not form part of his bill but he would state it to their lordships as it might meet their approbation in case thev did net like that which he had alreaty proposed when there was a declara� tion verified upon oath ofthe defendants intention to escape an arrest of his person might take place he would thertj fore suggest that the creditor should have thc right to arrest his debtor under certain limitations but as soon as the debtor should have put in bail the creditor should be bound to bring him before thc commissioner in the country who should forthwith examine him as to the state of his property if the commissioner should upon that examination find that he had no property he would of course order him to be dis� charged  if on the other hand he sheuld find that hehad pro� perty he would without adjudicating on the circumstances order him tobe discharged on giving security to the creditorfof the amount of his debt provided that debt were subsequently proved by the verdict of a jury this would mitigate to a certain extent the hardships of the law it would anticipate nothing for the suit would go on asbefore andit would have this additional advantage that it would bring both debtor and creditor together before an impartial personand would thus stop nine out of every ten actions that were bronght it would bring to the knowledge ofthe creditor what he had to expect and to the knowledge of the debtor what he had to perform this would generally terminate the sut altogether and ob� tain for the creditor all that he had a right to demand from his debtor the bill it was clear could not be carried into effect without the appointment of commissioners in the dif� ferent counties of england and wales ih london the ma� chinery for carrying the bill into effect would be found in the existing court of reaiew and its commissioners their lord� ships had frequently heard of late that the court of review had not sufficient employment if this bill should pass they would soon have ample businessenough on their hands it was clear however that there must alio be a number of com� missioners dispersed throughout the country for the purpose of carrying it into effect there it was admitted on all hands that great benefit had aiisen to bankrupt estates under the recent alterations of the bankrupt laws and it was likewise admitted that that benefit had arisen owing to the working the bankrupt estate in the metropolis under official commis� sioners and assignees there was a wish to extend the same plan to the country but tbere was some difficulty as to the mode in which it was tobe done in the country there were no official assignees no standing commissioners and if th system which now prevailed in london were extended to the country it would require lhe establishment in each district both of standing commissioners and of official assignees now thisbill provided for theestablishmcntofsuchofficers in the various districtsof the country who would perform tbebusihess in bankruptcy and also in insolvency which this bill would transfer to them after several other observations which for the reasons already stated were quite inaudible to lis the lord chancellor observed that important as this subject was not only to those who were now imprisoned for debt but aiso to those who sought to recover their debts by means of that im� prisonment it would still be carried into execution without any extensive or complicated machinery he could not but think that the adoption of the principles of this bill would be a great blessing to thecountrythatjit would be a great im� provement to those who were in the situation of creditors and to those who were in debt and who from their inability to pay their debts were now in prison he trusted that tbeir lordships notwithstanding the late period of the session would turn their consideiation to this important question anci that both thc debtors and creditors of the country would reap the advantages of their lordships turning their deli� berations to this measure the noble and learned lord con� cluded by moving that the bill be now read a second time the duke of wellington felt that he owed an apology to their lordships for rising to address them imme� diately after the noble and learned lord on the woolsack  but as this was a subject to which great public attention had bcen drawn as there were a vast number of persons deeply interested in the adoption of some measure of this de� scription and as this measure by proposing a new system of law involved in itself very urge and extensive interests he deemed it to be his duty to come forward and to propose to them not to consider it at the present advanced period of the session the noble and learned lord had stated accurately to their lordships the dates ofthe different periods at which this measure had been previously produced to their lordships the noble and learned lord had stated that it was brought up to tlieir lordships house last year on the th of august and that it was laid on their table this year on fhe th of june  and had compared the period of the th of august a with the period of the uth of june  as if there were nd other circumstances existing in parliament to be taken into consideration bn this subject except thc dates at which the measure had been introduced if he was not such mistaken there was then upon the table of their lordships a greater quantity of business to be transacted than was ever known before at so late a period of the session their lordships had heard reports and he hoped that they were well founded that parliament would be prorogued nt the end of this month or at the beginning of the next their lord� ships knew of measures of far greater importance which were about to be sent up to them and on which it wouldbe necessary for their lordships to decide and under these cir� cumstances considering that some of the noble and learned lords had already set out upon their circuits and that others of them must soon leave for their circuits he humbly submit ted that if it was expedient on the th of august  to postpone the consideration ot this measure to a distant period it was also expedient to adopt a similar course oh this llth of july  on which day the noble and learned lord on the woolsack had submitted the second reading of it again to their notice he entirely acquitted the noble and learned lord who brought forward this bill last year and whose absence from his parliamentary duties he lamented as much as any of their lordships could dohe entirely acquitted he said that noble and learned lord and also thenoble and learned on the woolsack of any neglect of duty in ndt bringing this bill for� ward at an earlier period what he contended for wat tbat as they now found themselves at that late period of the ses� sion with so much business before them it was impossible to enter now into the discussion of the second reading of thisbill hc did not admit because he desired to postpone this mea� sure for future consideration that he therefore approved of its principle nor did he mean to state at present any opinion upon its principle but this he would say of this billthat there were some parts of it whichmade an important altera� tion in lhe law of england and inthe tenure of landed pro� perty and he therefore called on their lordships not to enter into the consideration of such a incisure at a time when thev could not carry it into execution or come to a decision which would be satisfaiatory either to themselves or to the public hc must also observe that the noble and learned lord on t woolsack had stated some circumstances which induced hi to be of opinion that it would bc desirable to postpone further consideration of this measure to a future time t noble and learned lord had stated that in the early parts  the billthat is in the first  clausessome vety important alterations had been made since it was before the house last session he had likewise stated that in the concluding parts of the bill which related to the poaver of arresting the per� son he should have some alterations to propose at a future time it appeared to him likewise that in respect to that part of the bill which referred more particularly to the creation of patronage and which formed no inconsiderable portion of it in the consideration of their lordships hear hear the plan was exceedingly incomplete anil thete must be in his opinion many more enactments to render the employment of tbe vast body of commissioners appointed under this bill desirable or even beneficial to thc public hc confessed that in the view which he took of this bill and he would not enter into many of its details nor indeed would he follow the noble and learned lord on the woolsack through those decails into which he had entered he should say of it that instiiad of being one bill it should be divided into four bills there was one part of it quite distinct from all othersnamely that which relat� ed to judgment debtors there was another subject also quite distinctnamely that whiclitelated to what avas called the cesstobonortim there was a third subject which was also distinct from the others and that related to the punishment of fraudulent debtors the fourthandlast part was alsodistihct and related totbe power of arresting thciperson iurespect to the first of these subjects he must observe that it made a most remarkable change in the whole �ystrn of the tenure of he iim the the of property m this countrya change which might be necessary to adopt to give creditors a fair hold on the property of their debtors whichwasa claim thatmustbeattendedtoandorwhich if it were necessary he would say at once  let it be made he had however examined the returns on their table and it appeared to him from that examination that the number of judgment debtors in proportion to thc number of persons against whom affidavits of debts were filed was really quite trifling he saw in one of the returns that the number of ludgment debtors against whom affidavits had been sworn in all the courts of law in this metropolis in thelast two years sonanhifjanuntlid onlto  though there hadbeen  affidavits of debt swom within that time now that it was proposed to overturn all the old system of landed pro� perty he implored their lordships to look at this question from another point of view from the same return to which he had just adverted it appeared that out of the number of pesonnstwhonffidattsh�d been lodged there were only  and odd whose debts exceeded  there were only  and odd whose debs exceeded we did not hear the sum and to lay hold of these persons their lordships were called upon to overthrow all the existing system of real anil personal property in england if it were truethat the great landowners ef england and the great merchants of eng� land were persons who sought to evade the just payment of their aebtsttjthcir creditors their lordships ought te pass this bill but if it were nottruethen hesaid that the first  clauses ot this bill were unnecessary and he therefore again recom� mended their lordships to postpone this bill fora longerpe� riod before they adopted a clause so disgraceful to the gentry and merchants of england as that clause ot it which compelled them to give up their property to the payment of those debts which ot themselves theywere not reluctant to pay there as another part of this biil which he did not exactly under� stand and which he should wish to have time given to their lordships in order that they might fully consider it the noble and learned lord on the woolsack had stated what was perfectly true that the first  clauses of the bill referred en tirely to judgment creditors the other clauses down to the uith or the th claase referred to the cases of debtors asramst whom no judgments had been obtained what was the object of those clauses  the object was to bring those debtors against whom no judgment had been obtained under the operation of the bankrupt laws but how were they to be brought under the operation of the bankrupt laws  they were to volunteer to petition the commissioners they could not be arrested their persons could not be touched but they were of their own accord to petition the commission� ers to be brought under the operation of the bankrupt laws this was a mockerynothing more hear hear could this give any security to the creditor  if the man were ar� rested he the duke of wellington could then understand how he would be induced topetition to be brought under the operation of the bankrupt laws but under this bill there was to be no such thing as arrest and the debtor was ol his own accord to petition to be made an object for the bankrupt laws in one word he would say that it appeared to him that it was qttite impossible that such a system could ever answer the noble duke whose exhaustion rendered him very inaudible during the remainder of hisspeech then pro� ceeded to observe that the noble and learned lord on the wool� sack had spoken of the court for the relief of insolvent debtors in a way in which it appeared to him that that court did not deserve he the duke of wellington thought that that had been a most efficient court he saw from the returns on their lordships tabic that in one year  per� sons had been in the prisons of the metropolis some in exe cutionand others upon mesne process of this number  had been discharged by order of the court for the relief of insolvent debtois at the end ofthe year  still remained in prisonand therefore the remainder must have satisfied the claims of their creditors and liberated themselves he the duke of wellington could not call that court inef� ficient which had produced such an effect that was in london but that court had also discharged within the same time not less than  persons in different parts of the country lfthe period before which the court for the relief of insolvent debtors will not discharge pri� soners in confinement for debt be too long why does not the noble and learned lord introduce a bill to shorten the period  he believed that the period of imprisonment had been fixed at two months to avoid the commission of those frauds which would be the consequence of that courts having power to liberate prisoners at the expiration of a shorter period if the noble and learned lord en the woolsack was of a different opinion why should he not bring in a bill to continue for a longer period the existence of the court for the relief of in� solvent debtors and to shorten the period at which they were to be liberated from confinement  with regard to the third part of the bill which related to the confinement and punish� ment of the fraudulent debtor he had not seen any sufficiently stringent remedy in it as the law stood now the judge of the court for the relief of insolvent debtors had power to refuse to liberate any debtor whom he found in a state of fraud against hiscreditors or other persons that was a species ot confinement of which he understood the noble and learned lord on the woolsack to complain under this bill however the fraudulent debtor must be re sularly indicted before the ordinary courts of law their lordships all knew the difficulties which stood in the way of getting such proofs as would support such an indict� ment  and thc getting of such proofs was not at all facili� tated by the clauses contained in this bill hc now came to what he said ought to be the fourth part of this billhe meant the clauses which prevented the arrest of the debtors person except in cases where the creditor had good reason to believe that it was the intention of the debtor toabscond to evade the payment of his debt he believed that the mercantile classes ef the country aud more particularly the shopkeepers and traders were deeply interested in baaing some power over the persons of their debtors but their interest in having such power was not greater than that of the lower classes of the people if the lower classes of the people should have no power to recover their debts they must often be left in cir� cumstances of great difficulty especially in times and seasons like the present under all these circumstances he asked their lordships not to pass a vote which should condemn tliis bill but to pass such a vote as was necessary to postpone the consideration of it and with that object in view he moved their lordships to put off the second reading of this bill from tonight to this night three weeks hear hear lord abinger next addressed their lordships but in so low a tone ef voice that ave regret our inability to give more than an imperfect report of his observa� tions
