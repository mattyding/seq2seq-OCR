rirlandfroir our own correspondentdublin july nationfal associatzona meeting of this body was held this afternoon at the cornexchange inconsequence of a notification publisbed in the moming papers that a lctter from ilr oaonneu wa to be read at the meetingthetc was a numerous attendance al halfpast  oclock mr coppinger was called to the chairafter some routine business the secretary read the follow ing letter to the miiemibers of the nationali association of ireland  hereditary bondsmen know ye notvho would be free themsejce must strike thcblowfellowcountrymeni find by the dublin papers re ceived this day that you have already constituted the associa tion for ireland under the name of the national  should have preferred for the present the name of  general  but of course  submit my own opinion upon matters of detail to yours i may be permitted to say that i should have desired to reserve the name of  national tor the occasion in which by the judgment of all reasonable men tory injustice and lordly insolence may render it necessary for ircland to assume once again a national attitude but there is one point which involves a practical principle of great value and a legal point of some nicety  mean the keeping the association preisely as the catholic association was perfectly free from any connexion or community withi any other society or union i deem this matter of the moast vital importance and only beg of you to recollect that the catholic association steered its course untouclhed and unas sailed amidst the quicksands and shoals of the law under my legal guidance i am not i trust presumptuous in expressing a hope that this new association will pay some attention to my advice and that advice most distinctly and enmphatically is not to have any species of connexion with any other body tbis in my mind is the more necessary because there are now other bodies of great value in themselves and of great importance which maybe pressed upon you i mean in par ticular the trades union the central committee and the parochial committees as well as the registry society amongst these the tradesunion is preeminent in length and number and magnitude of services and will i trustlong contnue to prove its undoubted patriotism and utility but it should continue to move within its own sphere and in its own orbit as should all the other bodies i have mentioned there should not be and in fact there cannot betany jealousy or rivalship but my nmost unequivocal opinion is that the national association should be totally uticonnected with any other body in order to display national utility which cannot be without perfect freedom of selfaction i would not dwell upon this topic but that i look ur to the new association as the best perhaps the only neans of preserving for england and securing to ireland thepeaceful benefits of the iteform bill i entertain the strongest expec tations of the great and permanent benefits to be derived fromn our association we must act with firmness and therefore should act with the greatest prudencewe must act with per severance and therefore should neglect no precaution to secure to ourselves perfect free will upon the one hanid and perfect freedom from legal difficulties on the otherin plaun truth we have occasion for all the qualities that make men useful as patriots and good subjectsundisturbed pitience united exertions unremitting perseverance per fect respect for the laws but the most energetic and continu ous determination to usc all and every constitutional means to procure for ireland justice complete justice equal justice this is an arduous struggleit will be a lengthened struggle unless we grapple with the difficulties of our politi cal situation like men who deserve to be free because they wvill not endure for one acauiescing moment the brand of slavery or unjust inferiority let us then look our difficulties in the face with a firn and unshrinking eyewe bave formidable enemies to encounter we have formidable enemies to overcome let us not dis guise front ourselves the number and the strength of our ene mies it the people of ireland protestant catholic pres byterian and dissenters are once deeply convincedof the foul degradation now cast upon them and of the worse mis chiefs and horrors confemplated by their enemies the result of that conviction will certainly be a peaceful constitutional but truly national uprising of all that is virtuous and good in the landan uprising that will drive the enemies ot irish liberties into despair and render our success certain and speedvour enemies however are mtny and formidable there are first the electors of the english counties wh o are gene raly a very uninformed and easily misled racethey are wretchedly dependent in too many instances on their tory landlords they are also liable to be operated on by the un christian cry of  no popery the parsons of the esta blished church in lngland inflame the bad passions of the fanners by every species of calumny they do not perceive that they are thus daily undermining their own religion and depriving it of the respect of all considerate men by making its influence an instrument to increase dissension between the various parts of the empire and of perpetuating injustice towards so large a class of his majestys subjects they are indeed  unwise men in their own generation and instead of making proselytes from the catholics to protestantism they have directly the contrary effect the farmers moreover teel the competition in their own markets of the produce ol the irish agriculturists and a foolish jealousy induces tlhem to hate and oppose tise irish they thus by countenancing the oppression of ireland keep our country ia poverty and distress the foolish men do not perceive that the greater the poverty of the irish the less will they consume ot their own agricultural produce and the greater will be the quantity of that produce thrown into the english markets to compete with the english farmers at their own doors silly men they do not see that the class in england which has the highest and most pressittg interest in the pros perity of ireland are thc english farmerssimply because if the irish were prosperous they would easily consume all or nearly all their own protisions and leave the home market of england to the english farmers whose produce must at once in that case rise enormously in price next to the farmers our worst enemies are the english parsons and some of the wesleyan alethodists not all by auy meansbut these two as classes are opposed to the interests of the people of ire land upon grounds of bigotry and intolerance which are in pervious to reason and argument and it must be left to time and to ridicule to thin the ranlks of those opponents and create amongst them sensations of shame and a sense of christian charity the next class of our opponents are the majority of the peers instigated by the very worst and most contemptible of our miserablc peeragetho pitiful vesev fitzgeraldtbe lord glengall who has earned for himself the sobriquet of i the slicebeen earlthc imiarquis of uestmeath bless the mark    and others of that species of indescrihables but the peers have stronger and better teasons to hate ireland and the irisls they know that the rcform bill could never have been carried but for the zealous active and dis interested pattiotism of the representatives of the people of ireland we turned the scale in favour of english reform and hence arises the bitter and unrelenting hatred of the bo roughmnongering peerage of englandt besidestheyactuallyaim at eitlierrepealing or destroying the effect of the reform bill encouraged by so tmany ot the fanners who are slavishly inclined they would risk the peace of the cmpire and the safety of the throne rather than allow the current of popular liberty to flow on in its presett chan nel to sweep away abuses and cleanse the corruptions by which so many of the british institutions have beenjtoi long taintedl nc next great obstacle we have to encounter is the tory i faction headed by stanley peel and wellington we know them well we know their conduct when the two latter were in office we know that they selected lord hladdington as lordlieutenant because his paucity of intellect and want of fixed principles made him an advisable tool for the oppres sion of ireland we sawv the flag inscribed  no popery insulting seveneights of the people of ireland and waving over his head nwe saw all the bigots in proportion lo their virulence and hatred to the irish people shaw lefroy jack son promaoted and rewardedievery measure uscful to ireland has been opposedstrcnu ously opposed by that partywcrc they againto regain powerireland would be

look around you and see who would fill that bench aud wbat hope tlhere could possibly be of peace or tranquillity for ireland if the lefroye tbe shaws the jacksons were to be judges ol the land  but this is too frightful a picture to be looked at without something like insanitrdo i exaggerate the intentions of the tory party  no i diminish their intensity and their atrocity there is the great organ of their party that in which they publish their inanifestoes there is their avowed autho rized publication the quarterly rctlien what plan do they develope  whaot project do they dissolvethis

sufficiently virulent to express our just indig nation and contempt  and eyen if we did we may easily scorn to use them let our actions speak for uslet one universal cry resound throughout ireland the

tbemselves must strike the blow when the catholic association was formed the people of england were nearly all adverse to or careless of us the people of scotland were then powerless and therc fore inattentive thiey could not have served us if they would and at that timne many of them for they didl not know what true hearts lreland contained would not assist us if they could the hlouse of commons presented a nominal but un certain and wayering majority in our favopr the house of lords almost to a man rejected our approaches with haughty disdain bnt in ireland itself what was our foundation of hope  the catlholic people were apathetic orin despair the catho lic nobility was unfriendly or indifferent the catholic clergy especially of the higher orders were suspicious if not more the second order of the clergy were unroused and but little interested the best of the protestants showed symptoms of disgust or disapprobation and the fbrmidable and organized force of orangism took the field at once against us not figuratively but in downright earnest yet with all these difficulties with obstacles apparently insusmountatble we succeeded irishmeni we succeeded   we were true
