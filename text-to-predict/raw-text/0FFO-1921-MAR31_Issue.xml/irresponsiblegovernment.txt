irresponsible governmentthe relaxation in the control of parliament over the executive and the decay of minaerial responsibility which are the legacy of the war would have been dangerous to the constitution at any period but they are particularly dangerous at a time likc ths present it is a time of transition the public mind is disquieted new ideas are fermenting in the minds of large bodies of the people and there are enemies among them eager to stir up discontent withz our historic constitutional system for ends of their own respect for responsible goveri ment and for parliamext is our best safeguard against deagerous tendencies which may be lurking in any quarters and upoa which these enemies are anxous to trade but this respect bss undoubtedly waned since the conclusion of the armistice anxd it will conxtinue to diminish so long as parliament con sents merely to register the decrees of a cabinet which has ceased to be really responsible to it the mischief as mp mnay macdonpond observes goes back to a period before the war but the war has magdified it and intensified it to a degree that is not yet generally recognized the changes which have taken place in our institutions and still more in the custom of the constitution that has directed their working in the past are in mr macdonoa s words  totally opposed to its spirit and tradition  and this is particularly true of those war changes which tend to conceatrate a semipresidential power in the hands of the pbnm mxsten it has been shown in former articles how close this concentration has become how destructive it is of the first principles of parliamentary government and how directly it proceeds in its present extension from the extraconsti tutional methods rightly and necessarily adopted to meet the supreme crisis of the war it is said that the disease lies deeper and that it cannot be remedied withoit farreaching modifications of our traditional system that however is not the question for the moment let us get rid of the entirely novel conceptions of the position of the pan m bnusm towards his colleagues and towards parliament and of the equally novel conceptions of cabinet responsibility bequeathed by the war before we embark upon further innovations when the changes which have crept upon us while all eyes were turned to the prosecution of our greatest struggle for freedom have been undone it will be time enough to ponder the wisdom of deliberately adopting considered modifica tions in the rights and in the duties of parlia mentthe present system it has been shown is a prolongation into peace time of the methods devised and sanctioned by public opinion for the more efficient conduct of the avr the war cabinet was perhaps the most remarkable of the instruments devised for that purpose it worked admirably but in its nature and in the temper which it naturally fostered in its members it was utterly opposed to the system and to the spirit of parliamentary government it was a dictatorship set up for the salvation of the statea dictatorship in commission at the first but a dietatorship which from its chacter and from the condi tions in which it lived tended to pass into the uncontrolled hands of the prtm mnsm the secretary of the cabinet sm mauaice eraneey has described the gradual growth of what he terms  diplomacy by conference  in a paper reprinted in the current number of the round table re traces the process by which the war committee was evolved from the committee of imperial defence created in  the war cabinet from the war com mittee and the splendidly successful british  empire delegation at the peace conference through the war cabinet he has much to say of how the supreme wvar council of  was followed by the council of ten the council of ten by the council of fqur and how the council of ambassadors was set up as an auxiliary body but his treatment of his subject has not led him into any indiscretions about the dangerous functions originally assigned to the secretariat of the war cabinet and now exercised by the sccretariat to the existing cabinet very much as they were exercised in the blackest days of the uar he is as might be expected an ardtnt admirer of the system of which he was a cobuilder if not indeed an associatearchitect there is nothing like leather and he is con vinced that  diplomacy by conference with as he insists a suitable secretariatis infinitely superior to what he regards as the antiquated system of diplomacy by diploma tists a great deal depends upon thc secre tariat sir maucice thihks it best to have only one secretary at conferences and presumably also at cabinets and he explains that  a really  good and discrcet the qualifications are im portant a really good and discreet prgaid is preferable to stenographic notes because this tends to greater freedom of discussion shorthand notes in fact may be inconvenient they are also inartistic they leave noroom for discretion but sg maurice is hardly just to the professional diplomnatists they knew all about his favourite system long ago if he will look at the little  sketch of the congress of vienna published for the historical section of the foreign office during the war he will see that the method which he prefers nowadays that governments are really re sponsible to parliaments elected on the widest franchise was strictly foowed by casmerbagu taxyaaid metrrih and ness orios over a century agoso strictly indeed that they never allowed the congress as a whole to come into existence at awl he thinks with apparent regret that it is  doubtful  whether the name of the supreme council will endure  but vidently he does not believethat this particular machinery can be dispensed wvith sn maurce records with pride that this body beld  meetings in  days that it reached  conclusions and that the reeords of its proceedings fill ten large typewritten volumes  we can well believe it but this is on the face of it a conclusive condemnation of the whole grand vizier system as it as applied in paris and as there is reason to believe it is being applied under our vitiated constitution today it is utterly impossible that any four human beings could adequately examnine ond discuss the massof business which these statistics represont the mere attempt to do so is conclusive evi dence of the vils of excessive concentration thecouncilof four did notaccept on secondary points as commonsense should have taught them to do the studied reports of their very competent experts they sought to investigate everything themselves and to settle the details of ahnost all questions themselves the result wax the ten volumes of pro ceedings grateful to the secretarial mind and the oractical failureswhiah are still dis turbing europe asid for which the remedy pro posed will doubtless be more conferences the nodel is about as bad a model for a peace cabinet as the mind of man could select this systen where there is no present responsibility to colleagues nothing but naked personal decision on the paxt of individual prime miniters and where only accomplished and irrevocable facts are submitted to the legisla tures of the countries concerned is the very reverse of responsible government it is in its essence autocratic and its inevitable tendency is to beget and foster the autocratic temper
