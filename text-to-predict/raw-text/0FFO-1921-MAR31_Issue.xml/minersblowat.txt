miners blow at nationpits to befloodedall work to stoptonightsir r horneswarningby our labour correspondentminers leaders took a plunge yester day into the waters of revolution notices were dispatched to the districts instructing the men to cease work at midnight tonight when govermment control of the industry endsthe instruction is to be obeyed re gardless of occupation that is to say not only will the hewers of coal and the pithead workers concerned in the getting of coal not function but the engine men and punpmen whose work keeps the mines free from flooding and venti lates them will stop also if the instruc tions are followed not only will the miners in a short time have cut thern selves off from the possibility of earning their own living but they will haave struck a deadly blow at the fortunes of other industries and taose engaged in thema decision of such incredible folly indicates the desperate extremes to which the leaders are driven to make good their casesimnilar action has been threatened on the eve of coal strikes in the past in one case tlhat of the sectional yorkshire strike in the summer of  it was carried into effect with results from which the yorkshire miners bave not recovered to this day and only by the efforts of the bluejackets who kept pumping operations going were the p its saved usually however the threat has boeen a lever for bargaining on this occasion the orders have been issued and they will not be easy to recall if the decision was taken for bargaining pur poses the executive have omitted to take nto consideration the shortness of time reanaing before their orders become operative and the difficulty of counter manding them a few hours delay might mean a great deal in such circumstances against the governmentthe miners have openly and fully ex pressed their appreciation of the immense difficulties facing the owners in the pre sent state of the industrv mr hodges in his article in the timcs yesterday admitted that the industry is bankrupt only one construction therefore can be placed on their action and that is that it is intended as a demonstration against the government and a reply to their refusal to extend control or give a subsidy in that case responsibility will be placed on the governments shoulders whicll they have not hitherto borne if the threat is carried into full effect the use of bluejackets for pumping in a restricted area under control is a different proposition from their use throughout the whole of the coal fields after control with its responsibili ties has been removed the owvners therefore will await with intense anxiety some sign of the governments intentions in this respectsir btobert horne put the consequences of persistence in their line of action very plainly before the miners leaders at his conference with them last night and placed himself at their disposalt any time today if they consider any recanta tion or mitigation if there is no repent ance at the eleventh hour the nation may face the fact that it has deadlier enemies than it believedand may prepare for a serious struggle the merse plunge gives rise to the possiblity on the one hand that they themselves may be nearly drowned meta phorically speaking but unfortunately it may also mean that others may be drawn in the executives of the other partners in the triple alliance meet this morning and it is not without significance that their meeting should take place at this juncture some of the moderate influences in the alliance may not be at work when meetings take place mir j h thomas mp for instance was absent from the subcommittee when it met yesterday to make arrangements for the meeting today and it is possible that he may not be able to be present todayminers at varianceif no better understanding is come to in the few hours that remainonlv one hope is left for the prevention of this crime against the nation it is that the engineen and pumpmen may be wiser than their leaders and refuse to obey orders willingriess has been shown in more than one direction to take elemen tary precautions for preserving the means of livelihood for the miners as a whole whatever the merits of the general dis pute may be and the owners are believed to have offered favourable termus if it is done not only that but up till the time at which the executive of the federation met yesterday the engine men and punpmens organization one of the federated bodieswas agree able to the acceptance of the termsbut was overruled by the executives deci sionin a number of districts the miners have shown that they do not look on the present moment as favourable for press ing to the utmost the fundamental differ ences between the owners and the men as to national or district rates the leaders have professed full belief in the loyalty of the districts but their last decision is bound to alienate moderate opiniondivision in the ranks of the vedera tion which otherwise would be slow in developing may be hastened it would be unwise to build too much on such hopes of deliverance but they are distinctly on the horizon divisions of this kind how ever cannot be entirely good inasmuch as they hold the seeds of the worst kind of manifestation of industrial warsir robert home consulted with the prime minister yesterday and while the miners executive were meeting at their offices in russellsquare met air evan williamis president of the mining association lord gainford and other prominent representatives of the owners and went further into the figures relating to the effect of the owners proposals on wages in the districts sir xobert hore was accompanied by mr bridge man secretaty for mines and other technical advisersthe miners lxeeutive in the mean time had come to their decision mr frank hodges the general secretary in a statement at the close said they had further considered the situation in view of the expiration of the owners forialoctices tonight and had resolved tocontinued in next columnsend the following communication to the districtsall notices must take effect regard less of oceupation in every mine and plant under the miners federationa subsidy impossibleafterwards the executive proceeded to the board of trade to meet sir robert horne and remained with him for an hour and a half mr hodoes opened the case for the miners and demanded that the state should subsidize the coal industry and provide the means to pay wages greater thanthe proceeds of the coal industry could under the present circumstances yield he asked on behalf of the federation that an arrangement shoulde set up by which the profits of the industry should be pooled so that the pits which could tot be operated except at a loss should be subsidized by the more profitably managed collieriesbesm robent honitn speaking for the government replied that it was impossible that the state could provide any subsidy for the coal industry lle pointed out that sub sidies in themselves were no remedy for the difficulties faciug them and even if they were it was entirely outside the capacity of the state at the present time to provide such help most of the other great industries at the present time were in a worse position than the coal industry in many of them the work people were not only unable to get their previous rate of wages but were unable to get any employment at all it was impossible to tax the other already crippled industries of the country in order to provide a grant in aid for the coal tradebefore the conference closed mr herferbt snrru the acting president of the federation intimated the executives decision to with draw all workers including pumpmen adenginemne obentnt hone said this was a very grave statement to make he could scarcely oelieve he said that the coal workers of the country would allow their means of livelihood to perish as undoubtedly must be the result in many coaltields if the pits were to be flooded hxe exptessed the hope that before they actually allowed any such course of conduct to be entered upon they would re consider the matter and he asked them to reflect in the course of the next fev hours on the disastrous effect such action would have both upon themselves and the country at large in conclusion he offered to meet them again today at any timeconvenient to thtemxvhen the memben of the executive left the boawrc of trade they
