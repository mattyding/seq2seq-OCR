sbeds a flood of light on what to most of them has for two years seemed something of a mys tery the navy and army of the united states had given invaluable help in bringing the war to an etid in the peae negotiations their accredited representatives had played a pro minent part and their president in partioular was known to be the chief if not the sole autbor of the covnuant of the league ol nations yct when the protracted negotiations at last were over senate and people flatly de clined either to join the league or ratify the treaty as far as theunited states were con cerned both were stillborn the mountains and the big four had laboured in vain in americaneyes tlxo twin results were uot only ridiculous but nonexistentthis disavowal of what was undoubtedly to a large extent the result of american brainis and american energy and persuasion naturally pro duced a certain feeling of puzzled irritatiot on this side ofr the atlantic the irritation wvas kept in checl by feelings of deep gratitude for armiericaes services in the wvar ler subsequeiit attitude of aloofness has been generally ac cepted as an outcome ol her domestic politics regrettable but inevitable and therefore her own and no one clses concern now however that mr lansing has spoken any fielings of sur prise and disappointment that may still remain will probably give place to a spirit of real hope fulness for if as would seem to be the casc his point of view represents the general trend of american opinion he establishes the fact that senate and people have acted throughout fairly and squarely in all good faith withoutt any defection fronm the ideals with which they came to stand beside the allies in the warthe united states andthie leaguethey havechiefly according to mr lansing on account of mr wilsons action in paris been placed in a very difficult position there was he says beyond questibnn a demand in the states that out of the great international assembly at paris there should come some common agency devoted to the prevention of war the president was therefore entirely right in giving prominence to the idea of an nternational union the essential thing as he saw it in order  to make the world safe for democracy  was to give permnaneney to the peace a union of the nations for the purpose of preventing wars of aggrcssion and conquest seemed to him to be the mnost practical if not the only way of aecomplishing this supreme object and he urged it with earnestness and eloquence in his public addresses in this ideal he had the great bulk of the american people behind him the defeat of the democratic party in the congressional elections of novem ber  was not says mir lfansing a repudia tion of the formation of a world organization but a popular rebuke to mr wilson for his letter of october addressed to the knerican people in which he practically asserted that it was unpatriotic to support the trepublican candidates the american people still believed in and wanted somi kind of a league they were opposed to the league as mr wilson gradually came to see it in may  he de livered an address at washington from which he had carefully erased al reference to the use of physical force in preventing wars by january  he had become convinced that the use of force was the practical method of checking aggressions this conversion w as mr lansing believes probably due to the fact that he had worked out in his own mind as one of the essential bases of peace a mutual guarantee of territorial integrity and political independ ence he had reached the conclusion that this guarantee would be of little value unless supported by the threatened and if necessary the actual employment of force an attitude which mr lansing finds entirely logicalthie mutual guaranteethis question of a mutual guarantee was the rock oi which the agreement between the president and his secretary of state finally split mr wilson now believed in force m lansing on judicial settlement as the practical vay of composing international controversies in letter after letter almost invariably un acknowledged mr lansing even while they were still in america tried to explain to the president his reasons for this divergence of opinioni do ntot believe he wrote in  that it is wise to limit our independence of action a sovereign right to the will of other powers beyond this hemispherei do not believe that we should put ourselves in the position of beibg compelled to send our armed forces to europe or asia or in the alternative of repudiating dur treaty obligation    i would not like to see tho stipulations of the  guarantee  article in the then proposed panamerican treaty extended to the eeuropean powers so that they with our full agreement would have the right to cross the ocean and stop quarrels between two american republics such authority would be a serious menaco to the monroe doctrine and a greater muenace to the pananmerican doctrineassuming that americans generally shared these views of ir lansings it becomes much less difficult to understand their subsequent refusal to join tho league of nations in  he was still strongly of the same opinionthe legal principle of the equality of nations he wrote whatever its basis in factmust be preserved otherwise force rather than law the power to act rather than the right to act becomes the tunda mental principle of organization  it appears to me that a positive guarznty of territorial integrity and political independence by the nations ould have to rest upon an open recognition of dominant coercive power    ln order to avoid the recogai tion of force as a basis and the question of dominant force with theunavoidable classification of nationsintobig and little  strong  and  weak the de dred result of aguaranty might be attained by entering into a mutual tudertaking ret to impair the terri torial integrity or to violate the political sovereignty of anystate the breach of this undertaking would be a breach of the treaty and would sever the reia tioss of the offending nation with all other signa toriesin effect what mr lansing believed was that a positive as opposed to a negative guarantee of territorial integrity woiild unavoidably lead to the overlordship of the strong nations the in possibility of preserving the principle of the equality of nations and a consequent re tum to the old order he himself was aim itg at the judicial settlement insead of the diplomatic adjustment baced  by foceof international disputes and an agree ment coniaining a guaranty against ones own acts instead of a guwrmity against the acts of another in a further memorandum addressed to the president in december  on the constitu tional power to provide coereion in a treaty he wrote as followsthe censtitution confers uiponi congress the right to declare war this right i do not believe can bo delegated and it certainly cannot be taken away by treaty the ques tion arises therefore ns to bow far a pro vision in an agreement as to a league of nations whicli imposes ontthe united states the obligation to employ its military or naval forces in enforcing the termrs of the agree mnent would be constitutional     i do not tlink therefore tlat even if it were advisable anly treaty can provide for the inde pendent or joint use of the military or naval forces of the united states to compel com pliance with a treaty or to make good a guaranty in a treatyin accordance witb these ideas he drew up and stbmittedto the presidenta draft of articles suggested for discussion as possible substitutes for mr wilsons own draft of the covenant as no notice was takenr of them by mr wilson it is un necessary to discuss them here beyond saying that they cmbodied mr lansings prineiples of the equality of all nations great or small the need for judicial rather thaii diplomatie settlemenit and the avoidanee of a mutual guarantee while they were beingxwyritteu m clemenceau on december   declared himself in favour of the doctrine of the balance of pox ersupported by a concert of the great powers although this doctrine had beeh expressly repudiated by presi dent wilson a few days before in hiis speechl at ilancliestei as belonging to the old international orider wliich had resulted in the war and althoughi colonel house iniformed mr lansing at the time that he agreed with him that it was entirely con trary to the public opinion of the world it was eventually adopted by the presi dent as well as by the other members of the council of four and became the domi unant fundanmental piinciple of the consti tutioxr of the league of nationsthat for mr lansing was the ruin of mll that ho hadhoped from the league ovinigto the ipresidents determination to get the league established quickly in some form or another at any cost its constitu tion and principles as established were fundamentally opposed to his ideas oi international justice and equity and were moreover in liis opinion at variance with the constitution of the united states if his views were and are to any extent shared by the mass of hisfellowcountry men it is not so surprising as it at first seemed that the american republie has elected to stand outside the league of nations in spite of the fact that it was designed and created by its own presi dent
