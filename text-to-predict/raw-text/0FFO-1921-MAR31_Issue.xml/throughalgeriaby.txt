through algeria bymotora plague of guidesby our iotoringcorrespondmit motorisj wandering alone and at thel single call of fancyj in new places has one supreme advantage over any othier class qf tourist or giobetrotter eie has athis immediate disposal the means of swift escape from places which bore him or from people who seem likely to do so he need not consult railway guidesor worry about catching trains he simply goes away in his car fromthoseplaces orpersons with a completeness and irrevocabilitywhich must be very good fqr themi have lately wandered in a number of extremely pleasant places in this ex tremely agreeable country and i have very often been gladthat i am driving my own car and can at need drive furiously awayrom guides i lo notcare for sgudes anywherebut least of all can i beatr with them in algeria some guides are no doub excellent fellows well in structed civil and blessed with the rare gift of being ableto impart knowvledge gracefully and in an interesting manner but here these are simply lost in a fload of amateurs of the most nsoisomedesirip tion the trade of guide seemn to be national in algeria with itsrioridxpre cepts implanted in the young at the earliest possibleage it is impossibleto enter anyconsiderable village or town in a motorcar withoutbeing overwhelmed by a yelling swvarm of little ragamuffirls wini scream their anxiety to elarm a franc note byshowingyou the way to an hotel or a garage i suppose tfiatfrom these lowly beginnings  they gradually climb to that eminence which permits theni to ordertheir employers about and to enter their bedrooms without invitationtim peraet gumland othrsa guide is a vonderful person when be catches your shrinking eye at the hotel door and proffers his services and a pocketbook full of certificates and testimuonials from dukes and less august permons you may be in the presence of a scholar or a fraud a man whose whole life lies in the things e wishes you to see and enjoy or a charlatan who knows nothinz and wvose chief preoccupation after tle question of payment is the ambunt of the bommission he will get from the shops he persuades you to patronize but whichever he may prove to be he is really a very terri fying creature to the lonely traveller in search of mpresmions rather than statistics and historical data to my mind the perfect guide is he who speaks only when he is spoken to who never olfers youa mosque or a panorama unasked who can tell you about both if neces sary and vho keeps other gadfies away unfortunately he is very rare and the other sort very numeroua yet i met today one guide who pleased me i was looking at a particularly fine view from the rocky heights of constantine sitting comfortably in my car happy in the belie that there was no giide within half a lil e of me to tell me what to look at or how many kiloinetres one can see on a fine day a voice fell ou my ear  it is a fine view that i  i looked round and saw a precocious urchin obviously a candi date for honours in theguides school wearily i went through the formula to the effect that i agreed with him but required none of him he stared carefully at me and remarked  yes it is a fine view et toi tu nas iair de rien i have never yet been told by a guide except poassibly in languages i could not understand that in effect i looked like nothing on earth he should go far that boym  rmb uscericuwguithe subject of guides naturally reminds one of the one place in africa where they abound ih more terrible fecundity than any other i do not know what if anytbing the township of biskra pays mr robert hicheius for having written a book about it and tor having with miss mary anderson staged a play but i am sure both ought to get imperial royalties out of the hotels and ilides of that muchvisited resort tourists pour into the place agog to see what they call the garden of allah  they remain a few days are cajoled into buying a deal of imported rubbish sold as local and in the end depart with immense enthusiasm their places takeh while yet warm as it vere by the nat batcb biskra is most excellent businesit is moreover superbly adveatised i first met it in an algiers garage where i saw on the enormous back of a charabane brilliantly iluminated by tlhe headlights of a car the words to the ghrden of allah and back if i had not already spspected that mr hichenss most successful novel had probably ruined biskra i was sure of it then the wicketgate to the  garden of allah  it may well have been when jr hichens first saw and wrote of it today it is an incubator of gides eager insistent to show you what tlcir own detestable existence spoils there is a little village about  miles north of biskra called el kantara which enjoys i believe the fame of being the original scne of another of mr hichenss books barbary sheei itt is very charmingn and possesses a most excellent inn actinig on the ery best advice i stopped imy car there for the night instead of at biskra it was only about  oclock in the anternoon cold grey and i think raining there wvas not a eat stirring  put the car away and walked oet litc the street ivhich consists of three houses two on ne side arld cne oit the other asnd was instantly greeted with the words sir if you are a friend of mlr rubberchiienlgeg but te rest wis lost ili a torrent of my otvn profanlityreally it is intolerable that any book should so spoll ones holiday i congratulate mr hicliens on a most successfil work and i feel sure that he himself views with horror the devastation it has worked could he not now wvrite a novel showing how the evil spirit of biskra is the guide wbo shvows you the landon garden and calls it the garden of alah whereas the garden of allah is the nrme given in all grimness to the real desert of sahara by those who know something of the matter t
