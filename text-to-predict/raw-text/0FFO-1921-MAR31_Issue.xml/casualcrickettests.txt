 casual cricket tests  coljackson on newbloodi selectlon committee scouts by a specril cobmisponnecmlieutenantcotonel f s jackson discussed writh me yesterday the suggestion originally put fornvard by the titncs that trialmatches should beheld  before the series of test matches against the australians is begun this year i used to think he said  that we could secuba considerable advantage in testmatches by having played tgether before and i also used to think that atrial match wasveryde sirable but latterly ihave rather changed my view for many  years i was onthe selec tion committee which consisted of four or flive members each of whom was taking part in county cricket and all of whom met and saw various players the captain was always one of the coimrtmittee he was allowedto have a large sayin the selection of the side to play in a test match and it isvery im portant thatheshouldhave it becauseafter all the responsibility is with him i re member wellleaving out a very great player because i had not enough confidence in him in test matchesit would be a very good thinz in my opinion to have a trial match but it is difficult toarrange owing to the county pro gramme and i am not at all sure that we can not do without it my experience is that in trial matches the players  are too anxious and too careful atlnasti alwas was the idea of sidesplaingtogether does not always apply take the sides that go to australia they have been playing together all the time they have not all performed so well as when playing for their counties  i picing an eiviaswhat you want is a good selection com miitteeafpointed at once whowili really get the nedessary information from all sides tom haywird says that good fielding is the greatest asset to a team and the best results are only to be obtained by practice in the field in the position that the player will eventualy occupy in the test match we used to be very particular as to that we picked ourplayers with careful consideration as to their positions in the field i think really the selection committee ought to have three or four members who can go and scout round and take note of what they see in countycricket i would let the counties know that such people are visiting the county mnatches with a view to watching players supposing some young player comes along who is doinz wella  batsman or a fast bowlersomuebody who bas some voice in the selection of the test match team should im mediately go down and see him and report i am a little inclined to think that no very good end would be served by playing trial matches in this country when the county season is already madeup i cannotthink that financial considerations matter very much becauseall the counties were they asked would be reddy to let their good players fo if financemust be the only con siderationin cricket which it is notit spoils my whole idea of th game
