an xray crisisthe danger to reproductionnew epoch inradiographyby ou meicl coroaspondentit does not seem to be understood as yet that the sad death of dr ironside bruce constitutes in respect of its cause a crisis in xray medicine the possibility of which had scarcely been dreamed ofthe whole situation has undergone a change this is no mere question of dermatitisthe old danger with its chances of becoming epitheliomatous cancerousit is a question which reaches down to the very basis of cellular life to the socaulled  nuclear chromation that mysterious substance on which heredity itself dependslet us put the matter which is of enor mous importance in view of the problem of cancer in another way as is well known both xrays and radium emit three kinds of waves in the case of radium these are called respectively alpha  beta and  gamma and the same terms are used now by many in connexion with irays the  alpha  rays have a long wavelength and arecom monly spoken of as  soft by which is meant that they have a low penetrating power ie they can be screened off very easily by the use of metal plates or leadrubber aprons and gloves or lead glass the  gamma  rays on the other hand have a short wave length and are spoken of as being  hard  in other words they can penetrate deeply and are not easily screened offin the early days of radiological work a great many people suffered from bumns by the rays a smaller number developed a definite dermatitis ie inflamination of the skin and a few were found to have fallen victim to the cancerous growth of the skin known as epitheliomata al these three con ditionsthe burns the inflammation and the canersbelonged to the same series thus the burn came first on the seat of it the inflammation developed and on the seat of that the cancer made its appearance ths number of cases which went on to cancer was relatively very smallnaturally a great deal of public attention vas attracted by the matter and efforts were made to discover the cause it was soon found that the offending rays were the soft onesthe alpha and beta rays the late dr jean clunet of paris one of the greatest of radiologists went so far as to lay it down at that early date that the soft rays stinulated reproduction in the body cell eg cancer while the hard rays hindered it the soft rays so to speak induced a delirium of youth and growth the hard a chill of unreproductive old agethis view was borne out by the work on the the treatment of tumours and cancers cancer as is well known is a kind of rebellion of a group of body cells against the general  law of the body the rebels refuse to obey central direction which would make some of them brain cels without any reproductive power and others muscle cells with but little of this power like a hive of bees every one of which will be queen they begin to reproduce and to nourish themselves as for reproduction growth irregular active disastrous is the resulteffect on oerowtmthe garmm or hard rays put a stop to this growth just as the alpha and beta or softer rays excite it thus the problem of the pro tection of the radiographer appeared to be simple he could easily shut out the softest raysthe most dangerous onesand yet have all the hard raysthe  nondangerous  for his work when he was taking photo graphs a softer ray was best but he could protect himself agiust it when giving treat ments he wanted the hardest ray available an xray approximating in the shortness of its wave length to the gammna ray of radiumall seemed well permatitis and burns tended to disappear and with them cancers but another factor of quite another kind had not been appreciated at its full significance mtost xray workers of the early days are childless the death of the reprductive cels was not caused by the soft rays it was caused by the hard ones thus it was not only the cels of tumours and of cancers which could be injured the more active the reproductive power of any cell the more sensitive that cell to the hard raysthe ideathe dangerous nature of which was largely missed so far as the radiographer himself was concernedwas fully appreciated so far as the treatment of the patient went  at last cried radiologists all over the world  we possess a means of checking reproduction our hard rays are lethal to body cells in exact proportion to their tenden cies either to reproduce or to nourish them selvesie to growthe vista was and is dazzling for the tissues of the body could actually be classified as  more or less radiosensitive  or  more or less radioresistant not only that but tissues vary in their sensitivity at various timesreproductive cells when active are more vulnerable by the hard rays than when passive secretory and digestive cell follow the same rule tumours too vary in degrees of sensitivity the fastgrowing cancers are much more vulnerable thau those of slow growththe demand went up for new apparatus capable of producing harder and harder rays rays as hard as the radium  ga ma  ray the demand was supplied the work of treatment advanced and more and more enthusiasm was evinced by the workers   and now has come the catastrophe the hard rays have a deadliness all their own for in the healthy human body there are vital tissues of high radiosensitivity a worse thing this than the oldtime burns and in flammations a new danger more insidious more immediate and far more catastrophic the cells of the human bone marrow are enormously reproductive there the elements of the blood itself are prepared in continuous process in those vital laboratories life itself is brought to birth day by day the hard rays penetrating the bony walls of these recesses so carefully protected by nature can bring that alchemy of life to a standstillthe matter stands there today it is a new problem utterly unlike the old one for we must have these hard rays in a sense a new epochis revealed an epoch the dangers of which only serve to light up its amazing possibilities
