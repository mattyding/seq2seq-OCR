the coal crisisthe result of smn r hornes consultation with the miners representatives last night is not to relax the tension but to strain it to breakingpoint it was announced at the close of the meeting that the miners lederation had decided to withdraw all workers from the coalpits including the pumpmen and engine men that is a strike order and an extreme form of action there can be no longer any question whether the cessation of work which will presumably begin tomorrow is in the nature of a strike or a lookout the federation means to strike with all its force not only at the coalowners but at the industry on which the miners depend for their livelihood and the country for its manufactures for the withdrawal of pumpmen and enginemen will infict per manent injury on many mnes the common sense to which we appealed the other day has failed even more completely than on any similar previous occasion the object of such an extreme step evidently is to frighten the government into surrender for it cannot be supposed that the xiners really wish to destroy their own livelihood it remains to be seen whether anything will happen today to avert the threatened action sin r horne has offered to meet the miners executive at any time but it seems unlikely that he wi make any further move on his own part the proposal put forward on behalf of the miners was the one outlined in the statement by mjfiexk hodges we published yesterday it is that the industry should be subsidized by the state in order that it may be able to pay higher wages than it can at present afford sin r hone replied that the state cannot do so at the expense of other industries which are worse off but we think there is another aowermu hondgzs has put the case for the miners as well we presume as it can be put certainly no one can put it with greater authority we are very glad to have his statement and commend it to our readers who can form their own opinion of its weight it is written in the reasoned and temperate manner which we have learnt to expect from mb hodges his main argument is that the industry is in an abnormal condition and that while it is so the questions at issue between the owners and miners with regard to the future conduct of the industry cannot be thorougbly threshed out and satisfactorily settled he thinks that it is  easily within the power of the parties to agree on a scheme for the normal working of the industry and he allows that  under private enterprise a great deal can be said for the coalowners point of view but the trouble is the present unprecedented condition of the industry and he asks for temporary relief from the state to tide over the emergency until more normal conditions are established we quite see the point an arrangement such as the owners propose if come to now when a considerable part of the industry is insolvent would bear more hardly on the poorer districts than in normal times and would not be suited to them but is his plan likely to restore solvency aad normal con ditions  he suggests that it can be done without putting any burden on the taxpayer by placing  the credit of the nation at the disposal of the iadus try  for as long as may be necessary we do not quite inow what this means but it must mean a subsidy of some sort and as was made clear at yesterdays conference it would certainly be abnormal the question that occurs to us and will occur to many persons who wish to be fair but look to the national interest is whether normal conditions are likely to be restored by continuing abnormal ones the idea of the government all through we imagine has beeu to get the industry back to an economic that is a solvent and selfsupport ing condition and they think that the way to do soeis to withdraw the present artificial support and let it find its own feet rarliament has signified its approval and the outside public have given a tacit consent they are certainly not prepared to go on indefinitely subsidizing a trade which cannot pay its way because it has ruined its own market and what the miners propose is an indefinite continuance of the subsidy there is no mention of a time limit in mb hodgess statement and none ap parently was made at yesterdays conference nor is any limit to the amount suggested any government that gave a blank cheque of this kind would neither deserve nor receive public support if it were given to one in dustry any other could claim it and some could do so with better right than coal the logical outcome of that policy is that all would be living on each other but to enable the public to judge the whole position more information is needed about the extent of the proposed reduction in wage rates under the owners scheme some details are published thisi morning but they are stated in shifts and said to be roughly calculated we should like them to be verified and translated into vweekly terms no one wants to see the miners reduced to distress
