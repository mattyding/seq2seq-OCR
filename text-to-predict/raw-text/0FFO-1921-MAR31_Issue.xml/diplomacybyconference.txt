 diplomacy by conferencethe new orderi sir maurice hankeysexperiencethe development of diplomacy by conference seems to have been one of the lasting results of the war tho beginnings of the system its gradual growth from  to  its application to tho peace conference its sivival at sp as now in londonall this is examined and ex plained by sir maurice hankey secretiry of the cabinet in the mulch nunmber ofile round table his articlo is a reprint of a peper which was reid by him at a neeting of the british institute of inter national ffairs onnovember  sir maurice says that he has an almost unique experienic of conferences having attended  international meetings since  his experience of these meetings has throughout been that of a secretary and it is from the poist of view of a secretary that he approaches his subjects earlier experi ences of cricket suggest to him a comparison between the position of a secretary and that of a wicketkeeper mistakes by either are apt to prove costly both have to be pre p for hard knocks and both see a good eal of the gamesir maurice traces the real beginning of allied diplomacy by conference back to the institution of the committee of imperial defence with a permanent secretariat in  it is a little diflicult to agree with his derivation for there is more than a sus picion that the chief purpose of the committee of imperial defence was to provide a body which while having no explicit responsi bility for imperial affairs mnight in practice relieve the british govermment of some of its responsibility for naval and military decisions as a matter of fact when war broke out the imperial defence committee lapsed into completc inactivity a hiatus over which sir maurice hankey passes easily with the assumption that the beginnings of allied conferencesthe first was l milmerands visit to london early in were in the direct succession from the committee of imperial defencelhe first attempt sir maurice hankey says  to provide any definite form and orga nization to the conferences was initiated at an important meeting held in paris on novem ber  attheendofwhichitwasdecided in principle to set up permanent machinery for coordinating the efforts of the allies in the war and mr asquith undertook to make proposals from that beginning there was an uninterrupted development of the confer ence method though it was not tiul mr uoyd george became prime minister at the end of  that the conference method developed into the imperial war cabinet for the empire and not till after the italian defeat that the supreme war council became the prelude to a singe military command for the allied armies during the retreat of march expnrs wno reuaurthis is the visible growth of the system of diplomacy by conference sir maurice hankeys aim is to supply some account of the reasons behind the scenes which have made that growth inevitable and to show also from his own experience what the difficulties are which attend conferences of this kind one of the chief of these difficulties is that there are so many people who have claims to attend the meeting it is always a diffi clulty in international gatherings that if an expert of one nation is called in for a par ticular question the corresponding experts of all the other nations whether really re ired or not enter the room also once they have entered it is difficult to eject them even when their subject has been dealt with particularly if they are cabinet ministers or offlicrs or officials of high rank curiosity detains them meanwhile other subjects are raised and fresh troops of experts comc in until tho room is overcrowded and any in timacy in discussion becomes impossible it is a ieal difficulty in all international work which can only be surmounted by very frm handlinghence the tendency of the few really big nen to retire into a very small room where experfs cannot crowd in upon them hence the development of the council of four at paris when the council of ten had grown to be unwieldy by its own size every member of a committee in ordinary life knows the inconvenience of discussion among a large number of people and it is one of the merits of sir maurice hankeys paper that it shows that the rules of everyday life had in this vay an important influence on the peace conference he adds in regard to the pro ceedings of the council of four even the marshauing of their business the assembly of the representatives of the nations concemed and of the necessary ex perts and thecommunication of the conclu sions to those who had to act on them were no light task consequently in april i was admitted as secretary and continued in that capacity until the llnal separation of the council of four at the end of june some idea of the pressure on these four men may be gathered from the fact that the records com prise  meetings in  days including  sundays and occupy  large foolscap volumes of typescrit no less than  con clusions were recordedthere are many other touches in this paper of the secretary wbo has had a troublesome experience of the human inconveniences of such conferences but sir maurice hankey is convinced that diplomacy by conference bas come to stay    modern develop ments in international communications the increased dependence of nations upon each others products the extension of colonies and the increasing interest of labour or ganization in foreign policies all tend to pro duce international problems of the greatest difficulty    nowadays when govern inents are really responsible to parliaments elected on the widest franchise it is no longer advisable to rely entirely on intermnediariessir maurice is even inclined to think that if the habit of meetings between responsible jministers of the yarious countries had de veloped before the war there might have been no war and he believes thlat he sees in the crystallization of this habit the chief function of the league of nations he is clear that the authors of the covenant did well to establish a single secretarygeneralcontinued at foot of next columnhe insists repeatedly on the need for secrecy at certain stages of conferences and he commits himself without a trace of selfcon sciousness to the statementastonishing in bimthat it is of course equally essential that eventually there should be the fuldest publicity above all sir maurice hankey sees in international conferences one great beneflt that of personal touch and acquaint ance between the statesmen who are actualy directing the affairs of the nationthe earlier conferences of the war were hampered by a certain formality and re serve    as the war progressed and as the conferences became more and more fre quent the degree of intimacy became even greater real intimacy and friendship contribute materially to the success of diplo macy by conference by rendering possible ab solute frankness in discussion fministers should be free to explain to their foreign col leagues if they think fit withoult fear of dis closure al their difaculties internal and ex ternal public and personal
