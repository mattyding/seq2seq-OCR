sport in the airthg prospects of british flying almost despeiaie a few weeks ao are now brighter not without extreme public pressure the air ministry have taken the requisite steps to restore the londonpais service and now the royal aero club a voluntary body have overcome financial difficulties and have arranged a programme of sport in the air for this season as we announced yesterday an aerial derby  is to be flown round london on july  this great contest will attract large numbers to hendon the beginning and the end of the circuit but millions will have a free view of at least some part of the flight the jacques schneider cup for seaplanes is to be contested at venice at the end of july and the aero club ha arranged to assist british entrants of whom there were none last year royal cowes is to add to its attractions a race for seaplanes flying boats and amphibians the university boat race is to have a rival in the air and teams of four aeroplanes representing oford and cambridge are to compete in each of three events we re a sporting people and there can be no surer way than these competitions to stimulate public interest in flying but their utility is more than advertisement and propaganda the flying prizes given since  notably by the proprietors of the daily mail have done as much for the improvement of engines and aeroplanes as similar competitions did for the motorcar in its earlier stages the aircraft have to be designed and tuned for fixed condi tions the performance improving and the com petition being keepr each successive year the verdict of impartial judges guarantees the value of the test and public interest gildsthe iaurel wreath of victory the criticism that cup races lead to freak designs is not substantial in the first place there is often much to be leawned from the performance of a model designed with disregard for all factors not deemed essential moreover merely erratic efforts are soon weeded out by their own failure or frustrated by a change in the coaditions which they may have evaded too cleverly but in actual fact the cost of constructing aeroplanes and their engines is too great to encourage extravagant experiment there is a heavy loss on the production of a model for which orders cannot be subsequently obtained manufacturers cannot now be content with the glory of wining competitions and in drawing their designs we may be assured that they will have in mind not merely the race for which they propose to enter but the probability of future adaptation to commercial or military use we can take our pleasure in sport in the air and yet be confident that we are assisting in the real progress of aviation
