no dis creet man would embark it mnight indeed exercise the curning spectilations ofkamblers and needy advyenturers who had no capital to lose hut it did not as affected by the pre sent corn law system contain within it the elements of whole some comamercial enterprise the next evidence which he would tender to their lordships was as to the eftect which this system had os prices  and hero be nmight he allowed to ob serve that he considered the statements of agriculturists on the one hand and those of manufacturers on the other as to the assumed effect of a free trade in corn in reducing prices were greatly exaggerateil he did not believe that result wouldi he such a reduction of prices as tho one party feared and thile othier hoped lkie was aware that ill saying this lie might not give satisfaction to certain parties hut he spoke there not as an advocate but as a member of their lordships house viying his inliidual opiion oni a great public ques tion lie ilid believe that a fee trade in corn would have some effect in lowering price hiere giettinig corn at the price at which wo could procure it in dantsic it might he sold for some s per quarter clieaper than homegrown corn  or if we got it fironm maita the difference might he somewhat less but they were told that corn purchased at odessa couldi be sold hiere fur ili or s per quarter this assumed that corn was chieaper there than was warranted by the fact the gentle man mtr saunders we understood in wliose report tlhe price at odessa was stated to he e the quarter seemed asi if he wished to frighten the agricultunists here with thie very lowriced importation from that port he had however over moked one little circumstance whiceh wouild give a very different turn tio the matternamely that when this price existed at odessa the dardanelles were clint and whien thiat occurredi coret was a drug at odessa  but in ordinary caaes when thie dardanelles were open its usual price was about  which with cost of freight c woull render i t somne s or s cheaper here than hiomegrown corn as to the point so often referred loss an effectof the corn lawsa tht while we paid w or l for the ills loaf here it wa sold in many places on the continent for half that sum he would not enter into it at present for his owxn part lie did not expect any great cheapening o f bread from a free trade in corn prices no doubt would fall a little hut not ranch  but uppose thie quarter of corni was lowered is and then consider that the consumption of all kiinds of corn in thtis countryj was itoo quarters anntually or of wheat alone about iit or i quarterssee what an immnense sum would be the amount f that difference in the price hlowever lie repeated be would not now eniter into theo question of cheap bread as an effect of free tradle in corn not that he underrated or utidervalued that important consideration  but it formed no part of his present argument lo go into a question en which lie believed the landholders on time one hiand and the msanufacturers on the other had formed very exaggerated etimnates he would for a moment suppose thiat instead of s or is is was the asnountno more and no less of the difference between britislh and foreign corn soil then he would ask what did that shjilling mean l it was a laxa poll tax falling on every in dividual in the countrytdiat sort of capitation tax whlichi in thit country in civilized times was never resorted to except in somne most pressing emnergency and never at any period withiout excitinig general hatred and disgust it was a tax from which no one escaped it fell equally on all classeson thetpoor as on the richon the humble peasant who subsisted onte daily pittance whichi his indutry rmuld procure its well as on the rich man whoe
