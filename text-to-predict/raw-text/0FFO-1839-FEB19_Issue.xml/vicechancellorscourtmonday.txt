contraetsand theimniediate objet ofthe suits is to fix the defensdans in one of those capacities with personal responsi bility for the payment of the rest of the purchasemoney the argunmentwlhich ilasoccupied several daysand isofa very teeb rical annd uninteres ting natire arises upon tiree sets of demurr crs putiln by the defendants in tie diffrent claractera ini wliclh they are stied on the grounids of the want of equity defect of parties anid multifariousness and impeach ut only the frame of the suit hot inist generallv that mr attwood cilia only be considered in law as a mortgagee of the mines to thie ross pany for the rest of the purchazeumoney and that he can ouly come upon the ruins of the mines for payment of what is due to himl wvithout any account being taken ot the minerals ex tracted the pleadings in these suits therefrer of nccessity inlvolve a reat deal of wvhat orcurred in the farmer cause but the folloseing outline wvill be sufficient to make the pre sent proceedinigs intelilgible w hile the orginal suit svas pending in the court of exchequer mr attwood flied a biil fer a specific performance of the contracts the plintifis in that suit had entered into witlh him but the day after the decree of lord lvndhurst was prnossnced declaring the agreements void be obtained an order to disrniss this bll uith costs on the reversal of tlme decisio of lord lyndhlurst in the house of lords and the nrgument beidg carsequently declaredi alid mr attwood then stood in this singulku position thlt his bilt for a specific performanice of the agreements stood dismissed for want of prosecution on his own application and nor at tempt had ever been makdo to get ri of that disimissal uiider these circumnstances it became necessary ftr mr at wood to eek redress in this eourt not by a bill for a sperific perforniance but by a declaration that upoii the true on strnction of the agreements the defendants or sonie sf them are personally liable to him under the contracts for payment of the remainider of the purchasemonev the bifl for this purpose set out the three agreements by the firstsmal i shears and taylor the managing directors of the coninany agreed to purcbase tho mines of mr attvwood for wi tf this surn  llm was to be deposited in exchequerbills sin the exen u tion of the agreement  was to le paid on the  st of october fellov ing and the rest bv instalments beanrig inter est mr attsvood wvas to make out a title bv the lst of octa ber and give possession to the trustees of the coumpany to v om the property wvas to be conveyed to secure the instal ments the second agreement was made on the st of october which recited that it hlad been determined ir conse quence of the state of timc title to vary the former agreement and to snake an abateoiient of lit in thie purchase noney andi that it was agreed upon delivery of tbe exchequerbills and payment of the uou small shears and taylor stould be let into possession in as ample a manner as if tlie tale had been accepted without such possession being deeniecd an acceptance o the title or abandonment of their right to have all reasonable objections to the title removed at mr attwodois expense wvho wras on or before tele tlt of april iui wvhethier the title nas then completed or ileo to convey the estates as tbolugh the title w ere complete under the former agreement but the payment of thc instal ments was niot to be disturbed her the interest on a sum of iooo dovn to scobcr lid dbt iotead of that in stalment beinig then paid it should be left for  years as a security by way of mortgage of the estates at  per cent  andl if on the th of october iz va there should be ny celid objections remaining to the title then small shcars and taylor were to be at liberty to remove such objection at the ex pense of attweod but suclh objection if it should not be ia the power of attwood to remtove should be waved by the companv and attwood was to execute a bond of iidemuitv agaiutst any remaining defects in the title and the tljwas to continue during the  years upon trusts for the like indemnity and the whole if necessary or a proper part was to be detained at the entd of toe  years in the names of the trustees for tme same purpose by the tlhird agreemelit executed in november  which was the most material as to the personal tesponrlqulitt of some of the de fendants it was agreed that small shears and taylor should be exonerated and discharged from all personal lia biiity to the payment of any sum of money by reason of their having been parties to or having signed the former agree ments or from any act nhatsoever in anywise relatlig thereto or consequent thereon except that they should re tnain liable for the payment ot the inlterest on thi remaining instalments of the purchasemoney but that attwood should be content as his security for the principal with the security of thie estates to be conveyed to trustees in the manner ex pressed in the agreements vwith powers of sale to criable the trustees to raise and pay such of the instalments as shurld fall due from time to time witb the interest it being nevertheless understood that no sale should be made or proceedings taken for that purpose uintil attwood sbould have given six months notice previous to sueb sale nor until the time mentioned in the notice had expired after detail ing thest agreements the bill set forth the proceedings in the original suit in the court of exchequer and tlhen wvet on to state that no trustees had ever been appointed nor any con veyances executed to the comapany but that the comipany had entered into possessien of the mines and wcre still in pess sion by their agents and in addition to hing worked the old mines had oponed new pits and extracted great qnantities of coal and ironstone it further stated thbt attswood hd been idduced to forego the personal responsibility of the three managing directors who had signed the contracts en be half of the compsoy on the fauth end cenfidense that they would honestly discharge the debt and without any apprehension they would hare involved him in a suit of such enormous magnitude as he lied been subject to in the court of exchequer the bil further alleged that when the last arreement was entered into only a emall part ef the o pita had been paid ad that a suma of ï¿½l still remainedine to him which the cempany deolared their intention not to payif theycould helpit while they were working the mines for their owvn beiseft it therefore prayed all sueb declarations might be made by the court as were jsat andecessary ith regard to the rghts nd interests of t lain ufi and in resrd to the perional libilities of small shears and taylor the contacting dirotors and as to the liablitjeuuf the other directeri id as to the iliabilities of thetrustees and also as to the liability of the company in respect of the several members thereof and as to the liability of the estates of the company and the estates of the de ceased directors and members to pay the plaibtiff tbe sum of oool together vith such interest on  as should he owing when the oi was paid thatan ac count should be taken and any deficiency raised by sale or mortgage of the estates of the company and that all direc tions should be given that were necessary to make the in demnity or equitable chargo available for tho purpose of the plaintiff being paid the money due to him the main points rontended for by the defendants in suppert of the demurrer were that this wvas not a bill on which the court could grout a specific performnance of the contracts for it prayed some hinr else whlile that wasiz its secret osject that the contract ws with three individuals v h wrre the original contractors for the company and that no subsequent contract could ectend their liahsility to othlers  that possession w as given nat the mines might he w orked ard therefore mr attwvood was not entitled to anly bygone account that the indemnity wenit for notlfing and thlat he had no title to malintain thie presenit suit because he hae nut given the notice thle mortgagor vwas entitled to hut bad only the ordinary remedy of a mortgagor in support of the bill it vwas argued the slemurrers had only heen put in for the purpose of delaying a settlement the defendants must one day conie to for event if this w as not technically the car rect mode of proseeding the rigist one was still openl to ur attvwool and he vwouid pursue it the company had got the plaintifs property they had taken away the inheritance and v ere bounld in conscience to pay for it i ho present course was the onlly one left open to bismi tol obtain the relief he wsas justly entitled to for it wvould have been a mockery to at temnpt to enforce the performiance of the contracts when the company vwere strugglinmg to get rid of them altogether and there was no other mode of compelling thens to appointmr k bruce mr jacob mr wigram aned mr sharpe
