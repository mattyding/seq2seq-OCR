number to six and which bad been granted for ileprovements effected in the construction of furnaces and their annexed machinery in the year  he entered into on agreemnent vwith the defendant whereby the latter in con ideration that ho plaintiff bad granted him pormisaion ox clusively to sell use and manufacture the patent furaaces in question vwithin the county of lancaster agreed to pay himk otu ayear with a certaun portion of tho prefits as a compensation for such exclusive privilege according to the rteizo r and formu of the agreemnent iool became dne upon the th of june  anld as the defendant refused to pay the emoney the plaintiff coremenced an action fos its recovery the defendant pleaded generally that be had not entered into the undertaking which professed to be the foundation of the action and in two special pleas he set up as a defence first that at the time of the presentation of the petition for the patent and of the grant of tho said patent by te crown the alleged improvements and inven tions for which one of the patents had been granted were not new as to the public use and exercie thereof in england and that the patent in questioni was therefore void ard that the facts whiah so rendered it void were at the time of enter ing into the agreement perfectly well known to the plaintiff hli pleaded secondly that he had not accepted the agree mnent nor acted upon the license which it professed to give and that he bad in fact no enjoymert of the right and cojise quently no benefit from the agreementto the special pleas the plaintiff detsiurred and after argu ment and consideration obtainedjudgmsentin his favour upon the demurrer after which the parties proceeded to trial upon the issue as to whiether the defendant had legally undertaken to pay the money or not the declaration alleged that the defendant had entered inito the agreemnent in question but the agreement whein produced appeared to have been entered into by the deferdant in conjunction with other persons i and as this difference between the evidence and record would if not cured in somo way er other constitue a variance of a nature fatal to the plaintiffs claim in tliat action an appli cation was made to the learned judge at the trial to amend the record ia conlormnity vwith the evidence with this ap plication tis lordship eclined to comply but in accordaneb with the provisions of a late statute reserved the pro priety of his own refusal for the consideration of the court of exchequer from which the record hau issued the law under which this reservation was wade was the d and th william iv ch  under the  section of wbhich act are effected those amendments now so common which the presiding judsge thinks proper to dlirect at the trial of the case by the th section it is provided that whenever he entertains a doubt about the propriety of allow inig tho proposed amendment in such circumstances as those already menitioned lie may direct the jury to find spesifically the facts to wbich that part of the evidence relatno and that he is then to direct the facts so foutind to be entered upon the back of the nisi prius record after wlhich is to follow an al legation in thei nature of the conclusion of a special verdict niamely that upon such a state ef facts the jury do not kinow for which party their verdict ought tw be given but that if the court in iunco are of opinion that it ought to be for thie plaittiff they finl for thg plaintiff and otherwise for the de fendlanit in the present instance the jury were represented on the rliori as having first found for the defendint andl followed up this positive and actual verdict by a form like that which iasheenjust given above and tho special fining upon lie record contained no copy of the agreement as preyed nor any except a very general desrriptiont of the in strument the court of excliequer chnfirsmed the finding of the jury and ordered the judgsnent to be entered for the defendantthe attorneygenerrl now subm itted thiat the judg ment so given could not be retained asit was in direct sila tion of the provisions of the statute wlhich alone sanctioned such a course of proceeding the topics urged by the learned gentleman are very clearly indicated in the statemenit which we have given above anid the enumeration of them would only be a repetition of what oe have already mentioned tue court from the beginning assented to the arguments of the learned gentlemani upon that part of the case and after haingheard mr cowling upon the part of the defnndants directed the record to be amended and completed by the in sertion of the whole agreement with regard to the special pleas against which judgniient had been given the attorney tgeneral contended that these
