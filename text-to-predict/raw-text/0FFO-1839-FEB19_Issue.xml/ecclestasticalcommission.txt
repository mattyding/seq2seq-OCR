ecclksiastical commissiona letter to tee blhop of exetmr with considerations on the lbtter of the bishop of lincoln and the chargps of the bishop of london lincoln alnd glocester and bribstol by a dignitary of tihe churchthe above is the title of a pamphlet beyond all doubt and all shadow of comparison the ablest that has yet appeared on either side respecting the opera tions of the celebrated ecclesiastical commission indeed if we were totaly ignorant of the real author and his work were not addressed to the bishop of exeter we should on a guess have been disposed to ascribe it to the keen sagacious and eloquent prelate himself at present the reasons we have ascribed refute that supposition we still think there are errors oceasionally committed in the reasoning and false views often entertained on the state of public feeling by the  dignitary of the church both of which we shalu endeavour to point out neither are we disposed to give up wholly the ecclesiastical commiwsioners to his sarcasms or their labours to his reprobation we still think that they have done some good and at the time when the body was first formed by sir robert peel stayed and prevented much mischief the truth is with respect to those eminent persons the archbishop and the bishops of london and lincoln that on the opening of the comn mission they were borne on the full tide of public opinion both within and without the church there was a loud and general cry for reform and under that feeling they were more reproached for the little they did or recommended to be done than for the exorbitance of their changes since that time the general ardour has cooled the tide has set in a contrary direction and the commissioners have in consequence been partially left aground various have been the cooperating causes of this refluxthe chief probably the awakened zeal and industry of the church itselfthus indicating its exelusive capacity to take the lead as the great public instructor but one wc have no question has been that assigned by the bishop of lincoln in his letter which we reviewed on its appearancethe reformation really introduced by the commissionthe  dignitary  is peculiarly acute in pointing out certain differences existing between the several publications of the three bishops who have written or delivered charges in defence of the reports of the commissioners let the following be taken as an example but there were parties within the church also her advo cates and defenders who were as it is new declared equally the objects of suspicion to the commissioners from the very entrance into their office bishop lkaye informs us  i knew that the commissioners could not stir a step in the ex ecution of the duty imposed upon thom without disturbing iu a greater or les degree longestablished relations and thus arousing the oppositien of all whese feelings or whose interests rendered them desirous to maintain things in their present state on all these accounts i expected that our pre ceedings would be acrutinized with an unfriendly eye and be criticised with unsparing severity the event has fully realized my expoctations the attacls upon us have not been confined to our measures they have extended to our motives aud intentions and in some cases have even assumed a per sonal character i do not it is true find this prophetic spirit in prejudice of many persons avowed by the other episcopal commis sioners bishop blomfield seems expressly to contradict these unfavourable anticipations in the follovwing words  no want of confidence in the commissioners so appointed was evinced at the timo  on the contrary some of those who have beon the least sparing ir their attacks both upon the appoint ment of that body and its recommendations did not hesitate to furnish them with suggestions some of which if publicly known and compared wvith the objections  would ex cite no little surprisea due consideration of the above will easily recon cilc the apparent difference many were ready to offer their suggestions to the commissioners on their en trance upon their labours that was the proof  of confidence  and as was then foreseen the same per son abused them afterwards for not adopting the suggestions of even greater changes which had been tendered to themthe following deserves attention the refections however cast upon  the interested clergy on the part of the commissioners are accompanied with others upon the ciurch herself the alleged motive of their whole undertaking is a suc cession ef  gross abuses  glaring inequalities  longexist ing anomalies in the church of anomalies truly i may ask what can be so great as that of the comnission itself i but what abuses or rather wlhat do the clamourers against the church in open hostility against her mean by abusesand what do the commissieners themselves mean by abuses  if things totally different are meant by the two par ties then the same term should never have been used by our own heads in point of fact the commissioners properly characterize their own use of the term the bishop of lon don prescribes  strong and vigorous measures for the correc tien of abuses and removal of anomalies while bishod monk severely stigmatizes such usage of terms when he says  the enomies of the establishment clamonred about such inequaliies which they termed church abuses abuses are one thing defects are quite another the latter may with out  strong or vigorous measures sine slrepitu be gently and wvisely removed bishop kaye adds his quota of condemnation against the mischievous effects preduced by statements industri ously propagated respecting the inordinate wealth of the established church  these statements the report of the commissioners ithat more large one for inquiry into ecclesiastical revenue says his lordslhip  appears effec tually to have answered  while doubtless the sum and sub stance of the bishop of londons  correction of abuses meant only the redistribution of what moderate revenues were new proved to remain to tho church and the ono great motive which his lordship expressly statesas the paramount object of the commission sweeping down it seems every argument of prescription of right or even  sacred obliga tion before it was thismoney  we want for these pur pases all that we can obtain from whatever sources derived  rentin fact unlimited equalization and confiscatior for pastoral purposes how greatly conducive the orderof nebi lity and gentry of this land might be thus made to the general interests of society if threefourths of the nobility were swept off the stage of the constitution and their estates con fiscated to build courthouses and endow judgeships for dis pensing cheap justice through the land  well might such an interpretation of the  increased efficiency of cathedral and collegiate bodies taken to mean the efficiency of their money otherwise disposed ef have aroused on the sudden all the alarmas and outcries which the sagacity of the commis sioners had foreseen unless perhaps their forocast had otherwise calculated that a transfer of efficiency as well as of money was to take place on the evacuation of the chapters and thus solitude in the cathedrals to introduce not only  peace but plenty and prosperity into the cburchstill in relation to the above we must dwell upon the change produced in the public opinion any man who at the time when the expressions just quoted were used by bishops blomfield and kaye had de nied there were abuses to be reformed or defects to be supplied in the church for we do not allow any such great difference in the import of the words as the  dignitary would intimate would have been thought out of his senses that the public mind has been disabused with respect to many of the imputed abuses more especially with regard to the revenues of the church sv again assert bas been owing in part to the publication of the first report of the com missioners then it was that the change first begem to take placewe shau continue our remarks upon this very re markable pamphlet in our next numbera very numerous and influential meeting of the yeomanry and others
