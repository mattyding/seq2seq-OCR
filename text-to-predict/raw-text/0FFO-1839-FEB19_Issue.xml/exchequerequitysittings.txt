exchequer equity sittingsmoses v willwims aid antielxriiall pfb t lejore jvlr jiaron aldersonrits lorasoiip on coming into court gave judgment in this ase which he said was a bill filed for a legacy which the piaintiff claimed under a will in which the two defendants villiam williamni and william thomas williams were ap pointed executors it appeared that the testatrix died in b and that the aill was afterwards proved by tho defen dants wvo paid in the firt instance all debts and specific legacies  and after having discharged that part of their duty there remained the residue to be divided among a given nun ber of persons amongst whom was liannah moses the vwife of the plaintiff who now claimed as her administrator it ar peared that the ascertained share of hannah moseswas d thr   es ra     it  i    ithe only question was whether or not both the defendants wero liable to mahe good the residue to tho present plaintiff as tho administrator of hlannah mosesan objection was taken to the bill on the groun i that the plaintiff had taken out letters of alininistration subsequentiy to the bill being filed biut to this objection be thought the answergven at the bar was per fectly satisfactory iu the first plae the plintiri had at the time ha fied this bill an equitable interest in the find  and seconwdly it appeared frees the cases cited from peere wvil lisns that administrations being granted it rolated back to the time when the intestate hlazinah mioses was to be consi dered as entitled in this respect therefore the bill was well foundedand the objection could not be suatained as to wiliism esilliams it appeared that the money l was hanled over by the defenident w t williams who resided at cliftonito w williams his coexecutor who resided a dim in norfolk for the purdose of being paid to hannahioes the person entitle l ro tbe legacy and it was suggested that w t wvilliams wvas entirely unacquainted with tle fact of her having been married and that he trusted to av wil liams whoa he believed to be resident very near thie spot where shc was actually to be found to pay the legacv to ber several cases were cited beginning with thai of  bacon v bacon for the puirpose of showing that when an execultor so condlcets himself as to be guilty of no ltahes or negligence in the administration of the testators estate and where the loes arese simply from accidentover which the exe cutor eyen exereising due diiigenice had nio contral that he was not personaily responsible for the amount of sach loss it appeared to himn looking at the circumistances of this ease that ne could not acquxit mr t williams on this ground  on the contrary it appeared to himn that he ought to he held re sponsible on the present occasion as it was his duty to bave mnade somse inquiries as to whether or not this woman was married by doing which he might have easily ascertained that she was marriedl and then it would have boos his duty to have taken care to have held some correspondence wsith the husimand and to bave ascertained where he was beforo he paid oyer the money to william williams it appeared that the husband of hannah moses did not resile near diss there was no correspondeneo with iiim the exe cutor w as not even eavare of the existence of such a person hut a few inquiries would have enabled him to ascertain the fact and he his lordship could not therefore acquit ihim ois neglgence if the case stood on this ground alone it appeared to him that tho cases ot ship brooke v ilinobinbrook underwood v stephens and long ford v gascoigne nwere decisive ef the point for there it was laid dowsn that if an executor permitted his coexecutor to obtain possession of money which he had at any time in his ow n possession and afterwards the executor misapplied the money both executors were personally resnonsible for the amount which one of thom had given to the other and that other had misapplied such a case did not fall vwithin tle class of cases of which bacon v bacon was the cuief and in which it vwas laid down that an executor should be allowed tho benefit of what ho had handed over to his co executor in the ordinary and due administration of tho estate whichi under the will hie had to administer buit it appeared also that there was another ground on which this casset ight be put the case of bacon v bacon and those which fo lomedi it were cases in which the exe cutor paid mneney into the hands of his coexecutor for the purpose of eing cised in the payment of debts and specific legacies anti one of them was a case where the executor was in the position of a trustee for an individual legacy but the present case was the case of a residue in aici a partyi sought to obtain possession of his portion of the fund which it was the duty of the executors having the assets in hand to divide among ths legatees bacon v bacon seemed to him merely to decide the question that if thrwore no negligence on the part of the executers with regard to the assets to be collecteuf ay less that might arise might possibly be conxsidered as the lss of the testator himself and as if the property so lost had never come into the hasdg of the executors and they therefore could not be charged with it in the administration of the assets of the testator and theretore if an executor paid debts as in the case ofbacoa v bacon by banding ovcr the money to his coexe cutor for the purpose of paying them he sbould be allowed the saue in account but this plaintiff was entitled to his share of the residue of the estate and the executors were bound to pay him that share it appeared under the will that the only thing the executors had to do was to pay these legacies and supposing that there had been no negligence on the part of w t l illiama it only showed that the plaintiff was entitled to his share with the rest of the coresiduary legatees at the time and that he bad a right to claim a cer tan proporion of tie testators property it did net appear that the plaintiff had been guilty ot any fault bv which he should lose his legacy and the executors must pay it oer again even if it had been paid correctiv to the coexecutor for the purpose of its being handed over to the plaintiff it appeared to hinm therefore that this case wvas entirely distin guishable from the cases of bacon r bacon and the othersout inasmunh as it appeared in the course of the argument that william wviliiams had conveyed sono portion of the le gacy either to the plaintiff or bis wife acting as lis agent he preposed to refer it to the tnaster to see tiow much of theleacy had been so pail so that the coexecutors should not be chargeable with more than they actually ought to pay t he master giving them eredit for the sums actually received by the plaintiffs wife either wvith his express approbation or under suci circumstances as niade hter bis agent for that pur pose there should thereupon bo a declaration that both exe cutors were liable to pay what if anythinz was due to the plaintiff for principal and interest of the suu accruing to him in right of hi wifes share ot the residue with directions to the master to take an account
