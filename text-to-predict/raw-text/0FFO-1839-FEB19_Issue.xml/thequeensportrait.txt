llglttousesprofessor faraday on friday night gave an interesting lecture at the royal in stitutiosi on the subject of a new lamnp invented or rather brouiht to perfection for the invention is not it appears al toxother new by mir urneywhich air faraday proposed to call the  oxyoil lamp for sant of a tiame better describino its nature not having as ho stated been at present iniormea whit name the inventor intended to give it the new lamp most nearly resembles the common argand lamp with this difference that its burners may bo mado to equal at thio lowest two and a half and at the lhghest number  of the common burners mad into tho fname of nvhioh a stream of oxygen gas is introdticed by which operation the character of the flame is changed froma dark smoky light tothe bright and indeed brilliant light of the hydrooxygen lights now used for iniscroscopic exlibitions the application of oxygenas to the ligit of commnon oil lamps is not new dr priestjey fiaving discovered the use of such application many years ao but to mr gurnoe belongs the nerit of having overcome an thoe difficulties whi ieh stood in the way of its practical ap plication and everyday use the lamp in question is more immediately intende for lighthouso purposes and mr gurney it seems has been engaged for three years in the most persevering and undanuted experiments in completing his task vbhicl is the more laudable inasmuch as en the au thority of mr faraday for fivesixths of that time all his efforts appeared fruitless in overcoming the objections to and surmounting the obstacles which stood in the way of the cam pletion of this useful invention the introduction of the oxygen has the effect of decreasing the length of the flame wsliich is tiius botter adapted for the marine purpose to which it is destined  and it has the greatest of all recommenda tions namely economy in its favour this is not however apparent at first view for the gas costs double the amount of the oil but thl introduction of the former effects suclt a diminution in the consumption of the latter that not onlv ii the expense of the gas and the apparatus used in it prepara tion paid for but an ultimate saving ms well as a most su perior light is the result this lamp was the text of the pro fessors discourse for the evening and he treated it in so lucid and pleasing a manner as to render his lecture exceedingly
