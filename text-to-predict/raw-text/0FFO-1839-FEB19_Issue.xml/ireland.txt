entreat the attention of our readera to the letter of that excellent and efficient commissioner of rebel lion tr iailip ryan addressed to his excellency the lord fieutertant it is indeed a melanclholy pictluro of the state of the country and a true and perfect exposure of the causes of those evils that disgrace unhappy ireland and the sources whence the desolation flows this admirably wellwritten letter should he perused with an implicit reliance upon the boldly affirmed statements wbich it contains it is no ano nymous productioniit is not the emanation of a mind exas perated by disappoittted hepes or blighted ambitionnor is it the mere effusion of a tradinig placeiunter or political deina gogue but it is the faithful record of experienced facts un coloured though well detailed by one whose duties have call ed him much amongst the peasantry and to wlhom the real state of our country is well knownto ils excellency the lordlieutenant c to speak his thoughtt is eerey freemans right my lordif the poet was right i am persuaded your lordship wsill readily pardon nme for expressing my opinion and soliciting your excellencys immediate attention to the consideration of a great public evil wlhich i am unable to re dress and cannot even contemplate without surprise and in dignationan evil my lord so deadly in its operation and fatal in its consequences that it has been the prolific source of many a sad ard mselancholy bereavementand whieh it not speedily remedied will lead to a further effusion of hu man wlood and add to that black and uinparalleled catalgue of crime whihel has so signallv but unfortunately character ized this country during your excellencys administration of the affairs of unhappy irelandmy lord it would ho mgre consonant to my own feelings and perhaps mere consistent with the respect due to your excellency to forward a memorial praying for the adoption of prompt and energetic measures for thc suppression of the deadly evil of which i complain but my lord it is now many months since i forwarded to your excellency a memo rial alleging that after the barbarous niurder of my un fortunate servant jolsn hogan at dunkerrin on the st of october t two men charged vith being principals in that bloody transaction fled the country but returned after the spring assizes of  at which other persons were tried for aiding and assisting that a certain liberal magistrte re sident in the county of tipperary but bearing the commission of the peace for the kings county sent for them and solely on his own responsibility took bail for their appearance at the ensuing asizesbut that the summer assizes of  and thc sprig assizes of  were suffered to pass over without these aesassino having been put on trial  that they were then at large in the county and that the bail bonds which pro cured them their liberty nwere by d rections of that magis trate obtained at the police barracks from the very men whom they had a few weeks before disarnsed and attempted to msirder and who were not even then recovered from the effects of the wounds inflicted on them it will be in the recollection of your excellency that my memorial on that occasion was couched in most respectful lan guagethat i undertook to prove every allegation by the swlorn testimnony of numerous vwitnesse and on public grounds im plored your excellency to grant a fair and open investigation into such highly illegal and unceoistitutional proceedings that memonal my lord xvas to guarl against the possibility of mistake personally deliveredat thecastle of dublin byahighly respectable professional gentlemnan wvho received a verbal nnswer that it should be referred to the consideration ef the crosvn lawyers but up to the present period i have received no further arswer nor have i yet learned wlhetlher the ma gistrate named in my memorial received any iltimation of your excellencys displeasure  but finding his name on the cirefully revised list of magistrates i am bound to infer that lie was not guilty of ati offence calling for the interference or condemnation of your excellency  but toy lord i conifess that my humble abilities are quite incapable of comprehend ing wvhy a mragistrate of the highest rank intelligence and independence and one whose judicial integrity couli never be questioned should have been unceremoniously de prived of the commission of the peace for merely to make use of a vulgar but trite saying endeavouring to procure at the inquest in dunkerrin  a clear stage and no favour for an inniocent and persecuted individual  while another magistrate for asisting in defeating thte ends of justice has been honoured with a continuance of your exrellencys confi dence my lord while i express my inability to account for this rare specimen of evenhanded justice it is but right that i shiozuld tell your lordship the opinions of othersrthe cowardly antitithe conspirators would at that period have given a rewvard for my head to any assassin equal to that paid for the head of caisis gracchus and as they knoew i  kept my powder dry and could not murder me with im punity it was desirable to effect by perjury and lecal inge nuity what bruto force could not accomplish  and any op poed to this view could not fail of being censured and in aulted while those who sympathized with my persecutors were sure of nieeting a suitable reweard the fate of that memorial my lord is the reason why i do not employ tihe languageof supplication on this oecasionand i shall therefore in respectful hut few words hasten to inform your excellency why assassins are multiplying while the virtuous the generous and the neble are daily disappearin from the land the mangled victims of brutal and blood thirsty conspirators and iam not wittiotit entertaining a hope my lord that the enrsation which this alarming com mitnicatien must necessarily produce may leatd to results ratifging to every humane lieart and be in some measure instrumental in saving the lives of some now marked out for the hullet of the assassinmly lord it will be in the recollection of the publie generally that in times of comparative tranquillity the vendors of ghnpowder were strictly prohibited from selling that article to any individual not even to a person svell known to be a peaceable wellconducted member of society until the purchaser should produeo a certificate signed by a magistrate certifjihg him to he a fit and proper person  but my lord what will be the sentiments of the astonished world when informed that that prohibition no longer exists that this salutary precautionary measure has been latterly done awcay withand that the worst characters in society can witlh all possible facility supply themeelves with the niu nitions of war and go terts to the execution of their bloody purposes l permit me to ask my lord avhy is this monstrous evil suffered to exist even for an houror had it its origin in a desire to leave the lawless and turbulent in all respects independent of the magistracyl view lng it as i do my lord and being infinitely hetter acquiainted with the state of thecountry than your excel lency orany man surreunded by iiis parasitos could be i cannot avoid exclaiming nowever inappropriate the quo tation lhat blind detested madness colnd afford such horrid license to the murdering sword lmfy lord when this fact flrst came to my knowledge i censidered it so monstrous anof improbable as to be altogether incredible but my lord after a searching investigation i find it too trueand in proof of it i beg to inform your ex cellency that i sent at my own personal expenso messengers by no cmeans reputablelokin persons to different to won in this county ana the conntiesofclarlimerick and kings connity to purchase gunpowder and although perfect stran gers in all those places except in one instance they were never interrogated nor met a single refusal i have commu nicated my information to more than ons magistrate and am prepared if necessary to substatitiato my statemont upon hlaving now my lord stated one cause of the manv murders wlhichl liave of late taken place it is right that i should acquaint your excellency with anether and tbht is the great facility of obtaining firearms in the country it is a fact my lord which cannot be denied that the lower order of farmers liave been for years registering firearms evena day labourer cannot do without a gun or pistol all of which i shall suppose rbgistered  and i have nio hesitation my lord in declanng and i am prepared to prove it that these arms are at the free and unreserved disposal of the most reckless assassins in every disturbed district in the south of ireland no man living in a thatched cabin in the country dare refuse to lend his arms to these mrauders  and i feel pprfectly safe in the assertion that the great majonty of the muerders where the bullet is the messongerof death are committed vith fire arms dilty registered if i couple these facts with tho illjudged policy of re moving police from one station to another as soon as they be come acquainted with the bad or suspicious characters of their locality and at a timo only when they could efficiently exert themselves in repressing crime and detecting offenders i fol l without at all alluding to your excellenc es personal exertlons frocount for the
