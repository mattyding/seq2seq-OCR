o lorn derhafletter iimy lordsome of the changes recommended in your lordshps report are to be found in the commu nications of the constitutional society of q uebec and alontreal of a date long anterior to your a point ment and your lordshids omission of this fact is en titled to great credit as your lordskip was doubtless aware that if they wvere generally known to have emnanated fron so rezpeceable and loval a body of men their popularity would have been greatly endangered among a certain class of politicians in the country for this considerate act of kiadness thev ought to bee and i have no doubt they are deeply grateful it is undoubtedly a hazardous admission to make but is rendered necessary lest the british parliameat might suppose from your ascribing all the system to the leaders of the rebellion whom vou have so charitably and so condescendingly termned the dis contented party that these traitols were after all not very unreasonable people but nien whose im petuous temper lhad hurried theni into the little im prudence but manly error of resorting to arns but nwho notwithstanding this venial offence were really desirous of promoting some beneficial changeswiith such parts of the report as are to be found in these documents i have nothing to do but to express my regret that all vour information had uot been drawn from a source equally unexceptionableit is that part which is peculiarhl vour own or was sugested bv those able and intelligent men thediscontented part to which i ohject your lord ship reconnends a legislative union of the colonies or a cosgress for the whole coexistent with but su perior to tile provincial legislatures this prescrip tion you are pleased to think will by its strong drastic powers purge the body politic of au impu rities and not only effect a cure of all existing evils however ruinous but however dissimilar they may be the search after such a medicine like that after the philosophers stone has lonz since been discon tinued bv enlightened men but empyrics still an nounce occasionally that they have succeeded by accident or inspiration where science has previously failed so prone indeed are mankind to indulge in the marvellous that these nostrums are alwavs fa vourably received bv the multitude and their popu larity is generally proportioned to their extravagant absurditv this legislative assembly which vour lordship recomnmends is to be constructed after the model of the congress ot the united states had your lordship visited that country of wlhich vou have underta en to draw so flattering an account from the reports of the  able intelligent and im partial men of the discontented party who have mihgrated thither you niight possiblv have heard of collisions between the genera government and the state governments of disputes about sovereignty and jurisdiction and of a term peculiar to america otnnullification you might have heard of deter mined threats on one side and fierce defiance on the other of undefined rights of constructive powers and of unfortunate omissions you would have learned that though the people may petition the congress the congress may not deliberate that there may he rights unaccompanied by powers and that written constitutions may be more vague and more uncertain than unwritten ones you would have seen a legislative union of separate states where the supreme legislature possessed too little power to answer the purposes of national government and where the individual states had partel with too much to retain any separate influence or individual autho rity in short you would have everywhere beheld the melancholy spectacle of a govermuent unable to enforce obedience to its own laws or respect for those of its neighbours to protect its own armouries against its own people or to restrain its own population from piratical incursions into adjoining countries with which it had entered into solemnmtreaties ef peace but supposing that vour lordship had passed tbrouh that countryas you unfortunaly did through canaa without hearing or seeing what other people had heard or seen and had not learned that such was its condition you would doubtless have inquired into the powers of the congress the imitation of which you so strongly recommend iad you instituted such an inquiry you would have found it had little or nothing to do that though the separate states had conceded all the authority that could be safely intrusted to it it did not amount to enough for vigorous action and that although they had ren dered themselves powverless thev had not made the ceatral legislation stron by their several contribu tions you would have tearned among other things that its chief duty was to deliberate upon all external matters also to regulate the armny and navy the postoffice the coinage the judiciary the com merce with foreign nations and the wild lands not of the several states but the domains belongin to the united states having acquired this information you would naturally have naked yourself hlow similar powers could be committed to a congress of the bri tish provinces your liordship has been more fortunate than most travellers and has discovered many things of deep interest and great importance that nobody ever heard of before so many indeed that i fear your account accurate as it no doubt is wiu share the fate of others of equal value and have to await the confirmation of succeeding expeditions butnotwith standing your lordships powers of observation i doubt if you could find a provincial army and navy for an object of legislation or a coinage which they have not got and cannot have or a post office as a distinct and independent department this latter you must be well aware is a part of the great general imperial postoffice is connected witl snails that traverse foreign countries and packets that cross the seas and officers residing out of their limits and beyond their control and in which the parent state has at least an equal interest with the colonies the supreme judicial establish ment does not existis not required and what mill doubtless have great weight with vour lordship would not be popular their foreign trade they cannot regulate so long as thev are colonies and ought not it they could the wild lands are the appurtenances of each separate colony and there arc no extra provincial domains that can be placed under its control where then are the powers of this legislature to be derived from and what is it to do is it likle congress to be converted into a debating society for wordy orators and vain boasting patriots or a canvass for the election of thegovernor gveneral or a hail of pensioners wlhere demagogues are to receive eight dollars aday as the reward of successful intrigue  where is it to meet  are the french canadians the papineaus and the vigers to put on their snow shoes and travel through several hundred nmiles of trackless forest to halifax or are the  able intelligent and respectable projectors of nova scotia to concede the post of honour to quebec to harness up their moose and rein deer and speed over the untredden snow tothe capital i it is true there are no hotels on the road but there woould be not a few ins in the lakes and such would be the harmony ef these travelling legislators that the outs would not quarrel for their places snug berths and warn berths are the objeets of patriotic desire and not cold ones if sectional jealousies and local im pediments create a difficulty as to the seat of govern ment as they did in the united states where is it to be placed  will you decide as those enlightened men did and choose the geographical centre if so shall it be the small island in the tamawaska lake in the heart of the forest between the lower and upper promnces or shau a more enlarged v iew pre vai  shall vwe regard the convenience of succeeding generations and place it in the desert midway be twveen the pacific and atlantic but i forget that
