graves of thefallenour soldiers lastrestying place   their name livethfor evermorefroi ooui special correspondentthe searching of tho battlefields for the ninburied dead and the removal of remains of british soldiers buried in isolated graves or groups of graves to properly constituted ceme teries has been an important part of the work of the clearingup army in france and flanders since the armisticeit is a purely military task and since novem ber has been carried on under the direction of general wyatt dso from the headquarters of the  ves directorate as the ceme teries are completed they are handed over to the imperial graves commission a civilian organization responsible for their ultimate design and future maintenance no fewer than  bodies have been exhumed and gathered into existing or new cemeteries when this process of concentration is complete there will be some  british cemeteries in france and flanders in addition to about  french and belgian cemeteries in which british soldiers have found their last resting placethere are some who feel strongly that it is tho soldiers wish to be left where he fell and that au that is required is the erection on the battlefields of monuments recording the names of the fallen in some eases indeed the rela tives have purchased the ground in which their dear ones lie this opportunity is however given to few and it is certain that if these isolated graves and burial grounds were left where they are they would bo uneared for and iiust in time inevitably disappearsome lie in the ruins of towns and villages sontie overshadowed by the broken and blackened trees of shellswept woods and others set in hills and valleys flayed by years of war but towns and villages will be rebuilt and a few years hence the scars of battle in the hiills and valleys will have yielded to the healing arts of peace no precaution could save these graves from being encroached upon in thle process of the reconstruction of the towns and tho recultivation of tle land a view miore widely held is that the instinct of the army demands that those wtho fell in tho field should be gathered in to rest with the nearest main body of thleir comrades and it is a view which accords with the national desire to do honour to our glorious deadsearching the battlefieldstlle sombre and solemn task of searching tlhe battlefields exhumation and reburial is boulg carried out with all care and reverence for the dead and due solicitude for the nattual feelings of the living the work very tryinig in the naturo of it is being done with a thorough niess for which the working parties and thie officers directing them deserve full credit their labours have been beset with difficulties of wlhich the lack of transport great in itself has been the least only thoso who have actually been the conditions can realize the utter destruc tion caused by intensive bombardnient some of the battlefields have been chuuned up again  nld again by shell fire and in some cases alltrace of the graves has disappeared when found isolated graves are often diffcult to deal withroads and tracks have been obliterated small strearris have disappeared and the land is covered with shell lholes liptolip and full of water in the course of the search a considerable number of unburied bodies have becn recovered some have been found in pill boxes and dugouts others in shell holes some still standing erect and others again in the long tangled grass that covers large stretches of land in the ypres salient and in the arras ambrai region in one case five bodies wvere found in position round a machinegtun buried at their post by a slhell explosion in other cases the terrific bombardment had destroyed all traco of small cemeteries in the fire zone but fortunately record plans had been made and it lias been possible to reconstruct the majority of them it is estimated that approxinately  lier cont of those buried as unknown have thus far been identitiedbattleground cemeteriesthe british cemeteries vary in size from over a thousand graves dowvn to  and in each case the land has been granted in perpetuity by the allied governments concernedi have recently visited many of these ceine teries scattered over the battlegrounds from iassehendaele and polygon wood over the vimy ridge to areas and down to the valleys uf the omnie and the ancre all of them whether large or small are enclosed temporarily in barbedwire fencing with a gate for entrance enad everywhere even in regions the most lesolate and remote from humnan liabitation their neat and tidy appearance testifies to the care uith which they are tended except in shape and size they vary little one from anotherthe bodies are buried in rows  feet in length bodies in each row there is no distinction of rank officers and men lie side by side in death as they fought together in life the little crosses of creosoted wood each bearing its metali name plate which marlk the graves are arranged with military precision and give the cerneteries a singularly appropriate aspect in keeping with their battla background tlhough it was rare to find a cross out of position it is evident that constant care is needed to keep them in good order and the wisdom cannot be doubted of substituting for them headstones maore permanent ia characterin the ypres salient and on the sonmme there are rmany cemeteries containing only a few score of graves somo separated by only a few hundred yards in contemplating them one is tempted to ask whether it would not have been well to concentrate them into larger groups capable of more dignified treatmenit than these small and isolated restuigplaces cain ever beexperimental designsthe imperial war graves commission has begun the construction of the cemeteries at louvencourt forcemille and le treport each is being treated in the manner that seems most fitted to its surroundlings when completed they will no doubt form the models for the treatment of others elsewherelouvencourt cemetery is situated on a high bank dn the doullensalbert road and over looks a wide stretch of openundulating country its elevated position on the roadside lends itself to more elaborate treatment than nill be possible in other cases the banking on the roadside has been covered in vith blocks of portland stone in the massive wall a terrace has been formed which leads to a flight of sevensteps giving access to the graveyard at the angle in the centre of the avall formed by the terrace stands the beautiful cross of sacrifice singularly graceful in proportion and beautifuiini design with a great copper sword as its only a ornmncntfacing the cross on the farther side of the cemetery is the stone of remembrance bearing thie words their name liveth for evermorc it is altarlile in shape serenely simple and yet imposing in design it is from x to  tons in weight and rests on three slender mteps supported on a solid concrete foundation ia the thick wall of portland stoio which en calroes the cmetcry a recss lies been consitrtmeted neir tho war stone and reserved for the planting of shrubs and flowers portland ptaore lhas also been used for the paths and for tle llheadstones it is proposed to level off the gpiound of the graves and to form the rows iuo umallwellmown lawns the headstonesare sunk nine inches into a concrete foundation abovo ground they measure ft in in height by ift in in widtheach headstone is carved with a cross or symbol of the dead mans faith his name and rank his regimnentul badge and whatever text or inscription lhis relatives may add in some cases the regimental badge appears in the centre of the cross in others at the top of the headstone with the cross beneath the graves are onlv ft wide and thero is no space between them it is the narrowness of this limit wlhich imposes general principles and makes it difficult to give latitude to individual wishes nor is it certain that the relatives when they have an oppor tunity of judging for themselves will still desire that more should be conceded than the liberty of choice between the headstone selected and the headstone cruciformn in shape it is too early yet to form an opinion of the general effect that will be produced when the work is complete buit there will certainly be much in it of noble dignity quiet grandeur and solemn peacefulness the cost i am told will be aboout Â£c which for a cemetery of abeut  graves will work out at far above the sumi allotted per gravea plea for ypres ceieterythe largest british cemetery in belgium is at remy siding near poperinghe it contains  graves of which  are british the largest british cemetery in france is that at etaples one of the great hospital bases during the war it contains  graves of which  are british but of all the cemeteries in rance and belgium none is more entitled to special treatment than those at ypresnothing less is due to the memory of the men who fought so gallantly in defence of the town and now lie at rest within its ruins yet unless something is done and done quickly tho opportunity may be lost of giving the principal cemetery in ypres the full dignity of treatment that all must desire for it the reservoir north cemetery lies  yards off a road which is to be converted into the main boulevard of ypres it is approached by a narrow path and on both sides of this path the belgian authorities propose to build unles the land bordering on the park is pur chased this cemetery will be hidden behind hotuses and the approach to it will be narrow and perhaps unsightly the purchase of the land would give the cemetery a wide frontage on the boulevard which could be made beautiful with lawns and trees and flowers the cost of the ground is about  francs
