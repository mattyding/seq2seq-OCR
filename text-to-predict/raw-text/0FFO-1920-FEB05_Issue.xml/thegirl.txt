of the sexes he said that there could be no real social rest with out feminine contentment and in our own country where women formcd the bulk of the population the effect of their sex preponderance seemeld to be alotit wvholly injurious and to have little compen satin advanitagethe female excess was greater in great britain than elsewhere and the war iad aggravated this disturbing factor because the mei who had fallen all belonged to the agcgroup which represented tither potential or actual hiusbands and father there vere now over p excess females of reproductive agethe social effects of sex disproportion were demon strated in the crumbling of thic old etbical standards the freedonm of the modern independent girl from the supervision of her parents  the tendency to rebel against discipline andl conventional trammels the cry of pleasure for pleasures sakeall these tended to the etncouragement of a lowered standard of mnorality it was noteworthy that in ireland the fllegitimate birthrate was far lowver than in any other country in europe n fact that might be rttri buted to the approximate nuwerical eqeuality of the sexes in that country it was in reuad to miarriage and family life that female prepondearnce was play ing the most important part never hnd there been so many unhappy marriages mlany married women were demanding divorce by mutiual consent as it wascontended that the present rigid law condemned many to the society of an uttcrly uncongenial com panion  while married men oftell sought happier relationis among the numerous unattached women speaking from bis onn medical experience be had no hesitation in saying that much of the existing unhappiness was traceable to clandestine relations between young women and married menfemale preponderance resulted in a large and in mcrasing number of the physically and intellectually fittest wvomen in the country beinz forced into lte labour inarket wnrile less provident women of the

leap yeares privilege was not worth havizigsocial bthremplissan extraordinary diversity of type had emered ba a direct outcome of sex disproportion the domestic type still formed the bulk in the industrial rlass but was becoming rarer in the socaned middle and upper classes the social butterfly type lad probablv never been so prevalent as at present it comprised the frivolous scantilyclad jazzing flapper irresponsible and undisciplined to whorn a dance a new hat or a man with a car were of more importance than the fete of nations the type con tained a large proportion of plhvsically attractive girls vwith strong renroductive instinets and they were ever vying nnd competing withl each other for the scarce and elusive male in manv cases they strove by means of dress or the lack of it to appeal to mans lower nature instead of exercising the power to erevate his ideals young men had dance invita tions four and five dep and our boys and young men were being snoilt before our
