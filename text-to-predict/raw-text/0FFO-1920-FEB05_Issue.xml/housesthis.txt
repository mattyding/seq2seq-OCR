passed at the glasgow congress onthe questions of housing national insurance and dangerous occupations the mfinister vas accompanied by lord astor and sirkingsley wood mp parliamentary secrtries the deputation consisted of mr will thorne mp mre l poulton mr e tpalmer mr j baneroft and mr c wv bowerman apthe resolution on housing caued upon the govern ment to deal with the question by making it com pulsory for local authorities to prepare and carry out adequate housing schemes and by making grants fie of interest to enable local authorities to erect suitable houses at a reasonable cost  in default of any local authority failing to proceed with a scheme the resolution urged the government immediately to make provision for the proper housing of the peoplemr poutrox said they iecognized that since the resolution was passed housing legislation had become effective although it did not go so far as they desired they desihed to impress upon the mhiister the necessity of getting local authorities to proceed with theirschemes as soon as possible he instanced the bad housing conditions that prevailed in certain centres quoting cases at leicester glasgow and birkenhead and submitted that a good deal of the unrest among the working classes was due to inade quatce housing they were being asked to produceas much as possible but good housing conditions were essential in order to maintain a standard of physieal effciency that would enable the workers to produce moredr addisons appealdn addison said they had a housing scheme coupled with generous financial aid which they were trying to administer and to get applied by every means that they could think of as quickly as possible in circumstances of peculiar and special difficulty any help which the trades union congress could render he would gladly welcome  he agreed that it was impossible to exaggerate the evil consequences arising from bad housing and he was confronted with the difficulty of trying to get a remedy he was glad to say that  houses under the birken head scheme would be ready for occupation this month he thought employers and employed in every locality ought to cooperate in seeing that they got labour to build houses and he hoped that an organized system of securing that cooperation would be adopted as the result of the recommendations of the resettlement committee which he hoped would be issued in a few dayathere was at the present time a great shortage of apprentices in the building trade the conditions of apprenticeship ought to be made more attractive and he thought the trades union congress could render great help by taking such things into con sideration up to the present the ministry had re ceived from  out of  local authorities in england and wales housing schemnes for their re spective districts of these  had been approved as adequate  hadbeen approved as an instalment  were regarded as unsatisfactory and  more were still under consideration he had no doubt that so far as the carrying out of the programme of  houses in  months was concerned the ministrys share would be completedhopes of next few weeksdealing with the labour difficulty dr addison complained that the last thing the contractor did was to tell the minister of health that he was short of men when he found he was short of men the builder went to the labour exchange his attitude being that fellowup in whitehall the minister of health  what is the good of telling hinm laughter therefore the ministry only heard of cases when contrartors got into a state of desperate shortness the amount of building now going on was only a mere tithe of whiat would be going on within the next few weeks the actual labour shortage on houses now being built in the last four weeks was repre sented by the followiing numbets   and  the deficiency increased by over  men in the last weekthe governments programme was  houses this year and so far as plans and all the rest of it wvere concerned there was no reason why it should not be done at the present time there were  skilled bricklayers but if every single one was en gaged on their housing schemes even then there would be a deficiency the shortage of slaters and plasterers was even worse than that of bricklayers rhere was a problem for organized labour and the government invited their help it was unthinkable that no other fortm of building should go on but an any calculation there were not enough bricklayers slaters and plasterers even if they were all em ploye in doing  nothing else but building the  houses it was evident that no niggling remedies would suffice he wished to say on be balf of the government and as uinister of health that they were willing to give the friendliest help to my practicable proposal that came along it ought not to pass thie wit of man with good will on both iides to devise some means whereby they could ret the maximum production of housesoffer to address congressdln addison asked mr thbrne if he would allow him to come to the trade union congress and put the case to that bodymr thorneso far as i am concerned yes at dncedn addison added that the ministry wanted to help and they could niot do it without the aid of organized labour it was quite certain that excep tional measures must be taken and taken qnickly if they were not to find themselves short of the men to build the houses the tirst thing was to secure the greatest possible output in some districts where they had had it carefully checked output was very disappointingmr thorne asked if dr addison inferred that they were doing less than they did before the wardnl addisox replied that on certain work in man chester the rate of a bricklayer averaged  a day which was niaterially below the prewar ratemr thorneit all depends on the buildingdn addisoni am not putting it very high i am throwing no stones and making no aspersions le added that every man should be secured and everything done to protect him from the vicissitudes of weather and so on he saw a resolution from the bricklayers union declaring that not moro than los a week sbould be charged for a house he asked them not to live in a world of unrealities if it cost £g £ or £ to build a house it could not be let at s a week without a great lossmir thomns said if there was a possibility of arranging for a special conference he would recom mend that dr addison should be invited to address themnational insurance benefitsmr e t palmer presented the congress resolu tion pressing for amendment of the national in surance acts o aso to provide for a sickness benefit of £ for the first  weeks a nmaternity benefit of £ and a grant from state funds to increase admini stration expensesdn addison said the government proposed to in crease tle sickness benefit to s and the other benefits pro rata the proposals apart from the pro rata treasury contribution would mean the in creasing oi the weekly contributions in the case of men from d to lod end in the case of women from d to od if the benefits uere increased as urged in the resolution the contributions would have to be raised to is d in the case of men and is in tie case of women which would be a big burden the new regulations were very striigent tile standard aimed at was to get the doctors to give as good treatment to the insured as they did to private patientslabour deputation athome officecongress

present resolutions from the congressamong the demands expressed in the resolutions werethe amendment of the factory and work shops act the empowering of local authorities to order earlier closing of

workshops act the home offlice was at present considering the question as to the earlier closing of shops the experience of the cooperative societies was of the greatest value the small traders must be con sidered when they were contemplating legislation and small traders were far from unanimous in desir ing that the hours of b or  should be reduced still further naturally one had to have regard to the general healthi and enjoyment of life of those en gaged in the retail trade but atthe same time they must takeinto account the desires and wishes of the small shopkeepers who formed a by no means in considerable section of the communitya committee was already dealing with workmens compensation and be could not say anything until the committee had reported finally in regard to what had been said as to the clothing trade he agreed that the conversion of  dwelling house into unauthorized work shops was not desiable and this matter he proihse would receive consideration as to the pro posed total abolition of homework this lie feared would be a serious matter there were many sides to the question which required thought and he could not pledge himself to anything which would do away entirely with homework he had every hope how ever thatthe tailoring trade would take steps to place itself upon a better level
