anxious about the safety of their contingents west of irkutsk who are stated to be constantly en gaged with revolutionary and bolshevist forcesthe surrender of admiral koltehak continues the topic of the hour in russian circles and all classes bitterly condemn nhat is characterized as the  treachery  of the czechs witlh them are associated general janin and all the allies generallyantiforeign feelinga regular antiforeign feeling has been genq rated with the interesting result of apparently lessening the differences between the various political factions the local bolshevists long bitter enemies of the koltehak government combine with the bourgeoisie in heaping blame on all concerned the whole case turns on the degree of pressure put on the czechs to surrender koltehak their obligation was to protect hiim within the limiits of possibility and their contention is that they were not bound to sacrifice life in so doing a conflict vith the soviet at irkutsk on this point meant they say jeopardizing the wvhole of their echelons still west of lake baikalthe czechs do not attempt to shelter them selves behind general janin but declare that in the circumstances they would have given up koltehak without the authority of general janin they asseverate that the tyranny and ineptitude of koltehaks government is responsible for all the evils which have befallen siberia and that admiral koitchak himself has been their un reasoning enemy throughout for these reasons they were indisposed to lose a single man in protecting him incidentally it should not be forgotten that the rank and file of the czechs are considerably demoralized by their painful experiences of the past five years and may have forced the hands of the officers in the matter those in authority seem to have undertaken without qualification a responsibility they were unable effectively to dischargeparleys with the reds british ships expected atvladivostokfrom our correspondent formerly
