testing days at paisleylast week in campaignmr asquith in a draperyshopmr asqit lcsadidates mr j a d macketan umrbigtar labncmina±is today poling febuary dedaraion febary trax our special correspondentpaisley feb tomorrow the paisley byelection enters its last week and principals and supporters are bracing themselves for the most strenuous and testing days of the campaignso far as the candidates are concerned mr asquith has much more in hand intellectually than his opponents with deliberate intention he has spread tho exposition of his policy over the full period of the contest and speeches which will deal with important phases of the political situation have yet to be made pbysic ally mr asquith is bearing the stress and strain of a hard and critical fight uncommonly well whatover may be the outcome of the election and its influence on political groupings i am convinced of one thingneither mr maekean nor mr biggar if returned would hold the attention of the house of commons for  minutes the present parliament is deadened already with men of their calibre and either of them would only add one more to the category of members who make their speeches if they speak at all to empty benches mir asquith on the other hand would go back to westminster with his powers of effective criticism unimpaired and might quickly build up an opposition which would cause mr lloyd eorge to chango his opinion that attendance at the house on one or two days a week is all that should be required of a prime minister in these serious daysmr asquiths personality is the only thing which is troubling the labour party at paisley and while mr biggar and his supporters con tinue to profess that the issue of the contest is already settled in their favour they keep up an incessant appeal to the electors not to be led anvay bv the glamour of a name perhaps i should add that the labour organizers have also been unpleasantly surprised by another expressioii of personalitythat revealed by lady bonhiam carter sneers about the asquith circus  are not sufficient to counter act the influence exerted by the wit and politi cal skill of the liberal leaders daughter during the early part of the camnpaign mr asqlitih limited his activities to the platform but it appears to havo been decided that he mlust displav some interest in the more trivial side of electioneering he has not yet been taken on a canvassing round today accom panied by sir john simon mrs asquith ladyonham carter and his election agent he visited a large drapery establishment in the town in this adventure he was not quite at his case mrs asquith inspected paisley shawls and brightlycoloured quilts and sir john simon affably discussed textures and prices but mr asquith found some difficulty in dissembling his anxiety to move along to a common room where he was to say a few words to the shop assistants eventually he was able to make his little speech and to tell the assistants that the way the nation would be taxed and governed for years to come would turn on the result of the electionfrom the drapery storo mr asquith and his party proceeded to the engineering works of miessrs fullerton hodgart and barclay where the candidate and sir john simon addressed about  workpeople without arousing any special enthusiasmit cannot be said that the election so far has arouled excitement among the general body of paisley people comparable to the keen interest taken by the country and particularly by politicians in the exprimo ministers attempt  to come back there is eager com petition to secure admission to mr asquiths meetings and also to labour meetings where mr biggar is supported by speakers like mir smillie but openair speeches attract little attention iind meetings  arranged  in the works hardly encourage the candidates to maultiply themsir john simon crowded as much as possible into his visit todey and mr asqtiith law kept pace with his activity the two spoke to a nmeeting of business men this afternoon and dealt at some length with the financial eituation mr asquith interpolated a passage on frce trade a policy to which he reaffirmed his adherence on the grounds that the war has not changed the rules of arithmetic tonight both mar asquithl and sir john were at a meeting in the central hall and the opposition attrac tion of mr ramsay miacdonald at the drill hall did not prevent the building from being as crowded as on the previous occasionfacts for business menmr asquith on a serious situationmr asqrrrn addressed a meeting of business men at paisley liberal club yesterday afternoon dealing with the poliey of the present government as it affects the business community he smid that the eco nomic situation in all its aspects was a verv serious one we were face to face with high prices heavy taxationand an enormous and unexampled load of national indebtednees with low and falling ex changes the situation which now conxfronted the business community of great britain was more serious than it had ever been in hix time he did not say that in any spirit of pessimism because he was one of those who believed that this country had unexhausted and inexhaustible recuperative powers everything depended on reestablishing our financial soundness and ourlindustrial and commercial supre tiacy and upon our taking at this critical moment the right and not the wrong roadnothing was more disquieting than the enormous increae in currency circulation coupled with the enhanced rise in prices the governing and domi nating factor in the fnancial situation was the fact that while banks had advanced  millions to thegovermment therevias no corresponding indrease pin commodities the moral to be drawn from the indisputable and uncontrovertible facts was that the way to check further rise in primes and to bring down prlces was to cease borrowing and bring down daily expenditure  to the limits of daily income that was not easy to accomplish but it had got to be done and his complaint was that the problem was not being fairly faced or drastically handled there was still too much profligate and unremunera tive expeidituro going on upon war departments that should have closed down he did not say that that would solve the position and agreed that new sourees of taxation would have to be found he recom mended tho careful consideratidn of his suggested levy on wealthliberal eeousi rr ordmr asqurrm speaking at an evening meeting devoted his speech mainly to the housing question he said that what was wanted was houses and they were not there ho observed that dr addison who was apparenty a littlo nettled at his mr asquiths criticisms adopted a common expedient in  political warfare and being in a strategically weak position indulged in a couziteraf£ensive dr addi son could not deny the truth of his melancholy figures and sohea asked what did lie mr asquith do when he was head of the  government dr addison said that all the old liberal government had done was to indulge in highsounding phrases and empty platitudes his reply was that lhe and mr lloyd george had been jointly responsible ftr tha domestic polcy of the governments dr addison had apparently forgotten mr john burns town planning act to deal with dums ihe was prepared to defend and justify the housing policy of the liberal government xe admitted the dilmculties which dr addison and his predecessor were con fronted with those difilculties wvere very great but worst of all the goverrnent went the wrong way to work to get the houseson the question of the nationaliation of mines he asked hir smillie on wbat terms did he propose to nationalizo the mines was it to be on terms of compensation for their proper value p it was said by mr smillie and others that either the present ownets or their ancestors were freebooters and robbers to confiscate the mines without compensa tion was not equitable and would not conduce to the welfare of a community like ours they could not stop at the mines but must extend the principle to the land and even to the property of cooperators laughter he asked the labons candidate to give a plain answer to the question whether he intended to confiscate mines how ho could justify it and how he was going to stop in the processes of natinlizing everyth inng
