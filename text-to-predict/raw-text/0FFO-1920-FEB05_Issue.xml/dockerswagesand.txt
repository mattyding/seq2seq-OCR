dockers wages anddividendsscope of transportinquirycasual labourpiroblemby our labour correspondentthe inquiry into the application for a standard minimum wage of s a day for dockers will be resumed at the court of criminal appeal this morning alr ernest bevin who has been described as  the dockers kc will com plete his opening statement of the case for their claims and sir lynden macassey kc will open the case for the respondents the national council of port labour employersmr bevin was the recipient on tuesday and yesterday of many congratulations on his speech at the first public scalion of the court thougn he has had no training in forensic speaking he delivered an address wlich for the orderly presentation of facts and the sequence of argu ment would compare favourably with the speechl for the prosecution in any ordinary case before the courts occasionally he broke off in the marshalling of his carefully prepared statistical information and gave to his case a rhetorical but obviously personal fervour but for thle most part the statement was the more telling because it wvas dispassionate he spoke from tfirt to last as a man who believed thorouglhly in the justice of the claim which he advocated and was ready to let it stand solely on its meritsspecial interest attaches to that part of his statement which dealt with the profits reaped by shipowners it is no secret that the transport workers intend if they are permitted by the court to expose to the light of day the financial secrets of the shipping industry especially in the earlier years of the war just as mlr smillie haled before the sankey com mission a number of dukes who were royalty owners and extracted from them full details of the incomes which they derived from the getting of coal under their estates the dockers leaders would like to train the searchlight of publicity on the dividends distributed by the shipping companies profits and wagesr bevin stated that in the first  months of the war period they  pocketed  Â£ while the dockers obtained as the result of hard struggles an increase of about s a day in their wages he invited the president of the court if this statement ivere challenged to get from thle ministry of  shipping the memorandum submitted to the government as the basis on which they requisitioned the trans port services lord shaw did not indicate whether he would or would not call for the production of this docunent he did suggest that the introduction of the question of shipping profits might in some wvay prejudice the dockers case but beyond giving a friendly warning toir bevin he made no attempt to rule out the question of profitsthere was some force in lhfr bevins reply that whenever the workers ought to raise their standard of living they were met by tho statement that the employers could not afford to pay what they demanded from that point of view mnlr bevin insisted that evidence on profits was strictly relevant to the inquiry and later in his speech lie referred again and in more detail to the subject it is anticipated that before he brings his address to an end today he will have more to say about the big profits taken and high rates of dividend paid by shipping companies his contention is that if profits were reduced higher wages could be paid and better conditions established without the need for any addition to duesand charges which in the long run have to be paid by the consuming public ithe other point on which lr bevin lays great stress is the inhumanity of the system of casual labour this is no new probleni on the contrary it has taxed the best brains in the transport industry and outside it for many years and has been the subject of many oflicial and unofficial inquiries mr bevin asserts and it is not denied that owing to the uncertainties of weather conditions and other factors governinig the ebb and flow of business in a port the employers of dock labour have every incentive to keep close at hand a floating mass of casual labour which may be employed or left idle as occasion requires the present demands of the dockers apart from the wage claim raises this question indirectly and the transport workers evidently intend that it shall be publicly probed before the inquiry ends their view appears to be that even if the court fails to discover any solution of the problem of decasualization it will be bound to take into consideration in fixing the basic wage of a docker the uncertain and irregular character of his occupationthe inquiry has begun well it is evident that lord shaw while not insisting too rigidly on legal tchlnicalities and the rules of rele vance is disinclined to allow the investigation to be marred by such abuses as those which vitiated the sankey inquiry if the example of tone and manner set for the court by mir ievin bo followed by the representatives of the opposing side the inquiry cannot fail to inspire public confidenceunemployment insuranceamong the bills of direct interest to labour whiclh were held over from the last session of parliament was the measure for the establish ment of a broad hational schenie of comiipulsory and contributorv insurance against uneinploy ment on the eve of the newv session the minister of labour is seeldng to obtain the views of organized workers and employers on the pro posals embodied in the bill this afternoon lie will have a private conference on it with representatives of the parliamentary conumittee of the trndes union congress and on saturday he will hear the opinions of the confederation of employers associations it is anticipated that the trade union leaders will declare themselves opposed to the contributory principle in so far as it operates by way of deduction from the workers wages and will urge that any charge for the maintenance of the unemployed worker should fall wholly on the employer or the stateminers and coal profitsthe mlinors federation had not yesterday received the figures relating to the coal industry which the govermnent are obtaining from an independent accountant thoy may be in the hands of tlho prime minister when ho meets the parliamentary com mittee of the rades union congress and the minors this evening on the question of nationalization of the mnines and will no doubt be referred to as coal control will probably come within the range of the
