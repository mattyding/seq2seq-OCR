 rigid airsetipsproblems of  lift  i  hand size  irbritish developmentair commn odore e m mtaitland cmg dso presided last night at a lecture before the royal aeronautical society on rigid airships and their development by squadron leaer j e m pritchard which was followed by xn interesting discussion the paper was designed to discuss in general terms thereuire nents of future service and comnmercial airiships and the problems and difficulties to be overeotne in nmeeting these requirexents and vwas intended as a prelude to more detailed papers on the various specialized partis such as fabric nachinery and installationthe lecturer stated that the amount of resistance to progress through the air arising from thgf area of ghe masinmul cross section of the hull is small compared withthat due to the  skin friction  and proportional to the surface area increase in diameter and consequent reduction in length to diameter ratio reduced the skiin friction but incressed the head resistance and therefore a compromiso had to be efteted at which the combined resistance due to the two conflicting causes would be a minimum lhis appears to be when the ratio of length to dia netetr as about  though in presentday ships tbis is boxut  the  parasitic  resistance arising frona appendages such as fins cars external wires struts c is in a modern airahip about  per cent of the whole the question of bull form was further complicated by the fact that the smaller the length dim ter ratio or the more nearly spherical the lighteir the structure would be while on the other handif this were carried to excess greater macbinery weight would be required to overcome the increased resistanceeconoary in fgaf rom these considerations the lecturer evolved the axioro that the longer the distance to be flown requiring a greater amount of fuel to be carried the greater the economy in obtaining the lowest possible head resistance with a true streamline form converscly for short journeys the greater weight carrying capacity more than offsets the greater fuel consumption of the short ship of large diameterturning to the effects of increase in size mr pritchard pointed out that in airships the lift  vaties witb thc cube of the linea dimensions whereas in aeroplanes it only increases as the square a further advantage irl increaseof size resulted from the fact that the ratio of machinerr weight to gross lift varies inversely with te lincar dimensions resulting in a very material decrease in the per centage weight of machincry installation in large arships the results of this ivere clearly shown in a table comparing a presentday two million cubic foot ship with a  mlllido cubicfoot airship of the future of the same speed  mph and percentage of disposable to gross lft although the volume of the ship had increased five times the machinery weight was less than three times greater ln the large airship vhile the linear dimensions were less than doublethe outercover should theoretically fulfil three conditlons in order to overcome the effects of  super heating from the suns rays the outer poriola should have aluminium powder mixed with the dope or varnish to reflect as many as possible of the beat rays while beloa this some aarkcoloured dye should be used to absorb such heat rays as passed through the outer portion without being reflected any heat whieh still escae d through should be preventea from being absorbed by the gasbags by arrargilg a system or ventilation in the space between the outer cover and the gasbags in addition to this the outer cover should be smooth to reduce the resistance and waterproofgasbags were at prcsent lined with goldbeaters skin which was a very expensive process as only one skin is obtained from a single animal aid some  skins were needed for an airship of the r class in fact tho total cost of a complete set of skinlined gasbags approximated to Â£l  it was therefore svery desirable to find a light flexible dope to replace skins vhich there was reason to ho be evolvedin the near futureannarngnsnt or carsid the arrangement of cars british practice the lecturer said was tonding to diverge from german methods in the direction of baving each car fitted for a specialized purpose and doing away with the large composite car forwardcontaining coutrol cabin wireless cabin and engineroomfound in zeppelins the british system was to havo a small centreline control car well forward wbich was in some cases actually an extension of the keel behind this two or more pairs of enginecars are ltted at varying distances from tho centreline of tho ship to prevent intorferenco in the sip tream of thepropouers this arratemnernt bad the aldvantage of reducing the oyetalj h ght of the airshipa serious copsidezwtioa ilth the existing cramped sbeds which could theottleally be broughtdownto ao more than the maximumt diarneter of the airship though in practice it was desirsble to keep the hull wt or uft clear of the gtound to avoid danger of damage arlding fronn inequalities in tho landing ground it was very ismportant that macbinery installations ehould be developed so that powet units could bo rapidly changed as complete units if possible wlthbut takiag the airship into the shed british and german pracetice is also at variance in thte susponsion of ears trhe zeppolins bad a com bination of struts and wires wbile the british used floating cars with the minitmum number of struts this has the advantage of preventing the trans mlssion of the shock of a heavy landing to the hulli sttucture but the zeppeiin system was probably preterablo owing to its greater safety and reliabilitylow weight rtas not sech a necessary desideratura in airship englnes as othet featuresi such as re liability fuel ecoanomy

to fuel igniltion thafn to tao presence of inflammable bydrogen and there fore the advantagb of using heliuum was consider ably overrated the lecturer concluded by calling attention to the porformances of airships during the war and to the baltic and atlantic flights of r which showed that great btitaih iwus second only to germany in airship developmentslix alan andensnoi speaking as a potential user of aircraft said that he was interested in this sub ject as one who was waitibg to see of what use these machines were likely to be for commnercial purposes he did not see anything insuperable in the outlook the governmient would no doubt have to talke a hand in the first stage which was bound to be more or less experimental but it vas first necessary to show that the ptoject was comnercially possible and then the public would cotme in the problems ot flight wete similar to those of sea navigation one had the same need to judge between the desire to hurry and the desire to carry weight even a tramp steamer had got enough power to ensure her steering off a te slore with a certainty but it would be a long time before an airship had a reserve of powver cont tained within her to allow her navigators that degree of confldence in the second place the surface ship wanted immense size and immense force she had to be big enough to carrysufficient fuel to drive lher through the water in order to get an economical load her superstructure must be able to carry a large number of pasengers under these condiuons sur face ships needed to runi to large centres of popula tion in order to pay there wa a rheh mnore diffi clt problem with regard to airships as far as he could judge they could certkly travel vith much greater speed but at the sarne time theyaurrled aiu were bouhd to carry a much less weight of passengers and material it seelned to him that the aircraft service of the futture should form a link in the existing form of interoen communications with a view to rapidity ifhete were plebty of wealthy people now able sad willitng to pby the price for a formn of travel which did away with all its nasty sides ad which mleant a saving of time lie did not think there was any reasoik at this stage to disatimmiatebetween the airship and the aeltplane there was room for both of them in the lit the thing was to get them started comnercially
