the africanflightprinces goodwishesdispatch fromv dr mitchellanother vimy inthe fieldwe have received the following message from sir sidntby greville comptroller to the prince of walesthe prince of wales wishes every success to dr chalmers mitchell and crew of the aeroplane on the journey across the african continentthe times aeroplane is now at helio polhs the aerodrome of cairo it is to be overhauled before starting on its journey of scientific exploration from cairo to cape townon tuesday at  pm the aeroplano landed at heliopolis  minutes ahead of the estimate sent from benghazidr mitchell who arrived in cairo having travelled by way of trieste in time to greet the crew of the aeroplane on its arrival reports that the pilots are very pleased with their machine but as the petrol supply south of khartum is expected to be irregular a rapid trip is hardly to be looked forthe delay at heliopolis is caused by the necessity for readjusting the engines for the tropics and testing all parts of the machine in order to get rid of the desert sand which had insinuated itself in a re markable degree during the storms en countered in northern africano precise date for departure has yet been fixed by dr mitchell but it has been provisionally arranged to start about  oclock tomorrow morningboth airmen express themselves well pleased with their machine and profess their ability to leave after so short an interval that if their estin ates te correct the machine should again be ready to resume its southward trip shortly after noon todayyesterday another vickersvimy piloted by two distinguished officers of the south african defence force and belonging to the union government left london for the cape the enterprise lof the pilots is weliknown and they may be expected to make a swift passagemeanwhile it is well to emphasizetthat the purpose of the times is to make a definite scientific exploration and totest thb practical utility of the cape to cairo air route thus the flight will not be a race nor a merely spectacular perform ance but a pioneer effort in exploration from the air and a serious attempt to show whether africa can be traversed easily and safely from end to end by proper aircraft in ordinary conditionsfor this purpose dr peter chalmers mitchell cbe dsc lld frs a member of the staff of the times and a man of bigh scientific attainments is being sent as passenger and observer on the machine he will carry an auto graph letter from his majesty the king to the governorgeneral of south africa and will make zoological and other scienti fic observations during the course of the journeyobstacles en routethe airmen have already experienced adverse weather conditions encountering a severe thunderstorm between malta and tripoli they were also delayed in their departure for benghai on the tripoli coast by heavy rain and had to dodge the stormis which beset the earlier parts of the sollumcairo stagein egypt the weather is reported to be unsettled but likely to improve as the aero plane makes its southingin the lower sudan the time of year is favour able for avoiding the destractive habbub which at certain seasons assails khartum with fiercely whirling sand and renders life odious to man and beastgales however are to be feared in the upper sudan and rain is likely at mongalla but really serious opposition from weather is not expected much north of the equatornews has been received from abercorn that greeat improvements have just beenn made in the landing ground and that high grass which had grown up over the emnergency landing ground at zimba has been cut this excessive vegetation which may be looked for in all the equatorial stopping places had to be dealt with as even a voluntary landing in really long elephant grass might well strain the machine and cause delaythe theory of the flight is that it should be conducted in such a way as to enable the observer to prepare a scientific record of the route as a gtuide for future development the possible value of such a record even if con fined only to the photography to be done by dr chalmers mitchell can be gauged from the remarkable work done by the royal air force in mapping from the airparticularly in palestine where the whole of the staff maps used for general allenbys laster eamaignl were revised in the light of the information supplied from aerial photographsit may not of course be possible to obtain such excellent restults from a single machine in a single journey the more so as the atmospheric conditions probably prevalent in the equatorial belt where accurate observations are most needed will almost certainly affect the light to a degree which will only be calculable after coa siderable experiencethe flying laboratoryy z mbedical corresmdetthe medical world has just recently been greatly interefted in the suggested use of  floating laboratories  in the form of steamers on the rivers in tropical countriesa proposal which was made in the first instance by colonel andrew balfour yesterday the idea that the  flyig laboratory might soon be available i addition wvas being discused asthe outcome of the announcement of dr chalmers miitchells forthcoming flightthe aeroplane ahould be able to carry a large amount of laboratory equipment and should thus make investigation possible in places hitherto almost inaccessible the vast importance of this in the investigation and prevention of tropical diseases requires no emphasiing
