recovering the difference if any between sale price and s from the treasury every monthlziolly inadequate guaranteessir herbert matthews secretary to the central chtlamber of agriculture since  stated to ai representative of the yimes that the mdinirnum prices recommended by the royal conimissioin were wholly inadequate and that nothing less than the s for wheat suggested by air webb would induce farmers to maintain mucll less to increase their acreage under cornthe encouragement of the home production of corn is he saiti thio biggest question tho govern meat have to tackle it i were a farmer having regard to present conditions and the prospects of the future i should turn every acre to grass that i recognize would not be to the interest of the country but as it business man  should havo to consider the necessity of getting a return on my capitalsir hierbert matthews added that the tendency among agriculturists vas to give up corn production and turn to cattleraising or dairying and to dairying particularly because of labour troubles hl pointed out that under tho hours of employment bill laid before parliament last session by sir r home minister of labour and to be introduced again next session the working wveek is not to exceed  hours and though persons employed in agriculture are expressly excluded by the bill the farming community have reason to fear that the lovern ment vwill give way to the prcssure of the labour parby and extend the bill to aigriculture if this were done said ir herbert mat lohewvs it is doubtful whether even the guaranteed price advocated by mr webb would induce farmers largely to increase their corn productionlast years corn ciiopson inquiry at the board of agriculture it was ascertained that the extent of land under wheat in england and wales last year was  acres as compared with  acres in  the total production of wheat last year was  quarters but although this is ftully  million quarters less than in  when the crop of wvlieat was the highest on record and almost half a million quarters less than in  it isapart from the two years mentionedtho lhighest sinco  and nearly half a million quarters above the average of the last  yearsthe total production of barley in  was  quarters this is  quarters less than in  and  quarters below the average and with the exceptton of  and  it is the smnallest crop since oficial estimates were iirt col lected in oats in  yiclded  quarters as com pared with  in  the highest on recordclear policy neededdangers of delayby ouit aoricultuitkl correspondentmr h l nvebb in his letter in the times of yesterday raised the question of the wheat supply in it new and arresting form his manner of review elevated it from the industrial or narrower spect to tlle national and wider domain if the problem is ever to be solved even partially in a manner favourable to the broad interests of this country it will be only by viewing and treating it on the lines inci cated by mfr webbthe food supply is primarily and essentinlly a question for the nation attempts may be made and have been made to saddle the farmers with the blame vhen supplies run short but without either reason or justic the collective responsibility must lie with those who shape and sanction the agricul tural policy of the country and only in a minor or superficial degree if at all with the section whose systems anid operatioins are determined by itmr webb recognizes the fundamental necessity of a definite and enduring policy and it may be taken that the object of cis timely letter was to impress on his countrymen the urgency as a startingpoint of a satisfactory agreement en this principletil e farmers positionthe wiider linancial aspect of the subject is outside the province of the farmer who is intimately con corned only whefn it comes to the production of the wheat itr may be doubted whether the standard of annual output indicated by mr webb million quarters instead of the present eight million quarterscould be mainltained for an indefinite period as there would be a greater tendency to soil exhaustion but if the result is made flancially attractive and reasonably secure the wheat wvihl be forthcoming in greatly increased quantitythe market is the determnining factor urnder present conditions wheatgrowing is not profitable to occupiers of some of the best wheat landthe heavyfournorse soils that used to yield good cropsand i of the lighter and poorer classes of land the prices i mentioned by mr webb look generous but in actual i practice are not excessivethis country has long cultivated the short view in regard to its sulpply of breadsitulfs in particular it ib already clear that the lessens of the submarine have been forgotten or are ignored and that imports from any country even at higher prices than are paid for homegrowvn corn and payable only by means of heavy subsidies are preferred to vwheat from british countiesthe famer has made his cropping arrangements for the harvest of  he may of course seed down some of his arable land to grass in the coming ugpring but broadly there will be no extensive altera tion of plan before the autumn accordingly there is time for mir webbs scheme to mature before the reversioni of land to grass has begun on a large scale but the importance and difficulty of the question will brook no delay a letter from mr herbert
