breaking thetreatywar criminals listrefusedvon lersner resignsrroi  ouraw coritespondetparis feb last night the list of officers officials pripees and politicians whose surrender is asked for by the allies was duly communicated to baron von lersnerthis morning baron von lersner returned the document to m millerand and informed him that he was resigning his post as head of tho german delegation and would leave for berlin the ambassadors council considered this fresb manifestation of german feeling this morning and is continuing its deliberations this after noonalthough baron von lersneres action was shouted aloud along the boulevards as a sensa tional item of news it cannot be said that it surprises those who have been following closely the course of the conversations on this point the allies are the last to minimize the diffi culties with which the german government have to deal in meeting the allied demand difficulties that have been to some extent in creased by the premature mention of those whose trial is to be insisted upon nevertheless people in great britain have to realize the felonies that were committed by the german armies in france and the other invaded countries of the alliance they have also to accept the fact that in france there is a very large body of public opinion which from an ideal standpoint is more than anxious that crimes against  the laws of war and the dictates of humanity shall be punishedhigh above such natural sentiments is the principle which is now at stake there is an unfortunate feeling here that british opinion as represented by mr lloyd george while strenuous in its wordy faith is likely to be somewhat lukewarm in action over this pointletter and spiritwhen all is said and done germanys action through baron von lersner places the allies dramatically and practically also in front of the questiondo they or do they not want to revise the treaty of versailles germanys delegates at the galerie des glaces declared that they intended faithfully to carry out the terms of the document which they had signed on many minor points they have broken the letter of the treaty on nearly all they have failed to observe the spirit now we are con fronted with the first real difficultyquite apart from the allies attitude towards germany we have to think of the relations between the allies themselves both in great britain and in france the versailles treaty has been accepted for good or for evil as the basis upon which we are to build up a further period of peace in europe there is naturally in the interpretation of such a comprehensive document a wide field for the discussion and the application of its provisions but there are some points upon which there exists no room what ever for a divergence of views and there are some points upon which it is absolutely neces sary to stand firm we are not ourselves going to undermine the very foundations we have laidchallenge to alliesbaron von lersners departure this evening will be a challenge not only to the allies not only to article  of the treaty of versailles  it will challenge the whole treaty of versailles it is an act contrary to all diplomatic custom the nearest comparison wvith which can be found when germany tore up the  scrap of paper and if the allies accept such a slap in the face it will be a frank confession of their inability to carry out the terms of the versailles peacein his letter of last night returning the list of the war guilty baron von lersnef recalls the many efforts he has made to dissuade the allies from insisting upon the application of article  his last proposalnamelv that of the supreme court at leipzig with the allies as prosecuting counsel and with the possibility of an appeal to the league of nationshas already been reported baron von lersner has left no stone untumed to wriggle out of the undertaking signed at versaillesbaron von lersner states in his letter that he has no desire to know the contents of the list which was communicated to him and which ho has now returned he informs the supreme council that ho intends to leave paris tonight as will be remembered herr mayer who is german charg daffaires left paris on the even ing of the day on which he presented his cre dentials to m mlillerand baron von lersners departure will therefore be equivalent to a rupture of diplomatic relationsvon lersners authoritythe ambassadors council which is having much more important and practical matters to deal with than fell to the lot of the preceding big four met this morning and met again this evening at halfpast  to consider the terms of the letter in reply to baron von lersners communication the draft which will probably be approved is a quite formal acknowledgment of baron von lersners letter and a formal re statement of the allies attitudewhat that attitude is may be stated briefly as followsthe allies within the time limit laid down by the peace treaty have enabled germany to carry out one of the main stipula tions of the peace they can hardly believe that baron von lersner has the authority on a matter of such gravity to speak for the german government therefore the note which has been drawn up by this evenings meeting of the ambassadors council will be communicated to germany through a channel other than baron von lersner whom the allies hold to be an executive officer who has resigned his position in fact diplomatically at any rate the allies are unable to regard baron von lersner who now resigns as representing more than the old official class in germany and without further notice cannot accept his refusal as binding upon the german governmentthe distinction which the french at all events endeavour to draw between baron von lersners attitude and that of his government would appear to be borne out by the latest information according to news received here from cgermany via switzerland baron von lersner received definite instruction from his government to forward the allies list of war criminals to berlinthe council of ambassadors has this evening decided in principle the action to be taken with regard to the germans who have been demanded for trial no definite step will however be adopted before the british cabinet has been con sulted the list of persons whom the allies demand for trial wvill with an accompanying note be presented directly to the germin government at berlin the french charge daffaires will probably be entrusted with this missionlist to be handedo over inberlinpanis feb it is officially announced that the decision of the allies with reference to the extradition of war criminals will be communicated direct to the german govern ment in berlinreuter the german governmenrts reasons for objecting to the delivery of war criminals are published on
