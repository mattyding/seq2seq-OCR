hige court of jurtti qouens bench divistonbefore mx justice field and m justioc matistin pe a solicitorex parte jenningsthis was a rehearing by order of the court of a case decided on the th of april last in which a solicitor mr augstus henry alauleof newnbam gloucestershire was struck off the rolls mr maule was on the former hearing charged in an affidavit by miss jennings with having been intrusted by her in  with sums amounting to  for investment and having failed either to invest or return the same also with having failed to pay except by a dis honoured cheque a suum of � collecteci for the same lady in january last mir maule not appearing or taking any notice of these charges wras summarily struck off the rollstoday mr wood appeared for him and having satis fied the court that the notice of motion on that occasion had by some strange fortuity not quite satisfactorily explained to them not been served upon mr maulethe couvr being of opinion that so serious a charge as that of having i mproperly converted and applied to his own use  a clients money had not been sufioiently proved remarked that the arsragement by which maule undertook to pay  per cent interest on the amount in question so long as it remained uninvested was an unwise and undesirable system of business and that the irregu larity of maules payments of interest to his client an old and illiterate woman vwas till more censurable however the case after explanations made by the solicitor now that he availed himself of the opportunity of explaining matters to the court now appeared relieved of much of the suspioious appearance which it at first sight presented and wasnot one for the infliction of punisbment for miscon duct the solicitor would be reinstated on the list on payment of costs to

prepared to ex plain his conauct actions words and writings and there was nothing in them which the jury could properly con demn the defendant was not bound to weigh carefully every word he used he did not wish to stir up any re ligious bigotry but he wished them to see the manner the obscenity and the ooarseness with which the plaintiff put forward his views in this review which could not bit be revolting to those to whom the views themselves were abhorrentand which he stigmatized as an outrage on society and onthe press of this country he hoped the jury would say his client had done
