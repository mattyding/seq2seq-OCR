who moved to amend the motion by leaving out all the words after standing orders in order to insert   and  be suspended and that the bill be referred to the examiners of the petitions for private bills he said that us he had for many years taken some part in the conduct of private business in that house and had been chairman of the manchester ship canal bill committeehewished tosaya few words in support of the amendment of which he had given notice the pro posal before the house appeared to him not only to go far beyond the necessities of the case but to be calculated to place the ilouse in a false position with regard to this matter the promoters of this bill asked the house to allow them to raise a very large sum by way of debentures before hall their capital had even been subscribed and without having asked the previous consent of the existing shareholders he proposed to so amend the terms of the motion as to enable the examiners to inquire whether the proposal embodied in the bill had been sanctioned by a meeting of the shareholders of the company in moving this amendment he desired that it should be clealy un derstood that he hadno desire to delay the progress of this measure in a way that would be injurious to the future success of the undertaking his only wish was that those of the subscribers to the shares who dissented from the proposal now made should have an opportunity of witharawmg from their engagements to contribute to the capital of the company ear hear another difflculty that presented itself to his mind was that there did not appear to be such a body of shareholders who might properly form a proprietary within the meanine of the standing orders inasmuch as they had only subseribed for three or four millions of capital s ub modo under con ditionsvwhich might notbefulslledand who might not therefore be competent to express their assentto or dissent from the present proposal the whole matter ought there fore to be fully inquired into he beged to move the amendment of wfhich he had given notice hear hearmr houldsworth said that there was no intention on the part of tbe promoters of this bill to interfere in any hay with the rights of either the shareholders or those who had undervvritten a portion of the capital of the company the whole matter would be fully laid before them at a maeeting wlhich was to be held shortly and they would then be able either to consent to this proposal nr to withdraw altogether from the undertaking hear hear even if this tmeasure were not passed the undertaking would still survive although its further progress might be delayed for another year he trusted however that the house would consent to read tha bill a second time that day as other wise he was afraid it would not be got through parliament this session and that would involve the loss of another  to the shareholders there was a strong feeling in manchester and in yorkshire in favour of the unddrtak ing which would rather increase than diminish the rail way traffic in the district seventy per cent of the sub scribers to the capital had already intimated theirapproval of this proposal hear hearmir coulrtsey in order to save the time of the house suggested that the bill should be referred to a select committee of that house consisting of four mem bers for the purpose of inqui being made into the point whethet the financial conditions imposed by the former committees of both houses upon this undertaking might be safely relaxed hear hear he understood that all parties asseuted to that course being adopted hearmr sclaterbooth intimated his willingness to wyithdraw the amendment of which he had given notice that the bill be referred to the examiners of private bills if the chairmau of ways and means would undertake to move au instruction to the select committee of the nature he had mentionedmr sinclair inquired whether the chairman of ways and meals would accept the motion which stood in his namethat the select committee should consist of uine membersba courtney said he thought it undesirable to increase the number of the committee he would will ingly comply with the request of the right hon member for north hantssir j xowbray expressed his opinion that four members were quite sfficient to deal with such a question as that proposed to be referred to this committeeur houldswvorth said that he was not awate of the negotiatons to which reference had been made now however ho was given to understand that the promoters had beet consultedand though he held to the opinion that the course suggested was unnecessary he should not further oppose it the bill distinctly provided that before the work was done parliament must be satisfied that the financial conditions had been fulfilled by the company pro ducing a certificate from the board of trade to the effect that live millions of capital had been botld jic subscribedmr sinolair said that he should nob press his amendmentmr addison observed that the supporters of the bill would like to understand who were to have locts standi before the select committee seeing the alacrity with which the opponents of the measure accented the euggestion qf the haiuran of ways n d u eptw d thedthat the bill would not be allowed to pus within the short time now left to the promoters unless the select com mitteo were ordered to report the sill by a certain date liear hearsie j goldsmi thought that this being a question solely as to how capital was to be raised concernled no otne but the shareholders and the public ho trustedthat the reference would he a narrow one and that the london and northwestern railway company would not be allowed a lts atandimr courtnei said thero would be no danger of the multiplication of persons havintg locus standi to argue now whether the liondon and northwestern railway company bad a iocutf standi to oppose this bill was discuss ing a question better leftto thecselect committee in all probability the oiily bodies to whom locus stand would be granted would be the london and northwestern rail way company the miersey docks and harbour board and the corporation of liverpool who would most likely be represented by the satme counsel the reference would be confined solely to the points he had mentionedsir h james said the chaircoan of ways and means could not guarantee thatthe inquiry woould be a short one as that would dependl npon the character of the opposition he therefore gave notice that when the chairman of ways and means moved the instruction to the committee he should move as a further instruction that the select com mittec should report the bill to the house at a date to be named hear hearthe amendment was then by leave withdrawn anld the motion agreed to

forthcoming reorganizations of those services it was contemplated to compeusate in any way those who suffered from the r promotion being deferred to considerably longer period than they were led to
