the vatican ad home rilerome just the numerous reports in circulation with refer ence to vatican matters either in connexion with home rule or the delicate subject of diplo matic relations with england have so little basis in fact and are so little justified by any negotia tions known to havo been initiated directly or indirectly officially or officiously that one is per fectly justified in declaring them to be the efforts of correspondents to fill a void the interviews of the duke of norfolk and other english personages with high officialsand their audiences of the pope have no revealed connexion with any discussions connected with ireland or with the question of diplomatic relations with england one may go further and say that the question of reconcilia tion with italy is equally dormantwith reference to home rule it is perfeetly well known that his holiness has no sympathy with mr parnells campaign and that the official opinion of the church has not been prcnounced pro or con because the energetic pressure of the majority of the irish bichops holds the normal con servative tendencies of the vatican in check the large majority of the english priesthood being of irish birth and that majority beingwith few excep tions in favour of irish independence it is natural that their influence as a body should have great weight with the head of the chiurch and this weight may be taken as the measure of the con servative influence which it counterbalances further than this nothing can be said as to the attitude of thepope with reference to home rule and the constant assuranoes of loyal english catholics that the interests of the church have nothing to fear from the english government will probably induce a continuance of this negative attitudethe pope is perfectly well informed on the sub ject of ireland and adiplomatic agent here would probably add nothing to his knowledge but might materially influence his decisions as to action it is certain that the pope desires the establishment of diplomatic relations with england the italian government is perfectly aware of the importance of the question of home rule to the stability of the english government and i have good reason to believe that in the present circumstances the appointment of an english representative at the vatican would hardly be regarded as inconsistent with the hearty goodwill which the english nation is known to entertain for italy and if the influence of the pope could strengthen the hands of her majestys government no nation would be more the gainer than this public opinion is somewhat influ enced by the mannerunaccountable to the italian mindin which the english authorities deal witlh the refractory element in ireland their reluctaneo to onforc the lltw raising a presump tion that the law is wrong but beyond this excusable confusion the public is very much at ono with the government as far as can bejrdged from this point the presence of an officialrepresentative of the queen atthevati can may do good and can do no harmof course if the much talked of reconciliation between church and state in italy were accom plished all difficulty on this ground would be removed but this greatly to be desired conclu sion is as much in the clouds as it ever has been entire freedom of discussion is allowed on both sides but so far not the slightest authority attaches to any of the published schemes no one has any authority from the pope to suggest any abatemenï¿½ of his claims to the temporal power and nothing is more certain than that the italian government will allow no mediation or guaran te e any concession of territorial sovereignty must always rest on its own good will which effectivey is a return to the status qrto prior to i learn from excellent authority that cardinal manning is with the majority of the irish bishops on the question of home rule
