graves ikes roceetr and m stevens cbeeter ship canal com panythe report of the council congratulated the association on hving made satinfactory prozres throughout a year of almost unprecedented depression owing to the determined attempt on the part of the leading railway companies to increase their statutory rates aud the necessity on the part of traders for an equais determined resistance  was both as regards finauce and numerical strength au escep tional year and no proper comparison could be made upon those points with that and any other year there had becn less litigationl than in recedin wears and the withdrawl of the government iway biif owing to ministedal em hrassmepts had caused less public nttcntion than usuad to be directed towardsthe wrk of the association t the esenseof initiating opposition to certain points of the biu had however been incurred and there fiad been further unlookedfor expenditure in connexion with steps which it had been considered desirable to take with res ect to the general election miuch useful work had been done with reference to the canal questionand a judicial decision on a very vexed question adverse unfortunately to trad ing interests had been obtained the journal of the association now its fourth year of existence bad been maintained and the railway and canal bills deposited for the presenat session had been examined and reported upon by counsel as in previous years the eficieucy of te association had been fuly maittaineduand satisfactory pro gress had been made towards effecting the objects which it had been formed

greaterefficiencytho thryanxv in moving the adoption of the report said it showed that a good amount of active work had been done unostentatiously by the association during the past year the object of the association was generaly the protection of the interests of traders and manufacturers using the railways of this country and the protection was to be extended in the first place by informing members as to their rights with respect to ni num rates undue preference and railway facilities and in difficult circumstances to inform the subscribers and members what their rights wereto give them advice generallyand to sone extent cooperate aso in vindicating theirrightsifthe assocaition should see its way to do so during the past year there had been  applications from members for adviceand in  of those cases the opinion of the standing counsel of the association hadbeen taken as to the rights of the tradersinthecircumstancesrdescribedbythe appheants the views of the association on trade depression had been stated before te royal commission by mr flinn wbo had pointed out how the policy of the railway companies particularly in inland towns obstructed the development of be trads of the country the association had also done  great deal to enlighten public opinion as to the means of transport by the canals of the country of course tbe railway nd canal taraffic bill had ocupied a considerabamounat of the attention of the council of the association dizn the tear and a formal resolution would be sbitted to the meeting embodying the riews of the council on that important subject the conclusion they had arrived at was the outcome of consultations with chambers of commerce and other traders associatiors throughout the country generally speaking broadly the reaolution in question sthted generally the conclusion cf the traders with respect to the bill now before the house of commons one important question in which the assoals tien had taken very considerable intereat during the year was the attept to have the law settled with respect to terminal charges that natter was bought before the courts by te late mr ball of croydon the result of the action be regretted to sayhad been tis factory not from any failuro on thre part of the association but thlrough an awward blunder on the part of the segislature which by the change el the juris dctiona few years agohabut out the appeals which mr hall had desired to take against the decilsion of a divisiam of the court the case would now have to be tried in some other formaxr eniy snplzy great grimaby seconded thu

and harbour board londonderry and w w blackstonea vote of thanks having been passed to the councilthe crairm proposed the following resolation  that the railway and canal traffic bill as amended byr the house of lords is unmtisfactory because  as respects undue preference the bill seriously impairs the safeguards of the existing law and  the provisions for bringing about uniformity of clauification ana revision of eaziinum rates am not calculated to forward the objecti desired but seriously to prejudice the agricultural anti trading interests of the community that with the object of facilitating the psasing of the measure to improve tho constitution and increase the rowers of the esilwa com muission so aniously desired by the trading public tho overnment be recommended toirop clauses  and  af the bill now before the house he desiredto say thas the association had no hostility to the railway companies or their shareholderr wvhose rights they ha no wish to interfere with wbat tbey asked for was atribunal by which the rights and interests of parties would be declarect in a summary ecolemical and efficient manner thy believedthat the interests of traders and manufactureni and of the railway companies were identical the more the trade of the country prospered the greater would ho the work to be done by tha railway companies and the more economically and efficiently the latter could conduci their transport business the greater would be the amounl of work they would have to do the point at issue between the traders and the companies was briefly this thlu traders contended that the principal element in cousider mng the charge for transport should be the cost of performn ilg the service on the other hand the railway companies contended that the principal consideration which should enter into the making of she charge was how much the traffic would bear he mentioned various objections to clauses  and  of the bill and said that if the govern ment persisted with thembe thought it would be the duty of tbe council of the associatiou to raise traders ana thi country generally tothe dancers of the clauses inquestionthe eon p stanhope mpin seconding the motion stated that the birmingbam and midland freighter association of which he was chairman had arri vedat tho conclusion that they would get no substantial beieft in regard to freight until they had been able to establish a really serious competition against railways such as could be brought abdut bycanals when thesill was in com mittee he intended to propose clauses for the creation of canal trusts throughout the country the manchester ship canal had only been carried out by an etordinaramount of dificulty  and his association thought that the initiative in such matters in the future should be left to the local authoritymr josrna flinr in supporting the motion main tained that the two clauses mnentioned wrere so unjust that they ought to strain every nerve to prevent such iniquli tous powers from being given to the railway compamesthe motion was carried unanimouslythe hon p stalrnors next proposed the following resolution  that iu the opinion of this meeting the present policy of the railway companies renders it quite impossible for inland towns to maintain their normal trad ing prosperity and that the formation of the manchcstet ship canal and the improvement of the waterwsp between birmingham and london and birmingham and the bristol channel wllu offer the hbet means of placing these important towns in a position equal to that of towns situate on navigable rivers or the seaboardmr josepii watson secondedand mir james duncan supportedthe motionthe lattergentleman giing instances showing the cheapness of canal as coupared with railway
