tie torpudo expbrmbtts atpobtsmouththe torpedo experiments against the iesistance were re sumed at portsmouth yesterday afternoon when the venerable ironclad suffered some rough not to say shame ful treatment at the instigation of captain long and his vernon staf  but everyibing is considered fair inwar as the experiment was understood to be the last of the secacderies amd was fully expected to have a sensational terai natioua considerable number of intejested spectators were attracted to tbe scene in fareham creek iacluding a pumvi ber of photographers amateur and professional who hoped to catch and perpetuate the dying throes of the brave old ship for some time before the impending convulsion occurred all eyes were riveted upon the object and as there was nothing to inform an observer outside the ring of officialwhen the supreme momenthad arrived the pro bability is that the artists were too startledby the shock toattend to their camieras the torpedoistsresortedto severe measures yesterday but with a distinctly useful purpolre in view having bound the ship hand and feet so to spewi in such a way that hev name becamoe a selecis they exploded b of guncotton ft below tbq water and in contact with her double bottom this amount of explosive represents the full charge of the old ppttern in whiteheads but as the bulk was for prudeptial reasons moored close to a muludbank aund as the water was consequfently much too shallow to allow of a locomotive torpedo being set to run at the required deptb a fixed chbrge wag lashed fore and aft against the bottom plating of the ship and eleotricaly exploded from nto  torpedo boatin previoun experiments this year the ironclad wa attacked on the port side which bhd been specily strengthened for the occasion and the result a we have pointed out was a victory for the defence yesterday the starboard side was selected for attack in order that a com parison might be instituted with the effectsproducedunder differenit conditions by a similar experiment last year in the latter case the double bottom was filled with coal and after the charge which was lashed sgainst the ship in the same way had been exploded it was found that the bilge keel had been shivered for a length of oft while the lower pllating had been much bulged above the bilge keel four strakes of the shlnpiatinigextending up tq the armour shelf bad also been forced inwards and fractured where they crossed the longitudinal frames they had parted in the middle for a distance of mt while some of the butts had been opened so that gashes in or in wide appeared between theml the coal had been pulverized and scattered in all directions and other internal damage inflieted xeverthelesi the watertight bulkheads remaided intact and by confining the influx of water to a single compart ment so much buoyancy was preserved that though the ship heeled over to starboard andwas maimedshe remained afloat and might have contiued to fght her gus pro vided always that no injury had been sustaied by her machinery a point which these experiments do not touch crippled however as she was it was thought at the time and the probability was strengtbened by subsequent examination of the ship in dock that the coa instead of being a protection to the double bottom had in teality proved a source of weakness by receiving the euergy of the explosion from the outer plating and communicating it to the inner plating and so distributing it throughout the submerged portious of the hulk were this reasoning just it will be seen at once that by packing the statious with coal the essential purpose of a double bottom which is to keep the ship afloat by means of the inner imn after the outer skin is injured was vitiated the question was suffiiently important to demand az experimental solution hence the raison dgtre of the present demonstration the double bottom which is about mft deep was consequently kept empty and the torpedo placed iu immediate contact with it in such a marner that being overhung by the contour of the hull the ship would feel the full force of the upward as well as the lateral erergy of the charge on other acconnts the importance of the experiment was obvioua for although it had been ascertained that torpedo nets were capable of protecting a battle ship from the bursts of the heaviest locomotive and outrigger charges it might happen of course tlhat the nets would be rent or displaced by shell fire or swept away by a graning ram or even attacked by a double torpedo the second passing throughl the gashes rmade by the explosiou of the first in any caseit was of urgent necessity that the effect of a torpedo bursting in immediate contact with a ships bottom should be practically and clearly determined the charge yester day was fired juast before  oclock in the wake of the boilersand it was socn perceived that something of a fatal character had taken place from the appearance of coil dust sweeping up throngh the bold the report had not the dull boom to wbich the spectator had become accus tomed instead of this tbe gun cotton exploded with a sharp angry whistling noise while the manner in which the mud was churned up showed that the force of the rebound was terrific theb ship lifted bodily near tho stern after which it was seen to leisurely heel over to starboard some eight or ten degrees and finaly repose though not until the tide fell upon the mud the old hulk had been mortally wounded at last a complete knowledge of the disaster which has overtaken her will not be obtained until a careful investigation has been made of the hull in dock but from a hasty exploration which was conducted on boaud itwas evident that the shothad not only dislocated the inner plating of the double bottom but i had penetrated the bunker compartment stored as it was with coal that the watertight doors and compart ments had ceased to operate and that water was fflowing into the hull through a hundred crevices to such an extent was this the case that though a strong working party was at hand ready for any emergency it was deemed useless to attempt to free the ship of water until her gashes had been temporarily closed from out side when this has been done she will be pumped out and brought into lock for careful examination from what has been said it will be seen that while the explosion of b of guncotton in actual contact last november simply crippled the resistance the explosion of a like charge at the same spot and under approxi mately the same conditionshas in this instance not simply disabled but really sunk the ship the firing was witnessed by among others the director of naval con struction and several members of the intelligence de partment
