whether professors at universities had a copy right in theirlecttires delivered to students attendingtheir classes their lcrdships by a majority reversing thb decision of the majority ofthe scotch judgesand deciding that a professor has such a copyright the case was argued before the lord chancellor lord watson and lord fitzieraldsir h davey qc the solicitorgeneral for scotlnd and mr j v clvrk of the scotch bar appeared for the appellant and r j c eorincr of the scotch bar and hlir hsclyrmont for the respondentthe appelant was professor o� moral philosophy in the university of glas�gowvand the respondent was a bookseller end publisher in glassgrlw the appellant delivered certain lectures to his cla in the cbursc of the winter sessions of the university and the respondent had published the substance of the lectures the action was brought for the purpose of preventing the respondent from continuing to publsh the appellants lectures thequestion whether auniversity professor had n copyright in lectures de livered in such circumstances was inuch discussed in the scotch curts with the result that the majority of the scotch judges were of opinion that he had no such copy rightlord watsow delivered what was substantially the judgment of the house lord fitzgerald differing this aupal is taken in two conjoined processes in etituted in the sheriff court of lanarksbire by the appellant who is professor of horal philosophy in the university of glasgow for the purpose of having the re spordent a bookseller in that city interdicted from pub lishing or advertising for sale certain books or pamphlets entitled  aids to the study of moral philosophy on the ground that these works are mere reproductions of the lectures delivered bythe appellant to the students who attend his classinthe university indefence therespondent pleads in the first place that the publications sought to be interdicted are not substantially the same with the appellants lectures but represent the views of the person who compiled them and are the result of his independent studyand research and in the second place that the delivery of the appellants lectures in the classroom of the university is cquivalent to publication and that he has consequently lost his right to prevent their publics tian inpn orinted form these defences raise two issues the first being a question of fact which if the actions ha originated in the court of session would have beenappropriately tried before a jury the second being a ques tion of law the sheriffsubstitute granted perpetual interdict as craved and ordained the respondent to deliver up to the appellant all copies of the publications com plained of remaining in his hands or within his control tho learned sheriffsubstitute by his interlocutor found that  the said books or pamphlets are in substance reproductions more or less correct of the lectures inx use to be delivered by the pursuer to his class of moral philosophv in the university of glasgow   and he furtber fond tat  the said lectures are the property of the puruer and that the defender has not shown that the purmer has iu any way lost his right of property theremn or that he has acquired from the pursuer or in any other lawful wy a right to publish or reproduce said lectures therespondentappealed to the second division who ordered the cause with minutes of debate to be laid beforo the wbole judges of the court for their opinion the result was that of the  consulted judges a majority of nine were of opinion that the respondents publications are substantially a reproduction of the appellants lectures onuthe d of october  the second division pro nounced the interlocutor whch is now brought under review it contains the following findings  find that the liuisucr is professor of moral philosophy in the university of glasgow and that the lectures referred to iri this record were delivered by him to his students as part of his ordinary course find that the defender who is a booksoller in glasgow published the works now complained of find that these works were compiled by a student who had attended the class taught by the pursuer and also hatl taken notes in shorthand of the purser s lectures these are in all respects proper find idgsalthough they set forth facts which were not seriously disputed the important part of the interlocutor follows  bet find in conformity with the opinions of the majority of the whole court that such publica tion did not contitute an infringement of any legal right of property or otherwise belonging to or vested in the pursner therefore dismiss tihe appeal c the only question which can be competently raised and decided in this appeal is that which relates to the existence of the appellants alleged right of property in his lectures the author of a lectureon moral philosophyor of any other original composition retains a right of property in his vork which entitles him to prevent its publication by others until it has with his consent been communicated tothepublic since the case of  jeffreys v boosey   r l ca  was decided by this house in the year i it must be taken as settled law that upon suchecom munication being made to the public whether orally or by the circulation of written or printed copies of the work the authors right of property ceases to exist copyright which is the exclusive privilege of multiplyinf copies after publication is the creature of statnte and with that right we have nothing to do in the present case the only question which we have to decide is whether the oral delivery of the appellants lectures to the students attend in his class is n law equivalent to communication to the public the authors rizht of property in his unpub lished work being undoubted it has also been settled that he may communicate it to others under such limitations as srill not interfere with the continuance of the right he has as was said by lord brougham in jeffreys v boosey   h l ca   the undisputed righb to his manuscript he may withhold or he may communicate it and communicating he maay limit the number of persons to whom it is imparted and impose such restrictions as he pleases upon their use of it the fulfilmeut of the annexed conhitions he may proceed to enforce and for their breach he may claim compensation he cannot print and sell without publishing his work but he may legitimately im pose restrictions which will prevent its publication whether the communication be made by giving copies for �rivate perusal or by recitation before a select audience in the ltter case the retention of the authors right de pends upon its being either matter of contract or an im plied condition that the audience are admitted for the purpose of receiving instruction or amusement and not in order that they mav take a full note of what they hear and publish it for tlneir own profit and for the information of the public at large upon that principle it was decided in  richardson v lacklim   ambl  that the fact of a pay having been acted for several years in a public theatre with permission of the author did not imply an abandonment of his right and that he was therefore entitled to restrain its publication from notes taken by a shorthand writer who had paid for admission to the theatre on the other hand i do not doubt thatalecturer who addresses himself to the public generally without dis tinction of persons or selection or restriction of his hearers has as the lord president observes in this case  aban doned his ideas and words for the use of the ublic at large or in other words has himself publisheguthem the main asgument addressed to your lordships for the respondentwas to the effect that a professorship in n scotch utniversity beinz muniw piblicumi and the occupant of the offlice beinz under an obligation to receive into his class all eomers having the requisite qualification his lectures are really addressed to the public and at all events that there  is no room for inferring that the students are taught under an implied condition that they shall not print and publish his lectures either for their own profit or otherwise i do not think it can be disputed thatas stated by lord shand this is the first occasion in the history of the scottish uni versities on which any such right as that now claimed has bcen asserted if the claim be well founded there can be no copyright in a lecture which has been once delivered in the classroom yet it is the fact that professors and their representatives have been in frequent use to publish lec tures which had been anuually delivered for years before such publication and have enjoyed without objection or challenge the privilege bf copyright tbat has been notably the case with our great academical teachers of moral and mental philosophy from dr thomas beid who was appointed to the chazir now held by the appellant in i to the late sir william hamilton i concede that although such may have been theprevalent understanding in scotland as to the orofessors night this is not a case in which it can be said that coswnins error facit jus  but i agree with lord shands observation that in these cir cumstances effect ought ntot to be given to the respond ents arcumnt unless he can make it clearlin principle or authority that the law gives him the right he claims as to the position of students attending the appel lants class it is suflicient to say here that they must be members by matriculation of the university and they must also be enrolled as members of his class for thesession upon payment of the prescribed fee a member of the public as such has no right to be present at his lec tures and the public has no right to infrfefe with orcon trol his teaching the leading if not the only case havinz a cose analogy to the present i  abernethy v hntchinson decided by lord eldon in the year  in which a perpetual injunction was granted on the ground that all persons who attended lectures of this kind were under an implied contract not to publish wbat they heard although they might take it down for their own in scruction and use in my opinion the reasoning upon which lord eidons fudgmeint is based applies strictly to the case of a professor in a scotch university the prin ciple which pervades the whole of that reasoning is that where the persous present at a lecture are not the general public but a limited class of the public selected and ad mitted for the sole and special purpose of receiving indi vidnal instruction they mav make any use they can of the lecture to the extert of taking it down in shorthand for their own information and improvement but cannot pub fish it if that be the real character of the relation be tween tlte iecturer and those whom he addresses it is im material whether they are selected by himself or by others fo lonz as it is matter of express stipulation or of reason able imrplication that the duty which he undertakes is linited to giving personal instruction to the individuals composin his audience some of the learnedjudges in the coa below seem to have been of opinion that the present case cannot be brought within the principle of  abernethy v ruchinson  because there is nothing in the nature of a contract between the professor and his students and therefore there can be no implied contract that thy abiil not publish that may be so but what lord eldon leld waa that the restriction of the hearers right to use the lectrres arose from the relation established by controct betveen them and mr abernethy in that case the restriction irecessarily became an implied term of thc contract  but the condition itself is the leal conse qucuce of the relation in which the parties stana to eacb other and must receive effectwherever a similarrelation existsrhether it be stablished by contract or in any other way  e no thnk hat tudnts f mraluhiosooliin the university oft glasgow or in any other scotch university either are or can with pro riety be raid to represent the general public  of course they are each and alr of them nmembers of the publiobuthey do not attend tho professor lecliurca in that capacity they must be members of the undivqersity and they must further comuply with its reg lationsand make payment to the professor of the usual tee in reten for which they receive frorn him a ticket or certilcate of their enrolment as students for the session  andwithcit observing all these preliminaries they would have non ight to enter hisclassroom during the lecture hour the relation of the professor to his students is simply that ot teacher and pupil  his duty is not to address the public at large but toinstruct his students  and their right is to profit by his instruction but not to report or publishhis lectures it appears to me that the learned judges whose opinions are adverse to the appellant have attributed undue weight to the circum stance that the appellants office is maunus publicum that it is so is an undoubted fact  but according to my appre hension the question which your lordshlips have to decide depends not upon that fact but upon tho duty which the appellants office requires him to fulfil the nature of the duty incumbent upjn a professor in an english university is thus described by lord eldon in  abernethy v hutchinson  now if a professor be appointed he is appointed for the purnose of giving in formation to all his students who attend him and it is his dut to do that but i have never yret heard that any body could publish his lectures so far as i know there is no difference whatever between the position of a scotch and that of an english university professor so far as regards their relations to the students whom they teach  and no point of difference has been suggested either in the court below or by the respoondents counsel the fact of his being a public official lays the appellant tinder an obligation to the state as well as to those who pay for their instrtiction to teach cfciently and to thebest of his abilities it does not affect the nature of hlis obligation and cannot alter the relation betveen him and his students that lord eldon held the lectures of a university professor to be within the rule laid down and given effect to by himn in  abernethy v utchinson  is beyond question because he cxpressly refers to the case of such a professor as an illustration of the legal principles upon wshich he gave judgmnent for r abernetby in regard to the act sand  will iv c  i adopt the opinion of the great majority of the learned judges which is in accordance with the view taken by mr justice kay in the recent case of  nicols v pitnman   ch div  the effect of the statute is to secure their right of property to authors of lectures and to persons to whom the right has been sold or conveyed notwithstanding of deliveryupon their compliance with certain preliminaries and their right is protected from invasion byforfeitures and penalties its provisions are not confined to cases in which the right would have been protected at common law but extend to many cases in which according to that law delivery vound have been equivalent to publica tion but by section  lectures delivered in a university or a public schoolor on any public foundationare excepted from the operation of the act and it is declared  that the law relating thereto shall remain the same as if this act had not been passed i cannot gather from the terms of that exceptionand declarationany indication of an intention on the part of the legislature to express their understanding of t e existing law with respdect to lectures in these institutions there may be lectures delivered within the walls of such institutions which do by their delivery become public property just as there may be others which do not whether they belong to one or other of these classes is a question which must be decided irrespective of the provisions of the statute i am accordingly of opinion that the appellant is entitled to have the judgrment of the second division in so far aa adverse to him reversed and to have the inter locutor of the sheriffsubstitute restored should your lordships come to the samo conclusion as myself in tis case i have to suggest that theproper course to follow in disposinz of the appeal will be to reverse the interlocutor appealed from wnth the exception of the first three findings  and in respect of these findings and also in respect that it was admitted by the parties at the bar and that the appeal was heard on the footing thataccording to the opinion of a majorityofthe consulted judges the works comaplained of are in substance a repro duction of the appellants lectures by the appellant to his students as part of his ordinary course the delivery of which was not equivalent to publication thereoft and that theappellant is entitled notwithstanding ouch deliveryto restrain all other persons from publishing the said lectures without his consent and subject to that declarntion to remit the case to the second division of the court of sessiouwith directions to affirm the interlocutor of the sheriffsubstitute dated february   and to find the appellant entitled to the expenses of process incurred by him in the court of session and further ordain the re spondent to pay to the appellant his
