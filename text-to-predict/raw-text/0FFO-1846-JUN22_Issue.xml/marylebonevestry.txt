there and as the writer did not object to his name being mentioned to any individual member of the vestry he mur daniel had the pleasure of being made acquainted with it the ientiments expreased in that letter were strictly in ac cordance with his own and about  months ago he intro duced the subject to the board of guardians but found that nothing could be accomplished from the littlo power the board had in dealing with the rates it was then thought however that if a sufficibt fusnd could be raised by private raeans they should be onabled to form a graud nucleus for the relief of those respectable persons who had been reduced by misfortune to the condition of paupers he had wit nessed in common no doubt with many others the degrada tion to which the higher class of inmates of workhouses had been exposed by being compelled to associate with characters whose habits conversation and manners wore to tally different from anything which they had ever experienced in the former part of their lifetime before a xeverse of for tune had compelled them to accept the shelter of the work house the disgusting scenes and vulgarities observable everywhere around them iwere painful and sickening to such a class of persons as this and tended greatly to enhance the misery of their last days hlear bear ohe felt certain that the liberal proposal just submitted to themwvould be cordlially responded to by the parishioners of every denomination and wvith that coaviction he begged to move the following reso lution that the generous eroposal now mad to this berd be accepted and that a committee coneisting of five members of the vestry and five of the board ot directors and guardians be eppointed with the view of carrying out the suggestions of the donor in a manner most conducive to the interests of taie poor of the districtnr ridgway seconded the motion expressed his entire concurrence in the proposal and intimated his wiuingness to support it by a subscriptionmr goqm and mr sodenx were satisfied that the requi site amount would be speedily raised in the parish and that the handsome donation promised by the benevolent gentle man whose communication had been read to the vestry would be more than doubled in a very short timemr williacas approved highly of the object and would pot his name down for  guineas towards the fund hearthe rev cerairs an said he had lately received  from the executors of a person who died some months ago and left that amount to be placed at his the rectors disposal he should feel great pleasure in handing over this sum for the purposes of the fund and would join mr williams in contributing  guineas to the same object hlear hearthe motion for the appointment of the committee was then carried unanimouslyvote of tansars to sir r peelmr josep then rose to submit the resolutions of which he gave notice last wveek expressive of public gratitude to sir r peel for his freetrade measures he said it had been urged by one or two memben of the vestry that they were exceeding their province in dealing with a subject of this nature but his answer to the objection was that he was only following up a conrs which they had already com menced in voting an addrest to her najesty and then a petition to the houses of iarliament for a repeal of the corn laws hear hear ix would be remembered that on those occasions the resolutioni received the unanimous sanc tion of a very full board eadi surely if theywere sincere in their prayer for that change i the commercial policy of the nations which had been since lwought about they would not could not hesitate to offer their gratitude to the man by whose individual energy it had been effected cheers re membering the cordial unanimity of the vestry of whom more than  members were present when those resolutions were passed in december laston that very day when the times newspaper to the surprise and joy of the whole world sketched out the intended measures of the minister six weeks before they were propounded in a prophecy which had been since verified to thu very letter hear hdarre membering thec feeling then displayed at that board he repeat ed that he had a right to expect for his resolutions now a re ception equauy enthusiastic cheers of the success of the ministerial measures very little doubt had been entertained up to last week when something more formidable was threat ened by means of a coalition the most disgraceful ever re corded in history the object of which was to unseat the mi nistry of this coalition between lord george bentincks party and lord john russellsboth of whom supported the coercion bill on its original introductionhe would nct suffer himself to speak whether it should prove successful or otherwise it would not alter the position of the pre mier in the estimation of the people who felt that he had been working night after night in the midst of an oposition unprecedented in virulence for the interests of the country the protectionists had complained of sir r peeltfor not appealing to the country and giving them an opportunity of making the best of the chandos clause and defeating his purpose by the exercise of their control in the connties but even if that course had been adopted the returns from the towns would havo been suffi clout to counteract those exertions the fact was that peel was the only man in the kingdom who could pass these mea sures hear hear if they had been left to the whigs was there a man present in his senses who thought they would have ever passed cheers mr joseph concluded some further remarks by observing that if as he had been told the friends of the whig party intended to submit an amendment he should be very glad to hear it discussed his resolutions were as follow that this bord the representatives of nearly  rated inhabit ants hereby tenders its grateful thanks to the right hon sir robert peel first lord oftho treasury for the untirnag zeal abiliwy and in dustry

large that mainisters cver originated or the legislature ever passed ioud applausemr pottea seconded the motion in a speech of great length in which he contended that the subject before the vestry was not extraparochial but was one which every im portant representative body in the kingdomwas bound to consider he met the complaint that the ministerial mea sures had not been left to the whigs by recalling to mind the expression of the whig premier when in office that whoever contemplated a free trade in corn was a fit object for a lunatic asylum lord john russell proposed subse quently to fix a tax upon the bread of the people in the shapo of an s fixed duty this was the great est boon the whigs ever offered but now they found a protectionist peer imploring the upper house to grant a s duty or failing in that a s duty laughter the fact was that he had very little respect for any party combi nations for party fights were mere struggles for place power and pensions hear hear he looked therefore to the ministerial measure and not the minister although sir robert peel was entitled to the blessings of the nation for breaking up a set of combinations which had been its primary curse

abandoned his design on hearing that we were  gentlemen and statesmen and asking what they thought of this polished race after the recent exhibi tions in parliament where the proprietors of horsejockeys and gaminghouses had doen indulging in language discre ditabloe o a coalheaver c mr potter attributed all the cha grin of the protectionists to their disappointment in finding sir r peel unwilling to play the part of their tool and con eluded by quoting the observation of the bishop of oxford  that the country gentlemen loved to get their serfs toge ther to drink their healths in empty jugs whilst the clergy preferred visiting them at home and making themselves per sonally acquainted with their wautss rebuke which thenation must have rejoiced to hear coming from such a high quarter at such a time fheav hearlmir wirsoic in submitting an amendmnent to the vestry assigned as his reason for so doing that the resolutions pro posed made the matter exclusively a personal one he did not generaly speaking approve of the introduction of ques tions at that hoard calculated to disturb their usual amity and unanimity of feeling but as it had been brought forward he felt bound to deal with it if the resoluton conveyed merely the thanks of the vestry for the ministerial measures proposed in accordance with the suggestions contained in her majestys speech he should have given it his cbrdial bupport but he did not like the paragraph which attributed motives and very base motives to those who had oppoeed the premier hear hear it mustbe obvious to every one and it was not honest to disgulse the fact that the parlia ment in  was in every respect a protectionist parliament the electionsturned upon this very point and sir b peel was placed at the head of government as the leader of the protectionist party no wonder then at the feeling displayed by those who were now deprived of their leader and athough h could not xcuse the violent abuse and vitupera tion heaped niightly upon the minister by that party he was bound in honesty to admit that they had received gtreaft dpro vocation the premier was bound to have said thtt fig himself unable to continue the old policyto which he and hisparty were pledd ho cold no longer lead a protectionist government re did not subscribe to the creed that there was a laxit allowable in public life which could not be per mitted in private
