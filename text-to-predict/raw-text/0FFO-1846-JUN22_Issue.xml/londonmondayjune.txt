london honday juxe x the last accounts from new zealand announce the complete success of our operations against the rebel chiefs the skill and discipline of a civilized force have produced their natural effect upon the tumul tuous gathering of a crowd of savages hexithe prin cipal and hitherto the most resolute of the insurgents has been compelled to surrender up his lands am munition arms and all his power as the price of personal safety he promises to retire into a remote part of the country and never again to molest the british settler kowiti also the other leader of the rebels after losing through his own negligence the cpah or fortificd village in which he had in trenched himself with considerable skill is reported to have been taken prisoner thus the war if by such a name these protracted but inactivehostilities may be dignified is at length concluded and peace restored wvhere but for our own default it had never been disturbedthe pulicy by which this happy result has been obtained is nothing less than a simple attitude of resolution and the display of a sufficient force to compel submission in case of necessity when captain gtey arrived at the bay of islands he found a negotiation pending be tween his predecessor in the government and the hostile natives which he lost no time in bringing to a conclusion finding that the rebels had no sin cere desire for peace and were only pretending to treat with a view of gaining time for more effectual preparations of war he demanded an immediate an swer to captain frrznoys proposals not reeiving this he forthwith broke off the negotiation and commenced hostilities at this juncture the two chiefs herr and kowrm were occupying each a wellfortified position at a distance of  miles one from the other and almost unapproachable by ar tilery by the th of december the governor had concentrated his forces amounting to about  men of all sorts soldiers and sailors supported by four ships of war on the st of january he had established himself in a stockade about  yards from kowitis  pab whence an unsuccess ful sortie was made on the following day an in terval of a week folowed during which the batte ries were completed and on the th a general fire was opened on the  pab three breaches having thus been effected an assault was planned but abandoned at the instigation of our native allies who seem to have anticipated wlhat was to come for on the next day which was sunday kowitis forces being employed in celebrating their religious rites outside the  pah the british forces signalled by the native scouts marched quietly in side and took possession without shedding a drop of blood they were not however allowed to retain possession so quietly an attempt was immediately made by the natives to regain their position but in vain in this conflict  were killed and  wounded on our side and  kiued on that of the enemy who then retired no further attempt at resistance seems to have been made by either of the rebel chiefs and the result is as already explainedthe only remaining inteligence is that a procla mation has been issued by the governor granting a free pardon to au concerned in the rebeliona measure of pradent moderation which cannot be too highly praised no one can desire the punishment of these ignorant savages for the mere sake of ven geance their offence may deserve it but ihe offenders cau for pity rather than revenge the right of civilized man to judge the savage by the code of civilization although it has been very generally as sumed admits of serious question indeed the whole relation of the colonist to the aboriginal inhabitant whom he finds in constructive if not in actual pos session of the soil has not been considered with that attention which the subject merits undoubt edly the settlers when they have once obtained a valid title to any particular tract of land may esta blish what laws they please within their own limits and by those laws may justly punish the savage who offends within those limits but in other parts with out the tract the case is different if the colonist wil go among the aborigines natural justice seems to demand that he should conform to their laws not introdace his own it will probably be said that with respect to new zealand the whole country be came subject to the british crown by the treaty of waitangi and consequently all the natives became subject to british law this if true is certainly a good legal answer to the objection against judging the aborigines by the british penal code but wecinnot think it is any answer to the equity of the case in point of fact the new zealanders are savages and do not understand our laws their morality is not our morality their religion is not our religion even their ideas of good and evil are quite opposed to ours how then can it be just to make them conform to our standard and to punish them because they fall short of it instruction and persuasion are better than coercion by the latter we may exterminate but we shall never gain good subjects by the former we may both multiply numbers and improve them to our own advantage the savage demands our pity anad our help if he offeads he is to be forgiven and when he sues for pardon let it be as in this in stance by captain grey most freely accordedand there is no fear of these principles of modera tion and humanity being carried by captain grey beyonl the bounds of prudence or to the detriment of the state his sentiments with reference to the rebel chiefs whilst they remained in a position of hostility are sufficiently declared in his despatches to the colonialoffice in one of these we find the following passage which deserves to be read for its plain common sense  in the first place i object altogether to entering into any now treaty with rebels more especialy into one which places them somewhat in the position of sovereign princes and requires them to treat for and to bind others whom theyhave no authority or right wvhatever to control such a pro ceeding on the part of the government gives to those twochiefs an importance and influence vhich they did not pre viously possess and which it should be our object neither torecognize nor to confer upon them if it is thought desir able not to punish them they should i submit receive a conditional pardon and they should not be treated with the pardon should also only extend to the individual for there are murderers and other criminals amongst the rebels who ought to be tried and punished whenever they are caught without any reference to the lapse of time and we cannot too carefully guard against in any way creating the belief that the indfuence of either heki or kowiti led to the conclusion of a treaty and geaeral peace in which all ivere included however guiltyholding these opinions and adhering to them in practice the present governor of new zealand will we doubt not soon restore the colony to perfect tranquillity he wil then be able to turn his undi vided attention to matters of domestic policy in which should he display the same sound judgment and desire of conciliation there is good reason to hope he will meet with the same success
