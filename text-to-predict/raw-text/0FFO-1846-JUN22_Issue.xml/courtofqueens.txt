court of queens bench wbstxinsten jube barrett v oliverpoittrrniud sitin iniazco this was an action of seduction brought by the mother of a lady about  years of ago against the defendant who was about  years old it appeared upon the facts that no greater degree of seduction had taken place than what con sisted in the defendants merely requesting the lady to comply with his desires and that the old gentleman some times went to the chamber of the lady who sometimes on the other hand went to his the lady after some time was delivered of a child which she attributed to the defendant against whom the action was brought by the mother upon the ground of the alleged loss of her daughters service during the period of pregnancy and subsequent illness the lady seduced besides being  years old wvas the teacher of a school for young ladies and it appeared not very clear at the trial whether the daughter was the servant of the mother or the mother the servant of the daughter the jury however at the trial found a verdict for the plaintiffa rule was afterwards obtained calling upon the plaintiff to show cause why the verdict should not be set aside and a new trial granted upon the ground that the learned judge had rnisdirected the jury in telling them that there was such evidence of the service habitually rendered by the young womain to her mother as afforded a ground for bring ing the actionimr m stn nou slhewed cause against the rulemdr crowder appeared to support is and contended that there could not be any loss of service to the mother iu the facts of the case and the rule ought therefore to be made absolutelord denman said that it was true that the loss of ser vice was the gist of this action and that some proof ought therefore always to be given of the previous service of the child and ofthe loss of that service as a consequenco of the se duction very slight evidence of such service was however sufficienttosustainisuch an aotion an agedparent attendedby her chld hada right to herservicesand kind attentions even wheso no wages were paid where any control existed to any extentupon the part of the parent over the child the ex istence of such control was sufficient to support an allegetion of sorvice and when once any service however minute was established it seemed to be a matter of course that the loss of it should inevitably result from the seduction and the illness of pregnancy which were the consequences of the seduction itself if the parent bad a constant oppor tunity of availing herself of the service of the child that would be sufficient without any evidencelof specific instances of servico which it may be difficult to prove even where there was a continual exhibition of a disposition to serve with regard to the case before the court there appeared to be something of the nature of seduction in the conduct of the defendant whose behaviour was very reprehensible in other respects it was verv desirable upon the whole that the doctrine which had so long prevailed upon the suliject should not be interfered with the law laid hold of the smallest pretence of service for the purpose of giving compensation for an injury which did not of itself legally entitle the parent to compensation although it was practi cally a source of the most grievous distress the inevitable consequence of seduction was that the child was altogether disparaged and deteriorated and that the parent must suffer a proportionate injury both in interest and feelings for these reasons his lordship was of opinion that the rule ought to be dischargedmr justice patrtson and mr justice wightman con curred in the judgment of lord denman and tho rule was therefore dischargedday v edwardsthe defendant in this case is a pawnbroker with whom a person called bassett had deposited a cruetstand containing four small bottles empty bassett afterwards disposed of the duplicate to day a publican who released the aticlc after which it was placed on a table in days house where one of his young children who is the present plaintiff took the bottle and attempted to swallow some fluid which it con tained and which turned out to ho nitric acid the child being much injured by the fluid the present action evasorougnt in the name of the child to recover compensation for the injury which reselted from the liquor and the ground upon vwhich the defendants liability was placed was that the liquor had been put into the bottlo by the pawnbroker or his people and that he was guilty of negligence in knowy ingly putting such deleterious liquor into the bottle and not communicating to the person who carried away the cruet stand that one of the bottles contained the deleterious article in question the case having come on to trial the jury found a verdict for tho dlaintiff a rule was afterward ahtiior a new trial upon tie ground that tho verdict was against the evidence as no sufficient proof had been given that the defendant was aware of the nature of the fluid it was also contended that the judgment ought to bearrested upon the ground that upon the face of the declaration there did not appear to be any such direct and immediate relation between the plaintiff and defendant as to make the defend ant liable to the plaintiff for the injury and that tho injury in itself as it was stated in the declaration was too remote in its nature to be the subject of any action for damagesmr miller with whom was mr petersdorff showed cause against the rule mr humphrey and mr lush ap peared to supportitat the conclusion of mr millers
