the jullundur doabfrom the delhi gazette april from juuundur we learn that a party of the st light cavalry arrived there on the th inst escorting tho gooroo and his kamdar from dukkuniserai as prisoners along yith four guns rom three to seven or eight pounders ap parently a mortar and a quantity of smau arms which were seized on the th under mlajor bradford of the st light cavalry on information that they were going off to the gooroo at oona the prisoner is only deputy high priest of the naenuck sect they were taken completely by surprise at  oclock at night three of the guns were found on hackeries coveredup with atta just outside the gate of the serai where they had stopped on hearing the ap ptoach of the troops the others after searching were discovered buried in a room of the serai  or  zum boers were also taken and a large quantity of ammuni tion besides the swords and matchlocks of the garri son of dukkuniserai which consists of about  men horse and foot it is possible they wil be replaced by a wing or at least two companies from a regi nent at jullundur who would by all accounts be no losers by the exchange in point of accommodation the broken bridges on both sides of the serai might it is thught by some be an objection to keeping so small a party as the one mentioned at that place at least in the rains tho oona or oonee above noted is it is supposed the place on which ajeet singh exrajah of ludwan who has returned from seealkote towards our frontiers has fixed as a recruit ing dept for the  army of the beeas considerable sur prise is manifested

food for powder we trust they will yet be better provided for and that the necessary orders vill not be needlessly delayedthe following letter from jullundur gives additional par ticulars of the discovery of arms c at dukkuniserai and proves an evident intention on the part of our neighbours or at least some of them not to let well alone jullundur april our worthy general left us for nakodah where the est cavalry and th irregulars are stationed for the purpose of finally determining the spot for cantonments i can easily suppose his visit was scarcely a wvelcome one as i understand that the officers had all commenced building before the ground was settled on the general however fixed on the spotfirstpointed outbythe committee and byso doing theofli cerswillbeablo toget

their furlough and on sueh an extensive scale as at present and all euro pean officers refused furlouch or leave on private affairs  it is well to indulge the native soldier aftor such trials and hardships but i consider making such distinctions very apt to engender bad feelings this morning a troop of the est cavalry marched into camp bringing three prisoners from dukkuuiserai accompanied by  guns  camel pieces jezails swords and matchlocks from what i learn the st cavalry and th irregulars received intelligence that there was a number of guns concealed at dukkuni serai and that it was the intention of the gooroo priest to move them no time was to be lost and a party went off under major bradford they had no sooner reached the fort than marks of hackeries were visible as having come dut and suddenly returned on obtaining entrance some hackeries wero found close to the gate laden with bhoosah and the bullocks yoked one of the officers thrusting his ssvord through the grain struck something hard on turn ing oyer the bhoosah a beautiful pounder brass gun came to view further search was made and four others were found buried underground also an immense quantity of shot shell and ammunition of all sorts it was considered ne cessary to disarm this party of sikhs which was done and the gooroo kamdar and vakeel were marched off to nakodah it was only a few days ago that a guard of irre gulars was removed from the fort at the request of the wily old priest he ought to be weu punished as an example thank god our daks are better managed and tho delivery of letters more correct which is a great comfort to us so journing in this outoftheway part of the world the weather still remains cool at any rate we have col morn ings and evenings and no use for punkas that is one com

from jullundur confirm the announce ment that the killedar of kangra continued dstermined in his refusal to give up his important charge  nd we learn that brigadier wheeler is likely to proceed himself at the head of two regiments with artillery from loodiana to undertake the reduction of the place the th regi ment native infantry wvhich had been ordered to take possession of the fort vere brought to a standstill at dowlutpoora about three miles from kangra they had found the direct road to the fortress impracticable for camels and had been obliged to return and proceed up an other route to the right about  miles further round uwhere the road lay along dry stony beds of rivers across valleys with occasional ascents and descents of a few hun dred yards very bad in most places for camels but not impracticable until the last march to dowlutpoora by this route which is reported impassable in the rains the distance between rangra and jullundur is said to be eight maarches

was deputed to send his purwannah to the com mandant desiring him to surrender the fort to the british the messenger had his face blackened and was kicked out of the place his purwannah being at the same time torn to pieces the aharajahs purwvannah to the same purport was then forwarded but this shared a simi lar fate and a verbal answer was sent that the com mandant despised runjoor singh as a dog held the miaharajah in contempt and deficd the british the moonshee of captain cunningham was then directed to endeavour to obtain a written reply but the com mandant was obstinate and refused to give one as he said  golee lbaroot vrould be his answer as soon as the bri tish made their appearance on the pass adding that until maharajah runjeet singh came himself to demand an entrance he would not open the gates an hour or so after the moonshees retturn captain cunningham wvent up with a havildars party to reconnoitre when the guns of the fort opened on them and they were obliged to return a similar party went up on the morning of the st and were also compelled to retire thorebels as we suppose they must be called though ve cannot help admiring the spirit which animates the holder of tho strongest fort in the country considered impregnable by arms to refuse the inglorious surrender by treaty of the honourable charge committed to his caro have plundered the neighbourhood of the fort to a great extent and were commencing upon the town wvhich captain cunningham caued upon the officer in command of the th to protect tke general belief is that the garrison does not amount to more than  men though it was knowvn that the killadar was daily increasing it the number of guns is said to be  but surely this must be amistalke andthe fort is reported to be provided with ammunition

advices same into jullundur to detach a party to hold fort m ulkra near the town tmporarily in tho possession of sirdar runjoor singhs men it his but one gun and will hold about  men this is rather an awkward state of affairs which cannot have been anticipated by the authoritica whon they ordered ono regiment up to take possessionit may in connexion with the display of disloyalty at dukkuniserai so opportunely damped by the military au thorities help to keep alive the feeling of discontent and dis like on tho part of the sikhs and lead to the renewal of hos tilities we certainly look with anxiety for further particus lars and we shall doubtless know by our next issue what is the exact amount of tho force to be employed on this unex pected service we understand thatthe commissioner mr john lawrence will accompany brigadier wheeler it is pretty clear and a favourable circumstance that the country people about kangra are not aiding the garrison in their pro ceedingsthe detachment which wo mentioned as under prepara tion for the reduction of kangra is to consist of the d grenadiers and the th regiment of native infantry from jullundur the th irregular cavalry from looshea pore and a considerable number of pieces of artillery chiefly mortars from loodiana or rather phulloor to be commanded by brigadier wheeler the order for the march appeared on the d of april and the d grenadiera started on the th the impression at jullundur was that there wouldnot be nmuch resistance after the first shot although the garrison are understood to consist chiefly of akalees and the authori ties seemed to entertain one approaching to it as they have provisioned the detachment to a very small extent major iayne commandant of the th irregular cavalry had reached jullundur without a single desertion in his corps and was to proceed on the th of april to mohee rian about  miles beyond hoosheeapoor and close on the bank of the beeas we understand his corps has elicited admiration
