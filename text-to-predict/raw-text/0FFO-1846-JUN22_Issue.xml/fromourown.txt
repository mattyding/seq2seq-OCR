malcontents hadie ceived a check and i other quarters the officers of the sikh government seem to be akwakening from thc stupor which late events had thrown them into and acting with isomething like their aneient vigour it is devoutly to to wished that those in authority should be obeyed and anarchy put down tho ptrcsece of the british troops ani authority of the governorgeuerals agent may have the happy effect of checking the tyranny and oppression of the sikh officials in the immediate neighbourhood of tfie capital and possibly even exert some influence ata greater distance but if the governorgenerals plan be adopted our troops and all the beneficial influences will be withdraln just as they may have begn to exert some power over the minds of the governors and the governed for their own mutual advantage and be the signal for the commencement of horrors worse than have yet beon enacted in lahoro while the reck lessness with which thoso who have now the upper handwill yield to the impulses of the evil passions which seem to have paramount power over them will leave innumerablo injuries to be revenged iyhen british interferencea shall bo withdrawn the lajxal and hia party are those for whose sakes we have refrained from anaexing the country to the british empire it will be a cruel mockery if at the ex piration of the period during which it is expected that they vill have created a strong government the yowung rajah should implore tho further aid of the british go vernment on the plea of having failed to form a government capablo of curbing the robellious and efficiently carrying on the affairs of tho stateit would i say in such a case be mockery to leave the unfortunate child and his imbecile counsellora to their fatothe latest accounts frqm lahoro come down to the th of april aud they state that the ranees life had been despaired of and that at the above date she was not out of danger letters of late date mention that the silkh sirdars openly declare that they are only waiting the rie of the rivers to cut off the communication and the commencement of the iaress which they expect will attack our troops at lbat season to rise themselves against our isolated force and destroy it before sec cour can come from ouv provinces it is very pos sible that this threat may bo put into execution but if general littler be permitted to make tho

french officers and most effleient artillery and every appliance necessary for its reduction as the garrison can have little or no influence outsido the walls of their fortress it might be quite

magnified into something much more serious than it actually was we deem it right to put our readers and contemporaries at once in possession of the real facts on the day in questisn a european horse artilleryman being on sentry at one of the gates attempted to stop a drove of cattle cows c from entering and in to doing he cut two of the cows with his sword about the nose and head to the extent of drawing blood the fact no sooner became known in the neighbourhood of the gate than the bunneahs in the adjoining streets closed their shops but on major brind going up to explain the matter apd point out to them that it was purely accidental and that the man had no intention to cut the animals but merely to drive them off they seemed satisfiedand reopenedtheirshops in the mealstime however the account had spread through other parts of the town the shops vere again closed and the bunneabs assembled in numbers on the roofs of their houses major brind having gone to the agent to the go vernorgeneral to explain the circumstance major law rence proceeded at once to endeavour to allay the popular excitement accompanied by major mgregor and lieu tenant h edwardes on their way through the streets they were assailed by the infuriated bunneahs from the roofs of their houses wvith brickbats and other missiles mr edwardes was so severely hurt as to be obliged to return having been struck on the head by a stone wvhich cut open his forehead notwithstanding his hat was protected by a thickturban it is however wearehappytosay nota dan gerous wound majors lawrence and mgrcegor were also both hit the latter on the arn but not injured a sepoy orderly from the th native infantry who was returning at the timc to brigadier eckfords quarters in nonehal singhs house was cut down and severely wounded several tervants syces c in attendance on the officers also ex hibited bloody turbans the troops were immediately under orders the gates closed and the guards on the alert and investigations into the matter were forthwith instituted the ageni to the governorgeneral exhibited the i utmost coolness in the midst of the tumult especially in pre  venting the suwvars in attendance on him from entering the houses whence the bricks were thrown and succeeded in al laying the ferment before night the shops were again open and the brawlers being made over to the british authorities for punishment rajah lall singb attended by sirdar tej single and others waited on major lawrence to ex press his regret at the untoward occurrence it is satis factory to know that no sikhs vere concerned in it and it ws in fact only such an tcuete as might have arisen even in these days as has been the case at benares almorab or any other town in the provinces the following is the native account of the affair the cows that were wounded yestarday belonged to a goojur who persisted in driving them through the gate afier he had been warned not to do so some two or three brah mnins who were passing tore off their turbans and ran into the bazaar crying out that the british had killed the cows it is not to be wondered that the people should have shut up their shops when the bunneahs were throwing stones some of the brahmins drew their swords and at the time that edwardes sahib was struck by a brick they attacked tulveo rujjub ali but did him no harm fortunately the number of brabmins seized and taken lefore the dur bar yesterday evening was five and they were sent off to the agent rajah lall singh beld the durbar this day in the sheeshmahal and it was agreed at the consultation held amongst the chiefs that it would be well if maharajah dhuleep singh himself went to the agent to apologize for the disturbance of yesterday his highnafs accordingly went accompanied by rajah lall singh sirdars tej singh chuttqr singh and ittur singb rhaleefa noorooddeen t d others and was honourably received by the agent the mabarajah himself addressed the agent and told him that some of the guilty people had been seizea yesterday and sentto him and more wouldbe delivered today and that  rupees had been given out in propitiatory charities at this time khoda buksh kotwal and fuqueer cheeraghooddeen presented themselve with several prisoners chiefly brahmin and khutrees who they stated were the principals in the disturbanec the rotwal said the number was  men and l woman the agent asked why the woman was brought the kotwal said her husband was implicated but had escaped so he had brought the wife she was immediately released inquiries were made into all the circumstances and in the course of them the durbar people were loud in their praises of the great forbearance of the agent the maharajah returned at a late hour to the palace the durbar was again assembled in the afternoon rhoda buksh rotwal replied that he had pulled down the shop of the hulwaee who had commenced the uproar rbaah lall singh ordered that other houses should share the same fateapriil this day lnerain nath priest of the temple in wichoo wallee vas imprisoned a circumstance which created a great sensation iulvee rujjub ali waited on tajah lall singh and remained long in consultation with him the kotwal then came to report that he found that dutt a brahimin was apparently the most guilty amongst the rioters having been the first to draw his sword and that he wished to know to what extent he was to be punished rajah lall singh ordered that the manshould be hung forthwvith and the agent be acquainted with the sen tence towards the afternoon theman escorted by a de tachinent of cavalry vas taken out of the mtustee gate and hung seven of the prisoners being taken out at the same time to witnes the execution hlany thousand people were present orders were issued to make arrangements for the reception of the agent of the goverrorgeneral who was about to present himself before the sirkarto take leave provious to his departure major lawrence accompanied by mlajors mgregor and edwardes sahib arrived about  oclock and were honourably received by the maharajah the agent told his highness that he was about to proceed in the direction of kangra the major sahib then went into summun boorj to take leave of the ranee who was behind the purdah here dawan deena nath stated to the ranee that the agent was about to leave for kangra whither it had become necessary to send british troops in consequence of the refractory conduct of the garrison the ranee asked why sirkaree troops should not be sent so as to obviate the necessity for the agent going away from lahore the dewan replied for major lawrence that there were many other matters requiring his presence in that part of the country and that he must go rhiluts were then presented to major lawrence and
