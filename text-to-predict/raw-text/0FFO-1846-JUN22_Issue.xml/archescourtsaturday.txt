archebs court saturda june the office of the judge promoted bybarnes v shorebefore sir h j fusttbis is a causa of office promoted by mr barnes the registrar of the dioceee of exeter against the rev james shore of bridgetown in the parish of berry pomeroy in the county of devon citing him to answer to certain articles exhibited against him touching his souls health and the re formation of his manners but more especially for having publicly read prayers preached and admiuistered the holy sacrament of the lords supper in an unconsecrated build ing without any license or authority for so doing and con trary to and in spite of the injunction ormonition ofthe lord bishop of exeter letters of request were presented in the usual way a decree issued and mr shore in the first instance appeared under protest but which was overruled and the court directed him to appear absolutely articles were then brought in and admitted without opposition witnessesavaing been exammned upon them an allegation was as serted on behalf of mr shore and a debate on its admissi bility having taken place the court rejected it when the cause was about to be heard the proceedings of this court were tied up by a rule for a prohibition but that rule waw afterwards discharged and the cause now came on for hearingdr addams with whom was dr irobinson appeared on behalf of the promoter of the suit all the articles he said except the seventh were of a technical and formal natureand their truth was admitted by mr shore that article was to the following effect that on sunday the th of april  and on sunday the th of july  mr shore took upon himself publicly to read prayers preach and on the lastmentioned day to administer the holy sacra ment of the lords supper and perform ecclesiastical duties and divine offices according to the rites and eeremonies of the united church of ltngland and ireland in the uncon secrated chapel at berry pomeroy without any li censo or authority for so doing and cntrary to and in spite of the injunction or monition of the bishop of exeter three witnesses had been examined on that article two of whom were clerks to mr barnes and he sub mitted that their testimony clearly proved that mr shore ministered in the chapels on the days alleged the third witness examined wa the pew opener who declared his in ability to state who preachedl on those occasions he dr addams admitted that there was no proof that mr shore had administered the sacrament on the day charged but one of the witnesses deposed to the table being spread which was a near approach to it the only real question in the caso wvas as to the penalty to bo inflicted on mr shore the articles concluded with a prayer that the rev gentleman might be admaonished not to be guilty of such offences in the future and that he be condemned in the costs of the pro ceedings the court however would remember that in the course of the proceedings mfr fhoro had made an affidavit in which he swore that he had on consientious grounds se ceded from tho church of england and that he was a protestant dissenter in holy orders ho dr addams contended that mr shore was willing to continue a minister of the church of england as long as he could set his bishop at defiance but within a short time after being served with tke ditation mr shore seceded from the church that being so he prayed the court not to admonish th rev gentleman but to pronounce a sentence of deposition he apprehended that his learned friends who were opposed to him would raise no objection to that prayer it would be the most convenient mode of disposing of the entire questiondr robrnson submitted that unless the rev gentle man were deposed thero would be nothing to prevent him taking a donativethe quesis advocate with whom was dr twiss appeared on behalf of mr shore ile submitted that the evidence was insufficient to convict mr shore of the charges brought azainst him it was stated that he had offended against the laws ecclesiastical but it was not stated what particular law or canon he had violated two witaesses naa neon exammed to prove that he had publicly read prayers on the days referred to and that on tho first occasion though not on the last he had preached a sermon neither of those parties however were members of the rev gentlemans congregation who alone were the proper persons to be called to prove the truth ofthe allegation it seemed that in theso days when a charge was brought against a clergyman the whole presumption of lawwas to be reversed every other man was to be presumed innocent until he were found guilty but the moment a clergyman was charged with any delinquency it was said that he must be punished severe y by his bishop he was sure however that in that court justice would edone he contended that reading the prayers was not an offence in a minister of the church of england on the contrary he was bound by a rubric to read them daily either privately or openly the charges against mr shore were au put conjunctively it was admitted that a part was not proved the whole therefore must fall to tho ground he rested that statement upon the common and ordinary proceedings with reference to indictments his learned friend had suggested that the punishment should be increased in consequence of the course which mr skore had pursued the prayer for a monition however had been made after the rev gentleman had avowed himself a seceder from the established church he was quite sure that the meek and mild prelate in whose diocese mr shore had been ministering would be surprised at the sentence which had now been prayed on the vvhole he submitted that mr shore ought to be dismised from the suitdr twess argued that there wfas no proof that there was acongregation present at the time the rev gentleman read the prayers in the chapel as the chapel was not conse crated it was according to thc st canon equivalent to a private house aud consequently hr shore bad committed no ecclesiastical offencedr adda and dr roansaon havingbeen heard in reply the learned judae said that it would be a waste of time to attempt to show that mr shore was the gentleman lwho offiated on the days stated in the libel tho two witnesses examined had had ample oppsrtunities of knowing mr shore he trusted that he ihould be the last person in theworld to debar an accused party a fair opportunity ofmaling his defence but he was surprised to hear the queens ad tocate argue thatthe readingof the prayers on the occasions charged was a compliance with the rubric there was no occasion to specify any particular law which mr shore had violated it was sufficient that the common law of the church had been transgressed it was abundantly clear that mr shore as a minister in holy orders did after the revocation of his license perform divine offices in the chapel of berry pomeroy and the question was whother it wvas an ecclesias tical offence or not it could not be contended that reading the prayers under the circumstances stated was not contrary to the ecclesiastical law of the land and the offence hero was increased by the fact of the buiiding having been taken away from the established church of england what was necessary to constitute a congregation had not been speci fically defined but it was usually considered according to language used in the piyers that when two or three were assembled together it was sufficient to form a congregation the pow opener who had been examined proved that he had put the other witneeses in a seat it was thereforo evi dent there was a congregation on those occasions it never was the intention of the not canon to regard unconsecrated chapelsasprivate houses the term asemployedinthatcanon meant a dwellinghouse it had been said that the charges in this casehaving bcenlumpedtogetherifanyons ofthemfailed the whole faeilto tho ground lhewas of opinion that there was no authority or which such a position could he main tained  on the contrary cases had occurred over and over again in which parties had been convicted of part of the charges brought against them he was satisfied that there was a sufficiency proved against mr shore to render him liable to ecclesiastical punishment the only question was its degree he was not preparod to go beyond the sentence first prayed and to admonish him to refrain from yublicly reading prayers or preaching in an unconsecrated chapel again if mr shore were guilty of a repetition of his former conduct he would not only be amenable to the bishop but he would be liable to be punished for contempt of court he being a mnimster of the church of england he could not of his own authority secede from it he was not a dissent ing minister but a minister in holy orders and from that he could not release himself ho the learned judge pronounced that the articles werp fully proved he admonished r shore from offending in like manner in the future and con demned him in the costs of these proceedings the admo nition was to extend to overy parish in the diocese of exeter or province of canterburyat a subsequent part of the day the proctor for ir shore prayed that the admonition might not go out for  daysthe court granted the uraverking v kingsir h j fust delivered judgment in this case the facts of which have iready been reported in the tirneithe euit was originally instituted

the only question was whether the evidence was sufficiently clear to bring home the charge the evidence which is very voluminous was minutely sifted by the learned judge who observed that whatever
