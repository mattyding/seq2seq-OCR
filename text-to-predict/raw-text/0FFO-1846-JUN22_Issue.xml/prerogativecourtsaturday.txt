argued last termthe deceased was mr john tlhompson who dd upon the th of march  being then of the age of about  years the partywrho was entitled to his property eo far as appeared before the court if he were dead intestate was mrs le baa who was either the niecec or grandniece of the testator the mcullocha who were now parties to the cause were sometimes called nephews sometimes great nephews and sometimes grandne hews but it was im material to the present case the deceased was pos eessed of large property both real and personal the wll propounded in the cause bore date on the th ofblarch  though in fact it was cxecuted on the th the party opposing the will was mr gregor an executor in a former will which bore date on the id of february  he had been admitted a contradicter to the will the court therefore must assume that he was entitled to a probate of the will of february unless it were revoked by one of later date tho oae came before the court under very peculiar circumstances and which undoubtedly placed the court in a considerable degree of embarrassment with respect to the real state and condition of tho parties the peanes originally before the court were mrs le bas and mr gregory who had sincz intermarried the will propounded consisted of three shects of paper unattached to eacih other written in a somewhat extraordinary manner and was said to be attestedby two witnesseswhose names were subscribed in pencil when mrs le bas and mr gregory were ori ginally before the court it was guagested by counsel that ifu uoure snoule de ot opinon that the thrce papers could not be considered as containiagthe wiu of the deceased mrs le bas might be entitled to have probate of the last sheet which revoking all former wills prior to that date mr gre gory would have no tocuw stusndi when mrsa le bas and mr gregory intermarried they had no longer any interest in opposing cach other and the case stood over for a consider able time to gat parties before the court who had an in terest coatrary to that of mr gregory and mrs le bas who had a united interest and against whom a decree might be obtained in the course of the proceedings an appearance was given on behalf of the mcullochs one of whom was a major and the other two niinors the case was by no means relieved of difficulty and the courtwas left to find its way as well as it could three witnesses had beon examined on the plea given two of whom were in the service of the deceased and were the subssribing witnesses to the will and the third was mr gonn the confidential friend and adviser of mr thompson though not of the profession of the law a large number of additional testamentary papers had been brought ir but they only tended to show the vacillat ing mind of the deceased the only important papers were those nosv propoanded and the will of feb ruary if the former were net valid then tbe latter as far as it appeared would be entitled to probate and by it the great bulk of the property would eventuallygo to mr gregory a stranger in blood to the deceased to the exclu sion of his relatives the learned judge then minutely described the three sheets of paper under one of which the mcullochs took the greater part of the property which was divided into eighths the respective shares to eachbeing written in pencil it did not appear to be the intention of the deceased that those three sheets of paper should con tain a final disposition of his property they wero tobe sub mitted to mr gonn and the last sheet was only executed professedly to guard against an event which did occur namely the death of mr hompson between the interval of the execution and the period at which mir gonn was to have drawn up a new will the question was whether those papers were proved to be the will of the de ceased at the time they wero executed by him wvhatever further intentions he might have and whether they wero executed with the formalities required by the act of parliament the learned judge then read the testimony of the subscribing witnesses neitber of whom would positively affirm that the signature of the de ceased was attached to the last sheet at the time they at tested it nor would they swear that it was not there he laid great stress upon a letter which the deceased wrote to mr gonn on the th of march in which ho stated that he had been kept awake by coughing all the preceding night but that mlr gonn wyould be pleased to hear that he h id strained hard to make a new will asd expressing a desire to see him that evening it had been truly stated that the declaration of the deceased could sot be received to supply a deficiency in the testimony of the witnesses but the contem poraneous declaration of the deceased was very important when the witnesses were called in the paper was lying open to their observation and thero was evidence to show that the testator was acquainted with the requisites of the act of parliament it was therefore to be dresurned that he bad complied with it it wvas not necessary that the whole of the three sheets should be attested or that they should be fastened together the whole of the papers were in the handwriting of the deceased and mir gonn swore that they were delivered to him on the evening of the day as con taining the will of the deceased he the learned judge was of opinion after much anxiety doubt and hesitation that the thrce papers were meant by the deceased to operato as his will it was clear that mir gregerywas an old friond of the deceased and that he had great attachment to him he pronounced for the papers and directed the whole of tho costs on beth sides to be paid out of the estatethe proctor for mr gregory immediately protested a grievance and appealclark and others by their guardians twithout the facts of this case beingeutered into the court pronounced for the will and decreed the costs out of the estate
