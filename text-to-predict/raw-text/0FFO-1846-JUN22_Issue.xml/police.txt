rectionlambethon saturday inspector campbell of the p division attended before the hon g c nonrton in compliance with a message sent to him to give an explanation to some disclosures made to the hon ma gistrate late on friday evening relative to the ex traordinary and suspicious death of george james ben well a lad aged  who had been found dead in a muddy pond at tho back of his masters house on the evening of tuesday week last with a b metal weight tied round his neck and both his hands tied together the short facts of the case appeared to be these the deceased had been in the employment ofa person named evans a manuefcturer ot piquaor british tea as errand boy since last april twdlvemonths and on the evening of tuesday week his master and his masters son proceeded to sydenham in a pony chaise for the purpose of purchasing aeme greens and on their returntney xounn written on tue lootdoard of the deceased bed in chalk an intimation that his body was in the pond at the back of the house a board was also found floating on the pond on which was written with chalk  the body ef geore benvell i in this pond the body was fount there and upon being taken out a b wreight was round his neck and both his hands were found tied together an inquest has since been aeld on the body and afterai lengthened inquiry the jury returned a verdict to the effect that the deceased had been tho author of his own death and had committed suicide subsequent to te inquiry w bishop the halfbrother of the deceased had receired se veral communications imputing the death of the deceased to very different causes and one in particular from a woman named thoobald who had lived as servant with evans who states that there was an exceedingly bad feelingbetween the deceased and his master and that this had recently be come considerably increased on the part of the latter on ac count of her theobald communicating to the boy the secret of tho manufacturing in which he evans had been engaged and it waa on the application of mr bishop that mr nor ton required the attendance of mr campbell to givo some explanation of the casehlr campbell said that he had taken much trouble in and was still pursuing tho inquiry into the case which was one of the most suspicious and extraordinary that he recol lected during his lengthened xperience as an officer when before the coroner and jury evans the master of the de ceased who is a most eccntric character and a socialist said that ho did not observe anything more than ordinary in the deceaseds manner when himself and his son left home for sydenham on the evening of tuesaay week yet when ho had proceeded half his journey he said that something struck him that all was not right at hone with george upon this he was asked by a juror why he did not return if such was his feeling and his reply was that he should havo done so but that hb thought that if anyhing happened he should be then too late to prevent it but the angwer to this and other questions from the coroner and jury were con sidered anything but satisfactory to them there were several points in the case which he mr campbell could not reconcile to his belief that tho deceased had committed suicide and even to say the least of them were of a highly auspicious character in the first place the cord by whirlthe metal w eight was suspended on the neck of the youth was so short as to be barely sufficient to tie behind and it was exceedingly doubtful to him wrhether the lad himself would have been enabled to tie it in the manner in which it had been found in the next if even he had so tied it and his hands he had then to get over a wooden paling four feet six inches iu height and such would be the difficulty of getting over such an impediment with a quarter ofahundred tiedto hisneck that he mr campbell should not be ablo to accomilish it much less a boy of  years o age inthe third placoe he mr campbell found ia the boxes of the lad a copybook and other papers which bore the handwriting of the deceased and upon comparing them with the chalk viting on the foot of the deceaseds bed and also the piece of wood found foating on th pond they bore no comparison whatever and in his opinion had never been written by the same hand the jury were of a similar opinion previous to the stepmother of the deceased being called but she sworo point blank thatbothwere inthehandwritingof the deceased and this it was that principally induced the jury to come to the decision they had sinco then the stepmothebrhad been most anxious to get possession of both the writing and the botard bearing the chalk marks  but he mr campbell refusd to let her have them particularl as he had found that evans had been stopping at her house ever since the death of the boyj and some of her neighbours did not hesitate to impute a more thau ordinary intimacy between the par ties there wfas another circumstance which he r campell felt it necessary to mention and that was that en a medical inspection of the body appearances of an ex traordinary description and which he could uot articularlyaludw to wgxo touad lglhi  rkngw tohimri cainpbell and othe tbstht he b

chalk writing on the footboard of the bed and which he did not believo to have been written by thle deceased was in these irords  please sir have thlo ddneas to remember me to my friends george benwell is in the yard at the back of the house andafterthewords please irand mnyfriends there were commas placed his circumetance satisfied him that the writing wvas not by the decmased as he was palpably ignorant of grammae and even if ho had not been he doubted at such a moment when on the point of selfde straction he would have taken tho trouble to write so metho dically and altogether he was very dissatisfied with the inquiry and hoped his worship would not allow it to rest where it stoodmr nortov admitted that the oircumstances of the case were exceedingly suspicious and directed mr campbeu to bring all the parties whlo could throw any light on the in quiry before him ou a future day when heshould enterupon afull investigatton of tho case
