the beethoven quartett societya meeting of this society together with some of the most distiseaished musical amateurs and prefessors of london took place in harleystreet on saturday afternoon on tho invitation of messrs sivorl sainton hill and rousselot the chosen artists of tho beethoven society for the present season to hear aperformance of the grand fugue  tantt libare tautdt recherclhe wyhich forms the th quartett of the paris edi tion beethoven originally intended to makc this produc tion the concluding movement of the th quartett of the same edition in b flat major but was persuaded by his pub lishers messrs artaria of vienna to give it as a separate wvork and write a new flne for the th quartett owing to the great difficulty of its execution or perbaps to some doubt of making it acceptable to the musicians of london the grand fugue has been excluded from the fixed pro grammes of the beethoven society but a desire having been expressed by the president and council that the attempt at least should be made this separate meeting was the result and the original design of beethoven was adhered to by playing au the movements of no  except the last and restoring the grand fugue to its proper situation as the finale as a performance and adverting only to theme chanical difliculties of the fugue nothing could have been moreperfect and considering the numerous claims these gentlemen must have on their time during this busy and sultry season as well as the frequent rehearsals it must have undergone they deserve the highest credit he composi tion itself is of gigantic proportions terrible and at inter vals even repulsive yet overflowing with manifestations of the astonishing power andugenius and originality of beet hoven as in all works howvever of extreme refinement in art much time and frequent hearings wiu be necessary be fore all its beauties can be comprehended we think that the conductors of these meetings are amenable to just re proach for having left so wonderful a work as this out of their course of beethovens quartetts their undertaking de manded and led them to exercise great moral courage in the attempt to lead the public taste into this new world of music and but little more was required to venture on the grand fugue whiclilike the keystone to the arch would have givers to the whole design a beautiful and architectural proportion wse may now hope that itis yet reserved to the musicians of london to retrieve the barbarism of his vienna publishers and present the whole of the quartetts of beethoven the field in which he most loved to let his genius rove unconfined in their full integritythe royal academy of miusicthe students of this institution gave their fourth concert on saturday morning in the lanoversquarerooms which were very fully attended the scheme comprised a great variety of compositions fri the wvorks of the established masters be sides three movements of a ils symphony by xr henry wylde a member of thc academny

about two or three miles to the northeast of the city and conjecture was rife as to its cause some persons supposing it to be some haystacks whilst others and by far the greatest portion including the police authorities from its situation being nearly north of the city and from there being very few houses in the sup posed neighbourlsood whence it emanated concluded that the appearances in the sky were nothing more nor less than the northern lights or aurora borealis mr wnliams engineer of thenorwich union and the engineers of the various othor fireoffices notwithstanding their being laughed at for being about to put out  the northern lights very praiseworthily attached horses to the various engines and proceeded as speedily as possiblo in the direction from which the light proceeded and after proceeding about two miles from the city on the horfieldroad it became apparentto them that instead of its being the aurora borealis the etensivo horse and foot barracks now erecting for bristol in that vicinity were wrapped in flames the appearance as they proceeded through the quiet country was awfully grand he night was untsually dark and one vast sheet of flame rose majestically into the air lighting up the whole of the surrounding country upon arriving at the barracks it was dis covered that the fire had originated in the sawmills which together with the carpenters shops and the vast piles of timber by which tboy were surroaunded were all enveloped in one entire mass of flame of course it was perfectly vain to attompt the preservation of any of this mass of burning timber and the efforts of the firemen and persons present were at once directed to the pre servation of the surrounding quarangle containing the bar rack rooms the loors and woodwork of which were just being laid dwn and to the removal of asmuch of the surrounding timber of which there were vast quantities upon the ground as wvas possible so as to prevent the fire from s reading in these efforts they were happily successfuil and the further progress of the flames wras arrested the fire continued burning during the whole of the night with the utmost fury and it was not until after  oclock this morning that it was at al got under it is of course stiu burning and it wmll be some days before the fire proceeding from such a mrass of burning timber can be thoroughly extinguished of course in the confusion at present existing the extent of the damage cannot be ascertained with any degree of accu racy but i should say the loss of ir baker the contractor must be at least from  to  in addition to which the poor workmon have au lot their toolsa loss to them of the most serious description the causes of this fire lay hid in complete mystery inasmuch as there was no fire upon the premises but i have heard fromn respectable authority that it is supposed to have been the act of an incendiary should this be so i hop eevery means wfill be adopte to lead to his or their detcotionsmeugglirnga
