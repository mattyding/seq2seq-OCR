i npw zeala ndprosi the yew zealander jan we have the greatest pleasure in announcing to our readers that our recent successes have occasioned serious overtures of lpeae from lheke and kawiti on sunday last held and kawiti went to pomares pah at the head of the karetu but that wily chief would not admit them for fear of implicating him self and incurring the censure and punishment of the governor they sent to nene requeating him to meet them in order to convey to the governor their request for peace nene would neither go to them nor suffer them to come to him but deputed his brother william waka to receive their commu nication being convinced that they are really sincere in their desire for a termination of hostilities nene has come to aucklaad in the vic toria with the concurrence of the other friendly chiefs in alliance with him to acquaint his excel lency of the submission of heki and kawiti and to intercede it their behalfthe two rebel chiefs throw themselves wholly on the mercy of his excellency resigning all their lands and leaving it entirely to him to dictate the terms on which peace and order are to be reesta blished in the northern part of the island we un derstand that his excellency does not intend to de prive heki and kawiti of their lands or to make them an appendage to the property of the crown we consider this to be most wise policy and its mo ral effect on the minds of the natives throughout the islands will be great and beneficial as it will prove that the qaeen does not take up arms and carry on wars for the purpose of depriving the natives of their lands and properties but to en force submission to the laws if our loyal allies are anxious that the rebels should be spared further chastisement aad are also well assured that their present submission is sincere and attributable to the efect and proof recently given to them that the queen will not allow insult to her fiag or robbery and outrage to her subjects to pass with impunity then we consider it would be no less consistent with justice than with mercy at once to grant full pardon and obliterate the iastwe learn that nene will return immediately to the bay of islands and that peace will soon be per manently established in that district the blockade will be removed from the northern ports on the st of february and the customs reestablished  troops will

donei directly moved forward with  men to their support and secured the positionthe th and st were principally occupied in bringig up the guns end ammunition through the woods a work of great labour and time as it required between oo and  men to each gun to get them through on account of the heavy trees it was necessary to cut down in making the road and the steepness of the hills they had to pass overseveral rockets and shells have been thrown into the pah on the st and each day sineo with the utmost accuracy doing great credit to the officers of her majestys navy who directed themnamely lieutenant egerton north star in charge of the rockets and lieutenant bland of the racehorse and lieutenant leeds of the hon east india companys service elphinstone who directed the shellson the morning of the ist instant i pushed forward a strong party into the only wood that now divided us from the enemy and taking up a position in the centro of it on an open piece of ground about  yards from the pab a strong stockade was immediately commenced for the pur pose of covering a battery and the work was sufficiently advanced before night to render any attempt of the enemy to drive us away useless this work was carried on under cover of a very thick part of the wood which completely concealed it from the enemyon the afternoon of the following day the enemy made a strong sally from the pah vith a view it is supposed of turning the flank of this advanced party of ours in the stock ade which was not yet finished but they were most gal lantly opposed bv our native allies under the direction of chiefs tomaiti waka nene noble or nopera mohi tawhai and others who instantly dashed out and attacked them driving them back wvith some loss supposed o amount to eight or ten killed and between  and  wounded on our side five were wounded on this occasion  and one of our most active chiefs reppa was severely wounded the previous day in a skirmish with a small party of the enemy who it appeared bad come out of the pahfor thepurposeof picking off any stragglers from our camp and who had suc ceeded in killing one of the volunteer pioneers who had gone to an unnecessary distance for water anrd war rhot inthe act ot taking it up to this date no casualty with the albove exceptions has takeu place in the european part of the forceit may be proper fr me to observe that in the action

the th instant i have the honour to acquaint your excellency that the stock ade and battery mentioned therein as being conumenced within about  yards of the pah being nearly completed i determined upon throwing up another but much smaller on its right flank and considerably in advance so as effec tually to put a atop to any attempt on the part of the enemy at making a sally such as took place on the d instant  as also entirely to cut off his communication with the country on the side of our camp this second work was completed this day and two guns one  pounder and one pound howitzer placed

of ground or rather ridge with deep wooded valleys on either side and thick woods both in front and rear the distance from the pah supposed to be about  yards in our front aro three guns one  pounder one pound howitzer and one light pounder with an apparatus for throwing rockets from this position several shells have been thrown into the pah as weu as rockets and much execution must have been done by them as they were well directedwvithin the larger stockade which at the utmost cannot be more than  yards from the pah there are two  pounders and four small inch mortars and the wood in front of these guns has been so completely cut down that nearly the whole face of the pah is now open to their firethe small advanced stockade contains one pounder and one pound howitzer and commands a rango not only along the same face the western that is exposed to the fire of our other batteries but will also rango along the southern face and i expect destroy the defences on the south west angleour progress up to this period may have been considered slow but great difficulties have been encountered as your excelency who has been an eyewitness to all our move ments will i am sure admit and tho decided advantage that will arise to tho colony at large if we succeed in carrying this place with little or no loss has decided me in proceeding with so much cautioni have c h despardacting colonel

th instant our advanced batter ies being completed one within  yards and the second about  yards off the pab a general fire was commenced from all the guns with a vioev of opening a breach into the place and several rockets were thronn into it at tho same time for the purpose of driving the enemy out the fire was kept up with little intermission during the greater part of the day and towards evening it was evident thatthe outer works on those parts against which the fire was directed were nearly all giving way hut the numerous stockades inside crossing the place in different directions and composed of much stronger timbers wero scarcely touched towards evening our fire slackened and was only continued occa sionally during the night to prevent the enemy attempting to repair the breaches that had been madeon the following morning the th inst no person being obsorved moving within the pah a few of our native allies under a chief naimed william lyaka a brother of tomaiti waka nene went up to the place for the purpose of observing whether or not the enemy had evacuated it this party entered the breach unopposed which being per ceived from the nearest battery a party of  men of the troops undercaptain denny waspushedup rapidly and toge thor with the natives gainedthe inside ofthe stockades before they were perceived by the enemy who at the time were sheltering themselves from the fire of our guns on a sloping piece of ground in one of their outworks our parties bad scarcely gained the inside when they were noticed by the enemy and a heavy fire of musketry instantly poured in upon them the stockades howecver now became our pro tection and strong reinforcements being immediately brought up from camp possession of the placo was sc cured in spite of all the efforts of the enmyto drive us back being obliged to retreat and shelter himself in a wood opposite the east face of the pah where the tiees being extremely large and forming complete breast works many of them having been cut down previously and evidently purposely placed in a defensive position he was enabled to maintain a heavy fire against us for a considerable time until a doorway in that face having been broken open the seamen and troops rushed out and dis lodged him fronm his position lie howrever still continued to keep up a fire from the woods but more vwith a view to cover his retreat and enable him to carry away his wounded men than with any expectation of renewing the contest the attack commenced about  oclock nm and all firing had ceased about  oelock pm the extraordinary strength of this place particularly in its interior defences far ex ceeded any idea i could have formed of it every hut was a complete fortress initself being strongly stockaded all round with heavy timbers sunk deep in the ground and placed closo to each other fev of them being less than one foot in diameter and many considerably more be sides having a strong embankment thrown up behind them each huthad also a deep excavation close to it making it complete bombproof and sufficiently large to con tain several peonle where at night they were completely sheltered from both shot and shellthe enemys loss has been sovere and several chiefs on their side have fallen the numbers i have not been able to ascertain as they invariably carryoff both killed and wounded when possible several of the former were however left behind and it has been decidedly ascertained from a wounded prisoner that the chief heki bad joined kawiti in the pah on the afternoon preceding the attackas your excellency has been an eyewitness to our opera tions and i may say actually engaged in the assault it may bo thought unnecessary to drawv your attention to those per sons who had a greater opportunity than others of distin guishing themselves but the satisfaction i feel in recording the obligation i am under to those persocs makes me per severe in doing so to the officers seamen and marines from her
