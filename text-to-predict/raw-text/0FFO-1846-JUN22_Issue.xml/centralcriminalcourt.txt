examination was made by dr watervorth the medical gentleman who had been in the habit of attending upoa the deceased but no one was present on the part of dr ellismr cockbunxnow my friend has asked you a ques tion which i think might as well have been spared with regard to dr ellis having formerly been in tbe lace trade are you not aware maadam that he has been atbroad and studying for the medical profession in foreign universities and has undergone a regular course of attendance at the hosptals to qalify him for the duties of that professionwitn ess tam aware that he has been abroad for several years but do not know of my own knowledge that he was studying at any foreign universitymir harles waterworth deposed that he is a surgeon and resie in the new kentroad the late mr dresserbad beei hiatient and he hadl known him for seven years the deceased had an attack of jausndice about six months ago for which witness treated him and be recovered from it in miarch ha hsad a similar attack but slighter and he re covered in a few days he should say tbat the deceased was a man who might be considered healthy but he cer tainly was not a robust man and his powers were feeble and his constitution languid he made a post suortcmb examina tion of the bod of the deceased he first examlined the chest and cnd blood exuding froin the lungs which were very much gorged with blood the beat wao also gorgedwith blood and thcse appearances in hig opinion sufficiently indicated the cause of death the apnearances of these organs accounted for the coldness of tho body described by mrs dresser and the difficulty ofbreathing which would be the symptoms of approaching dissolution from such causes the diagnosi written by dr ellis wvï¿½ given to him and h corpared it with the appearances presented upon the post mcitens examination they only correspoeaded in one or tltwoprtcisars anl there was no trace of the dias aso of hopa atbts which was gtated by the defendant to be thle cause of death or any suppuration of the liver or vscera hxe considered the tse of baths and the application of cold water to have been highly improper to a person in the con dition of the deceased astheyad a tnency to produce the congestion of the heart and lungs to which he had referred and more yarticularly in a person in whom the circulation was languid like the deceased than in a person of vigorous constitution he shorld also say that in his opinion the application of a wct cloth to the stomach of the deceased on the llonday when he wvas in the condition that had been described wvas highly improper and in his judgment taking into consideration the state of ths lungs andhe of the deceased such a proceeding w as calculated to accelerate his deathcrossexaminedalthongh he expected that the effect of the post mortem examination would be contradictory to the diagnosis of the case givenby drellis he gave him no notice when it was to take place and no one was present but himself and his partner mr hicks he did not consider whether it would not havo been fair to give dr ellis an opportunity of being present at thepost wortemexamination le should consider that bathing applied to any part of tho body of a patient in such a state would have beer injurious and improper he would not actually pledgo himself as to the cause of death it would be impossible to do to  in such a case the deceased was what might be termed a kealthy man but he did not mean to say by that that he was free from all malady if the brain had been conteated it might have accounted for the congested state of the heart and lungs but he did not open tho head to see the state of tho brainreexaminedhe should say that a bath at a tempera ture of  was too cold for the patient to be placed in and the effect of such a bath would boe to drive the bloo from the extremities to the internal organsmr james hicks the partner of the last witness vwho assisted in the post mortem examination said that the body presented all the appearances of a man who had been drowned the face was bloated and bloody serum issued from the mouth and nose tho lungs were enormously gorged with blood and the heart enlarged and fabby in his opinion the application of cold water was highly im proper in such a caseorossexanrinedbeforo witness entered into partnership with mr waterwrorth he acted as assistant to a gentleman who had the medical charge of a large union in bampahire at the present time hardly a week passed but he was present at a post mortem examinationmr cockbunn inquired whether this happened from so many of his patientsdyg laughterthe witness replied fortunately not but although he was in practice ho took every opportunity he could of at tending the hospitals to witness post stortem examinations with a view to obtain all the knowledge he couldcrossexamination continuedhe did not examine the head of the deceased because he considered he had fouad quite sufficient causes of death in the congested state of the heart and lungs the cold state of the extremities and the difficulty of breathinz might be produced by many diseases but in this case he should say they were occasioned by the congestion of the lnegs some diseases of the brain might cause congestion of the lungstwo persons in the service of dr ellis and who were engaged in superintending the baths were then examined their evidence merely went to show that the deceased was put in a bath a t a temperature ot  degrees on the friday saturday sunday and monday in the morning it ap peared that he remaned in the bath  seconds and he was then rubbed dry and was placed in bed they also proved that wet bandages were applied to him but they denied that thero was any application of the bath after mon day afternoon when the deceased appeared in the state de scribed by kis wifein crossexaminatios they said that on the saturday and sunday the deceased appeared very much better and that ho stated the baths had done him a great deal of good and he was able to walk and he lilewvise said that he felt very much better since he had been under dr ellis tho doctor it appeared also sat up with the deceased all s ay and aonday niht and appeared anxious to do all he could to relieve sim and the deceased au along expressed sitisfaction at his treatmentthis was the case for the prosecution and the court and jury adjourned for a short time to take some refreshmentmr coocburin then addressed the jury for the prisoner and he commenced by observing that the present charge differed from every other in this respect that whereas in every other case the law required a guilty intention to be proved or inferred yet in this instance if a person acted with the utmost kindness and showed tho strongest desire to benefit his patient if death not withstanding his exertions unhappily ensued he stilmightbe amenable to the charge of manslaughter the learned counsel then proceeded to express an opinion that the jury ought to dismiss entirely from their minds all cons deration of the merits of the hydropathic system  he consi dered it had nothing to do with the case it might be avery good system and possess all the advantages claimed for it by its supporters or it might be as was represented by others a delusion and an imposture but the only question for the jury was whether under all the circumstances of this case they could como to a con clusion thaf dr ellis in his treatment of the deceased had acted with such criminal rashness and want of cau tion as would justify them in finding him guilty of the crime of manslaughter he then proceeded to comment upon the facts and said it appeared perfectly clear that the deceased had gone to the doctors establishment of his ovwn accord and tbat the doctor was ignorant of his suf fering from anything but rheumatism the treatment at first wasmost successful for inasmuch as it appeared from the deceaseds own admission that when ho first went there he was prostrate with pain helpless as a child and unable to walk it was sho hat in a day or two be vas entirely free from pain and able to walk in the garden with a littlo assistance wlras not this calculated to induco dr ellis to persevere in his treatment and if unhap pily by so doing he had aggravated another mortal disorder of the existenco of which he had no idea surely it would bo too much to say that ho had thereby sub jected himself to the charge of manslaughter the learned counsel then proceeded to comment at some length upon the medical testimony and observed that he thought it would have been but fair to dr ellis if ho had been allowed an opportunity of being personally present at the post mrortent examination or of having some one there on his behalf he likewise called the attention of the jury to the fact that it was admitted although some diseases of the brain might have occasioned the congested state of the lungs yet that organ was not examined and for all the jury knew to the contrary it might if the oxa minatio had taken place have entirely accounted for the appearances which presented themselves on the body of the deceased the learned counsel concluded a very eloquent and able address by calling upon the jury to ncquit the prisoner and not to destroy for ever his prospects in life by finding him guilty of so serious a charge upon such sliht testimonytord chief justice tsndal then summed up and the jury without any deliberation returned a verdict of nottwvloythe defendant was immediately discharged fromn custody
