kin ds ofexcesses upon the inhabitants it is an andcint practice in which it must be confessed the soldiers of colcotroni excel even the mainotes themselves conceive with what benedictions the entry of our troops was accompaniedthey who pay for every thing they take and never abuse any one therefore deputations arrivc every instant to request the prolongation of our stay in the vauey of pamisus whilstour bayonets are showing themselves con ciliatory the cannon of the russians obey blindly the orders of couatcopo distrias as soon as the entryofrthe lainotes was known at nauplia they sent from caritene the too cele brated colocrotoni with  or  palicares and admiral ricord went with his frigate and two or three government vessels into the gulf of coron we were already at calamata and having driren off the tlainotes without firing a shot we did not permit colocctronl to establish himselfthere ourpre senco being suicident we condinued then to playour honoura ble part the russians have ot

the hydriotes who blew up one of their cor vettes slipped through a brig and ran two others ashore these latter were taken by the russians the crews of all these vessels took refuge on shore where our soldiers treated them with theirusual humanity this great feat of admirral ricord took place three leagues froma the anchorage of the gdnie the commander of which thought whetn he saw the russian admiral arrive that he was come to blockade and ngt to destroy the hydriote vessels if he could have fore seen the event he would have taken measures to prevent this disaster you will iperecive that affairs are becoming singu larly complicated every where the elections take placc in the presence of the soldiers of the president and nevertheless the majoritv is constitutionalthe president continues to exile without form or judg ment the raost distinguished persons in the country and all the representations of the residents of france and england have hitherto been vain it is thought even tbat the exasn bassador gordon whose opinions nevertheless are conformed to those of the presdenr has attempted but without success to obtain some eoncessions in order to wait without collision the decision of the plenipotentiaries oflondon lastly three new delegates from hydra who had come to nauflia at the express wishof the president have retumed withouc havinr obtained any thing wve are placed here in a very unsound position we cannot consider greece as the propertyof count cepo dlstrias he is only the provisional chief ofthe coun try antl it is our dnty to preserve peace until the arrival of the definitive cbief we ought not to assist the president in bis projects of vengeance against an opposition which he has pro bably created by his own administration we cannot sustain this opposition because we cannot judge of the justice of its vcomplaints against count capo distrias our part then ought to confine itself to calmeing the cxasperation of parties and the gaining oftimeit seems that upon this point the residents of france and england the commanders of the forces by sea and land have adopted an opinion and a line of conduct perfectly identical  therefore all parties render justice to their intentions and to their conduct whilst the russians in showlng themselves the devoted exeoutors of the wishes of the president forfeit all claims which they may have acquired to the gratitude of the country they were his toole at poros in aiding the presidents greeks to destroy that city the french do not confine themselves to the protection of m od on and navarino but extend it to all the towns and allthe inhabitants which are within the circle of the corps of occupation the french here as elsewhere do honour to their counry they will have known some time in europe the events at pores we expect tberefore with impatience the first news from london they wvll perceive the necessity of putting an end to the provisional xystem aprompt decision alone can prevent anarchy if they send a king whoever it may be it will do good if it be done quickly the health of the brigade is perfect  general gucheneuo has proved himself a worthy successor to general schneider
