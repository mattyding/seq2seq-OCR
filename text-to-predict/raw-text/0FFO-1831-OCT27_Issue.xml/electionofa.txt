applauseair stevews then peresented himself in front of the hust ings and iwas most enthusiastically received he said that no man could regret more than he did the necessity of again calling thelivery from their respective occupationsto attend in the common hall to support their just rights cheers  but it was not the fault of bisuselfor of the livery the inconvenience arosesolely froin the conduct of orl indivlduals who thought they had a right to control the wisbes of the livery f the city of london loud cheers it was known to every man that the court of aldermen was a secret and closed court and all that couxlt be ascertained of thieir proceedings was from hearsay and the public papers by which it appeared that with five aldermen in favour of the lirery  or  had again thought fit to put thiem to the trouble of going through another centest loud cheers there had beer so maany pretensions set up on the former occasions and which had beeni so successfully resisted and destroyed that it was diflicult to isay en what ground it was that the livery had the trouble and inconyezzience of meetingthis day in the first instance he felt bound to say sir peter leauriehad acted a falr and honourakble part tof ifrhe thought the system of rotation was binding on the livery he lbad a right to icy their sentiments by istaniding a pall hear but when the sense of the livery had been so decidedly declared against himn and in favour oe the present chiefalagistrate a known and tried reformer he mlr stevens could not con ceive on what principle it was thatt the livery should be called on to go to another election loud cheers some of the friends ofsir peter laurie who formerly had worked under the banners of reform had now mingled together in support of a gentleman who on no principle of rotation could claim the votes uf the livery heiar in oidintary times he mr stevens would not be one to come forward te oppose any such a gentleman but in such a year as that which was coming on the livery ought to look at what their chief mlagistrate had done in the year that was past and when they saw that gertleman exercising his office for the prometion of the great cause of reform and of public liberty and fighting the battles of the people where could they find anu indivicdual so fit to fill the civic chair aet this important crisis as the one who had already done so well loud ceberp the livery were now bourd by every principle of honour anid justice to support the lord mayer against the little phalanx that first endeavoured tar injure and destroy his reputation and character anud who mow seek by every possible trick and mannruvreto assail the rights of the livery and so deprilve him of the high station they were determoined he should fill loud cheers there was a vast deal of absurdity aboit the court of aldermen laughter the livery had scarcely interfertd with thtin more than once in  years and it was certainly rather hard that at leasst once within that periedlof time they could not have a man of their choice to preside over thema as chief magistrate it had beta said that the court of aldermeni possessed a kind of veto against the choice ofthe livery if eewhy should sthe livery meet at all to chgose a lord mayer  hlear thse object oftreturning two aldermen to the court ofaldermen had ori ginally been to save the contests and trouble to which thelivesy had nowr been forced oust int order that if one declined to serve the other should be ready to take upon himself the office with these views he came forward so prspose to the livery the lasrd filayor to be reelected to thecivic chair fur the year ensuring before he concluded hie could niot but ye mark that if the court of aldermaen were placed in the same situation as the ltveryif  liveryrmen stood in determined opposition to  aldermenwould thiey give way to such a hoay  loud cheers and laughter it was not reasonable on any principle of justice or bonour to suppose they would do sqo cheers valuable as was the time of every inilivi dual he was sure that no lireryman would leave the contest untla victory had been obained wveeks had already been devoted to the

friends had been mnuch aggrieved that he should have before attcked him but he had dune so because he had thought him a wolf in sheeps clothing cheers and laugh te efound from the tory gazette of this day thatt alderman farearothers coming forward on the present oc casion was a matter of great gratification to the tory pzarty in the mlornin post of this day he had read the following paragraph i hat the firmness of the court of aldermen in doing right will not now be exerted in vain some idea tuigist he torned of the writers conception of what consti tuted firmness by a referencei to another article in the samae joutnal a few says back in which he says that the firm ness virtue and patriotism of the hereditary branch of the legislature have rescued the country from the irretrieva ble calamity by which it was threatened cheers and laughter this writer in the morninsg post had given the livery the opportunity of knowing thatt the little house of incurabes in the dcvt ofrlondon was as unnecessary as the great house ofiucuribles ia the west end of the town ra monse cheering and laughter in addition to the tory alderman farebrother there had appeared in the public jour nals of the daya motley list of names who wouild support himaome of whona were at one timelleflormers and at otherswihen thewind of fottune veered denied themselves as such sort of political mountebanks who threw

busttngs to put a tory in the civic chair which will raise ehemselve its it were in stilts  and as that would give the beipht so they think it would give talent to a moan loud cheers  in addition to the great guns laugh ter who appear in support of alderman yarebrotbcr thuer are also some little pocketapiatolil or in other words some gentlemen who e are axiusly waiting for somne of the leftoff suits of greatness for themselves to wear  but he mr pearson was certain that many of them were to threadbatre and ragged that not even the ve riest irish pauper wouild consent to put them an ge neral laughter there was on the present occasion presented to the livery a most respectable character in the person ofalderman kelly cheers he mlr pearson had told the livery with respect to alderman thompson that he could look in his honest face and read his heart though bie made no promise auid he would tell the livery now that al dtrmanskelly had made no pledge but thd lilvery need not he afraidfor there were some men whose very nead he mrpearsor would  rely on without a pledgo rather than the solemapronmiscandengagement ofnother lefeltconfident the livery would return to the court of aldermen the lord mayor aud aldermaa kelly with an immecse majorlty al i derman farebrothers would be a littlego a lot that would  not be withdrawn but would remain in the catalogue for some days immense checringand laughter the livery could ceasiy undesstand the motive which induced bim to call on tlbe livcry to stand firm and record their votes this dayit was to put the two gentlemen he had named at the head ofthe poll with a great majority andthose who were not now present would see by the public papers for whom they were to vote to xecure their independence laud cheert it mattered not which of ths two stood highest for alderman thompson after tke short conversation which cook place between that gentleman and himself alr parson had sild that the united voice of all london would not induce hims to redre from his pledge lond cheer there was a little phydlognointeal langtage which he mlr pearzon could read and the llvery would have seen with what care he had avoided some of ihe aldermen when many were suggested to his noticehis presentchoice he had every faith in cheers though he had entered his pretest against the present prodcedings he had no doubt as to the re suit of the election but this he would say that on that no tiec which he had gireo to the sheriffs if the livery would stand by him hie would wring from the burt of aldermen the usurped prerogative of rejecting thc cholee ni�the livery loud cheers the right they had assumed was noatfunded in law and this election tlhouid be the knll to the moral ensequence of teue aldermlen of the city of london isaudcbeers he had ppoeed sir pcter laurie because it washis duty to oppose a toryat a time like the present  but that geitleman had nenw laid down his arms and he ras no longcr his foe loud iers and he would naw advert to a miseonciptlonwhich hadgoneabroad from thenewspapersthat he mr peatsors had spoken of sir peter lauie as a beast he begged to set himrelf right he had done no such tbing whit he had said was that sir peter latirle being half whzi and half tory was like a bat half bird and half beast cheers and laughter no hoped if be had given pain tosir peter laurie orany of his friends that this expla nation vtould be deemed tatisractory if itshould not he was perfectlyready to ofrer his apology cheers though he had now done with sir peter s a privatefriend he bad not yet done with him as a caudidate for the present election re minded him of the fable of the hydra with many heads and hlercules sir peter was the first head of the hydta with which the livery had to combatand when like ljercules they had lopped it ofr another had grown in its stead but on the second electign sir peters was notfing more than a pimple on the shoalders but the livery like hercules with a red hot iron seared the neck the iron used by the livery wis the alraost unanimous expression of feeling against him loud cheers and now he hopedwith the exertions of the livery to eear oil the head of sir peter lauries successor cheers and laughter dmr stesens had alluded to the aldermans oath vhitc it would appear bound them to secrecya sort of freemasons oath he however had got the token now andwouldreadit to the livery ftwasas followas you shall not sell any nanner of victuals by retail such as bread cheese ale wine lesb or fish neither by your apprenties nor allo your servants to do te like  and said mr pear souifina by reference to the period at which this form of oath was akopted that mptuary laws were passed by the corporation as to how much victuals each person should eat the aldermen werer llowved  courses of  dishe each while other peoplc were only allowred one course of  dishes loud laughter the oath thus proceeds the secrets of the court you shall keep and not disclose anything tnere spoken for the comron wealth of the city hear or that might hurt any person orbrother of said court urless it be spoken to your brotber or any one else and that you think in your dis crction lt shall be for tbe good of the ity when ssld mr pcarson aad the court ofalderrien discretion  loud cheers and laughter under that oath it was most ridiculous and absurd to contend that the aldermen were not at liberty to say howtbeyhadvoted in theircourt but under thecircumstances end the secrecy witb whicb their proeedings were conducted he should be glad to receive all information as to what might reach the ear of any liveryman of transactions in the court of aldermen and iet every man make itas publicas possible he now begged to retire without seconding the nominalcon of tie lord mayor he did not do o lest it might militate ngainst theulterkor proceedings he had in view and if he did not raise his bznd on the lord mayor being put in nomina tlon he begged the livery to attribute it to the same motive loud cheersthe names or the aldermuen were then put up that of sir peter laurie was hissed and hooted loudly but wben the name of aldenran farebrotber vias placed in view of the livery nothing eonld exceed the expressions of indig nation and disgust which burst from all parts of the crowded hall whue the names of the lord mlayor and aldermnr keluy were received with the most loud and dlstinguished cheers and other manifestations of unequivocal approval about  hands srere held up for aldermen farebrmther and we may say that thougands were raised in an instant for the two popular candidates the expression of the united voice of the ball was if possible ten times mere powerful than it was upon the second contest and twenty times greater than it was upon the firstthe corsroxserjeaart declared it to be the opinion of the sherifti that the electton fell upon the lord alayor and alderman kelly the announcement was receivedwith tre mendous cheeringthe corseoserjeayt then stated that a poll was da manded upon the part of alderman farebrotber in the names of w am rotbh wvarwick weston anti john atkins loud cries of  shame shamne and in allusion to alder man farebrothers trade of auctioneer  knock down farebrother a poul ws as a matterof coarse demanded for she lord mlayor and alderman kellymr lauriece called the attention of the livery to the present contest in which the livery of london and the court of aldermen were competitors he represented the necessity of preventing the lord mayor and alder man kelly from putting their hands lato their pockets on such an occasion loud cheers and stated that of the subscriptions for defraying the expense of the last elec tion a small balance remained still in hand and would be ap propriated to the present he then read the liat of subscrip tionswbich amounted so about aud called upon the great bedy of the electors to come forward with their purees in de fence of their rights and frdvileges which were most grossly and basely violated the appeal wvas received with cheering clapsping of hand anad waving of hatsilr rcrrand tayr stood forwrard amidst im orcuse cheerh le would he said advcrt to the rea sons which induced bim to codfider the present contest to be one of great importance the contest was not onlythat of the reformers with the antireformer but that of the livery with a portion of the coturt of alder men whatever might have been the opinions of indivi duals as to the commencement of the struggle all must now acknowledge that it was the duty of the livery to rush forward at the prescnt moment the character of the engage ment having undergone a change of a most serious descrip tion loud cheers he had with surprise seen a requssi ton certainly not numerously nor could he say very respect ably signed laughter recommending the choice of aider mln farebrother to the livery immense hooting bissing end groaning the requisitionlsts stated ae a reason for such recommendation that they wisbed to put an end to the tumults in the city loud laughter they called the struggle of the livery for their rights a tumult ifa disposl tion to excite tumult existed could not every one point to the coust of aldermen as the cause cheers and cries of  yes yes the stupid beasts they are the cause were rpot those who demanded a pill in deriance of the united feeling of that hall the instigators to tumult tumult amongst the livery  the accusation was nonsense cheers it had been said very properly by mlr pearson that the rejection of the man the livery wished to return was an usurpatlon by the court of aldermen it was he alr taylor assured the livery an usurpation too not of very long standing he had searched into the records and he found that all the charters of the city gave to the livery thefultright to elect a lordmlayorfrons amongst them selves w then could it be endured that the court of al dermen should defraud the livery of such a right  lioud cheers and cries of  their power is at an end the usur pation is a complete one and ddopted by persons who had long been distinguished for their opposition to every thing calculated io benefit the people to whom they were now so firmly and resolutely opposed ctheers in looking for the blessing of a parliamentary reform the livery would riot forget the necessity whicb existed for a cor poration reform for a check upon the proceedings of the court of aldermen cheering it was also necessary to limit the period of mayorlty electios why could not that election like the future parliamentary electlons be limzited to two days cheers whry should not the present election wfhich was protracted by the sapient aldermen many of whbom werer not citizens of londonas all be closed on she second day it was a remarkable fact that those who were now keeping up any thing like tumult were not citizens thev were aliens who had waited with their mouthsopen forthegown and the moinent they got it commenced operations against those who had invested them with it mr taylor condluded by characterizing the opposition of the aldermen to the livery as most indecent and abominable and was greatly cheered upon retiringair galloway aes also loudly applauded upon coming forwrard he conaidered the contest as infinitely more im portant than the two preceding ones and he had no doubt that the coartafaldermen viere at that moment occupied in the attempt to dissuade the lord mayor from persevering to act in conformity with the wlsh of the livery but the attempt would be as futile and ridiculous as it would be to endeavour to prevail upon the livery to yield up their pretensions in obedience to the dictum of the comert of alder men loud cheers he called upon the livery as they tegarded thelr rights and as they abhorred an insolent usur pation of those rights to come up to the poll in such a masioer as to show their feejng of contempt and indignation for those who wished to trmple upon them cheers all bands must be united the people must prevail over those yho had at all times and on all occasions done au they cauldto add to the catalogue of calamities whici formed the deadly complaint and curse of the people loud cheer ing the junta who now wished to thrust down the throats of the people alderman farebrother who had in fact done notbing but insult the livery and who had particularly dzitingtisbed himself by his determined rejecton of the candidate whom thousands bad joined in calling again to the magisterial chairif the livery would not contemptuously and indignantly reject tuch a candidate for their auifrages they would be ssnwerthy of the name not only of liverymen but of men loud cheers but he knew the conflict would testify the sincerity vigour andd unanimaity of the friends of freedom and that they would at once overthrow the paltry aristocracy oppesed to them cheersthe commronseugeant telln upon the part of the sherilf informed the flall that the polling would commence at  oclock and
