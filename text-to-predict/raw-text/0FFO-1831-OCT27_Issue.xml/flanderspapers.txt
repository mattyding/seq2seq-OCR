for foreign affairs ascended the tribune and saidgentlemen after having laid before you in your sitting yesterday the course followed by the govern ment in the late negetiationsafter having shown you its perseverlng efforts followed by a result so unexpected and so contrary to its wishesthere remains for me now as well as my colleagueswho are like myself counsellers of the crown a melancholy and painful duty to perform the fulfilment of this dutywe cannot avoid plaeed as we are under the law of a necessity which cannot be mistaken and with which it is impossible to contend except by subjecting to incal culable chances the present and future welare of the coun try and perhaps by sacrificing the two conquests of our revo lution independence and libertr the treaty of peace deter mined on by the conference stipulates in articles  and  cessions of territory in favour of bolland tbe government could not authorize ts plenipotentiary to sign this treaty the h article of the constitution which says no cession no change no addition of territory can take place but byvir tue of a law formally opsed ihis and at the same time pointed out to the gevcrnmentthe course it had to follow it is to remain faithful to the principles of the constitution to fulfil the obligation which it imposes on us that we come gen tlemen by the kings orders to submit to your consideration a project of haw authorizing the government toconsent to theces sions otterritorystipulated in the treaty ofpeaceandto conclude finanrial arrangements amid the painful sentiments which affect it the government will not leave yotu in igporance of the motives which have determined it to take on itsclf the re sponsibility of the initative which it now uses the nation whose destinies are now to be definitively fixed and you gen tlemenwho represent it in this place shall be acquainted with all our thoughts if ever the courage to speak with frankness was necessary it is now  it is in reference to the weightyinterests on whichbyoa will bave to decide to he silent or to dissemble at such a moment would be i will not say weakness in a ministry but basenesv yes gentlemen the question which the project of lav raises is so weighty that the whole future fate of the country is involved in its solution if at another time proposals like theconditioalsnow imposed on us had been made to belgium the government raiglht bave slhrunk from the task which it now performs it would per hap have said to you reject these conditions they are un just and partial depend on the goodness of your cause on timeif need he on your arms and obtain better but gen tlemen this language which would then have appealed rea sonable because circumstances and facts gave it a force which it would not have derived from itself is now no longer possible since then time has advanced and europe has witnessed events which by modifying the general policy could not but influence the question raised by our revolu tion the support which we found in the idea of our strength inspired into the powers by our successes in septemberthe perhaps mere real snpport which the heroic resistance of the poles gave to our cause has wholly abandoned us poland that interesting country which never had its equal in glory and misfortune after prodigies of courage has fallen can it be necessary to teol you the influence that its fall must have bad on the policy and resolutions of a pawer all whose mo tions were tmbarrassed by the revolution  but besides these emnsideratioss there is another whicb cannot and must not escape your it is that the question which has been in dfs pute for this year past is not limaited merely to our interests and those of holiand bit that it affects in many points the interests of enrope our patrfotism our national pride wounded by the sentence of the arbitrators who bave just decided between rolland and us niay revolt at this inter vention of europe it is nevertheless a fact which we cannot do away witlh the fact besides is not newit bas its sanctionit has its precedents in history other peo ple berbre us have had to submit to the consequences of it it is not the first time that whether with or without reason political expediency and the system of the balance of europs have subjected a people fcr the general good to those sacri fices which are subnitted to only from a conviction of the inu tility of the efforts that might he made to escape them the sactifice which is requited of belgium isof the same nature its whole excuseits entire justificationfor you who are calleti on to sanction it by yaur vote is in the necessityin the circumstances whose influence in human affairs is some times so powerful that the statesmen cannot avoid it the slve powers agree together to support the decision which they have made and which they think calculated to guarantee at the same time the maintenance of peace and the european system this may be an error arising from the feeling of distrust unduly excited in them by regenerated belgium we believe it to be so and you will bear us witness gen tlemen that we have neglected nothing to dispel an error so fatal to our interest our efforts have not the expected euccess and the determinations of the five great powers have inter posed between our wishes and the hope of seeing them rea lized the powers it would be idle to attempt to dissemble it act in concert and the decisions of the conference ae the note accompanying the treaty declares are final anti irrevocable these words derive espcial force from the circumstance and thenecessities ofthe moment theuncertaintywhich forthis year past has involved the afairs of europe in consequence of the protraeted suspense of the belgian question cannot be pro longed without leading to the crisis which it is so greatly desired to prevent and which every days delay renders more imminent it is now for you gentlemen to deride whether what is demanded of us whethet the cession of territory which is the price at which peace is to be ofieredto us can be recouciledi will not say with the in terestsof the country itis pardauy and violentld injureli will not

before you it is to be determined whether we will or not whether we can or not form any independent zation with the territosy as it will be circumscribed by the stipulations of the treaty gentlemen we hare not conceade fromn ourielves the objection that may he made against the project of law before youwe have especially foreseen the arguments which it wil be easy to draw from the condition in which these of our countrymen and our brethren will be placed whom rhe treaty separates from us nobody appreclates better or shows more warmly than we do the regret and the gilefcxcited in the soul by those forced sepa rations which tear from ourafeectlorsfrom our syrpathythose who formned with us only one family and who so powerfully aided in the conqust of apatrimony which they are not to be allowed to enjoy with us far be irom us the idea of weak ening by our words a sacrifice the extent of which we fully comprehend but placed between our affections and the pre i ponderating interest of the country having to choose between the abatgonment ofsome of its members and the annihilatioa of tee whole family our choice haa not been free we have been compelled to cnter on the course in which you see us and may we be allowed to say that in acting thus we have reckoned on your suffrages on the generosity even of those ef our brethren to whose expatrlation  we are obliged unfortu rately for ourselves to subscribe we said to ourselvess that thoughfrustrated of the hopes of sharing with us a comamon country they would not however from personal metives desire to draw on belgium the mnisfortunes which
