obtainor as to tbe mischief and detriment to which the country had been subjected so long from the want of such reform and from the long contdnuance of the unjust and oppressive system of rotten

because the delay might produce miscbief and cxciltement and also because the house of lords wbich he regarded as a most imnportant branch of the legislature had by their conduct lost much of their popularity and influence he grieved princlpally for their ske and not for the people for reform must sooa be theirs hear hear they had the solemn pledge ofmninisters that no measure of reformn sbould be brought ifsto parliament less efficient or less calculated to promote the end in view hnati that which had been rejeeted by the house of lords  the bdi would not be frittered down to please the

motion shortly pointed out the policy of conceding the bill to the earnest prayer of au classes of the people whilst it would be received as an act of grace and favour he insanced the measure of catholic relief to prove that if too long delayed tbeconcession would lose half its value and drew a lively comparison between the bill of rights of william iii and this the great charter of our

unanimouslymr ja es hius t o rose to move the third resolution and saidgentlemen a majority of the house of peers has deprived us of the benefits we so sanguinely anticipated from the reform bil which they have rejected under the specious pretence that the measure wvas revolutionsr  i think the majorityare compromised in the late tumults which have been occasioned bytheir illjudged opposition to the anxious wishes of the antion applause and that they are morelly re fspoasible for the lives which have bean sncrificed in those dis tmrabnces let us hope tbat a new light will break in upon the lordsthat they wfill cease to offer vexatious oppositionto thalt great measure the ultimate success of which they cn not prevent they say sisarit is too large aconcecsiou and pregnant with mnischief but conession psstponcdco t cession refusedis alone calculated to promote con vulsion timely concession is one of itc bases of good government cheers it is said that the force of public opinion will eventually carry the bill but i fear it must be after a long and tedious struggle  let us however bear in mind that moral not physica ferce is the only means we can constitutionally employ let us thus state our resolves and express our gratitude to those noble peers aud patriotic mem bere of the house of commons who have so disinterestedly advocated the peoples rights applause for this end i beg to propose the following resolution viz that so far from having become lukewarm or indifferent to the mea sure of reform we will never cease to exercise all the constitutional means in our power to cause it to becgme part of the law of the land that the gratitude of this meetlug is due to such of the peers as have voted for the second reading ofthe reform bill and that the cordial thanks of the meting be also given to the hon thre house of cola moos for havnng patiently discussed and for having passed that most important bill cheerslir issac fishterl seconded the resolution which was carried unanimouslymr george crort said thatin ritingto move the fourth resolution which had been placed in his charge le should not have made one observation after the addresses wvhich had been made to the meeting but from an alluslon whlch alr hun ton had made irv bis speecb buttwhich he had merely touched upon it was thinthat the hiul had beea rejected under the specious pretextthattitwasrevolutionary this pretext may be specious gentlemen but i am convinced it is nothing more cheers for it appears very clearly to be uaed for the purpose of getting rid not of the bil only but of the ministers who proposed it whilst air bunton was ad dressing you and more especially when he touched upon this subject it recalled to my rnind a passage i had met with in the couse of my readling a few days ago in the works of a writer whose authority on constitutional matters cannot be questionedmir justice blacktone applause he gen tlemnen was not a ladical he was not even a moderate whig but was at the time

upon thetrue tbeory and genuine principles of liberty eiery member of the community howeverpoor should hivea vote in electinag those delegates to whose charge i commlitted the disposal of his property

principle laid down by that constitutional writer and docs the bui do more than this no the oanly qualification the only limitation and distinction of the right of voting wehith judge backtone lays down iaunot eveni a el qualificaion for a boreugb or a s qualificaion for a county but that every voter should be enabled to give his vote freoey and withnut inuence it is upon this priacile thae the reform bill is framed its is intended by it to baive up a clas of voters vho will give their votes freely and without influence and isis for this reason tbat the bill has been supportes by sd large a
