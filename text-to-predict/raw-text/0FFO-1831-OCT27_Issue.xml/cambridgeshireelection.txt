within many years and as it is likely to occupy no inennsidewrale share ef the public atten tiont or the next loor  days it may not be amiss to inrm your readers f some particulars as to the candidates ard the partieby whotn ther are supportedthe vacancy bas as most of your readerp arc aware been causcl bythc resignation of lord francis osbornethe honest and independetti whig member wh has represented thc county for the last years i rnav here mention tbhat up to the commensement of the present century cambridgecouny has been almnit a clnse borough in the hand ofte tories the nomination was in the hands of a few leading families and the people had very little to do with it about the corm menctment of this century the popular interett which had befote been very feeble sprung up into sufficient strength to be able to take an irmportant part in the affairs of the county and by the aid of it lord charlet sanners who then stood on popular groundswas returned for thecounty lord charles hlivever forgot the step by which he had ascended to the re presentation his voses in the huse were any thing but fivonhible to the populsr party and he lest their support in  that party wvas sfriciently strong to return lord francis oborse to the exclusion of tho heon c yorjce thc uncle of the present candidate and to continue him to the present time when be has resigned oan accountof illhealth i should observe that on every occasion when there was a chance of a contest lord francis osborne had always received the sup port of the hardwicke interest he received it in m whersame injudicious friends of imr adearges pat him in noroi ranionand kept thepoll openthouglb against that gentlcmans will for  or  days a zd he received it in the election of j from many of lord hardwickes terants in cmmon with mlr adeane against the opposition of lord charlcs manners thus the independent interest mnade its firat ehorbt in  by the fejection of cne tory candidate and continued te increase untll in the last year it was strong enough to send two mnembers fivourable to reformone a pro feased wvhig andi the oiler if not a professed whig at lcast with au his political predilectiens leaning that waysineelast elretien bowever things hav taken a new thougb conslderinl the parties not a singular tum here the in terests of the houses of rutland and hardwicke have bcen united far the avowed purpose of opposing a candidatevwho comes forward on the popular interest as the advo cate of the late reform i have said that the avowed purpose of thlis coalition is opposition to what the parties profess to think too extensive a measure of reform but the renl object is to rush if possible the independent interest aud to bring back the coanty to the snug and quiet tory dotaination trder which ithad cxlsted for so many years theattempt howevcr if my informsation is correct ib as hopeless as it is desperate ana like the opposition made to the bill by a certain party in a certain pince wiiu end in ex tingunshing the political influence of those who have made it this unnatural coalition between parties who were never before united has produced as itt first result the nornination as the candidate on the ultratory nd of course antire form interest of g p yorke esq son of thelate sir joseph and lately a member for reigate of lur yorkes pre tensions to a seat for the county his most anguine sup porters do not pretend to say more than that he is the nominee of the houses of mlanners and yorke and the pledged oppo nent of the reform bill though like many other of its oppo nent it in probable that he will avow himself a reformer on the hustings tomorrowonthe sideof lr yorke are ranged all the antireforming interest not only of this but of many other counties cven so remote as lvestmoreland a large portion of clerical and university influence extending snore soito to tradesmen tutors c i have hcard of many applications in this way on the antireform side which were completely successful because accompanied with  intimations not to be mlsuun derstood probably before the end of the week i shall be able to speak more circumstantially on tbis subject the tery tbrces have been greatly recruited by the charlesstreet gang who have transferred themselves bodily hither in the persons oftheir most active membcs and who are  at work in every possible way of this also more anonthe reform candidate is mr townley a gentleman of an ancient and highly respectable whis familly and of mo derate fortune resident within a few miles of this townmtr townley is brought forward on this occasion free of expeuse indeed a gentleman of his fortune which though respectable is not adequate tt the trains of a seveft and pro tracted contest could not with any pretensions to sanity hbae ventured to opoosesingletanded such a force of money and influence c c c as the tory party will bring to bear upon any refosm candidateas i am upon this subjeet i may mention rith the view of corrccting an erroncous impression a para graph whidih appeared in a london evening paper that the yeformets here have ample funds it it true they are making great exertions but the truth must be told that to make those exertions effectual here they mnst be supported by the re formers in every part of the country if subseciptions come in the arrangements here are such as to ensure success but any one who knows any thing of a county contest must bc aware that a contest conducted on the purest priniples requires and more particularly in a large county fundsau pie funds i hone the reformers througbout the country will bestir themselves as far as the reform question can be fought it is about to be fought here
