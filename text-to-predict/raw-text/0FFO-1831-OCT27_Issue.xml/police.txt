appeared from the statement of a respectable person that yesterday torenoen he found a crowd collected in the curtain road in a very excited state and upon inquiry as to the cause ascertained that some disagreement having taken place be tween two boys one of them the prisoner had stabbed the other in the abdomen with d penknife the wltness gave notice ef the occurrence to the police by whom the prisoner was brought to the officethe little fellow who had been wounded was present and seemed to be in much pain but there was no evdence of a surgeon or other professional person as to the nature of the injurymr besnett observed that he could do nothing until he had such evidence but he was placed in a rather awkward situation for if he sent the boy to a surgeon the latter could not be expected to lose his valuable time and attend there without some prospect of remuneration but some time since mir fuller a surgeon was employed in the expectation that the parishofficers would payhim and he had never yet been able to obtain compensationa police inspector said that if the boy were taken to mr lesson a surgeon in st lukes parish he believed the com missioners would see him paidthe boy was taken to mir lesson and in the mcan time the prisoner was detained
