eccleiastical intelligencethe rev chancellor espin presiding at chester consistory court yesterday gave judgment in a case involving the question of the legality of prayers for the dead in the church of england on september  an application was made to the court for a faculty authorizing an inscription to be placed in the church of odd rode cheshire asking for prayers for the depirted the chancellor in delivering judgment remarked that when the matter was first brought before the courb he referred to the wellknown caso of  brecles v woolfrey but he did so on tho spur of the moment not having seen tho inscription until just before the court opened on consideration he said it might be doubted whether that case and the judgment on it would have warranted that court in sanctioning the proposed inscription at odd bode the case referred to was indeed a leading case and the judgment was a careful one the judge sir eerbert jenner fust did not give direct sanction tu the inscription before himn he only refused to order the tombstone which bore it to be removed it did ot appear that ho would himself have authorized the inscription bad ho been asled to do so then again it inight be argued that the odd rode inscription oof your charity pray for the soul of henrietta francis  went somewhat beyond the one placed on the tomb of mr woolfrey in the churchyard of carisbrooke the chancellor referred at some length to sir e j fusts judgment and proceeded to refer to a few inscriptions iiu various parts of the country sornewhat similar to the one proposed in this case in the church of st saviours lends built when dr hook was vicar of leeds though not by him was an inscription which ran nearly thus  all ye that etlter this church pray for the sinner that bei t it it must be some  years since that church was dedi cated the bishop of ripon dr longley afterwvards archbishop of canterbury did not disapprove of it or he would have ordered it to be erased before con secrating the church the chancellor then referred to similar inscriptions in the church of liangurig tdontgomeryshire but they had beenplaced inthecburch without authority no doubt in private derotion the practice of praying for the departed was retained by many bishops and theologians john wesley amongst them but the definite forms of such prayers as were found in the first english prayerbook of  were withdrawn in  and never restored in the revisions which followed in   and  and it was noteworthy that those wbo revised the prayerbook hesitated in thp matter because they did on the last occasion restore the commemoration of the faithful departed to the church mlilitant prayer bishop cosin had left it on record that certain words in tho first thanksgiving after the communion were retainedin the service of set purpose as a cumulative expres sion intended to inclnde both the living and the dead still admitting that the words were only an eblique and general form of such prayers as they were now considering they had not that direct and personal referenco and application which the pro posed inscription exhibited some devout persons had recently hoped that uch intercessions for the departed should be reinserted in the liturgy as were found in the prayerbook of  but that reinsertion had not yet taken place and the reason for caution was clear out of the ancient prayers for the faith ful departed grew the notion that they needed to be succoured by the prayers of the living hence that they were ungergoing sufferings and even torments from which the prayers of strvivors might assist to relieve them and so by rapid strides we reached the roman doctrino condemned by the nd article of religion prayers for the dead wero unquestionably associated in the popular mind with the later exaggerations referred to in that article and it might be added that a bequest made for such prayers being offered would be void by tho commnon law of the realm as superstitioas therefore though in private prayers might be offered as comformablo to the ways of the primitive church certainly from the second century downward and however deeply one might sympathize with sentiments of affectionate regard in tho bereaved fired as they often were by strong realizing of the truth of the communion of saints it did not seem to belong to a court of first instance to do what the formularies of the church have abstained from doing it was not fr him to authorize directly tho settingup in a place of public worship of an inscription demanding the prayers of the worshippers for the soal of certain persons who had departed this life mr crump who appeared in support of the application said that tho original application bad been withdrawn and an amended application oreitting from the proposed inscription the words in question had bcen made and was un opposed the chancellor said that that was so and that the faculty had been decreedthe rev john ord late rector of st
