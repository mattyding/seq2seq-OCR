the francorussian fetesdiarseilles oct admiral avellan and his officers were a little late in leaving lyons last night and the first train which was timed to arrive here at  minutes past  this morning did not enter the station until  minutes to  the second followed it exactly a quarter of an hour after wards an enormous crowdl filled all the avenues leading to the station the platforms of which were kept by troops as each train came up the custom house band played the russian hymn and the few people who had been admitted to the station cheered voci ferously the first train contained the junior officers and a number of french journalists all of whom in spite cf the earliness of the hourwere in evening dress the civic authorities who uith the field officers of the garrison awaited the ruesians were similarly habited and although of course they were only obey ing the customs of their country they all looked particularly uncomfortable there are still some things which we manage

of red velvet and gold through this room the visitors after tho municipal and pre fectoral officials had been introduced to them passed to the carriages which were drawn up in the courtyard outside there they were greeted with renewed bursts of cheering and with the playing of the  marseillaise the crowd here is the most democratic which i have encountered in france and although it is fully as enthusiastic as that of lyons orof toulonit is certainly less formally deforential to rank and uniform but the genuineness and cordiality of its welcome were not to be doubted the admiral and many of his officers came out from the station bareheaded and scarcely put on their caps during their subsequent progress through the city the route followed was by way of the boulevard de la liberte
