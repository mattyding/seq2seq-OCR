the taub uguberryi feom our bpecial correspondenttoulon oct the magnificent battleship jaureguiberry which is to bo lanncbed on friday october  from the yard of the forges et chantiers de la diediterranee at la seyne near toulon in tho presence of an assemblage such as rarely attends even the most important public function bears tho name of the grest french admirml who at the ago of  died in  aind whose son at this moment commands the firstclass cruiser alger in tonlon itoads the ship which when completed will rank among the most powerful vessels of thoe french navy and is sister to the charles martel launched in august last and the lazare carnot now nnder con struction at the governmentyard atle mourillonacross the bay was laid down on november   and has been therefure not quite two years upon the stooks no french battleship of the frst class has hitherto been built with anything approahing to the same celerity the plans were drawn by m lagane a naval constructor to whom brazil owes the solimoes spain the pelayo chili the capitano ilrat and france several warvessels of the most modein and efflcient types the new ship marks the latest and most perfect developments of ideas which were first adopted for the pelayo launched in  and which were improved upon in the designs of the capitano prat aunched in and i am very doubtful whether it can be truthfully said that we possess zany battteship that is upon the whole equally formidable the jaureguiberry as yet has very little of her armour on her and being also without guns engines or fittings pro bably weighs no more than about o tonsbut when completed for sea and loaded to her normal waterline she will displace  tons of water and will therefore rank in size wilth our trafalgar or nilo with which i shall presently more closely com pare her her lines are so fine and so different from those of the majority of french battleships that she looks rather like a fast cruiser than like a ship of the line the stem gently curving outward as in the case of most of our own vessels of late date falls altogether to recall the characteristic boottoe form of the bows of the majority of french ironclads  and the forecastle instead of being  a plage is not only high but actually a deck higher than the after part of the ship the problem which was nndertaken by the designer was to combine in a vessel of less than extreme size great speed with high sunpower and as complete protection as it was possible to give  and i venture to think that m lagane has solved his numerous diffi culties in a remarkable mannerthe ship is ft long by ft in broad and from the keel to the upper deck measures ft in the draught aft will be ft in two triple ex pansion engines will each drive a manganese bronze screw and steam wvill be furnished to them by  groups of bvilers of the allest and lagrafel type tested to b pressure with natural draught a totai of horse power ss contracted for this will give a speed of about  knots with forced draught end a development of horse power the speed should somewhat exceed g knotshe guns are arranged exactlyas in the capitano prat though they are of course of much heavier calibre the main armament consists of four big guns disposed lozengewise each in a separate covered turret those on the quarterdeckand fore castle are each  in ton guns those on the beams are on sponsons and are each loin ton guns all the other guns are quickfiring ones on either side a little astern of the forward turret and again a little forward of the after turret is a small turret containing a pair of oin ton guus in addition there are on the upper deck and super structure and in the tops on the two military masts four in  sin and eight in guns there are also six torpedo ejectors of which two are submergedihe armour includes a in endtoend belt at and below the waterline this is brought do wn forward to the level of the point of the ram and s sur mounted by a belt of n armour which protects the slope and edges of the armoured deck this deck which is of steel is in thick and the armoar of the large turrets is carried right down to it the principal turret arnmcur has a thickness of in the oin guns are behind in armour ail the eight turrets aro constructed upon id laganes balanced system and no matter the direction in which they may bo trained the trim of the ship is not appreciably altered this is an important im provement which i hope may be adopted in our next turretshlps i recollect during the last manceavres noticing how very markedly the ileubovv heeled over when her two ton guns bappened to be trained simultaneously on one beam the heel was sufficient to raiso the armour on the other side entirely out of the water anai to expose the ships un protected bottom to any light guns which might be brought to bear upon it such a state of affairs woald especially in a fleet action be a dangerous source of weakness and since m lagane has shown how it may be avoided without making any material addition to the weights i trust that onr national pride iwill not prevent us from utilizing his invention the entire armour or the jaurguibesry mill weigh nearly  tons and will cost about £ whicb is roughly the price of a large secondclass cruiser or of a fast atlantic steamer of the best type the normal coal capacity is  tons hut it can be if necessary considerably increased the complement will be  officers and mena remarkable feature of the jaureguiberry will be the extensive use of electricity ap a motive power it will move the turrets raise the ammunition and do much other work which in the majority of modern ironclads is done by steam or by pneumatic or hydraulic power it will also of course light the vessel the ship will contain  incandescent lights and there will be siz very powerful miangin search lights the total cost will it is estimated be about £ the following is a comparison of some of the leading details of the jaucguiberry with those of certain modern battleships of about the same displacement belonging to other powersrpartw alnd local onlyit is trce that the weight of broadside of the jaurguiberry will be less tban that of any of the ships with which she is compared on the other hand she is so arranged that she can fire two sin one in four  io two in six isin and four in guns simultaneously at any point on either beam and can bring to bear upon any point ahead or astern one  sin two in and four iin besides smaller guns in this respect as well as in the important quality of speed and in general com pleteness of protection she seems to be greatly superior to the other vessels
