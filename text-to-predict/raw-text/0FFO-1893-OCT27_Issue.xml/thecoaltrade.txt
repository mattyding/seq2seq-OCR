present and mr pickard mp was in tho chair mr elliss letter was laid before the meeting and was regarded as a proposal for a joint conference on much the same terms as were put forward in the resolution passed at the last general conference of tho misers federa tion  but as the subcommittee had no power to come to any decision on the subjeeb it was now resolved to bring the question before a full meeting of the executive board to be called without delay little doubt seems to be felt that the joint conference will then be arranged and strong bopes are already expressed that a setÂ£lement

by want of foodthere  was a rather lively debate at yesterdays meeting of the liverpool city council in reference to the loan of liverpool police to st helens on account of the colliers riots some of the labour representa tives finding fault with the arrangement mr kelly irish nationalist and labour representative asked why police had been sent to the disturbed coal dis tricts without the watch committee having been called together as he had understood was to be the case he had moved in committee a resolution against allowing their policc to interfere inan outside labour dispute mr brownbill liberal who was in eharge of the committees proceedings said that the apphcation vas made by the mlayor of st helens to him in the absence of the chairman it required im mediate attention and he took upon himself the responsibility of sending the constables especially after the statements slr asquith made as to the steps that should be taken for the preservation of good order in st ehelens and other disturbed districts alderman a b forwood congratulated mr brownbill upon his action t would not do for liverpool to stand aside in such a matter especially when tbeirrefusal might bave led to the introduction of the military there and the attendant dangers the lord mayor said bmr iarownbill consulted him and bearing in mind mr asquiths words as to the desirability of relying more upon the civil than the military forces he at once eudorsed the application and thought it was quite proper for mr brownbill acting for the watch com mittee to order the police to be sent to st helens at once mr taggart labour said he did not believe in sending either police or military to overawe those on strike and take the part of the masters alder mau huahes c was surprised that even one member of thc council expressed such views did mr taggart mean hat the men on strike were to have the opportunity by wilful destruction to gain their end  sr tagart no that was the logical conclu sion of the speech it wasamost merciful course even in the interests of the men themselves to send the constabulary the town clerk in reply to sir taggart said the bmayor of st heleus was re sponsible for the cost incurred mr brownbill said smr hornby took the opinion of the committee on the general question add there was only one dissentient hear hear the general proceedings were con firmedthe bishop of shrewsbury presided yesterday at staffurd at a joint meeting of the stafford and stoke archidiaconal conferences referring to the coal strike he said it had been assumed that the clergy because tney had not raised their voice on the matter vcre on the side of the capitalists but that was nnt so and itwvas because their imperfect acquaintauce with the details of the dispute made it impossible for them to take other than a neutral position in the matter if it was as st james saidthe hire of the labourers is kept back by fraud they would not be doing their duty if they did not stand by the oppressed but such was not the gues tion and they were incompetent to pronounce odg ment the clergy could however in general terms say to the masters  give your servants that which is just and equal  to the servants  be obedient to your masters they could also let it go forth from that meeting that they grieved at the widespread suffering caused by the dispute and that a serious responsibility rested on those who any longer refused to make concessions which would insure peace such as that which had been recommended by several chief magistrates of northern towns the followidg resolution proposed by the rev a h talbot rector of church eaton and seconded by mr w mlunn a working man of wvolverhampton was adopted   this conference of staffordshire churchmen lay and clerical cannot but exdress the deep sofrow with which it views the great laatgers moral and materialof the continued struggle between coalowners and coalgetters the conference tenders itg deepest sympathy to the innocent sufferers from the results of this industrial war and it prays that almighty god who sitteth on the throne and judges right may so rule in the hearts and minds of all men of authority and influence that no efforts may be wanting to terminate this disastrous confiettee agent of the lothian miners federation received yesterday a letter written on behalf of the coalmasters association in blid and east lothian intimating that if the miners of the lothians persist in their four days policy the masters will be forced to adopt stringent mneasures for their own protection a reply is awaited before any action is takena correspondent writes  mr lockett the champion of the coalmerchants in london recently stated in the public press that the depression iu the coal trade which produced the present crisis was due to the advance in the rate charged for conveying coal to london he had to admit that there bad been no advance in the rate itself and the utmost he could make of the increase was the alteration brought abont by charging cwt to the ton with an allowance of cwt per truc for wastage now instead of cwt as formerly even according to mr lolcett this was only an advance of d or d on a value of s per toa the lndon merchants hav stadiousli avoidedmentioning the fact that the coal rates in manydis tricts have been considerably reduced the diminution of tolls on the midland railway system alone from this causo amounting to Â£ per annum it is well known that the difficulty under which midland collieryproprietors have suffered was brought about by the durham strike which led to their generally increasing their output to meet the deficiency in sup plies from durham as soon as the durham nits resumed work they found their markets fully supp jed from the midlandsandthc only way in which they could rebabilitate themselves was to pour cargo after cargo of coal into the thames and self it for what it would fetch which they did the midland collieryowners thus having a largelyincreased outpat to dispose of in a restricted market applied to the railway com panies to lower the rate bat their own figures as laid before the railway managers shiwed that it was by shillings and not by pence that the rato must be reduced to be of any use to them as any reduction in the price of miidanud coal would be followred ux by a further reduction in durham prices the durham owners being compelled to recover their position in the market the railivay companies declined to assist in a competition of so ruinous a character
