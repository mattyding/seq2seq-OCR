personal property to the amount of £ or £ and realty estimated atfrom £ to £ the probate action was brought by a german woman named johanna louise gerdt who with her husband keeps a publichouse at hull its first object being the revocation of administration of the estate of the deceased john franksen granted on mjay   to the defendant as holding a power of attorney from frau buhman who lives in hanover and wax sister of john franksen and its second the obtaining of probate oe a will alleged to have been eecuted by john franksen on august   which document was not forthcoming but the contents of which were shown by a draft of it lodged in court the defence to the action was that no such will ever was executed by john franksen or anvone ncting for him and the defendant by way of counterclaim asked for a declaration of intestacy the terms of the alleged will as sbown by the draft were that  mrs gerdt  was appointed executrix and trustee of the testator that out of his estate she was to have £ for her trouble and that she was to realize his real and personal estate and pay over the proceeds absolutely to his nephew henry franksen  whether born in wedlock or otherwise if he could bo fouid within six months after advertising for him but if he could not be found within that time then the proceeds of the estate to be divided amongst the relatives of the testator who might claim after the insertion of advertisements for claimants the defendant frederick fischbeek who though not related to john franksen himself was nephew of his wife who had prodeceased him obtained the power of attorney from fran buhman soon after franksens deatb and on may   administration was granted to him in common form in the course of april and may advertigements were inserted in english papers calling upon persons who asserted a right to participate in franksens estate to forward their claims to mr f w spink of hull  solicitor for the admini strator hat nothing whatever was heard about any one claiming under a will or about any will till the end of julyr or the beginning of august when a mnan named william wilkinson benso announced to hr spink that in august  he drew a will for john franksen and had the draft of it in his possession that draft he produced soon after and handed it to mr spink and it showed that the attesting witnesses were bensoe himself and a man named herbert william fape who in  did scrutiny work for him benson in the witnessbox described himself as a person who was at one time a law clerk subsequently au accountant afterwards a law stationer and finally  out of business he admitted en crossexamination that he ltd been in pecuniary diffliculties and that he had been up in a police court on more than one oceasion charged with laving b¢een  drunk and disorderly pape his fellovi attesting witness admitted that in august  he wvas convicted at the east riding petty sessions of stealing silver spoons from an lotel  but he said that ho was innocent of the charge though so convicted he stated that the wyll actually executed was engrossed from the draft drawn by benson which was nowin cot and that he eugrossed it hedescribed bensons position at the time the will was drafted and engrossed as that of a  law stationer but admitted that the law stationery establishment presided over by benson consisted of one room benson and pape were the only persons who gave evidence as to the preparation and execution ot the will but other witnesses were produced to give what may be called a kind of corroborative evideuce in support of the plaintiffs case some of them swore they bad heard john frankseu say he had made a will  others that they had heard him declare his intention to make one  and others that they had seen in his possession a docurnent which he said was his will the strongest testimony on this latter point was that of a man named prince who swore that in cleaning and arranging papers for john pranksen the day before his death he saw amongst them the dusty outside of a document which had inscribed on it the title last will and testament of john franksen it was however asserted that in a statement made by this witness to mr spink or mr fisehbeck he alleged that he never had seen a will of mr franksens he denied having made this statement one of the last of the witnesses called in support of the plaintiffs case was mrs gerdt she stated that she had known john franksen a very great many years and at one time lent him rooney which he repaid that she was in the habit of going to his ofice to change foreign money which sailors passed to her in payment for what they had at her house  and that she knew nothing of the will till about august  when benson came to her and told her about it in crossexamination she admitted that at one time she kept at hull a bouse of entertainment in which sailors and women danced that she was several times made to pay penalties under the licensing laws in one instance to the amount of £ and costs and that sbe was surprised when she was told that under a will mr eranksen had appointed her executrix and trustee it was explained by mr isaao that he did not charge irs gerdt with having been concerned in the forging of the will the object of his cross examination was to show that she was not a person whom a testator would be likely to choose as executrix or trustee for the defence evidence was given that long after  mr franksen was heard to say that he had not made a will  that for years he had been in the habit of employing solicitors to do his legal business for him that during the week before his death mr spink was acting as his solicitor that the evening before he died he spoke to mr spink about making arrangements in favour of mr fisch beck who also carried on the business of a moneychanger at hull  that on his death all his papers were looked through by mr spink and mlr fischbeck and that no will was found among them in connexion with his suicide it was stated in evidence that  horses of his died of poison and that this drove him into a very depressed state of mind shortly before his suicide it was admitted by the defendant that in october  which was two months after bensons production of the draft will the relatives of the deceased mr franksen came to an arrangement for a distribution of his personal estate and that in pursuance of that arrangement eienry eranken in whose favour the alleged wvill was made received £ and mr fisch beck £ and further that henry franksen wanted mlrs gerdt to sign a aper drawn up by mr spink which stated her belef that the alleged will was a forgery  but mlrs gerdt refused to do so it was also stated that after he received the £ henry franksen left this country having previously made a statement to the cefendants solicitor wvhich was taken down in writing each side alleged that the onus of trying to find henry and snaking him its wit ness lay on the other the defendant cnald not offer his statement in evidence and the plaintiff did not call for itmr isaacs and mr searle addressed his lordship in argumentative speeches on one side and the otherthe president in delivering a judgment of some length very carefully went into and commented on every salient point in the evidence in the course of his obsarvjtions his lordship said that uudoubtedly xhe case was one wshich called for all te care that could be taken in reference to the decision at which the court ought to arrive it would be diflicult to avoid inferences of criminal misconduct on one side or the other there appeared to be but one choice of conclusioueither the will was a mannfactured one or it had been wrongfully destroyed the only direct evidence as to the execution of any will by the late jobn franksen was that of benson and pape he need scarcely say much about benson having regard to that persons personal history he was not entitled to much credit the same might bo said of pape their best friends could scarcely expect that the evidence of those men would be acted on unless sup poried by corroborating testimony although the object of the wills acg was to secure that testa mentary disposition should be in writing and duly witnessed it would be a hardship if srea vrce evidence were not allowed to be given in respect of duly executed wills which through sorie causo or other had disappeared accosdingly probate might bh granted on such evidence hut before it was acted upon it shonld be scrutinized very closely indeed this case bad been put before the court very fairly by counsel on both sides and he had been afforded the opportunity of having itpresented to bim in all its bearings he could not thini that there had been that substantial corroboration of benson and pape which was called for in order that tho will propounded by the plaintiff should be established while there were various circunstances that tended to throw great doubt on their statement that a will had been executed by mir franksen there was evidence which could not be controverted that mir franksen bad been in the habit of employing solicitors to do bis legalbusiness wvhy then had he selected benson instead of a solicitor to draw his will then on the face of the draft was a mistake which had been dwelt on by mr isaacs with no undue emphasisthat was the misspelling of the name of the testators brother where that brother was named as the father of henry franksen the name was spelt  glosse whereas it was glausa common name in germany though not in this country now benson said in the witnessbox that there had been much trouble over that name owing to the testator himself and that half a sheet of paper was consumed in the endeavours to get it right cculd that be believed  having regard to the fact that the testator was in the habit ot writing both in the germin and the english texts and had written the name correctly when addressing his brother by letter was it likely that he should have had any difficulty about it in august  when having his will prepared or was it not more likely as put by mr isaacs that benson spelt the name mu accordance with the way ib sounded to him on some occasion when he heard mr franksen pronounce it  the learned counsel bad also commented on the cir cuntstance and worthy of note though less important that in the will the plaintif was describtd as  mrs gcrdt though mr franksen had been heard to call her johanna whether hienry franksen had any hand in the manufacture of the will was not shown  but his opinion of its chances might be gauged by the fact that he took  as bis share of the estate whereas if the will were a good one he would be entitled to be twecn £ and£ as totheallegeddestruction of the engrossed willhe could not come to the conclu sion that there had been any destruction mr spink who had no interest in the matter eamined all the deceased mans napers immediately after his death as did also mr fischbeck both swore that there was no will among them true prince swore that on the previous day he saw a document amongst them entitled last will and testament of john franksen bot having regard to the statement which prince was svwosn to have made and which the court believed he had made as to having seen no will he could not rely on princes evidence he pronounced againszlthe will propounded by thc plainti and prononuced a declaration of intestacy and he directed that the letters of administration he reissued to the defendant there would be costs against the plaintiffthr uinivepsal barbel company luted the first meetings of the creditors and shareholders of this company were held yesterday at careystreet wc before mr a s cmlly assistant receiver having called over the proofs the chairman reported that the company was formed in september  to acquire nnd develop certain inventions relatingto the manufacture of barrels boxes c from pulp the official receivers observations have already been published the accounts showed unsecured debts £ out of a total indebtedness of £ and against that the assets were valued at f but inasmuch as they were all covered by debenturesthere was apparently nothing available for the un secured creditors the account with the coatribn tories showed a deficiency of t the company was formed to aequire patents and to promote a subsidiary company to develop the business therewere negotiations entered upon to carry out the idea but they did not appear to have been proceeded with he thought that however much the creditors might dissapprove the way in which the business had been carried on it was only fair to the directors to state that they had undoubtedly had the courage of their opinions and had advanced sums amounting to over £ for the purposes of the company according to their statements they estimated that it would cost something like £ to prove the valae of the patents and they went to allotment on a subscription of only  lvhether they were justified in so doing was a questior to be decided hereafter the deficiency account showed that whilst the gross sales of the business only amounted to £ and the stock in hand at the date of the windingup order was only valued at £ a sum of £ was expended in stores and materials and the companyhad paid out £ iu salaries and wages the contract for the purchase of the patents hnd not been carried through consequently the patents had reverted to the vendors mr d h iavigdor a director explained that the the difference in the purchases and sales was due to the fact that the company was distinctly an experi mental one dnring the first two years the experi ments were not crowned with success and the goods manufactured proved to be failures and unsaleable further tbousands of barrels were given away as samples it was true that the directors went to allotment on a subscription of £ but they under tookand had since carried out such undertaking to take up neaily the whole of the share capital instead of drawing any money out of the company for salaries or fees they had invested considerable sums in the business with a view to helpint it foroward for the information of the creditors he begged to state that negotiations were pending for the recon struction of the company and the continuance of the business and if those steos were carried oat a sub stantial sum would be
