ithe institute of painters inoilcolourat the end of this week tho autumn picture eason sets in with its usual violence and mul tifarious shows are leing provided at the insti tute at tho british artists and at six or seven of the private galleries it is not to be assumed from this that tho demand for works of art is particularly active on tho contrary if one is to believe the gossip of the studios and the gal leries the pressuro of hard timesis not yet re moved and the public still shows an irritating amotnt of selfdenial as regards the purchase of pictures but there arethe artists and wvhat can they do but paint  tho oil institute vwith its fine galleries in piccadilly as full as ever is a proof that the painters have at least been energetic and industrious and the same lesson will doubtless be learned from the other galleries that will be open in a day or two here at the institute we have  pictures by members and  outsiders andif there isnothing of astonish ing escellence there are very many highly competent examples and not a few on which it is possible to dwell with real pleasure mlost of them are small in size for it is the praise worthy practice of the council to encourage the production of what are called cabinet works the assumption being that the larger pictures are reservedfor theacademyorthe other summer exhibitions if the truth must be told in at least three cases out of four tho cabinet works are much better than thoso which are commonly called importantfor there is somethingin the restraining influence of a small canvas which so to speak drives the artist in upon himselfmakes him think more and allows him to waste less energy in appealing to the gallery take for exuample one of the best things here mr tom grahams  tho landing stage   an ex collent little gray picture that forms one of the attractions in the central gallery it is a repe tition of or a first study for a much larger picturo lately shoifn at barlington houseand it isin every waymore satisfactorybetter espressed andmore possessedwith a feelin fornature mr thofne waite again in the little canvas callednl ew mown hay   says what he has tothout any nvste of effort and the manner in which all the elements of the scenetho hay makers the heaped grass and the sunny dis tanceare brought together within the small limits of the canvas is little short of masterly we are not sure too that we have ever seen so successful a portrait groap from mr shannon as that which he gives us of his wife and child and this because there is space enuugh for what is essential and no morethe first wall in the first room has a number of capital esamples of these small pictures mr cherallier tayler well known for his large pic tures of newlyn life showsv quite an unexpected power in this direction his  villago corner  and to a less degree his  asters   aro briuiant and hihlyfinished little pictures of flowers agaiust thito walls which alnost emulate the high finish of mir aimatadema froma mr ivaltor osborne the painter of irish street scenes we have learnt in the last two academy exhibitions to expect good grouping andgood colour we have them both in the sketch called in galway town  mr macbethrae burns fruit stall in tangier is a bit of excellent colour and there is charm in the smalllandscapes contributed to this group by mir cyrusjohnson still it must not be supposed that everything hero is of this scale and the iarger picturcs of mir leslie thomson msr anmonier mrc frank blrangwyn and klr thomas somer scales are but afewof thosewhieh might be noticed in the first room mlr leslie thomsons sober landscapes have always a great deal of chann and his painting is full of what artists call quality but he sometimes as here  onpoole harbour   has a certain heaviness in his foliage which inures the general effect he and mr j  pickering to mnention another artist who has excellent wvork in this exhibition gcne rally paint landscapes in a somewhat low tone vwhereas mr aiumonier and mir claude eayes prefer bright effects with barmonies of clear ness that are not too common in our english atmosphere none of the four has ever painted better than in the examples in the present ex hibition and in the case of one of them mir claude hayes his large  haymaking in chert sey fcads   which hangs in the third lrcom marks a reat advance oa anything that we remember to have seen from his hand before if he would only carry the right half of the foreground a little further as he very well might this picture would deserve a high placc among the landscapes of the autumn mir soxnerscaes the last of those we have named is the painter who quite unknown till last may made so great a hit with his dark blue seapiece at the academy his two smaller but yet considerable pictures at the institute show him in very much the same vein with the same power of massing his waves and the same fondness for deep sapphire blue of the subject pictures in the first room we ueed mention but few tho d dolce far niente   of mr frank brangwyn a curious experiment in his later manner ir arthur burringtons  a bribe   and a clevor little picture called privileged by mr ravenhill that escel lent artist in black and white whose drawings in the manner of the late charles eeene are a feature of some of the comic papers all these pictures have decided promise though mr braugwyn is in somo danger of allowing his imnressionist theories to run away with himperhaps the most complete picture in the central gallery if not the most complete in the whole exhibition is the beautiful flowerpiece of m fantinlatour which bears the title  delphinium imperiale we have often called attention to the fine and sober art of this very considerable painter in his two departments of portraiture ana flowerpainting but we do not remember among the scores of his pictures that havo found places in english galleries during the last dozen years to have seen anything quito so successful as this it succeeds in all the points whero m fantin is usually strong while at the samo time there is a ripeness in the composition and a reasoned variety in the colour which is sometimes absent from his work it is with good reason that the artists brother members have given to this capital picture the principal c entre  in the exhibition thero is assuredly nothing that has a right to displace it to either side are rather interesting pictures  the  stone haven of mr wvaterlowr the scottish shore piece  gtherin whelks of mr r ivllan and the  rhino salmon fishers  of mr hamilton amacallunm together with another picture of mr leslie thomson smaller but not less suecessful than tho other these form a series making a good visavi to those opposite the two garden scenes of mr fulleylove that haymaking of imlr thormo waite which wve have mentioned already and pictures of mr w l wvyllie br alfred parsons and the president sir james linton this last is one of severalexamples of the landscape art to which sirjames linton seems now to bh devoting his summers and although they hardly reach the level of accomplishment attained by his fgures especi ally in watercolour they show a considerable
