mr cabson at lowbstoftmr carson qc mp was in the absence of lord randolph churebill the principal speaker at a meeting held yesterday at lowestoft on the occasion of the laying of the foundationstone of the new constitutional club by mr harry s poster mp and mr william youngmanmircarsowsaid that after the long and weary session of parliament throngh which they bad passed it might be thought that members would like to go down to their constituencies and tell them something of what they had achieved if he were asked wbat had been done during the past eight months he would reply  nothing because the government instead of spending their time in passing measures useful to the community at large had expended their energies upon a measure which they knew would never become law hitherto they had always regarded the house of commons as a great legislative and deliberative assembly but this session they had passed no laws and they had not been allowed to deliberate the whole position of the gladstonian party might be sumnmarized in the words  gag and gammon cheers to use words that had been frequently repeated of late it was founded on a plethora of promises and on a famine of performances it was consoling however to find with regard to administrationthat the matters for which the government claimed their chief credit were exactly those matters in which they imitated the unionist policy if lord rosebery was an excellent minister it was because he had pnt on lord salis burys best diplomatic foreign suit and if he had an excellent policy it was because he was exactly carry ing out what lord salisbury said he ought to do cheers tho late governraent were denounced because they adopted coercion in ireland but mr morley confessed the other day in the house of commons that in  or  months he hab suiprcssed  rneetings that were hd to intimidate peo ce in taking this course he was doing nothing mere than what was right ho had in reality gone over to dnublin castle in an old suit of mir blalfours laughter and cheers some time ago the cryremcmber mtitcheistown  was raised because certain measures hd been taken to put donn serious disorder mir asquith when he found people makling a noise and burning a colliery had very little hesitation and properly so in sending troops to the scene of the outbreak in the interests of law and order one matter for which mir asquith has been blamed was the nonrelease of political prisoners whose methods were themethods of dynamite itacemed somewhat inconsistent that mlr asquith should keep these dynamitersin gaol whilekeremained inofice with the assistance of mden who as was proved bytbe parnell commission had been in league with some of the prisoners themselves as to the future action of the gladstonian party with regard to ireland they had been placed in a rather tight corner by reason of the action of the house of lords there were two courses open to them but they did not knowv exactly wfhat to do they could proceed at once to abolish thu house of lords which was easier said than done  or they could appeal to the country which was the very last thing they would do laulghter and cheers he would not obje¢t to their going to the country but be would just as soon that they should not because so long as they remained in offlce we should not hatve home rule laughter if they would only join with the ujnionists in passing useful measures they might yet carry out the functions which they were sent to the house of commons to perform what he objected to was their going about the countr making false statements with reference to the hfouse of lords and pretending that the uniiouistswcreputting forward a ease respecting that house which had never been put forwardl at nil he had never heard it said byhbis party that the house of lords had a right to compel dissolution iwhat they said wes thisthat the house of lords had a right to see that the will of the people was carried out the will of the english people was certainly against home rule the government re p lied  you are wrong the people are against the house of lords if this were the case he answered that they had the remedty in their own hands let them a ppecal to the people cheers yet again they had heen told that home rule blocked the way but whiat right had the government to allow it to remain when the country was crying out for legisla tion on various matters  it was upon that very pint formn that sir william harcourt told them the tvry party were going to stew in paiaiellite juice it bad since been a very pleasinlg spectacle on the door of the house of comzmons to see him wallowing in par aellite juice of his own creation with regard to everything raised on behalf of the loyal minority whether it was deemed reasonable or unreasonable the members of the goverunment went through the pitiable process of looking across to the irish benches and a nod from mir sexton settled the point it was not mir gladstone or mir mlorley who conducted thu bill but ilr sexton and his supporters mr asquith was prepared to make a great concession by allowing a second chambef to bo set up in ireland  in order that panic in ulster might be allayed mir carson denied that fair treatment wvould bo obtained for the landlords and protestaut poopulation of ireland by the provision of a second chamlber elected upon a £ franchise and said that every ulsterinan wzould hc opposed to it
