bubmaan address was delivered yesterday at the offices of the london chamber of commerce eastcheap by mr el f hertz assistant superintendent of barma police and civil officer of various columns engaged on the barmachina frontiers and in the shba states on  the commercial future of burma and possiblo railway extension towards china sad india sir a k rolut mp president of the chamber occupied the chair and among those present were mr s s gladstone mr m mowatt mir j chainbers mr perry white mr montage j pattye mir a gilflllan mr g n eooper mr j annan bryae mr hyde clarke baron g de renter and ma kenric b murray the secretarymr hertz said he had great pleasure in addressing them on a subject which cbuld not fail to elicit their sympathy and that of all who had at heart the main tenance and further development of our commercial prosperity more especially as with the late events in siam it behoved us to be more than ever watchful lest we found ounrselves hopelessly handicapped in the struggle to secure that important market of the future southwestern china the possession of which might open up to us enormous advantages when once a regular line or linesof communication between the sca and southern china had been established there would be comparatively little or no diflicalty in spite of the chinamans aversion to the foreigner in securing yunnan which was coterminans with upper burma ns a now fieid for our trading enterprise at all events we might rest well assured that the french who by their recent successes in siam had obtained the command for trading purposes of a large and fertile tract of country would not be slow to push this advantage to the utmost nor unless they were wilfuuy blind to their oxvn interests would it be long before we heard of their being busily engaged in con stracting stone roads and railways without which the commanding influence they had just acquired over siam the immediate neighbour of bua would be lmost if not entirely valueless in referring to the peopfe and productsof burma its resources and reqinrements and its commercial capabilities mr eertz stated that wider he wise adminmstration of our officials upper burma was fast acquiring a degree of prosperity it never enjoyed under thebaw and his predecessors he then alluded to the importance of constructing good roads and railways particularly in upper burma as regarded the latter two rottes were available which if sufficient enterprise were shown ip their construction were certain to prove of the greatest value to us in the futare he was satisfied that a line from moulmein through to zimmes to the mekong which it would strike a little north of the th parallel of latitude and up the right bank of that river to the chinese frontier a distance approxi mstely of  miles was quito feasible nto doubt dhe engineering difficulties would be considerable and its construction would need a large amnoant of capital but with the vast market of southwestern chinawhich was capable of any amount of develop mentat one end of the line and a host of enterprising british merchants at the other there could dbe no doubt of the ultimate financial success of such a scheme especially when it was borne in mind that our trade with northern and eastera siam which was capable of being still further extended would consti tute another important factor in insuring that success he imagined that our neighbours and rivals in indo china the french would experience no small amount of difficulty in successfully competing with us for the commereial supremacy over this part of asia if the line he hsd indicated were once constructed the second of the two routes in question which would in time prove of considerable commercial importance was the one from mandalsy to the kunlong ferry on the chinese frontier and he believed he was right in stating that a railway along this route would before long be an accomplished fact there was still another trade route to china further northnamely the one which started from bhamo which might be called the bhamomomein route but he did not con sider that the trade on this line was capable of any very great development reverting to the maulmein zimme eailwny to the chinese frontier heremarked that the new treaty just concluded betwete france and siam did not in his opinion offer any impedi ment to its construction as the line approached tho mekong it would enter tho british territory the shan state of kiangtung while previously to reach ing this point it would be well without the kilo mter tract west of the mekong which was practi cally the western limit of territoryunderfrenob inlu ence he held i connexion with the development of trade between china and burma that the policy of the british government towards the former bhonld he of a conciliatory character every effort should be made to promote free intercourse between china and this easternmost portion of our indian empire the greatest obstacle to the further development of tho trade and commerce of burma and the shan states was the sparsity of their population and he snmgested that every inducement should be held out to chmnamen to settle in burma there were other schemes for the extension of a bnrmese railway system wvhich must not be lost sight ofalthough the lines he had referred to as necessary for the establishment of direct and independlnt communication with yunnan must be looked upon as claiming our first afteution the rangoonlandalay railwiay had ilready done much to open up the country and its extension from sagaing to iogounghich was nerlycompletewould be attended with still greater beneficial results locally this extension would bring us within about  miles of the brahmaputra valley in assam and by this means a junction might ultimately be cffected between our burmese and indian railways he however con sidered that the best ronte to be followed in con structing a railwaya commercial nid not a strategic onefor the exchange of indian and burmese produce would be from bengal along tho arrakan coast touch ing chiagong and akyab and crossing the arraan yoma hills by the aong pass and having its termina tion at thauetmayo on the river irrawaddy during the ten years precedming the aunexation of unper burma lower or britishburma as it wis then cafed doubled its revenue raising it to not far short of Â£ a year during the few years that had elapsed since the whole of burma became british there had been a further increase but not at the same rapid rate burma was st rich country which only needed the construction of a welldevied system of communication by roads and railways within its own borders nd wth contignous states and the introduc tion of chinese or other sbettlers for agricultural purposes in order to extend its trade and cormerceand if we turned to account the advantage which the possession of this country gave us the time was not far distant when the now markets in southwestern china with which we should thus be brought into direct communication would be accessible to the enterprise of british commerce cheersthe cnia trn a said he was sure they all felt mnuch indebted to mr hertz for his address for many years long before the sabject became of political importance the chamber had shown that it realized the intense interest which the british empire had in the eastern couitries mentioned by the lecturer whose statements that day had confirmed their viewson the motion of mr bryce who stiongly con demned the robbery by the french of territory from the unfortanate siamese seconded by bnon dn reutger and supported by air penny whit a vote of thanke was passed to mr hertz
