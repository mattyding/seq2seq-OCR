sense to neutra lize them and that ix for excellent reasons they rejected statutory councils they would bo wise in try ing to remedy a felt evil by constituting voluntary councils these were days in vhich the more they took the laity into their confidence and their connsels the better for both the future of the church of eng land depended in large measure on the attitude of her laity if rightly or wrongly they imaginedthat they had not becn sufficiently consulted on matters which lawfully pertained to them they might be reluctant to support her if ever her hour of need should come the rev a bath paull hull moved that this conference is of opinion that a clause should be inserted iu the parish councils bill to oblige any person who desires to be elected churchwarden after the passing of this act to make a declaration that he is bond jidc a member of the church of england vzscocnt halifax thought they could not lay down any very general rule as to whether parochial coun cils were good or bad in each case it would depend on the character of the clergyman the circumstances of the place and various other considerations le objected strongly to that portion of the local govern ment bill which provided forthe lumping together of pairishes against their will the cizairaan did not think it was desirable in any sense to introduce into the measuro a clause of the kind described in the rev a bathos motion it was uito abandon ing the idea that they were the church of the whole pcopl after further discussion the resolution moved by sir frederick dilner wasa carried the other motion being withdrawnthe proceedings of the conferenoc were brought to a elose at an evening session wshen a discussion took place on  mlission work in parishesiherefordspeaking at the hereford diocesan conference yesterdowy the bisho of hereford said churchmenmst be prepared to expeb iduced aiming at the disesablishment and disendow ment of the church in wales and such a proces they knew was avowedly introductory to an attempt upon the church of england but lie was certain there was no cause for faintheartedness dealing with the education question the bishop said they might depend upon it that church schools iu many parishes were in a critical condition and that all the encouragement which the department could give to the formation of school boards would be fortlicoming it would be a grievoas misfortane if voluntary schools were weakened or suppressed they must be preparld however to face a real and imminent danger and prepsredalso to make sacrifices in encountering itxcresterthe bxsnop of ceyster in opening the session of the manchester diocesan conterence yesterday said it was impossible to ignore the great industrial con flict that was going on and though both parties were likely to object to the interference of an outsider y et it was permissible to viewthe prospete of a national disaster as every ones business and to urge that eompromise must he possible between disputants who had interests in common the fime had surely come for wise arbitration proceeding to refer to the parish councils bill he said it contained defects easy io remedy and he had little doubt that by the time it had passed out of the hands of parliamenit it would have been made a wise and beneficial measure there was still however an area of english life whlch was expressly excepted from its operation that which was indicated by the expression  ecclesi astical it was precisely within that area that their discussion was to move today it mighbt help them perhaps to some definite choice of schemes which had been proposed if they realized to them selves definitely what were the main extensions of their existing authority which many of the laity claimed these might be shortly and adequately comprised under three heads first some voice in determining the objects fox which collections were made in church secondly some definite influence in the appointment of the parochial clergymen thirdly some control over changes in church hymnals vestments oaments and forms of public worship the first two were obviously reasonable but in respect to the third claim there was clearly room for considerable diversity of opinion it would be intolerable to leave each congregation to determine such matters for itself for apart from the endless diversities which such a practice would introduce it would certainly be the occasion of bitter and never ending disputes voluntary councils could only be good in the absence of something better any organization to have any real authority must form part of the legal constitution of the church and if it was to have any chance of adoption by our legislators it must be based upon existing institutionssobsequently papers were read by mr t c eroiisfall on  statatore councils  and by hfr eerbdet phillips on volhntary coumcils
