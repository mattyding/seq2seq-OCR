the plaintife is a natural born british subject and as such is entitled to exercise the right and franchise of petitioning parlia ment and is also on the register of electors for the southern division of st pancras in the said county of middlesex  thlo defendant was on febraary   and still is the member in the house of commons for the southern division of st pancras and is the representative in parliament of the said plaintiff and us such i bound and compelled both y the common law and the law of par fament tn present any proper petition to the said house of commons for redress of any grievance beyond the jurisdiction of the common law from which he may be saffering provided such petition is not in violation of and does not transgress any rale of the said house of conimons  the plaintiff did on february   request the defendant to present his petition to the house of commons for redress of certain grievances beyond the jurisdiction of the common law from which he the plaintiff then was and still is suffering but the defendant improperly and mali ciously refused to present the said petition whereby and by reason of the premisses the plaintiff has been deprived of his right and franchise to have such peti tion brought before the said house of commons and the plaintiff claims   the plaintiff also claims a writ of mardamus commanding the defendant to present a petition from the plaintiff to the said house of commons containing grave charges against the master of the rolls and humbly praying that an address may be presented by the said house of commons to her most gracious lajesty that she will be pleased to remove the right honourablo william balol baron esher from the office which he holds of mqaster of the rollsit appeared from the affidavits that during the parliamentary session of  the plaintiff requested the defendant sir julian goldsmid the member for south st pancras to present a petition to the house of commons in which he charged tho master of the rolls sith gross abuse of his judicial offico and prayed for an inquiry into the truth of the charges the defendant presented the petition and the clerk to the select committee on public petitions returned it to him with an intimation that it was not a proper petition to present and could not bereceived the plaintiff afterwards brought an action for damages against the defendant elaiming damages upon the ground that he had failed to present his said petition but the jadge found that the defendant had taken all proper steps with a view to presenting the petition and gave judgment in his favour the plaintiff also sued the said clerk of the select committee on publio petitions but his action was stayed on the ground that the statement of claim disclosed no cause of action in february of the following year the plaintiff forvarded a petition to sir julian gold smid with a request that he would present it but as he was of opinion that it was identical in terms with and open to the same objection as that of the previous year it was returned to the plaintiff on or about may   the plaintiff again sent the defendant the same petition for presentation and the defendant presented it but it was returned to him by the clerk to the said committeo with a letter say ing that in the opinion of the committee the petition was not one that should be presented to the house of commons on february   the plaintiff re quested the defendant to present the petition referred to in the statement of claim the defendant returned it to the plaintiff being of opinion that it was similar in language to that which had already been refused and that it vrould be improper to present it in reply the plaintifr on february  x wrote a letter to the defendant in which he said that the last petition differed from that tendered in the previous session inasmuch as it contained a prayer that an address might be presented to the queen to remove the master of the rolls from his office the defendant being of opinion that it was practically identical with those already refused declined to present it the plaintiff thereupon on may   issued the writ in this action on july   master pollook ordered the statement of claim to be struck out and on july  mr jastice collins afirmed the order the plaintiff now appealed to the divisional courtir cbaffersthis is a constitutional question this is a petition for the removal of the judge as i found there was no power in the house of commonfs to inquire into his conduct i am now asking the defendant to present a totally different petition to that which he presented beforemin justice grantiriayou have got to show that a mcmber is bound to receive a petition whether he approves the language of it or notmr chaffersi submit that my right of action is clear from the decision of  ashby v white in smiths leading cases the novelty of the action is no objection lf an action will lie for refusing to receive a vote how much more ought it to lie for refusing to receive a petition  the question is whether the action is so frivolous that it ought to be set asidemr channell qc and mr cagney appeared for sir julian goldsmid in support of the order of the judge mlr channell qcthe plaintiff has shown no authority for this action there is no duty upon any particular member of parliament to present any particuaor petition if there is any sueh duty it is only when the petition is in accordance with the rules sir julian thought it not right to present this petition because it is absolutely tho same as that which has been twice presented and refused we submit that he has done all he can and that thersent action is an abuse of the process of the mir chaffers in replythe former petition was totally different from this i admit that it was against the rules of the house because the house has no power to inijuirc into the conduct of a judge but thepresent petition prays for his removal and that is in accordance wth the rules of the housethe cojrt dismissed the appealmn justice wills saidi am of opinion that the decision of mr justice collins was right and this appeal must be dismissed mr channell is quite right sn saying that i on demurrer the defendant would have been entitled to judgment he is now clearly entitled to have the action dismissed it is a very strong observation tbat in the th century there is no precedent for any such action i am quite familiar with the case of  ashby v white where a public common law right has been violated a sub ject vho hs suffered from a violation of that right has a right of action that a point which must have arisen hundreds of times has never been questioned in this waythe fact that no such action has been thought ofis a very strong argument against the existence of the right it is the right of the subject to petition parliamnent but it does not follow that there is a rigbt of action against any particular mem ber who is asked to present a petition and declines to do so i cannot believe that such a right as this has been known to the common law when no trace of it has been discovered during the last nearly ears sirce theprinciple of  ashby v white  has ben removed from controversy and the prin cip d there laid down steadily acted upon this is snfflcient to disnoso of this ease it would dispose of the action cither under the inherent jurisdiction of the court or the rules what i have now to say would relate to the rules of the court independently of its inherent jurisdiction it is a matter beyond all controversy jhat two petitiona had beeamiecta hit cta mmatitteeon pablic petitions as not being fit to be presented this petition difers from those petitions as it asks the honse of commons to make n alddress to her majesty praying the removal of the judge if i sm right in sanpposing thab this is all this petition asks for in addition to tbo other petitions how can it be suggested that sir julian goldsmid was malicious  he thought this petition open to the same objection as the others suppose he made a mistake i do t suggest it in applying the decisions which had already been given to the other petitioris to this one how can it be said to be malicious  it seems to me that it would be to permit an abuse of the process of the court if we allowed an action to go on which could not possibly succeedmr justioe ginqtami am of the came opinion this is a very important question the question is whether an individual bas a right to com pel a member to resent anypetition and if he does not present it whether the individual has a iight of action against the member i am of opinion that there is no such right the member is not the mem ber for the particular constituency but for the whole country any member may present a petitiou from any one to say the member is to be made the mouth piece of a libel or slander or whatever the statement may bcis to throw upon a nember a burden which has never been placed upon him no one gainsays any thing the plaintiff says as to the right to petition the question is whether a member can have an action brought against him because in his judgment he has thought that it is not right to present the petition i think i am right in saying that if no member will present the petition the individual can send it to the bpeaker and if he thinks it right he will liresent it the individual tberefore has the meaus of having the petition presented of course there is a penalty on the memberviz that if he does not do his duty to the constituency he will lose his seat it seems to me that the person who framed the statement of claim saw the difficulty and put in the word  mali ciously you have only to read tbe plaintiffs afli davit to see there is no malice sir julian goldsmid seems to mue to have exercised a proper discretion in refusing to present the petition but whether he acted wiely or not is not the question the ques tion is did he act maliciously p the appeal must be dismissedmr justice wllsi wish to add that i do not think that you can mnake a thingactionable by putting in the word  maliciously  if in itself it is not a cause of actionbeforc mit

crime before one of the metropolitan police magistrates and an extradition order was maco ono otto who claimed to have purchased the jewelry from ebstein had produced the articles before the magistrate and the magistrate had nmade an order that they should be retained by the police and sent over with the prisoner to be p roduced at his trial tho terms of the french extradition treaty as

the society and raised a question as to the effect of a condition on the back not of the deposit note given by the society but of the note signed by the depositor at the time of the deposit the depositor signs a note i hend you the sum of s  which i will thank yoa to place to my credit on deposit with the society at  percent interest subject to the conditions and terms speoifed on the back hereof by which i agree to lbidel and then at the back of this were cersain con ditions of which the sixth aud last was tis  with drawals of deposits are made on the same principle as applies to sharesie if the available banee in hand shall be at any time insuflicient to pay all the depositors wishing to withdraw they shall be paid in rotation according to thepriority of their notices then the society gave a deposit note or receipt in these terms  xeceived january   of mr brett £ to be placed to the deposit account with the monarch investment building sooiety at  per cent subject to  days uotice of withdrawal and upon this document there was no meition of the conditions it appeared that the plaintiff had between january lo and july s handed over to the society the sum of £ in sums varying from £ to £ on notes and receipts such as above stated he had on demands of withdrawal received back certain sums leaving £ still unpaid for which in october  he gave notice of withdrawal in answer to which the society set up the condition and it was now stated that at that timo £ was claimeed by depositors and so they were at the time unable to pay the whole thereupon the action was brought in the mayors court to recover the money and in the absence of the recorder it was tried before sir forrest fulton the common serjeant who held that the condition precluded the action against this ruling the plaintiff appealed on the ground that the condition did not mean that if the furds were at any time insufficient to pay all the depositors wishing to withdraw the plaintiff would have to wait some indeftinite time until the society had collected further funds if evei and until all depositors prior in time of notice of withdrawal had been paid off in rotation and that the judge should have held that the condition only meant that if the available balance in band should be at any time insufficient to pay all ther depositors wishing to withdraw they should be paid in rotation of their notices out of such available balance then in handand that those depositors entitled to payment not paid thereout could then sue and further that the condi tion not being on the deposit receipts did not affect the contract after the judgment the society gave notice to the plaintiff that his turn had come and that he would be paid end he then brought an action in this court ani got judgmuent at once but £ was deducted for the costs of the action in the miayers court and that left only £ duemr willis qc withhim mr cannot appeared for the plaintif in support of his appeal and con tended thateven assuming that the condition was part of the contract it did not effect his right of action for nonpayment on the lapse of  days after the notice of withdrawal it was simply they said a rule of priority as between a number of depositors seeking to withdraw their deposits at the same time mr justric chanleson the societys view years might elapse before the depositor would be entitled to payment after  days from his notice just somr ciane£ll q with mr mlontague lush appeared and argued for the society that their con dition applied and precluded the action it was he said intended to prevent the concera from being wrecked in the event of a  run  by simultaneons notices to withdraw a number of deposits amounting to a sum groater than they happen to bave in hand ml justice wbrghtdoes the conldition mean more than thisthat depositors are to be paid off in rotation according to the dates of their notices of wvithdrawal p surely it must or it means nothing effective ma luicz wbisoetaccording to your view if the funds in hand were cot suficient to pay all the depositors they need pay none  because unless they cau pay all how can they pay them in rotation the coubt came to a decision after a long argument in favur of the plaintiff the depositormir justioe charles in giving judgment said the deposit note to wehich the eeal of the society was attached undertook to return the deposits on  days notice the contention on the part of the depositorwras that this document contained the terrsns on which the money was received and held that it only affected priorities of payment as between depositors whereas on the part ot the society it was contended that as tho funds in hand were not sufficient to meet the demands of depositors whose notices were prior to the plaintiffs hid action could not bq maintained that would be a view very convenient to the society but he did not think it would be avallable the society it appeared had funds in hand available as assets and the plaintiff was entitled to maintain his action upon the expiration of his noticemr justice wbight concurred appeal therefore allowedleave howrever was given to appeal  and it was settled

member and cbairman had resolved that lr ellis should be proceeded against for building beyond the line and proceedings were taken but before the magistrate it appeared that the architect had not fxed the line of building and the proceedings were adjourned to enable him to do so and he fxed it accordingly and thb magistrate couvicted mr ellis he then appealed to the appellate tribunal but pso applied for a certiorari to set aside the conviction on the ground that the magistrate ought to have waited until the time for appeal ba elapsed the court did not set aside the conviction but referred it back to the magistrate and in the meantime the appellate tribual had settled the line a little in advance of the architects line end so rather more favourable to the builder but the magistrate made

ascertain what the  general line of building  was and he adjourned the proceedings to ascertain it and when he had aseertained it he made an order for demolition of the houses there were appeals against that order and also against tho decision of the architect as to the general building line and on the letter appeal dr longstaffe sat was it right that he should so sit  surely not for he was chairman of the body which directed the proceedings that there was personal misconduct no one would suppose but there was a general rule of law against any one talking part in a judicial proceeding in whioh he had probably a bias and though dr longstaffo had taken nlo great part in the resolution still he was chairman of the tom mitteo  and though no doubt he bad not been guilty of any conscious

exrected that such a liaieon could continue without disastef oveiaking him juries in breach of promise cases would swallow a good deal frorp plaintiffs but hi would ask them to say that in this case thoy wete asked to swallow too muchmr beoow n in reply said that the blackmail existed only in tno imagination of defendants counseland was not supported by a single fact no sugges tion was made against the girls charaeter until the simplc farmer  appeared on the scene the wholeof defendants evidleuce consisted of people who knew defendant well and because they knew he was married the jury

to believe that msarry on the quiet  meant putting a ring on her finger the next time they metrt jrstrclu biatiew in summing up said the case was one of the most repulsive ones it had ever been his misfortune to try the plaintiffs case was that she consented to lead an immoral life on the faith of a ptromise made in a enstonroad drawing room and that she continued for three years to lead that life although here was no immediate prospect of that promise being fulfilled the defendants answer was that under no circumstances could he be such a fool as to promise marriage when hundreds of people lnew him as a married man was there ever s daughter of eve so little curious about the surround sags or the man she was engaced to yet she was not a child but had been placed in such a position as to learn very early in life experience for the manners of the bar werc not those of the drawingroom if they beleved plaintiffs accountand the law did qot allowv them to believe it unless materially cor roboratedthen they most come to the conclusion that a namber of decent people had comne to commitperiur in this case the only corroboration was the etter of december  and on that scrap of paper alone was plaintiff enabled to placc her case before the jury if plaintifs construction of that letter v as correct and it was a promise to marry her in a mouths time why did defendant go on to wonder  when they would spend a christmas togetber and why should he want to  keep things quiet the whole case was for them if they believed plaintiff knew defendant was married there was an end of
