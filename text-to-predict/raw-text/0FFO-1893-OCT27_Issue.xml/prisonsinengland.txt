 prisons iiy england anyd i alesfor the last  years we have had to record an almost unintorrupted diminution in the number of inmates in our prisons commencing with  in  the number had fallen by  to  but in the year ended march  last it appears from the report of the commissioners of prisons which has just been issued that the number has risen to  or about b more than in  and  more than in  is this the commencement of a period of rising population which the reports of the commissioners of prisons have arned us for some years past that we must naturally expect  it appears that twice during the  years referred to the downward course received a check in  just ten years ago the number was  above tiat of the preceding year and in  it was  above the nunber in  a studyof the diagrams which accom pany the report shows that on the first of these occasions the increase was confined to the female part of the prison population  in the later year as wvell as in the present both malo and female population have risenthe prison commissioners iu previous reports have drawn attention to the curious circum stance that since  the prison population has on the whole risen or fallen in direct oppo sition to the fluctuations in the population of adult ablebodied poor in vorkhouses whereas before that year they rose and fell in unison from  to  the prison population rose attaining in the latter year its highest level theworkhouse population fell from  to  reaching in the latter year its lowest level since  the prison population has fallen from  to  the workhouse population has risen since  from  to  the population of both has however risen during the past year the prisons by  and the workhouses by the rise in population of the local prisons is however counterbalanced by a diminution in the number of prisoners under sentence of penal servitude in convict prisons and elsewherewhich fell during the year from  to  or by  less than half what it was in  this fall has taken place in spite of an increase in the number of sentences of penal servitude in consequence of the judicial authorities having taken advantage of the powers given by the act of  to pass sentences of penal servitude for three years in cases int which they would not have sentenced to penal servitude when the minimum sentence was five years inder the act of  nevertheless the total number of sentences of penal sernitude  is very con siderably less than in former yearsin  it wvas  in it was  and in  it was sb the numboer in  was in factless than any year except the two immediately pre ceding itthe large diminution in tho convict prison population has of course had its effect in a pecuniary saving and other ways not only have we saved the very costly colonial convict establishments at bermuda australia and gibraltar but in england the cost of the convict establishments has during the last  years been reduced from £ to £ a saving of £ per annum the cost of local prisons has in the same time been reduced from £ to £ a saving to the country of £ per annum in the two together the diminution of cost has been £ a part of which is due to the diminu tion of crime and a large part to the concentra tion of prisons effected in carrying out the prisons act of  by which  local prisons have been reduced to other public interests have been very materially served in this process of discontinu ing prisons brixton chattenden and woking prisons have been closed as prisons and have been transferredto the wardepartment chatham and portsmouth convict prisons the former closed last

order to remove the disagreeable associations which the prison had connectedwiththe ancient medieval hydro pathic establishment which stood and still stands close by alillbank prison famous in its day for many exciting discussions is to be given up partly for an art gallery for which its site is admirably adapted and in part it is ap parently to be the scene oi an entirely novel and as many think very doubtful experiment of erecting dwellings for the poorer classes by public moneyan experinent which the moverment have facilitated by selling the land to the county council at a remark ably low price tho capital expenditure saved to the various branches of the public service by the gratuitous acquisition of these sites and butildings is of course very large indeed the reports of thecommissioners on the present and former years bring out certain facts as to the prevalence of crime in different seasons of the yearwhich are of much interest and importance from the possible insight they may give into the causes of crime but which have not yet been satisfactorily esplained the highest level of the prison population is almost invariably about october tho lowest january or february if we take tho general average of a series of years it drops during april and rises again during m llayand it drops during july to rise again till october tho number ot committals in the six months beginning with june is more than in the other six monthsthe statistics and diagrams which exhibit the fluctuations of crime during a long series of years demonstrata that their general course end tendency for many years past has been in the directionof diminution  thatthis dimi nution has taken place particularly in those classes of crime which are committed by habitual criminalsviz offences against pro perty with violence forgery and offences against the currency and offences against pro perty without violence which comprise the l great bulk of crimes committed also that this diminution was concurrent inpoint of time withthe development of various measures intended to bring it about and that it occurred in spite of thegeat increase in population which might have reasonably accounted for an increase of crime it is also pointed out that the number of frst convictions has fallen gradually from  in  to  in i which shows that the criminal ranks are not being filled up by fresh recruits it is further shown that the diminution in the younger part of the prison population is four and five times as great as in the older portion which proves that the younger part of the community is not supplying crimi nals to take the place of the older and more incorrigibleit is also demonstrated that there is no such coincidence between the variations in the amount of crime and in the amount of drunkenness as to establish that connexion between the two whih some temperance advocates too hastily assert in order to strengthen their cause the commissioners point out thatwhile crime has thus decreased and the crimrinal population of the prisons has diminished the debtors have increased largely and continuously the number committed in  was  and in  it had gradually risen till it reached  many of these are conmmitted for nonpay ment of rates but the difference of practico in this matter in different parts of the country is didicult to explain in stafford prison z out of  committals were for this causa  in hol loway  out of  in birmingham however only seven out of  liverpool only six out of  and none at all at cardiff or northallerton a large number of the prisons had only one debtor at the endof march last and about half had anderfive only three prisons had over  birmingham  liverpool  and stafford  cardiffbhad holloway the debtors prison for all london and middlesex  there seems reason in the remark that  the applicability to present circumstances of the rules under which this class ofprisoneristreated isopentoconsider ation thetreatmentofdebtors is prescribed by the prison act but the act for the abolition of imprisonment for debtpassed in  placed the matter on an entirely different footing for those who are now imprisoned are only those adjudged to be able to pay but who refuse to do so it is certainly unsatisfactory to see a number of persons who are in prisen because they refuse to pay a just debt which they have means topaysaunteringabouttheirdivisionofthe prison in absolute idleness and affording them selvesout of themoneywhich they refuse to devote to paying their debts the luxury of superior food and drink tothat which the prisonwould supply it is very much to be desired that there should be some authoritative exposition of the princi ples which should govern the award of sentences it is probable of course that persons like the present recorder of liverpool will from time to time disregard the opinions of their colleagues but the large majority of persons on whom is cast the responsibility of awarding sentences would be glad to accept and be guided by the wellconsidered views of experienced and careful authorities on such questions as now give rise to a scandalous un certainty and inequality in the treatment of criminals whother the sentence passed on a first offence should be no heavier than on the third or fourth is surely capable of being dis cussed and settled to the satisfaction of most of those who have to administer the law and should no longer be left to the unguided caprico pf each judicial authoritythe health of the prisoners both in convict and local prisons was in  exceptionally good in the former the deathrate was less than in any of the precedingl years except two and in the latter lower than in any year on record themedical inspector saysthemeasures taken to prevent disease during the year were so effectual that the medical reports from the various prisons are devoid of much interest this seems to show that the obligation suggested by the question propounded by the prince of wales if disease is preventible why not prevented  mightibe enforced by the ex ample of our prisons the measures taken to preuent the spread of smallpox in the prisons which was in several cases introduced frequentiy tby tramps and to guard against its being carried out by a prisoner on his discharge afford an exampleof the care which has been bestowed on this matter and bring to light the deficiencof some of the local authorities from which the public are liable to suffer the medical inspector goes on to say  the convicts may alsd be said so far as disease is concerned to be in the happy condition of a nation with out a history there were no deaths from enteric fever nor was there any mortality from erysipelas smallpos or the other eruptive fevers i am glad also to be able to state that there was not a single suicidethe blot in the judicial system which is revealed in these reports is the large number of persons who are actually tried and sen tenced while insane some to penal servitude no fewer than such persons were received into local prisons vhose insanity was recognized by the medical officers of prisons shortlyafter their reception jiany must have been unable to understand why they were placed upon their trial or the meaning of any of the legal proceedings taken the insanity was very obvious in most cases moreover in nume rous other cases insanity existed both at the time of trial and on reception but was not immediately detected the commissioners take the opportunity of pointing out that this condition of things illustrates the fact which careful observers have alreadyointed out that a large proportion of crime is comn mitted by persons who are in agr eater or less degree mentally deficient it certainly points to the desirability of exercising more control in theinterests of the community of these whose mental deficiency takes the fonu of habitual crimeihe conduct of the prisoners as in former years is shown to have ben generally good the great mass behave themselves well and misconduct is confined as it is in the outer world to a comparatively few some of whom are almost incorrigiblo in the convict prisons  prisoners out of  incurred no punish ment and in the local prisons  out of  and  females out of  were similarly well behaved idleness in both classes of prisoners seems to be the prevailing vice and is no doubt when combined vitb a strong desire for the comforts and luxuries which should be the reward only of industry the cause of most of the crime which led to their being in prisonthe gradual but slow diminution of the per sons for whose maintenance the imperial go vernment is still liable as a legacy of the trans portation systerm is shown by
