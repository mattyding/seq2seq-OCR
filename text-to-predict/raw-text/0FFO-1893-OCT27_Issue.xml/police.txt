inflict betting was not illegal in itself persons might bet at ttttersalls and on racecomses there were however certain places where persons were not allowed to bet persons were not allowed to bet in the streets ned were not allowed to keep a house like the one in the present instance for the purpose of making bets in in such eases betting was illegal and the legislature made it so in order to protect improvident people from being temnpted to bet judging from the appearance of the defendants they did not appear to belong to that class which the law intended should be protected from the practice of maling bets still there was some thing in example aa it was uite possible thai poorer people might be tempted to tollow the example of the defendants the room bad only been used for betting for three weeks and no mischief worth men tioning had been done to pooraor improvident people in his opinion the case was one for nominal penalties williams and rabe would each have to pay £
