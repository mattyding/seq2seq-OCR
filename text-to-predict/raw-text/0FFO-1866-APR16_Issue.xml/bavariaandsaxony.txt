bavaria and saony upon austriaand prussiathe official gazette of bavaria contains the fol lowing when the prussian eircular of tho th of march had shown the danger of a war between ustria and prusia the bavarian government thought proper to make imme diate efforts to prevent that calamity and to prepare the way for negotiations cousequently after roplying verbauy an the tbh of arch as already stated to the question pro posed on the th in conformity with that circular it ad dressed on the bt the follovwing despatch to the repreenta tives of bavaria at vienna and at berlin to count bray steinburg for the former and to countde mongelas for tho lattermunich mfarch sirthe differences which have arisen between the governments of austria and prusaia respecting the execa tion of the treatv of gastein had only come to the know ledge of the kingss government in a conidential manner and it therefore sought to act only in the eame was  from its point of viewv in favour of conciliation es hially ass it coold not aidit that the wvarlike agitation of thpress had any real founnatienbut from the cirerlar despatch of tho resldent of tho prussian council of iministers of the th of march and from the questioti propounded vcrbalu it is true but officially in virtue of that documentwhich question i lave commnmicatkd to you as well as the answer mide to it the lkines goverument at last officially undertood that differences of tho grnvest nature existed between the two principal federal powers that for the moment thero are negotiations intended to remove them and that their solu tion by force of arms is regarded as a not very remote possi bilityv in this state of things the kings government con siders that its right as vwell as its duty in virtue of its posi tion in the confeleration caus on it to appeal with al frankness to the two principal niembers of the confedera tion with a view to maintaining peace and to safeguard the gravelv menaced interests of germany  it is of course unnecessary to prove the fact that the federal law absolitely forbids all war between the members of the confederation the rovisions of article  of the federal compact aro too clear to leave the least doubt on that point and equally with the nature and object of the confederation they exclude the possibility that austria and prussia can be exempted from those prescriptions on ac count of their poition as european powers article  of the final act of vienna defines the means by wlhich all pos sible differences betweein members of the confederation are to bc settled and conflicts avoided it is imposible to deny that a federal state which by disregarding those provi sions should attempt to do itself justice and bring a war against another federal state must be considered as having violated the federal constitution  bat the most sacred possession of the nation and all the vital interests of each niember of the confederation are mot less decidedly opposed than the principles of federal law to a war between its members after the internal liscords and struggles whichl were protracted for centuries had caused the ruin of the german empire and plunged into degradation and miisery all who formed part of itwhen they had made the german territorv the battlefield of foreign arniies and the german people the object of foreign ambition the enthusiastic onion and uprising of the princes and populations of germany broke the foreign yoke and re estblished tbe right honour and morals of the fatherland as a result of that victory the germanic confedera tion was founded and wrhatever opinion may be held as to the ulterior development and amelioration of its constitu tion and of its institutions niobody can deny that it has pro cured forgermany a prosperity unexarmpled in all her nrevious nistory  ifty years of internal peace during which none have dared to attack gormany during which no foreign army has set font on german territory years ofevelopment for all her resources and all her interestsin deuct al moral and materialhave at last healed the wounds of the thirty years war as well as of niore recent struggles and restored germany to the height from which heroown faults had thrown her such are the results of the germanic confedrrati on  by contributing to which austria antl prussia the two fundamental columns of the confede ration have deserved well of the german nationand that confederation is now to be broken i that proud and noble edifioe is to be demolished germany is to be reduced to her former misery  the gerama nations are again to shed their blood in a fratricidal struggle and be come again unavoidably the proy of foreign powers i are there any doubts that those would be tho inevitable conse quences of much a war that conquerors and conquered would be obliged to sgthmit to conditions and to a peace imposed on thenm by foreign governments and that these alone would gather the fruits of the struegle  in truth the nation wlich should be the cause of nsch a war would be soon jadged by its own conscience even be fore history had pronounced its incorruptible sentence but if nevertheless the possibility of a war between ans tria and prussia is set forth so seriously as is clono in the rrussian despatch of the th of march the question may be asked what reason and what object can outweigh the principlesofpubliolaw above mentioned and the most sacred interests and whether tbere are not other meambof arriving at an unlerstanding  there is an impossibility thatthis motive shaouli resnlt from the differences relative to the execution of the treaty of gastein that treaty could not in effect do otherwise than lead to a transitory situation  and now to break up the germanic confederation for somo misunderstanding in the provisional adniinistration of holstein and thus hurry germuany into civil warno ono will possibly consent to that course or dare to acknowledge it whatever desire he may have to place his wishes and private interests above all other considerations those differences must in fact be settled bv direct negotiations between the two contracting parties of gastein or elsm lose their signification by the establishment of a de finitive order in thc duchies  but that final settlement of the situation of the dachies cannot be considered in itself as the motive and tho object of the war for accordling to all appearances there has not yet been any negotiation on that point between the owersin joint possession the most nanrstl course there fore seems to be to commence such negotiations and not to dedrive the federaldiet of the share which incontestably belongs to it in the decisionuls ariderdfoqitdifferent motives  ucless war isdesired for quiteconsequentlv after a serioas examination of the situa tion it is impossible to avoid arriving at the conviction that the danger of the war arises from a certain uneasiness in spired by the entire federal situation and the position of the two chief meynbers of the confederation towards each other and indeed the prussian circular of the th of march indicates something of the sort but if such is the case if the danger of war appears as foreshadowing the revi sion of the federal constitution there can beno justifica tion in order to improve that constitution for adopting the means best calcnlalcl to destroy it in the most fatal mannertf one of the twvo federal powers really considered that for it to continue a member of the confederation was insup portable in thepresent formof that body there would be bfore all reason to inquire whether the feleral constitu tion might not bc altered thu zings government does notloubt that all the members of the confederation are ready to enter immediately into negotiations for that object and to consent to all the modifications that would respond to the requirements of the moment as for tho government of bavaria it is quite isiposed to accede whether the proposal is forwarded by the confederation or whether preparatory rezotiations on the subject take place between the various cabinets  in virtue of those considerations the kings govern mnent addresses cqually the two chief powers of the confe deration anw invites each of them to declare to it that it will abstain absolntesy from any violent attack on any other mecniber of the confederation and that on the contrary it is disposerl to enter into negotiations to maintain the peace of the confederation at tho same timo to point out tlhe mole and the form of the neoctiations to which they give the preference bo so good as to read this despntch to cont de iensdorff anni  to count de bismark and to leavecopies with them i count on you to give me shortly a re port of your missionreceive ebaron de pfordtenuthe same official journal appends the subjoined note replies have becn already received from the cbinets of vienna andl brlin they are both dated the th of april and give reason to hope that

cultiesthe following is tho text of the despatch addressed bv baron de benst to count de hohenthal saxon tiinister at berlin in reply to the prussian circular of the th of march relative to the dispute between the two great german powers  dresden aprilcby my desptteb of the th of isarch i informned your excellency that the prussian envoy bad read to me on the prvious day a circular despatch from his government and i tohld you at the same time what answver i hadgiven i exprossly added that my reply could have only a purely per sonal character since i could not speak in the nameo of the goveinment on a docnment of such importance which had only been commniicated to tno ril rocsome hours later x von der schulenburg having been uly authorized ief t me a copy of the said circular though i am nosvin a position to repeat to him mvverbal answer as ha ving received the icings approbation inevertheless find in the written communication and especially in the fact that the prussian circular has been published a sufficient reason for remitting our written answer through your hnds to the cabinet of berlin however on this occsion i do not think that i ounht to confine myself to repeatinmy answer to tle question propounded at the end of the circular despatch but tbat i ought also to expres my opinion on the statement of motives which precede it i mnust susposo that the prussian government does not in tendl to explain its own views to the confederate govern snents without intimating at the same time its desire to know thore of the said governmentsthe first point is the difference which has arisen be tween the governmnents of auistria and ptrussia in conse qucrce of tle �astein convention as neither the diet nor tbe cofederate gover nments individucluy with the ex ception of the two high contracting parties tnok part in the arrangement i woultd willinglv pass over that subjectbut the statement of motives addressed to us touches on the question of the dachiesof the elbe in general and ar that question still remains within the competence of the diet we consider ourselves called onwbeneyer our opinion is asked in that respect to frankly declare our view se that our silence may not bo prejudicial to the diett w tvill however in my answer restrict myself to what ri most indispensable and in the first place  call attention to the fact that austria which as we are told before com bated vigorously the pretensions of the hereditary prince of aun stenburg bad positively designated at the con ferenceof london in concert with prunia and the con federation that ame princo as tho candidate having the grcatest claims i next tako the liberty of oblecting to tho pagssewhich speaks of tho duchies as of a country belonging to prussia aml austria the prussian goverument cannot ho ignorantthatourcabinetholds a contrary opiuion and that on that foint it is in accord with thin german govern ments i willingly refrain fronm adducing proofs in support of that opinion contenting myself with referring to the over tures which the austrian antl prussian goveruments thouglht proper to make to the federal diet when immediately af ter notifying to that assembly the conclusion of the treaty of vienna they proposed the withdrawal of the federil troops from holstein and lauenburg according to the protocol of the th ditting of the diet in w austria re erredtoher declaration nade in the last sitting on the oc casion of the preentation of the treaty of peace with denmnark with regard to article  of that treaty this dle caration was that ths austrian government hoped for a favourable result from the negotiations engaged in with the prussian government relstive to a solution of thle principal question in conformity with the rights and interests of the germanic confederationprussia on the contrary in alluding to that declaration and completing it further declared that the prussian go vernment also saw with satisfaction in the conclusion of peace the possibility of arriving at a definitive solution of tho question in dispute bv means of negotiations between the two powers and with the pretenders neither the confederation nor the individual govern mnents have since received any intimation thst the two high governments have relinquished that hope on the contrary the confederation must still cherish that wish and in any case the declaration in question would have had no meaning if those two high governments bad considered tho daehies as a country belonging to themselves the present circular of the prussian government calls our attention to the armaments of austria and the menace therebv implied against prussia i feel munch satisfaction in being t ispensed with cotnmenting on thatportion of the cir cular by the note delivered at berlin on the st of last month by the austrian ambassador iu which all aggressive intention on the part of austriaan intention which we never had anyreason to believeis denied in the most solemn and categorical manner and put entirely out of the question at the saime iime that austria engages to observe strictly the stipulation of the federal compact which forbids any mem ber of the confederation to enforce justice for itself we have therefore only to express oar confident hope that to this manifestation will be added a declaration from the prussiau government equally reassuring for federal peace and that the simultaneous cessation of military preparations will soon put an end to a state of disquietude wvic already begins to weigh heavily on general business aud if pro longed wouldm poso onerous obligations on other govern ments with regard to their federal dutieslu the present state of things i milht perhaps consign tothe domain of theory what i have to say on the subject of the last part of the circular but an impartial examination will lead to the conviction that the questions to be decided are of praotical importance and that we cannot be excused from discussing them thoroughlythe federal institutions we are told cannot suppose a serious antagonism between austria and prussia tley have only been supported by the accord between the two powers which has lasted so long solely through the deference of prussia but no federal organization could absolutelv exclude the possibility of such antagonism and of its disatrons consequencs so long as the two powers find them selves in presenc of a common task in germany and the idea of assigning to each of them itspeculiar sphere of infnu enee ought precisely to find its corrective in the lesson taught by the circumstnces which have given rise to the present differences and to the circular of the prusiangovernmentthough wo do not mean to dispute the defects of the existing federal organization we cannot approve of so severe a condemnatiop as that contained in the circular of the th of blaroh we are of opinion that the experienceseotirns niht tnlihnv  rata  rt tion thau hypotheses and apprehensions howeer sinere tconvictions on which they are founled we readily agree thab the military orzanization of the confederaton with regard to the security of germtany is capable of reat ame liorations but we must not forget on the other hand that the security of germany has never been threatened sinoe the confedteration was forrnedthat is for more than half a centurynotwithstanding the revolutions and wars which have occurred in other countries daring that interval has prussia herself if we may be allowel to put the question any good reason to consider herself injured in a military point of view by the federal constitution can the supposition that in any aggression whether from austria or other powers prussia would beat first corupelled to rely on her own strength be regarded as justified bv history where are the lacta toprovo this tho threate inp conflict of  cannot be cited in support of this suppoition for at that time this defective organization was e eisely in abeyance and prussia could not expect for herself the benefits of federal organization which she did not then recognizebit when prussia was menaced with external complica tions had hergovernment ever to complain of the attitude of the diet was not every one ready to support prussia when in s the rhenish frontier and provinces appeared to be menaced did not the confederatiou maintain the best relations with prussia during the war ia the east was notthe confederation atthedisposalof prussia when during the italian war that government was preparingto intervene ictively  does any one doubt that if the war between austria and prussia against denmark bad led to the inter vention of the great powers the confederation would have lone its best to assist the two german states which had oramenced a national war in declaring that it had been un iertaken in a pport of the rights of the confederstion to judge byr the picturo dravn by the government of berlin the exitting situation is very disadvantageous to prussia yet the present circumstances are positivelv favourable to that power for while leaving to prussia her liberty of political actiontho situation has suojected the con federation to the consequences which nay arise how many garman governments had asked themselves in  whetner the struggle against thne indepedence of egypt concerned german interests and why the confederation then assumed aresponsibilit by an arrangement in which it had not taken part and in a question in which it was as little con cernedand again more recently at the period which imme diatelypreceded thewar betveen germany auddenmarkr was not the confederation exposed anew to the danger of de fending the rhine because prussia had assumed unknown to her cofederates and without their cooperation engage ments on the east which might have easily exposed her to an attack on the west  neither prussia nor austria is nor has been involved in a dsmilar danger by the othermembers of the confederation we are at least not aware of any instance and although these latter do not think of avoiding the obhgations which result from that uneqnal situation this is certainly the place to show on whicl side are the advantages and on which the burdens the despatch of the th of march mentions that the interests of germany and of prussia are identical and no german government will in fact deny that assertion the same document quaifies the situation of plassia as menaced in so far that she is not certain of the support of germany but from that statement we derive the reassuring convic tion that prussia recognized the importance of germany for herself in the stamo measure that germany is animated in her turn by a sinmilar feeling towards prussiathat certainly also prevents us frona seriously taking ito consideration eventualities such as the broken strength of prussia or  the fate of polaudthp government of saxony bas acknowledged re peatedly the necessity for a reorganization of the federal constitution in conformity with the requirements of the period and it has readily adhered to the efforts made with that object neither will the saxon government avoid a cormon deliberation on that important subject nor the so lution which may be arrived at we however think our duty to be to express here afresh the conviction i expressed to s von der schulenburg on the occasion of his first com munication the moment in which the family is con structing a new house is not fitted for intestine quarrels by such a course what had been erected may be easily de molisbed but no newedifice constructed if indeed germany was in presence of a foreign war there would then be reason to hope that the feeling of coi mon peril and duty would put an end to all dissent and that under the pressure of the moment she would create something containing sufficient vital force to exist but a situation whieh menaces to give rise to an internal war leaves no bope of tbat result such a position can but aggravate the dissensions between the governments and parties and nuder a violent pressure can only lard to com plications of which the extent cannot be calculated nor the consequences avoidedwe sbould nevertheless loudly protest ifrom that declaration any one attempted to deduce a disposition on otnu part to elude the question of federal reform our intention was only to express a sincere warning if no attention was raid toit e sould take part in the examination and thescussion the question with a tranquil conscience but at the same time with all the energy of our convictioa and of our activitvtbe presint situation and the removal of the dangers snaliz in it by the despatch of the th of march re quires only theapplication of the existing federal lawd which positively guarantee to any member of the confedera tion that sbholdi he seriously attacked the support and pro tection of the whole body the replies received by te prussian government to its despatch of the tth of march so far as they are known here must hrve completely reas ured it by showving that all the members of the confedera tion are perfectly aware of the obligations which those pro viions of the federa laws itnposeon them and that prussia may if attacked count on their cooperationthis view of the situation very naturallyinspired the evy whioh i had occasion to make verbally to h von der be ulenburg and which i desire to repeat before temi nating if the prussiau government thinks fit to apply to the diet the government of saxonv will vote in conformnity with the federal laws in favour of the hiussian demand and will act in conseguenoe in order to oppose the aggressor such is the reply to the first questionthat is to say to the one as to what may be expected from us in case prussia should be attackedby austria on the other hand the question as to what might be expected from us should prussia be constrained to positive mnenaces to make warthat eventuality we say is of such a nature that in principle and in accordance with the fe deral enactments we cannot consider it as possible since however it has been expressed we mustdeclare that we iook upon it as not being of a nature to be decided by any one of the cofederate governments without encroaching on the rights of the confederationyou will please to communicate the present despatch to the royal government of prussia receive cd
