establishment may be said to be on its trial before parliament no disinterested person considers it worth defending except for the sake of its pro testantism lf its bishops and clergy get fascinated with romanism and labour to introduce insidiously a paltry imitation instead of the genuine article sometlhing which at the very best can be regarded only as a sort of electroplated poperythen the conviction wrilt rapidly gain ground that the re venues of the chlirch had better be restored to the roman catholic priesthood whatever may be the faults of irish protestants thev wiil tolerate no dallying with the church of romne such as the authorities have so long winke at in the parishes of grangegorman and st bride the riotous proceedings in the latter clhrch seemed to have brought matters

congregation as he does not consider that there is any principle involved in the dispute an address from his churchwardens messrs boilean and yelford appears in the papers today stating that they deeply regret the late oc currences in the parish church and that they have submitted their views to the incumbent who thevy feel satisried  will cordially acquiesce in assisting them to prevent such disgraceful outrage and con duct they do not say how this is to be done nor do they make the slightest allusion to the cause of the public excitenentwhich was a very siuy miicry of roman catholic
