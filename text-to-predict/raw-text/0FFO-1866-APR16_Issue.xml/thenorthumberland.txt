the lirehuybebplaadtoday at halfpast  oclock auother stupendous mechanical effort will be made at muilwall to lift aud force this great ship into the water our readers w ill be glad to hear that on this the third attempt there is every prospect of complete success the tide it is calculated wiul bef unusual height it is almost a mlatter of certainty that at the high ilood there will be  feet of aater under the ships keel at the sternpost and should the wind hold fom iis present quarter and as it has held since saturday there is every chance of the  feet being increased to  and the depth at the bows from five feet to seven when it is recollected that after the midship section is fairly immersed ia water every foot additional rise takes off a premsure uponi the launching ways of upwards of  tons it is a matter of certainty that a feet tide alone must lift her but though this is known by cal culation no amount of calculation can say to what extent the tide will really flow enormous artificial powers of flotation have tlherefore been devised so greatly iu alddition to au that has hitherto beeu tried that with their aid even a feet tide will affect the northumberland more than a feet tide without themin order to understand the operations today it is necessary to explain that the launching ways of the northumberland over which the cradle slould glide with the vessel into the water have been made on a rather less incline than usual this was done to check the impetus w hich such a vastmass would ac quire if launiched rapidly into the river thelaunch ing rays therefore are for the first  feet of their length only sloped at an incline of one foot in  and for the remaining  feet at the rate of about one in  when thefirst attetnpt was nade to launch the ship she nmoved very sluggishly over the low gradient and on the fore part of the cradle arriv ig at the point where it becames steeper it appears to have  nipped and since theni held her fast and imnmovable the attempts to move her which have preceded the efforts to be iade today have princi pally consisted as our readers are aware of endea vours to lift the stern by artificial floating power and to force the bowvs overthehitchby meansof hydraulic pressure some objections have been takento these methods on the ground that as the stern was floated the pressure upon the ways of the bows of the vessel which are not oater borne would b still fulrther incereased there is undoubtedly a sound mnechanical reason for supposing this butruose who urge the objection seem quite to foiret tllat the linmited area of the slip on which thie vessel is built precludes the officials from employing so much floating power under the bows as they wvould otherwise no doubt gladly avail thlemselves of today however all that can be done in this will be tried by having empty hogalicads equal to floating up about  tons lashed uinder the bows since the failure of tha last attempt the works necessary for the effort to be made this afternoon have been going on with out intermission day and niight whenever the tide permitted the first thing to be done was to re move the huge bilge logs which form the midship part of the cradle and aro connected with the sup ports at either end which keep the vessel upright the enormous friction of these logs passing over those of the launchiing ways caused them almost to ignite and burnt out the libricating grease between them it has been necesary therefore to replace this grease though it involved an opera tion of the utmost mechanical difficulty and even hazard so firmly were the logs pressed down by the enormous weight of the ship that all ordinary attempts to remove them proved futile each log herefore had to be perforated alu over with large holes and the remains then cut oat with adzes foot by foot as each piece was removed thelaunching ways under it have been carefuxlly and amply re greased and new greased bilge logs forced into the places of lhe old beams all the parts of the cradle therefore wlhich have nipped upon the ways have actuallybeen removed fronm under the ships aide and replaced by newe and stronger materials the fore mnost part of the cradle also consisting of the up rightstechnically called the  poppetshas been dealt with iu a similar manner aimd in addition to this supplementarv launichinig ways inside the original ones have beeii built from the bows to a length of abeut  feet under the fore part of the vessel over these also the fore part of the cradle timbers has been extended o as for this length to donble the area of foundation on which this part of the timber structuire is to slide any mechanic can see at a glance hor important are the gains tnade by these alterations the emplovment of lighters and  lumps lashed under the northum berlands stern will be entirely dispensed with to day the expense of their employment was very great there was no uniformity in the amount of lifting aid they rendered and thus while some would be in danger of sinking from the efforts they made others were doing nothing their pull was never a very strong one and most uinques tionably it was never a pull altogether their places therefore today will be better supplied by four enormous  camels or more plainly speakuig gigantic wooden buoys which have been made at deptford dockyard each of these is roughly speaking o feet long  feet deep and  feet wide and each has a power of flota tion equal to raising a weight of  tons tos in all they are constructed from moulds of the ships side so as to fit closely under her bottom at the stern all are of course both air and water tight and all are fitted with large iron sluicedoor so that the water may be let in and allow them to drop off from the ship directlv tleir services are no longer necessary two of thiese  camels were at low tide on saturday chained inder the ship inde pendently of eachother and two more the larestand most important as being the furthest astern wvere safely secured in their position yesterday afternoon the ton small  camels vihich wrere used at the last attempt will also be employed again todav their lifting power is about  tons and they have been shifted rather nearer to the bows in order that their lift may be exerted to the best possible advantage forward of these the barrelswe have alreadv men tioned will be lashed and their flotation will re lieve a strain or rathier pressure of more than  tons upon the point where it is most needed the powver of the hydraulic rains has been increased by more than a third the one of nearly  tons pressure remains under the bows as before to lift the ship upwards but the efforts of the twvo of  tons each which have been usedc to start the cradle are now to be supplemented by two more of  tons each applied at both sides from the river two powerful steam capstans will haul on hawsers attached to the stern and two land capstans will be tixed on the opposite slhore and worked by hand from there simultaneously with the efforts of those on the river boats are to be moored to these cables to drevent their being affected by the set of the tide and thus exercising their strain upon the ship in any way but directly asternone of the most formidable daners coinected with this attempt to launch the ship is the possi bility of the vessel yielding very slowly to the gigantic forces which will be employed to move her in auch a case the risk of her stern when floating being carried upwards by the tide and so slewing the vessel upon the ways would be very freat indeed and it is not too much to say that in the event of such an unfortunate occur rence if the tide fell before it could be remedied the northumberland might becomle a total wreck happily there is verv little possibility of such a disaster though every possible precauition has been taken to avert it no less than three line ofbattle ships chain cables have been fastened to each side of the stern and moored so firmly in the ground as to be able it is believed to conmpletely resist the action of the tide uipon the vessel either up or down the river these chains too are so arranged that each only comes into direct action as the vessel progresses down the ways once out into the stream a number of powerfal tugs are to be in readiness to take charge of her and toow her to her moorings where the work of fitting her with engines and internal equipments will be carried on it is to be hoped that tonight will see her anchored safely afloat if todays attempt fail it is almost impossible to say what more can be donxe
