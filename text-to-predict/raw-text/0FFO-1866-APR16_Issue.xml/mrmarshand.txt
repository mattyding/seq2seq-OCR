mr marsh and his constituentsthe following correspondence has been forwarded to us for publicationto hni m h mar mpsirwe theundersiguedelectorsof salisbury who voted for you at tho last election feel it to be incumbent upon us to express our regret and dissatisfaction at the unexpected ten dency of your recentspeeches in parliament from the un usualcircumstance of your absence at the time of the elec tion we cannot refer to any promise given by you upon the hustings but it is an unquestionable fact that in s  and  you canvassed and were elected as a supporter of a reforming government we do not wish totrasnmel our members by binding them to consult their constituents upon every occasion  but we were greatly surprised to learn upon your return from australia that withont any communica tion with the eleetors of saiisbury under the altered circura stances resulting from lord palmerstons death you had needlessly entered your protests aainst further reductions of the franchise by so doing and by a subsuent speech upon the introduction of the franchise bill we are of opinion that you have endeavoured to aid a asskai and die contented section of the liberal party in their attempt to upset agoverment pledged to eform and have thereby forfeitedthconfidence hitherto reposed in vour political integity and fitness to represent ws mn parliamnentwe therefore feel it our duty publicly to inform you that you must not calculate upon oar aupprt at a faturehere follow  signatures  rutlandgate aprilgentlemeni bave received your addiress and am ex ceedingly sorry to differ even politically with those who have supported me hitherto and many of whom i am proud to call ray personal friends on looking throughthe list of the  signatures i find however that there are some names of those who did notvote for me and of others who splt their votes with the conservative opponent with regard to your not being able to refer to any pro mnises giren by me this is nndoubtedly true a iw have always abstained frotn giving any promaise whatsoever i would much rsather not be returned to parliament than he trammelled with any pledge of any kindwith regard to the statement that it is an unquestion able fact that in   and  i canvassed and was elected as a supportr of a reforming government i must in the first place refer you to my first address to the clectors in  wherein i statd that i held mysf bound tono party whatsoeverin  dia not approve the proposed reform bill and the only way of sbowing this by a vote was by support ing lord john russell resolution although i by no means agreed with the whole this is as every one knows some times a necessity in parliamentary tactics and to a certain extent is the casm at the presentmoment asi should myself prefer meeting the reform bill with a direct neative to voting for lord grosvenors motion in  on the ques tion of the then reform bill i spoke very stronglv against lowering the franchise i should however at that time have been oontent to have had the question ettled by an sl rating franchise which would have hadacarcely any prac tical effect as no one proposes such afranchis at the present time and as it ia well known that it would not be accepted by those who are heartily in favour of lowering the franchise there is no occasion for me to discuss the subject since then i have voted at least twice against mr bainess bill for lowering the franchise and once seconded the amendment on which occasionr my speech or a part of it was published in salisbury on a placard by the friends of an opposition candidate i also at a public meeting in the assemnblyroomus last june at which many of you were pre sent spoke verv strongly against lowering the franchise and oa nte evils of democracywith regard to m rot consulting my constituents after lord palmeratona death icannotsee therewas any occasion for it as it might be presumed that there would be no change in the principles of a government which consisted almost entirely of the same individuals as before i think however that lord palmerston was much too ood and wise a statesman to have introduced a reform il into the house of commons which he in common with al really thinking people rmust have known could never under any circumstances have been paased by such a sub gtantial majority as to justify for one moment its being attempted to be thrust upon the other house of parlilment i need scarcely add as perhaps almost all of you know it already that a arrived in london after perhaps the most rapid voyage ever made by any one to australia and back on tho th of february and that parliament met on the th that the debate on the address was not over until the th and that i actually went down to salisbury on thei need scardolysaythat i made my speech at the begin ning of the session against low ering the franchise rithout cousultinganyonethisyouwilli think inferfromumygeneralk independence since that tine othera have taken the same ourse and so far from thinking that thoy are a small and discoatented faction perhaps the division will prove that thry are not so very em and they are i believe one y dis conketed waith a eforsbiu wlhich by beginting to lere the franchise must in my humble opinion inevitably lead to manhood aultrag ancd democracy in fact it i avowvedly accepted by its best supporters with this view again expressing my
