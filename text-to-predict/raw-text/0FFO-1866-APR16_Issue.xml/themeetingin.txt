the meetiig in dowingstreet itrom the snectatorsine main object of the mneeting of tuesday in downing street seems to have been to auow earl rursell to make a house of commons speech it was a very good speech and as a party speech a very effteive one the presence of his old audience and the abseneebf the lofty serenities among whiom the earl is now corpelled to debate roused him out of the intellectaal drowsiness whieh has of lite been creep in over him and he quoted earl grey and retailed perso esiexperieces and explained his position in a nanner which if not very fresh was at least animated and intelli gible his main notion evidently was to show that the ideas of his bill were not new tbat it was a supplement of the bill of m rather tban ai novel and on ginai measure a line of arumeut which wil doubtless tend tn comfort the souls of tories not being able to accept the reform bill as a revelation or anything else except an imperfect but successful measure which transferred substantive power from the peers to the middle clua the effect on ourselves is not we confess quite so consolatorv thefact that smith has proved a better managerthan jones is no proof that robinson will be better than both the tenpounders have governed a great deal more wisely than the boroughmongers but that is no evidence as to the capacity of the sevenpounders a totally different clas the bill of s is not a whit the better or the worse because it extends the bil of  the counrse of today none the safer because steered by the almanac of  years ago the best liberals do not want an extension of the old one but a biu much superior free from its drawbacks without its rotten borougbsor counties possessed by families or assertion of the false priuciple that representationi is best secured by an arbitrary renal franchise the present bill certainly intensifies two of these evils making the little boroughs worse than before and afrirming the rertal idea in a stiul more objectionable form and it may for aught any body can tell also increase the third a  qualification may succeed and has not been opposed from our side of the discusion but it may turn out to be just below the line where independence ends we want a decent dinner and earl russell simply says that as testerdays was not quite cooked enongh he has had the honour and happiness of hashing up the remains that is a strictly conservative process no doubt bhtt the dodge does not tend to sharpen ones appetite verv muchthe point ef his speech however was the promise that the bill for redistribution should be tacked to the franchise bill by indissoluble bonds a promise received outside with much greater favour than it seems to us to deserve the government savs earl russell in bis most emphatic manner the mnanner in which he would take the responsibility of im proving the law of gravitation or rearrangini juniters moons will stand or fall by its redistribution gill  who doubted that who ever questioned that a measure trans ferriug power from one section of the country to an other was a measure involving the fate of governments  if miuiste rial responsibility means anvthing it meaus that  bhlt how does that remove the objections to a halfandbalf scheme  either earl rusell intends to introduce his second bill this session with the hope of passing it or be does not if he does why not add it tothe franchise bill after the pattern of the measure he is so jiustly proud of and so mztke his bill complete if he does not what right has he to assume not only the power of prophecy but of prophetic legislation  who can guarantee anything for next session  tihis parliament he says shall pass the bill suppose he is dead or apoleon is dead or the audacity of a squireen has as seems probable set the world on fire does he mean that he will uot dissolve oome what may until the bill is passed that if forced to interfere on the continent or beaten on a great irish reform or defeated on his budget he will neither resign nor dissolve he of course intends none of these things and his promise like mr gladstones previous one merely amounts to thisthat it parliament wiu pass onenhalf of a reform bill without knowing what it meaus and no ccident intervenes between this aid april  if he is in power and europo is quiet and the countr is in the same mind he will if he can give parliament the choice of aceepting or rejecting the second and much more important half ie seems to think of his measure as a loaf of which any bit may serve to stay hunger wlhile it is reau a medicine half of which mav be noxious wilile the whoe would be beneficial takce the calomel kindlv he says and the black draught shall come by and by this is inot ood physic and we are unable to understand why hav ng gone so far earl russeu did not go further forget mr liices bygone remarkone which mir euice who was a real tactician would not have repeated nowreject mr brights advice andboldly announce that mr gladstone wold move in committee the addition of redistribution clanses he has admitted the principle and only objects to put it in force accepts the law and only resists its applica tion to the machineryfor the rest the result of tho meeting was ou the whole favourableto the government the attendance was large and the evidence of successful pressure put on reluctaut members was consderable mr bouverie relied on as an opponent of the bill evidently did not know what to saysir ayrton whodia know profersed himself perfectlvsatis fled mr torrens was annoyed but obedient mr cogan brought with him assurances of irish support without price previously atranged mr baxter affirmed that the scotch who do not take bribes were au in favourof a measure the danger of which is corruption  aud a dozen nutineers who might have made a diversion either stayed away or kept silence earl grosvenor is said to have gone to lord salisburys meeting instead keepin however outside the party as a buttress keeps outside a church  and neither mr horsman mr lowe nor lord blcho appeared mr laing and mr e james alone had courage to adhere to their views in the teeth of the majoritv but de tocqueville is not effective in mr laings mouth and mlr james represents rather the conservative than the liberal side of the man chester mind as to mr bright he wat meekness itself and actually condescended to say that he bad not urged the separation of the two bills  with a view to ulterior and democratic reform mr brights secretviews are of course unknownto anybody buthimself and his maker and he may have urged that device with the secret intention of handing the country over to a group of landlords for anyting auy human being can prove  but statesmen are usuallv judged by their words and what he said on d january was this you will carry such a biln much more easily public opinion hereafter will be more ripe to deal with the question of the distribution and when thero are a larger number of electorsreturning your members to parliamenti mean a larger number in the different boroughsyou will have what a mechanic would call a larger lever and a better parliament which would deal more satisfactorly with all questions which may come to fore you consequently t e dilemna is this either mr bnght at rochdale conciliated rrdicals by explaining a subtle deslig which he did not entertain or be is unvw con ciliating whigs bv denying a design whicb he did enter tain and whicb for elf earl russells prophetic proeises is exceedingly likely to be realized indeed mr brighbt had scarcely sat down when mr gladstone stooil up to say that mr bright wished for a dissolution before redistribution was settled while the govermnent did not wishit perhaps lmr gladstone did not know even though earl russell took pains verv conspicuouis and renark ablepathsto honour his special position inthecabhinet telling sir h hoarc who quictly asked wbat amendments the government would accept thatr gladstone would settle that with tho rouse of comnons ve are happy at all events to percqive that the goveremnent has iio ulterior motive and only ask whi as the cherry is guaranteed to the mouth the mouth ahoulabe ordered to nmake twn bites of itfor all that appears one would do anld the fruit is only in lured by the division newt arguments may be producel in the course of the debatte but at present tile only falcts are that government accepts the principle of a comnhsvehensive reformn andlp that it declines to act on it
