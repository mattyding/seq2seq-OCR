resolutions then carried the first was that the present management of the sick poor in the metropelitan workhouse infirmaries is highlv unsatisfactory that the buildings are inadequate and uubhalthy the medi cal attendance insufficient the nursing merely nominal and the general administration radically defectivethe noble lord observed that there was not a single sentence in al the resolutions passed at this meeting which was not distinctly borne out by facts and nothing whatever was stated at that mneeting by those who represented the association for the improvement of thecondition of the sick poor in workhouses which could be said in the least to ap proach exsgeration thefacts were perfectly clear and it must be obvieus to all who had looked into the matter that the terms of the first resolution were fulli borne out by the facbt for the medical attendance was insufficient the build ings were proved to be unhealthy and the staff of nurses was nothing iuke proportionate to the wanta of those who were in these places there wu no hope of improvement beingeffectedin the workhouse infirmariesbythose who had the administration in their hands and the gentlemen who hed their interest awakened in this matter now came before the right hon gentleman to appeal to him as presi dent of the roor law board and as representing her ma jestys government lo deal with a state of thin o isgrd eful at once to society and to the administration of the law wear it was not for the deputation to suggest the mea sure of reform which should be applied to these existing evils but he felt bound to say that no system would be satisfactory which did not include the separattion of the sick poor from the ablebodied paupers and the placing of theick under a distinct management the reason of this sas obvious a man might be a good master of a vworkhouse kut incompetent to deal with the sick sanai iaige uuuner or patietis indeed required to be in aged in the same manner as an hospital was managed by a person competent to classify disease and to bave a special knowledge of caseu those who knew the buildings at present used as workhouse infirmaries most of which hbad beeu erected for a totally different purpose were quite hopeless of any effective improvement being earried out in thesebuildings hearj thegentlemen aroundebiallenged inquiry into the couidition of thoso infirmaries and they trnsted that the inquiry being conducted by the poor law board would be a fl and free one for then it would prove the necessity for a change being made and the pcor law board would feel bound to

reform the system of which they complained by bringing such matters forcibly beoe the pub lic anid enlisting its symnpathies in the cause the best cliance was afforded of ultimately giving efect to

certainly not pregared to dispute the conclusions to which the deputation had arrived and the remedy proposed was he umderstood that there should be six separate hos pitals for the sick at present lodged in the metropolitan workhouse infirmaries the meeting must not lose eight of the fact that such a scheme involved a great change tn the principle upon which the poor were now main tained mn this country that charge was now local and the administration of the law wu in the hands of thosewho contributed locallv to the fund out of which the poor were relieved wherea this scheme would treat the sick poor as belonig to the whole metropolis and the ex penses of rsising te buildingsand maintaining the hospitalsod be charged on the wbole property of the metropolishe did not say it would be wrong on that account or that the system of local management for the purposes of the poor bad been faultless  but the system was one of which the comamunity was extremely tenacious and there would ke considerable difficulty in suspendidg it even in this city where the adoption of a more general system would appear to be so reasonable he did not say that the diffloulty was insuperable and if it were clearly proved that a chadge was euentuial for the proper treatmeut of the sck poor he did not say that it might not beeome even popular especially if it were proved that the defects under the pre sent system were irremediable there kad always been a difficulty as to the hands in which the administration of the poor law should be placed aud the great dread of the legislature had been that there would be lax and wasteful expenditure injarious to property and tending to the pro motion of puperism if the administration was not in the handsof those directlyinterested in the economy of the fuuds and the guardians were chosen for this purpose senme guardian he acknowledged performed their duties with judgment and humanity but as the chief duty which they nad to perform was what ws termed to keep down the expenditure it was somewhat of a chance when ua s were found possessing a the qualities required for a wise administration of the law the right hon gentleman proceeded to dcal with the other facts of the case and said he thought that if the house of commons could be preraled upon to alter the present system of rating in the metropolis it would do so for the sick poor and have a general rate asin the cae of the casual poor w e con cluded amia lend cheers that though he could not pledge the government in the mnatter be could assure the depute tion that nothing should be wanting en his art in recom mending the propositions for favourable considerationthe dieputation thanked the president and withdrew
