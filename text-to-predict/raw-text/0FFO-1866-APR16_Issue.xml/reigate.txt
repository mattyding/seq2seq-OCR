after the committee bad remained in deliberation for about an hour the public were readmittedthe caauruaw said be was desired by the committee to state that the course taken by mr gower after the evidence which bad been given was a most proper one they also felt it right to state that mr gower was personally exone rated from any charge of bribery or treating and they thanked him for the bonourable and straightforward manner in which he had tendered and given his evidence slight applause the committee had resolved that mr gower had by his agents been guilty of bribery and treating at
