from the eeonamttnna ceeate ou lord grosvenors amendment has added little to our knowledge of the reform question and could add little it is a case which could be stated by telegram wec are going to give political power to a class who now have do politfcal power surely we ought to know bowuch power wve are going to rtve them and how much we are not going to give them till we know what the redis tribution of seats is to be we cannot tell how much power we give them everything depends not on the present con stituencies but on the new constituencies not on what is but on what is goingto be we cannot tell how manyseats we are giving to the working classes til wo see the list of new constituences then we can say whether the proposal is too great or toolitqoe now we cannot sayie is said indeed that the number does not matterthat the working classes villnot vote together and consequeutlv that theirpreponderance in a particular constituency willnotffect the members for the constituency the way to answer this is to contrast it with the opposite arguments which the friends of the biu also use they say see what excellent members the workinmen now send they elect mr hughes ir fawcett and it is said mr mill but the advocates of the billi cannot have it both ways either the worlcing classes will rule the places where they have the majority or they wir not if they do they wiu retura the members and may take credit for the goodness of the members if they do not thev must not tsk c redit for the goodness of the members for they do not return them more than other peoplethe plaiu matter of fact is that the supremacy of any particular sort of persons in a particualr constituency does colour the character of the member for that constituency the agriculturistsreturn members devoted to agrieulture the trading towns persons full of the notions and fell of the feelngs of people in trade just so the working men wil in the long run choose members suited to working men thinlin their thoughts feeling as tbey feel at any rate at an interesting time at a time when the working classes have special opinions on an occasion in which they have special interests such wil bo the sure result it may not be always so but it will always tend to be so and the ten dency will be realizel most completely exactly at the time when the peculiarities of the el are most predominantmr gladstone says that the boroughs in which the work inglsses areamajorityaxe fewernow than inl butt it used to be said we think earl russell said it that under the old system there wa univeral suffrage in old sarun where there were no inhabitants and a most restricted suf frage in bath and such places where there were inhabitants you canuotgive members to the working classes where there are none er where wrhat there are rtre hhopelessly corrupt before  most of the mecalled workingelass consti tacncies xere corstituencis which might be ougbt audwhich were bought which might be intimidated and were intimidated under the proposed biu this will happen againagain where there are working classes as in the great towvns the bil ignores and overlooks all other clases it gives this one class all the power capital as mlr gladstone said has been for many a year is the growing power of england and yet in the great seats of capital and accumn lation this bill overlooks the political claes of capital and gives the wholesuprenracv to labourwe say as our readers inow that the franchise ought not to be reduced where as in country towns there are no working men fit to have it and that in the larger towns where there are fit working men some accompanying safe guard some representation of the minority sorne suitable organ for capital and weslth should also be provided mr gosehen said at the mansionhouse that there was much to be said in favour of such schemes but there was one difficulty aboat them they wvould never pass of course the i will not while the most influential men in england thouch they admit that much is to be said for such schemes refuse to say it so long as they support an unphilosophical scheme in the hope that its simplicity and want of pbilosophy wiu carry it through so long as insteadof propoing greatiideas to their time they adopt and acquiesce in the mean ideas of their times if mr goschen be right iu saying that this bill would pass though a better bill would not pass we cau only say that if he and the other members of the govern ment had brought in a really god bill that bill would have passed more easily than this fragment that now he is stooping to conquer that he might have cesquered better withoutatoopingit may e however that after all the bill will notpass we dno n rofess very confidently to foretell the fate of a new measure proposed by a new ministry to a new parlia ment but lordstanley who always weighs hiswords and who never perhans produeed so great an effect in par liament as on thursday night did not hesitate to say that whether lord grosvenors anendment was carried or not the bill would not pass and that a more comprehensive neasure must bo brought in next year where then willthe more intellectual members of the governnent stand they will have abandoned the dignity of hilosophy but not attained the lucre of practice they wi have stooped but they wiu not have conquered
