the rbfobm billtehe debte  from the saturday redceoixne aouse nas resumed the discussionof the reformbill without any change having been made in the position of parties or in the attitude of the government in different forms the old argnments have been stated aud restated and the same appeals have been made to the passions the fears and the hopes of opponents and supporters the question has been once more askedshall we pass a reform bill and the answer has once more een given that although to pass a decently good reform bill would be an excellent thing to paus a thoroughly bad onea mrae fragmentary onesided incomplete billwould be a very unwise thing the great meeting of the liberl party produced nothing but aa appeal to that partb to remenmber lord rumsells services to vote as be wished and to believe that he would take care that no harm should bappen from the bill being read a second time the government by using every means of pressure by satisfying one lukewarm sup porter with one sort of promise aud anotherlakewarm sup porter with another sortof promise hasdone its vervutmoat to secure a majority on thesecond reading after ihatis to come the deluge no minister even sngests how the fran chise bill is to be carried through botb houses when it is taken in conjunction with several other bills on which the governmnent is pleded to stand or fall as much as on the francbise bill thegovernment is always stading or fall ing now it is always crossing its rubionus breaking its bndges and burning its boats it is to go out if the frau chise biu is not carried and soit is if the redistribution bil is not approved  and every argument used by the more independent of its supportersis rmet by the unvarying threat that if it does not receive a blind unwavering upport through thick and thin right and wrong it will go out of office some advautage will probsbly be aerived from this and the government will perhaps get a majoritya majo rity largely composed of reluctant and unwilling supporters on the econd reading the rubieon and the bridges and the boats will then be done with and the government wiiu thinkit may stand with credit  but the real discussion will only then be begun aud the opposition as a mere party manceuvre might perhaps lave reserved their strength vith advantage unut the redistribution bill had been produced sndthe whole scheme of thegovernmentrevealed the debate on thewhole scheme must be equaly loug disenrsive and elaborate whenever it i producedand theonlyquestion now is whether the government shall receive such a condouation for bringing in a mere fragment of reform as wiiu enable it to retain office the opposition therefore might have waited until the real subject of discusion arose but the most direct and effective course perhaps is that which has been taken and if the government claims the approval or pardon of the house for having attempted to treat reforn bit by bit the opposition is entitled to point out and insist upon the magnitune of the mistake that haa been muade and those liberals wbho like lord grosvenor strongly dis approve the policy adopted by their leaders and dare totheir souls their own give an example of honestv atnd independence by opposing the second reading which they could not have given if they had waited for the production of the complete schemewe may take it for granted that there are no arguments anst lord grosvenors resolution except those which are derived from such vague and remote considerations as the duty of supporting lord russell the necessity of redeeming ministerial pledges and the expediency of winning the ap proval oe the working classes mr gladstone made a long a fierce and a doclamnator speech but he did not adducea single argument againstthe resolution lord stanlev on the other hand made point after point in support of the resolution and there is no reply possible to his arguments except that however strongly reason may be in favour of the resolution general expediency is ainst its being adopted at the present crisis that a bill for the redistri bution of seats is much more wanted than one for the ex tension of the franchise ana that it is impossible to calcu late the effects of reducing the franchise unless the effects of redistributing the seat ale taken into aceount is as plain as daylight there is no use in discussing how many new voters the franchise bill would add to the electoral roll orbowmanof the wvhole number of voters would belong to the working clsses or how many oboroughs the working clsses if united could control unless it is known in what beali voting is to go d let is supporeehatif the present eonstituenieswere preserved there would under the franchise bill be an increase to the whole niumbhr nfvoters of wutw the redistribution bill may for all that any one knows increaso this enormously if  large northern towns were sabstituted for  small western towns the total number of electors in the english boroughs might easily be raised iu a most marked manner the more extreme advoctes of reforn think that the government measure is far too moderate and that the working classes even if the franchise were reduced to  would form much too feeble an element in the constituencies who can tell at present whether this is to or not i if the redistribution bil takes away seats from borough where the working men are few and transfers them to the boroughs where working men predominate the bill may be mado to go very much further than it is supposed to go by its friends or its foes then again calculations are made to show that such or such a number of boroughs will be completely under the control of the working classes these calculations are ingenious enough as far as they go but they only go a very ahort wav no one who makes the calculation has tho necessary data a few trokes of the pen in the fraining of a be distrbution bill would double at once the number of these boroughs the fallacy of the whole argurent of the government as to the moderate nature of their measure les in this that they draw their estimates from the present constituencies and reserve to themselves the power of changing the constituencies and so furnishing an entirelv new set of data if tre government openly asid that it made no matter how mauy men voted and that all britons and christians might a well be voters as not then it would not alter the calcniation of constquences very much how the seats were distributed but this is not at all the line which the government adopts it offers us a moderate bill a bill based on figares a biu guarding against a sudden trausfer of political power and then it reserves to itself the privilege of bringing in another measure of which no one knows the provisions which may make the present bill an extreme one entirely alterthe figures aud transfer in a few months the great political preponderance to a class that has now but a small portion of political powerit is only therefore in a spirit of courtesy to the govern ment and from a desire to seem to their constituents to be doing and saying something that members can pretend at present to analyze the effects of the biu now unner discus sion those who like mr lowe object to all reduction of the suffrage can discuss the bill thoronghly for their case is clear before them but thevastmrjoritvof the house wishes to have a reform bill and only asks to know the objects and the limits of the measure proosed this the govern ment declines to let them know they shall know soon but the firtthing is to pz a coplitnentaeyvoteasa sort of testi monial to the government the members for smau boroughs will then bo told how theyure to be affected by the complete measure and will naturallybegintheirresistanco if they find their interests eudangered itwas aslordstanley observed very artless art to suppose that these members would be en tra pod into carrying a franchise bill and then when thev hna made themselves powerless would meekly await their condemnation it was making this art stiul more artless when mr bright kindly explained beforehand the secret to those who were intended to be taken in but the whole of this artless art will be quite at an end when the redistribu tion bill is laid on the table lord stanley however snggested that the ministry may have an art that is by no meaus artless and that those members for questionable boroughs wrho vote for the econd reading mav find them selves rewarded bv their borough being spared in the redis tribution bill mothing is more easy than to dlo a friend a good turn iu such a case unlessthe borough he sits for is no toriously and ludicrously bad and this is a mode of exer cisin pressure or influence that can scarcelvbe detected no onewilt knowwhat changes are made in the redistribution bill afterthe franchise bill has been read a second time and the bargain wmi be made of course in a very indistinct and vague way or more probably no bargain will be made bitt as it is obvious that the members who sit for boroughs that ought to be disfranchised have now a great opportunity of rendering a last servioe to thosewho can make or destroy the government could trust to their calculation of their own interests a more unsatisfactory state of things can scarcely be imagind and althoughgreat allowance mnss bemade for these who think the best thing is at this moment to go with their party and to keep in offlce a emiistry which is probably aa efficient as any party or comnbination could nowsroduce yet it must be owned that the ministry scarcelv deservetobetreated so lenietly and that the mistake thei have made in throwing aw ay the opportunity of passinga moderate and conplete measure bas been a most serious one
