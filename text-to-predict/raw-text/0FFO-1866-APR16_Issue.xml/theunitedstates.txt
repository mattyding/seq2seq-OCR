the united statesprobo ouj own correspondentwashington april the civil rights bill has not yet been introduced afreh into the senate and consequently the poli tical crisis is as grave and ominous as ever the president alono seems to look upon it with uncon cern his remark to those whlo talk to him about it being simply things may go wrong for a time but they will all come out right in the end these are his own characteristic words and to the remonstrances of friends or tho threats of foes he returns no other an swer yet to lookers on the turn which affairs have takern is very menacing the republican party is now almost utterly estranged from the president mr raymond standing almost alone in supporting his policy with a courage only less than that of mr johnson himself becaue it involves lesser risks and sacrifices had the president in vetoing the civil rights bill confined himself to that particular measure the breach might not have been so hopeless as it now is but he went fnrther and swept away all the principles upon which the republican party has based itself and in this he acted against the advice and the judgment of some of the ablest men in the country and now we learn this morn ing by telegraph that the connecticut election has gone against him mlr hawvley a radical has been elected governor of the state and the demo cratic candidate defeated and a majority in the senate of republicana not to say radicals has also been returned mr sumners party will attach great importance to this event but the president will simply disregard it speaking of it one day last week he said that he would rather of the two have the conservative candidate mr english elected because it wonld check a little the confi dence of the radicals but that he was in no wise anxious about the result in this respect again mr johnson stands almost alone in his opinions i believe that the democratic party considered that the issue of this election was a mnatterof the greatest consequence it has gone against them supposing our present information is correct and the example may not be without effect in the general election next autumnyet the president holds on to his course with a directness and persistency which seem more and more extraordinary every day to one who marks the nervousness uncertainty and fear which prevail everywhere else there is no one who does not speculate with uneasiness upon the result of this great contest the president alone does not pause to conjecture but steadily pursues the means which appear to him beat adapted to deal with the critical position in which the country is placed last night he took another step which will enrage mr summer and his party to the last degree he issued a proclamation declaring the states lately in rebellion to be now at peace with the rest of the united states which will have the effect of removing from them the military control at present exercised this is carrying the war into the very heart of the radical camp it was under the theory that the war is notyet endedthat the freed mans bureau bill was passed for no one not even thaddeusstevens everpretended that the constitu tionjnstifiedcsuchameasure itwaapartof thealleged  military necessity  of the times the president has now formally announced that peace is fully re stored and the foundation of radical legislation is gone yet it is my duty to inform you that the signs and indications lead to the conclusion that the country is no longer going with the president almost every man from almostevery state receives letters daily warning him that mir johnson is going over to the  copperheads and that he must not support him this kind of communication between members of congress and their constituents is very common and it infuences greatly the treat ment of public affairs after gathering together the opinions of many classes of representatives and weu sifting them the residuum is thisthat the people are afraid the president is going too fast but a slight occurrenco may change this feeling one victory or two on the part of radicals would probably have that effect forthe people do not want to see them carry everything all their own way it is an intensely difficult situation it isso impossible to get at the real bearing of public opinion in thicountry except by tho general congressional elections that any judgmentwhich could beex pressed as to the probable upshot of the present struggle would be untrustworthy  which way are the people going is the question in everyones mouth and it receives a different answer every day because there is no gauge for testing it the radicals are not positive on the subject although sore of them think they are their aim is now very clearly defined they are anxiousto keep the southern states out of their share of re presentatlon until the next presidental election and if they succeed mr sumner or mr chase will be the next occupant of the white house the pre sent contest however could not be protracted for three years moreas it must be for this scheme to succeedwithout the sound of cannon being once more heard in the landbut it is not in domestic affairs alone that the prospect is dark and troubled there are dangerous and embarrassing questions yet pending with foreign powers and two of them give no slight uneasiness to men who are anxious to see their country settle down to its old career of peace these question ae the continued occupation of mexico by the french and the closing of british north american fisheries to citizens of the united states on the frst of these subjects congress is prepared to be firmt on the second it will be tery illiberal and it is to be feared exasperating the mexican difficulty has been so long beforos the publie that you mayattach scarcely so much importance as it deserves to the fact that near the middle of last monthi believe on the thmr seward sent another despatch to the marquis de mot tholou iu reply to a despatch of m dronyn de lhuys dated the th of january mr se wards rejoinder is very preming and peremp tory m drouyn de lhuys had contended in his despatch that the empire in miexico was chosen by the people and that the french army bad made no attempt to carry monarchical insti tutions in the fold of their fag in reply to arguments of this kind mr seward i believe insists that the election of maximilian was an act without the authority and against the will and opinions of the mexican people e goes on to inform the french government that the united states had seen no evidence that the voice of the people of mexico was heard in the selection of the t soecaed empire  which had been got up in their capital and that conse quently the united states couad never recognize maxinmlian after entering at some length the despatch is a very elaborate one into a discussion of these points mir seward sa i am informed pro ceedsto point out the eravity of the circumstances and the necessity of adjusting  a question the con tinuance of which must be necessarily prejudical to the harmony and friendship which have hitherto alwaysexistedbetweentheunitedstatesandfrancei he then refers to the french campaign in mexico as an act of intervention dangerous to the united states and to republican institutions in the ameri can hemisphere he afterwards reviews the past and present position of mexico and asserts that no foreign power had any right to interfere in trials such as hemr in reply to m drouyn de lhays who had said that the french expedition was oulyan alliance with the constitutional party in mexico and had asked whether the assistance which france gave to the americans in tneir wvar of independence abated from the niatioinal cha racter of the strugglein reply to tlhis mr seward simply affirms that there is a great difference between the position of the americans at the period referred to and that of the mexicans when the french went among them he then comes to the main point of the despatch and informs the french mlinister that the united states will be gratified to have definitive information of the time wrhen french miilitary operations may be expected to cease in mexico the despatch of which the foregoing details are strictly accurate and trust worthy concludes with a nutmber of extracts froia foimer communications of mr seward to the french government tending to show that the united states has adhered to one line of remnon strance witlh france throughout its intervention in miexico if the french government has sent any reply to this despatch it has not reached this coun try down to the time i writethe fisheries question is also one which threatens to give great trouble both to this country and to great britain the unfortunate jealousies of the protectionist party which resulted ia the abroga tion of the reciprocity treaty with the british pro vinces are deplored by every american who is capable of taking a commnonsense view of the mlatter wve have not long to wait for the effect of tihe revival of all the old disputes about the right of taking fish in british waters yesterday a mir pike brought forwrard the following resolution in tbe house of representatives whereas the governors of several of tho british pro vinces have publiclr warned our fighermen from off the fish ing grounds adjacent to their coasts thereby manifesting au unfriendly disposition therefore be it resolved that the secretary of the navy be requested to send a sufficient naval force to protect our citizens in the enjoyment of their rights as recognized by the treaty of  and by subsequent treatiesthis resolution was being carried to a vote without contention when mir raymond interposed and suc ceeded in getting it referred to the committee on foreign affairs bat the danger has only been avoided today to be revived to morrow the ame rican fishermen will go into british waters to fish the colonists wil drive them of and both governments will be saddled with fresh griev ances i am informed that a member of the house is making a proposal by which it is hoped some new arrangement maygyet be made vwith the british proviuces but if this should fail there would be little prospect of a better mnder standing between england and america ameri cans in their present frame of mind are prepared to snap at the faintest shadow of alleged wrong done to them in the name of england and although they have no sort of right to use these fisheries they wllu certainly assert one and pro bably abide by it and it is impossible to say what mischief may not arise and all because mir liorrill and his set have the sway in con gress uponcommercial affairs there is scarcely a man who takes any interest in such topics beyond the interest which his constituents force him to feel in the protectionof their particular local productions or manufactures
