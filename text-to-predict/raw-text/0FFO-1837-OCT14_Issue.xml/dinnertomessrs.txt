chtair easi now give vou the toast which is em phatically the roast of the evening the health of your distinguished aud excellent reprerentatives to honour whose return you are thite day rnee drunk with three times three and loud cheecingmdlr baarssosr do mnoat sincerely vish that i had at my command words to exprtss and adequately to convey to you the depth of the gratitude which i feel for th kinda reception which you have been pleased to give to my name proposed so ably from tte chair as one of your representa lives cheers  it becomes more difficult for me to give xpresion to my feelings when i look around me and see this room filled to the utmost and filled as it is with the respectability the rank and the station ot thib populous and wealthy county cheers i have to thank you for what occurred on the recent occasion of the election in this hundree whcn i am proud to say though i believe it arnoc frcm no merits of my own but from the intensity of your conservative opinions you gave me a greater number of voes than any that had bcen given in the hundred since the passing of the reform act cheers for ihat mark of sour approbation i can assure you i feel deeply grateful and l trust i shall never by any act of my oxn cease to derive the same support when an occasion may require a aimiltr kindness on my part caeers i alluded to the in tensity of conservative feeling in this district and i had a right to allude to it for cn looking back to the contested elections in this county tor a period embracing nearly the last  years i well recollect from iy boyhood to the present time that rochford h undred was always charac terised as being one of the most loyal parts of the county and one in which the general iheling of attachment to the sove teign was only balanced by a deep sense of the value of the cmnstitutot and a determination to support it cheers perhaps some surprise may be expressed but not by me for i bail it as a manitestation of the feelings of conservatism at such a numerous attendance of the clergy cheers as an individual member i give my cordial thanks to tliose gentlemen ot the cleigy who have attended here because i think their presence in a great degree hallows these meetings and tends to show that we are not met for the purpose of mere festivity but that we are met for a more hallowed andt mnore important purpose tian those who upbraid the clergy for their attendance arc in the habit of ascribing to stuch meetings cheers i have also to thank the clergy aod i am sure ou will also thank them for their kindness to me and the vaiuable support the rendered us at the last election i am not saving too mucit when isay that in supporting the established tchurch itiroughout the country they did but their duty cheers we the conservative members of the house of commons have endeavoured as far as lay in our power to fight the god fight and support the cause of church and st ie the clergy believe and we as your representativls belitve that the church has been in danger and is in some little danger still and they would not have been actuated i y the feelings of men but degrading them selves as englishimen if they had ttot supported those whn supported them cheers for this it is that the clergy are held up by a certain sect to public ecorn and cor tumely but i believc they may centent themnselves withithe reproach laid on them for there would have been far more reason fo reproach if titey had acted othierwise for it might then have been toid that thev were rather looking to their ten poral benefirto the loaves and the fishes and the good thing which it is in the power of tioverrment to b stow tor it must hive been observed by every one that in proportion as an ecclesiastic professes whig or radical prin cipie so sure is het of attaining a high degree of promc tion in the church loud cheers as to you gentlc men the yeomanry of the countv i hardly know whether to congratulte or condole wilh you for the efforts you have made in the cause because it appears you are to be punished for the success of the conservatives thbrughout the kingtom hear hear the vote by ballot is thrctened on one side and on the other side vou are threatened with therepeal of the  clause in the reform act hear hear nowv it rices seem rather hard that at a time when a motion is brought forward for the ropeal of the cornlaws and when that repeal is supported by some members of the government and but very feebly opposed by the rest that they should then try to deprive the agricultutists of the power of sending agri cultural members to the house of commons to resist this attempt to destroy what i consider the first ant stable in terest of the country loud cheering at least it may be said of those gentlemen as i said of the clergy that their effbrts in supporting the cause of the conservatives is entirely disinterested for it is knowvn to all of you that there isi not the meanest place or function in the smaltest townthat there is nor even the place of posttnaster in a little village with the smalleat amount or a place of l a year up to an income of ereat extent in a large town in which if a petition for an individual be signed by the conservative inhabitants and presented by a conservative member it is not certain to be laid on the shelf hear hear i say it does so happen that ot all the patronage which comes from the treasury to the public of this country there is not one single fragment tha has come through consetvative means or has been ob tained by corseivative interest cheers therefore the suport which you have given to conservatism not only in this district but in other districts of the county has been purely froml your feelings ycur opinions and your inde pendenee loud cheers i have to thank yen also for having invested me with the proud distinction of your representative at this most intertsting era it will be a most interesting scene to witness the openingof thenext parliament by the new sovereign cheers of that il lustrious person i will say nothing except that from all we have heard and from all we have seen we have retson to nticipate iromn her good sense from her feellng of reli gion cheers from her sotind discretion nd from her ex qisite judgment that we have in her person the promise of a sovereign who sflrds at least the earnest of much and long happnes cheers  thank yeu gentlemen again more especialy for returning me to parliament be cause owing to those exertions which have been so ably and eloquently alluded to by the chairmanthe exertions ot the house ol lords the huse of comr ons ie now placed in a totally difterent position from that wliich is occupied for some years pst cheers it certainly is a most gratifying cir cumnstance thzt to the present parliansent there has been re turned harks to the newborn energies of england a greater number of persona identified with what i believe to be the real reeling of the curtrythe teal sound opinion of the coun trythan o any parliament we have had for years cheers and if we have nota majority at least that largeandfortmld able minority which theoppostion to thepresent government will  hltd will be such thatif theycannot bring forwatd good mnau es they can at ieast prevent the perpetration and ear ryinsr ofl bad ones chieers i will not detain you longer ansa i coticlude as i began with my heastsclt expression of graetiude for kindness on former occasionsr and for your kind ness tiow cheers as i have said before it is a disttnc tion which a commoner has a right to be proud of and the highesc clistinctlion which he can receive is tbat of being wcaber for lis native county and  trust i shall know how to d serve that honour load cheersair palstlegreat as was the compliment which you paid me in common with toy honourable friend in the invita ti n to flts board still more flattered must we both be by the hianner in wnich our healths have been drunk inaemuch as that complitnent conveys to us a reasonable hope that our conduct asd tne prlnclples we have represented for you in n ar tamenr have been such as to obtain your approbation cheers this testimony gentlemen will not only tend to cnfir  us in the corviclon of the soundness of those principles hut it will enable us to carry into the hcuse of conmons that confidetce in advocating those principles which we could derive from no other source cheers for myself in addressalng g company at the most ldistantextremity of the county from where i reside allow me to return my heartfelt tbianks foe the confidence you have bestowed upon nte cheers if t have reason to be thankful for the confidnce reposed in me by mv own neighbours how much ttore ought  to be thankful to you and how much more o ught i to tr to deserve it by my future conduct cheers you resdng no less than  or  miles from my own habitation have called me amongst you and i thant you most sincerelyi trust you wiu never have reason to think me unworthy of this invitation cheers with confijence in your supportwithout any apprehension from the power of one party or any favour to ask ot the other i trtist you will allowr m to say in common with my hon friend on my right that we shall ever be found amongs the most ttrenuous supporters of the constitution of the county cheers  that constitution as established by church and scate renewed cheering and whtle we are ever watchful over the special interest of this country we shall be fiund most anxious to do everything in our power to preserve the rights and liberties and conduce to the hap piness of our fellotv couttymen cheers ln doing that we shall he convinced tha t there is no way so sure of produc log it as upholding the etabilishnent of the church and the integrity and independettee of the three branches os the re gial ature cheers these institutions gentlemen are not bubbles ofthe teior distant objects to be looked ar merelyfor the sake of disputing tt to what may or may not be the tegult for that man mutt be more than wilfully blind who does estsee that everything is now dependent on the course pursueddinregardto theseparticularpeints thevery pillars of the constitution are touerlng to their foundatiori every act of her majestys ministers bas hitherto tended to dis credirt he estabishled church to eradicate that feeling towards elidlon

question the religious opinions of any party whatever whether roman catholic dlssenteror any other person who conscientiously diftered from me they are all entitled to ejoy their opinions and i respecrtall who entertaui their opilnonsaina sincere point of view but is it not our duty who are attached to the established church now to stand forth in its defence surrounded as it is by al phaltnx of enemies unsted in close honda for the purposeot annibtisting that establishmnent  t ss for us to defend our chttrch and it is for them to entcrtasu thtsr opinions cheer the acts of the present mtinister have been moat dcdedly rdiverse to the eaiablisbmtent ot a church so that am convinced that if there be not an earnett stir made in the country in support of that establishment but a very abort perioc wiu intervene before we shall not only bhae to lament the fall of the established church in ireland but in england also hear and cheers and let us look to the present state of the house of commons for are not the goman catholics holding the balance between that pirty which are ot no relgion at all or what is taantimount to the same indifferent to all and to the mainterance of the established church and are not her majetys minis ters now crouching to the archagitator of irleand for the purpose ot maintaining themeelvesin of e tcheers have they not dcclmated the bishops and seized on the revenues oi the rcee and have they net rendered these dignitaries mere stipeadiary vervants dependent on the will of the house of commons ruled as it is at this rnoment by a romsn catholic faction loud cheering if a stop be not put to this the most serlous constqurcato tbe esta blished church mutt follow and let us look to what theyredoing as regards the other grades in the churchthey are nowv being reducedi mean those who arc above the grade of the parish priest and let every one render his assitstance for if yout sifer the mniddle steps to be taken away you wil shake the wtole and leave as void serviceable fbi their purposte cheers there are mrany other points which might be touched on to show the conduct of rev miajeet s ministers with rgard to the religion of the country but it if not for me on tils occasion to go further irto this subject it is not religion alone that they have attempted to injure have they not endeavoured to bring into contempt the house of lordsthe main prop of the state and what have they done with respect to the agricultural interesit  when measures have been brought forward in which agricuiture has been interested and concerned bweve you found them support tng that interest  there mny have been one ortwo inoivi duals amongst tbem perhaps who from patticular feelings or principles habve conme forward and voted for these measures  but what was the came the other day wben thelast motion was made for grinding foreign com in bond a mere trick to evade that law ihick was passed for the protection of agriculture who was the person who supported it  wby the very indi vidual who as the organ oy the mninistry was connected with that depsriment the president of the board of trade cheers beep your eyes steadily fixed on this subject for depend oa it that individual could not so act in his station it ke were not supported in principle by tbe rest of ber lajestys ministers hear hear that individual will the first moment he has the pwer take away that protection which youhavehithertoenjoye  butif this should be attempted i trust you wiil find not onl those individuals whom you have sent to parliament but every one connected with the county most anxious ready and strenuous in op posng it loud cheers we can hardly soupese that her majesty has yet framed her mind entirely to azcord with the principles of her advifers and it is hardly possible that her eyes can be closed to what is pasing in the world or that her mind s shut against reasonable prirciples it wilt be for us therefore to make known to her the sentiments of the people of the kintrdom and when this is done there is little doubt of what will be the result for those persons now in power will find themfelves placed in a station to which they more pro perlybelon and hurled down from a station for which they aretotally unfit cheers i bg leave to thank you and to drink h alth arid happinness to every one present cheersafter streral trasts
