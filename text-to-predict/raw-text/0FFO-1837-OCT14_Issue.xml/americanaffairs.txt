americani aiiffairsmashingron sept in my last letter dated the th instant i hazarded some conjectures as to the probable raovemens of congtess so far as anything has yet been done those speculations haye been realized the senate have passed a hill authorizing a suspension of the payment to the states of the fourth instal mnent under the distribution law they have passed a bill authorizlng the issue of treasury notes a bill extending the tlife of payment of revenue bonds and also a bili authorizing the warehousing of imported goods for a term not exceeding three years the duties to be paid in cash when the goods arc taken out of the warehouse the two last of these bills i have no doubt will become law during the present session the two first are more doubtful but the chavces are in favour of their passagethe fifstnientioned bill has been under discutssion in the house ot reprtesentatives for several days past its fate whil not be decided for three or four days to come the adni niistrative party arc pressing its passage with great zeal if it should be defeated it will render necessary am isase of at least s of treasury notes thecteation of siichan mount of government paper in time of peace cannot fail to prove ruinous to the party in power if they are not already ruinedthe conservative party which is very smlall in congress loe excecding  in number ate seceders fram the domnant party they want firalness and will on most questions be driven back again into the ranks at thc head of this party is aivr rives of virginia formerly mlinister plteapotontiasy to france on all the bills which have passed the senate the conservatives in the house with five or sx exceptionf will vote vwith the administration but on the bill now pend ing belore the senate for orgaaztng a kind of subtreasury they will vote in the negative the effect of this bill as re commended by the president and secretary of the treasury would be to refuse in payment of all dues to tble goverrnment the paper or notes of every bank in the country whether the bank or banks dit or did not redeem their aotes in speciethis bill will probably undergo amendment jin the senate particu larly one proposed by mr calhoun the effect of which will be to produce the same result at the expiration of one two and three years instead of from and aficr the passage of the act this bill may pass in the senate but will be lost in the housemr calhoun has united in mostof the proposed nreastures with the administration the somnerset which he has made has astonished both his friends and his fo but was not matter of surprite aithough of reeret to a middle clas of statesmenthat class whlch could look calmly upon mr calhouns positfon and the poliey which he would probably pursucthat class which without predi lection or prejudice could admsre the lorce of his intellect while they would shrink from the visionarv and impracticable theories ehich his fertile imagination was con stantly eugenderngtbat class lhich deplored hits n chastened ambition while they rejoiced in his eleiation provided that elevation iwould not place him in a condition to do injury to his country under mistaken but honest vlews ot expediency and policythat class which beheld and knew mr colhoun as a statesman to be powerless and prostrate while labouring under selfdelusion and belliying that he seill possessed a controlling influence at least in south caro linahe bas now unfortunately for his future fame put that imaginary influence to the test and my word for it he wil find himself as far as it reopecs his late political friende standing lmnost alone some three or four of the nullifiers fzom the most generous and noble sympathiew mtay follow him in the new and unbeaten track in which he is now tread fog but disappointment and deep mortification are his doom inevitably i do not record this opinion with any degree of pleasure or even of satisfactiot here at thib moment it is heterodoxit is ridiculous but mark the sequelthe opinion ia gaining ground that congress will do uo thing more during the present session tlan provide relief for the treasury this will be accomplished by the four bills which havc already passed the senate aud aye pending before the house ol representatives both branches have given strong indications of a settled determination not to take up any business but such as has a direct connexion with the financee of the government or ratber with the deficiency which has or may accrue in the treasuy of the united states if tbis determination is adhered to as it probably will be congress will adjourn withtn three weeksthe presldent has not yet restponded to the call made by congress for information respecting texas it is under stood however in diplormatic circles that an
