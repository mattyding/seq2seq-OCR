youthful queen had accended the throne surrounded by difficulties ot no ordinary charactetshe found herselt in the hands not of her own chosen atinis ters but of those who had lost the entre confidence and ee spect of our late revered monarch laud cheers and by the disgracef ul union they had fbrnred with the two most daring facrtons that ever sprung up in this cuntry had rendered themselves completely incapable of giving to our sovereign that constitutional advice which would enable her to give an ample pledze of thesinceriry of her attachment to protestant principles and her desireto mnaintain the oath she had taken loud cheers he ttused he had now suffliciently derined the loyalty of the protestant conservativei of the british em pire their motto aas  fear god honour the

maintenance of those constitutional prin ciples in defnce of which they had all united togethier he was convinced thut any man taking the trouble to look through the pages of our national historyand taking an accurate survey of the many dangers that ever before threatened this country from foreign or domestio foes must be constrained to admit ahat great and imminent as they might be they sank into per fect inslgnllcance when compared with the fr ghtful situation in which they at present feund themselves they werecled upon to defend that protestant constlution which constituted the broad foundaion of the greatest exent of indyidual and mational liberty civil and religious which had ever been en joyed by any nation on the face of the earth cheers he would not conceal trom them the dangers which he tbought menaccd both the throne and the altars of the country those dangers would not be lessened by turning their backs upon them they must fairly look them in the face and strenu ously resist them feeling that no sacrifice would be too great to maintain those principles for which they had united ctleers they were now about to participate in the same sruggie in which their forefathers had eo nobly engaged at the ever memorable petiod of  cheers when the glorious revolution established the throne and the altats of our country and perpetuated that indissoluble unrion between ehurch and dtate whic through the blessing of god their descendants were sill determined with their lives to maintain or in de fence oi them to die loud and continued cheering there was a great similarity in the situation o the country at the present moment and at that period although there was cer tainly one striking and most cheering difference to which he should sbortly ailude the advisers of the crown tit that period aided the popish faction then aiming at the destruc tion of our church and protestant institutions that led to a evolution in the country which drove popery from ita coun cils and what was more drove a false and bigotted monarch from the throne of these realms loud chees si there was now a body of men nominally protestants but pro fessing no religion at all uniting themselves with the avowed infidel democratic pirty and with that bigotted part ef the romish churchfor he would not include ill the pomsn catbolics a considerable portion ot whom both in englanrd and ireland wete as fitmly united in the defence of constitutioaal prindples as themselre and would as deeply regret tbough dffering in their religious creed to eee the church ot england upset feeling that it had ever been the true and solid foundiation of britiah liberty cheers but still there wss as he had said a bigotted party of repub lican papists and with them those now in power had allied tbemselves cheers the great striking and cheering differ ence in the two periods to which he had averted was tis the sovereign ofour day had lie firmly believed been educated witb an attachment to these protestant principles wbich placed her famnily on the brilasb throne trdwith her reveted grandfather who was prepared to lay his head on the block rather than sacrifice those principles if put to the test will be found equally resolute and steadfast in their maintenance loud and continued cbeers the situation of the country was indeed most alarming and it required the wisdom of a long and experienced life to know how to rescue it from the diffi culties into which malgovernment had involved it no man could be weak enough to belleve that the present ministers wvre any thing more than the mnere nominal advisers of the crxown there was the power of tbetworepubllcana and popish factions controllipg and corlcing them to adopt measures most detrimental to every thing that was sacred aundvaluable in the institutions of the country loud cheers lt was not for him to occupy their time by retracing all the jteps which had jied to such a state of thing  but be would go back to the perfod of the reform bill ani admitting as he was qultteady to dg that there were then many who advo cated thsae eatsure ffrno a glnoers desim to advance the real interests of the countryyet undoubtedly there were two parties besides theconatitudional reformers who carried that isiets surethe democratic party and the bigotted party connected with the church of roaer who were

loud cbeerx becausceven if ttheysocceeded in stripping property and educatlortof its ligittinate influence in thecountry there would still remain to the tories a power whicb never belonged to the wvhigs and which would enable them to straggle for the remaining institutions of the c un try cheer and what was that power it was the moral influernce of character loud cheers and he would boldly declare in the face of that enlightened assembly comoposed of the wealth character and respectability of that divislon of the county that that snoral influence wag the only hope eui which nglantl now rested cheers what had been the regult of the late strisggle at the elections  the people of ettgland hat seen through the shifting views or those who brought ferward the reform bill and they had returned to their national leaders anstfriends so that the fiends of the constitution wete still in a positlon successfully to deend the throne and aiars of the country boud cheers the concessions wwich he hid always opposed to the roman catholic party had failed to produce tranquillity and peace the advocates of thcse con cessionm had been deceived by false professionsnay further they had been deceived by periary loud cheers  for looking at tile evidence taken before the committee of parilament he found oconnell himself stating that lie would never advo cate the measure unless there was amplc and perfect security to the established church in ireland cheers and yet that ver individual whom they must not despite for he was a man of talent and power now said nothing but the destruc tion of that church nothing bat the destruction of everything connected with protestantlam in that part of the empire would satisfy him cheert they bad assetmbled msn fully to express their sentiments of attachment to the institu tions ot the country and that great wad glarious meeting he had now the hlonour of addressing was a guarantee to him that the people of engiand would not be ridden over raugrn i sbod by a popish faction loud cbeers and that they would not allow their beloved sovereign to be long held in the degradet situation in which she was at present placcd loud cheers he implored them to consider to what a height of national prosperity and greatness this country had attained undertheir free protestant iostitutions cheers and yetgreats that national prosperity had been it was as nothing com pared with the great moral worth of character which had arisen solely and entirely from the connexien of pure religion with he institutions of the state cheers this had brougbt down upon tiem great nutiens blessing aad diatinouihed them afmong nations s the greatest and happiest people that ever existed kchears they entered into a contest with france not for aggranadizement of power but to resist theprogress of certain democratic infidel principles which it al j loteed to prevail would have laid in the dust everv instsution of social ordecr and happiness and left the country and cvery other without the slightest xecorty for pronerty and life but through the blessing ot fod who usheld them so long as they held fast that faith which was the fbundation of all that
