oenilernen if  art right in the views i have prrouglt before you on the subject of education as lying at the root of che happiness of this countrys you will see howrr mrch depends npon the ptinclpies held by statesmen on that question i dont think the government can do muoh to cxtend eur coml mercial and manufacturing nterests the iruth is that government has done much evil by intelferisig at all with edir conmerce andmanufaclurecr by shackrlig snditbrovlnrt up  arlers in the wayos vigosous popular exertion which would bave made usmore wcalthy and prosperous than yrieierbiave been what we want the government to dolis to let us alone to remove fromn is the crushing burdens which weigk us down and as in the story cel sinbrad to let us rtun fie let gvernment but rid the country of iha heavy burdens whicb oppress it and we shall ruh a race with any country upon the face ofe the earth and great as it is at present it will become much greater when government cee tbeir duty and the people understand their only true interests bit the oeithlig that lies at thebate of the colutrin of all our ptosoceity is an intelligent a mora i wellconducted and therefbre a happy pi opl make what law you pleasewhat is the use of lawvs if the people are stank in vice frame as in spai n and portugal what constitutions you maywhat is the use of constitutions if the peeple do not understand or care for them  but avee me an initelhigent and virtuous people and we will obtairilawts frot the mot sordid of rulers give me an intelligent and yirtuoins people andt we will break ttle yoke of the most tyrannical aud crusbing dsspetism give me an intelligent and virtuoua people and we will force our way to freedom and to truths by our own strengtb and our own determination oiaud cteering therefore i say again it is not whslt government can do ret usit can run a railroad or make a canal why we can do that ior ourselves by our own enterprlse our own industry our own capital give us but an intelligent people and we shall have all the rest deprive us of that and the gifts of government aye miserable and wretched gifts cast upon a land that cannot receive them applauie gentlemen as i crossedl today tic country that separates you from glasgowas i saw that uplanccountry portion of it called the moor and its far trctchng barrenness i thought with myself what would anitnglishman say when he traveled by this road and looked around him as he passed across even in the midet oi the low lands what must appear to him a trackless waste of useless moor  and if he shoult go to the highlands and see there hills still more steril and barren moors of stil greater extent would he not come away saying commend me to the het ge rows antl the growing timber the swiling cottages the ritch vallies and the glowing plains  that is the country for me scoland isa poor barren country but you will tell the sxxon tiat you would not exchange your moors and your moun tains for his country rich as it is that the scotsmn loves his moorland wastes as dearly as you love your fields and villages and from these very moors and those very hills which to you appear useless wasres the scotsoan knows how to charm cultivation and fertilitythat which seems to you a barten and unproductive soll under his hand becomes a charmed field and that which appears to you as wild and hopeless wastes will speedily becom sourtes of abundance and wealth cheers but whence comes this  how did you acqutire the ability and industty that change such anun promtsing soil into productiveness havc governments done this for you have courts favoured your enterprise  eave kings done this for scotland  al  have red history it was quite the reveree down to the period of the union konga frowned upon us courtiers neglected us nobls scorned us gorerrment left us to ourselves and when it did interfere it was with the sword of persecution and then our forefalhers found shelter in these moors and glens from that withering curse of scotland and the wilis ofayrshire were the hiding places ot many ot our nartyred ancestors lve receivedr none of all our wealth and power and greatness from kings or governments or courtiers we got it from the intelirgence of the people acquired in their own churches and their own schools from the minister and the schoolmaster knowledge was communicated in that way wisdiom was imparted to us in that way and scotland became great in the only way to which she mustiock for her future greatness apptause now gentlemen since i saw you last i lhave visited another country very different in some respects from this in the south of ireland where i have lately been i saw very few f those upland wastesvery few in tihat part ot the country where i travelled of those barren moors i saw a eruntry rich beyond words to describe richness trees springing like palms crops ripening to abundaiare n harveston which oature lavished profusion a climnae most nmild a soil most indulgent tivers read to recelve the commerce of the world harbours ready to accommodate theirships and yet when i looked a the people  did not seethe misery of which  had heard  for in the farmhouses and the cottages in the three counties i had visited i saw a considerable appearance of comfort an aspect of abundance but when i went into the towns where i ex pected to finj a manufacturing people i saw wretctedness ga thered together in vast masseshovels containing the most feartul misery and the faces of their inhabitants marked wish every feiture of famine and distrees in the midst ot all this fer tility this poor country appeared to be weighed down by some heavy burden and labouring under the stroke of op pression you lsk what was the cause of this i went into their chapels and there i beheld a scene which much as i hzve traveled abroad i never saw equadied even in the city of rome and although i have seen italian popery in all its splendour yet i never saw it in greater splendour and i have seen also a great deal ot nu peisriton in italy hut i never saw superstition so gros ani the people so abject crouching trembling on the very pavement before the holy water under the eye and at the nod of the priest grovelling on the earth li terror lest the crse of god which they believe the priest has in his power should fall upon them i never saw any thing like this in the south of europe i saw a people more abject in their devotions more under the power of the priest and more debissd and grovelling to the earth than ever i had seen in the heart of papal europe and when i heard of the scenes that ensued some of which followed their morning devot onsscenes of the wildest riot of the most fnigittful debauchery succeeded by quarrelling and blcod shed and crime and that the very men who sat trembling i the morning under the priests nod in the evening were fightinglike savages merely because theyarecalledby the name of a factionfor the whole country is split into these factionswhen i saw the loaded sticks with w hich they fough t their battles and the deadly weapens they employwhen  heard from all parties anu all sides of the waste of rine of the waste of money of the waste of life as the conse quences of these debaucheriee and of the misery and crime to which they give riseand when i found that all thsis went on under the nod of thote ery priests who are invested with absolute and unconrtollable poveri read in the history of ireland in the rcesent day the his tory of scotland in the past and saw bow deep the deerada tion n tnut be of a people sunk in ignorance anl groaning under that yoke of superstition which our forefathers broke applausn and therefore allow mte to say that when i went throughout county after county and beheld such scenes when i lteard lthat cpitalists dared not come into the coun try and establish manulscrures because they were pro testantswhen i heard that men durst nor exercise the rights of citrena at the elections beeause they would have been mobbed by these peoplewhen i saw that the housts of men of raaal end industry wvere nst safe because they are built aridst a people so rode and so barbarous i understood how v was ths t ireland has never prospered and when i wnt into the schools rhat are called national seloolswhen i iound that the master are planted there by these very priests teaching the children the doctrine that thc priest is the arbiter of heaven and can hurl them into hellwhen i hear such doctrines inculcated impressed upon the children what hope cn i have that any light shall ever relch the minds of a people so closed in vwith walls of darkoes  cheers and now gentlemen when i turned to the contrast witi thin ceuntry when t thought what would we have been with such harsbours such rlren such a soil such a climate aud when i thought vhati had elevated us without these natural advanrages from she very state in which these people now are no a condition far above them i did fondly hope ithat the aiime means would be applied to ireland which had ratsed this country and that we should begin by impressing scripture trutb upon its people along with the inculcation of human knowledge cheers therefore gentlemen i could not doubt as to the course of policy in regard to ire land i shoild pursue as your representative we are told that it is on the subject of ireland the battle is to be fought and that ministers will contend with the opposition all that  can say if that in the struggle of parties for the fake of vic tory i shiall take no part whatever if such a struggle should take place on the election of a speaker i shall take no part in it or in any of those mere personal contentions bu if any proposal shall be brought forward to do justice to irelnd on the principles of alr oconnell by the plan of excluding the mliniters of the truth instead of establishing sound ministers and souind schoolnasters i should be utterly unworthy of being your representative if i liesitated for a moment to demand clearly and resolutely that parliament shquld do justice to ireland by weakening the power of the priests instead ot laying heavier burdens ou the people and by emancipating the people from the voke that is crushing them to the earth cheere excuse me for detaining you so long on ths question wthich will occupy much of he attention or parliameat i have no object to serve in parlia tment bat to do you service i have no honours of place to seeki would reelve none i have nowealth to receive nor to desite from the ministry the only reward i do desire the only reward i will ever seek is the approbation of the people of scoiland in any little exertions i ever made i readlny confess that it was an object of my ambitioto t secure thetavour of myintelligent countrymen and when i have been received by you with favour such as i do not deserve but which you in your klndness have given all i wil seeic in the course of those arduous ddties to the discharge of which you now send me wvll be that i may be able to meet again such anunmber as i see tonight of friendly faces beam ing with kindness  and to assure you that amidst all the weartiness and toll and anxiety of parliementary duty the refreshment to which i turned had beenyour favour and the objeet at which i aimed wag that when i retumedr to you i might fird tcatfavour
