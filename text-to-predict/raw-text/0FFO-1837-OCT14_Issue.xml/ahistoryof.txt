ia jisto y of elarglish ppiscopacy bythomas athebury ma oxoxthe purpose of this work is to detail the history df the ecclesiastieal affairs of this country from that mo mnentous period at which the long parliament began its sittings to the restoraton of charles il the sub ject is well chosen because amidst the abundant mate rials which have been collected by various authors for the general history of this period the ecclesiastical portion his been although not overlooked yet lesr d elt upon than any other of the features which cha racterise this section of our doraestic history the author has executed his task with very creditable skill with very laborious research and with a modera tion and impartiality which entitle bim to unqualified commendation at such a ieriotl as the present it was not to be expected that a writer could present a faithful picture of the times comprised within the scope of tbis history without exciting the ire of sorne of those zealous partisans who desire to keep out of view the absurdities and abominations in ivhich the turbulent fanatics of the th century indulged in order that they niay excuse or praise the mischievous and profligate audacity which distinguishes their worthy descendants of the existing age accordingly mr lathbury has been abused and misrepresented by one of the organs of that faction which seems to think that to subvert the constitution the shortest and most effec tual method is by beginning with the established church against suchx atacks a work of less merit than this might safely stand and the best appeal from censures so unprovoked and unfounded as those which have been bestowed upon mr lathburys history is to the book itsefin order to clear the way for the history of the period which the title of the work points out the author has found it necessary to uace the proceedings of that reformation which begun in the reign of henry viii was firnly established under the sway of queen elizabeth thie translation of the bible and the establishment of the liturgy were the main instm ments by which the truths of religion were opened to the community the manner in which the latter was formed is thuts stated  the entire reformation of the liturgy was next under taken by the same committee that had been intrusted writh the arrangement ot the commuaton service wiuch bad been left to the discretion ot the clergy who retainiig their predilection for the old forms slighted the new communion service the reformers perceived that nothing would so effectually correct these irregularities as one uniform liturgy accordingly cranmer goodrich holbeach day sklpp thirlbyrldleybisbops with coxdean of christa churcb lay dean of st pauls and somc others immediately commenced a revision of the ancient offices prilor to the reformation various ofices were used as those of sarum yomk hereford bangor and lincoln these had originally been compiled by bishops of those sees in the primitive church the bishops were accustomed to compose liturgies foet the use of their people after the manner as is generally admitted of the apostles and first ministers of the church now from the early liturgies had been derived much of what was contineti in the various offices in use at the period of the reformation these various offices were exsamined by the committee the result of whose labours was an entire liturgy the first book cf king edward the committee by their instructions were not authorized to reject the ancient books but to revise themto select vhat was excellent to refuse what was orherarlst when the committee sat down to their lagours a preclamation was issued prohibiting all persons from preaching till the new liturgy shoald be completed in afew months the work was fialashed containing the order for moming and eveuing prayer and the forms ot baptism con firmation matrimony and the burial of the dead the utmost prtsetence was cnincee tnroughout rites and ceremonies iere no rejected unless they were intzvationa of a recent period or had been akused in idolatrous worship nothing was rejected merely because it had been adopted in the church of rome it may be questioned vwhcthtr the v orld ever eaw a body ef uninspired men whose proceedings under very difficult circumstances were more marked by caution wisdom and moderation than thosa of the earliest reformers the liturgy was approved by conyocation and having received the sanction of parliament it was used in all the churches in a few years at the suggestion of maxtin bucer peter mtartyr and they foeetgn divines the book twas review ed ard at their instigation several alterations were adopted the first book commenced with the lords prayer in the new book the scntences eahortatlou confession and ab solution were added scme few ceremonles as the oil in baptism and the unction of the sick were retrenched the prayers for the dead were also omitted and a rubric was in seited in the communion service declaring that no adoration was intended by the posture of kneeling this rubric was omitted in the review of the services at eflibeths acces sion out in  it wvs restored and still remains copes and other habits heretofore used in the consecration of bishops were also laid asidein his history of the reign ot cliarles i and of the period which succeeded it up to tbe restoration mr lathbury has given a fair view of ecclesiasti cal affairs it has been objected against him that he has drawn the portrait of laud in too favour able colours and that he has been unjust towards thc puritans both of these charges aic unfounded it is true that he has exprcssed some feeling of sympathy for thc fate of charles  and of laud and that he has stated in plain terms that the puritans of that period tnaintained none of those principles upoil which the dissenters of the present day glorify their opposition to the institutions of the state for tlle first he might stand excused even by an edinburgh re viewer is it historically untrue to state as the author toes ihat the contuct of charles and of laud  wvas arbitrarr and contributed int no small degree towards hastening that ruin in which thc church and state were involved  and is there any great offence in ventur ing to suggest that nevertheless  their motives were pure  or that  it indeed thtir characters hal been as black as is represented by their enemies their subse quent sufferings might have softened the enmnity with which their memories liave been pursued  surely it may he permitted to an engtisih clergymanx writing a church history of the perioli in which this monarch and this prelate lired to bestowr upon their untimely graves the  passing tribute of a sigh and he may itl mas christian minds siand excusedl for not further seekidg  their frailties to disclose than die purposes of his work required what he has said in contrasting the purieans of the reign of charles  with the dissenters of the present day is this il is amnusing to hear modern dissenters glory in their being the descendants of the puritans in no instance how evr do they cepy their example the carly puritans con formed to the liturgy a few things exceped they contend ed for an established cburch  most of them remained in the churcb until the day of their dealth anl in their printed works they ffequently allude to the formularies of the church at the restoration the nonconformists occupied nearly the sanme poittiun and would have been satlsfied with a few alterations mlodern dissenters diffcr as widely from the early puritans snd the nonconformists of  as they dn from the established church by the puathans they would be deemed schilsmoaics for gathering separate churches oern dissenters denounce establishments as uncriptural but thepuritans and nonconformists contended that they were necessary in  a few alterations would have satis fied tire ejected ministers but no alterations would satisfy dissenters the former would have retained a rooderate episcopacy by the latter it is viewed as an offset of popery were the puritans and nonconformists to revisit the earth they would denounce dissent as the engine of satan it is wr absurdity for radorn dissenters to claim any relationship with the puritans whose principles were zlarnetrlcally oppo site to their ownlet folks dispute as they will the conclusions hehas drawn but will any person of veracity any person of ordinary decency say that he has deserved the accu sation which the edinburgh reviewer with a want of decency peculiarly his own has brought againstir lathbury when that critic ir commenting on the passage we have extracted above ventures to say  tshis prejudiced scribhlsr  has the hardihood to denounce themn the dissenters as the engines ofit is however not utpon isolated passages but upontt gcijuru iewwur ul s wvork tflit mlr latbburys merits are to be tried by those wbose good opinion is alone worth possessing it is because it contains a calm clear faithful and dispassionate review of the eventful scenes which its title comprises because it supplies satisfactorily t vacaney in the ecclesiastical history of that intercsting period and
