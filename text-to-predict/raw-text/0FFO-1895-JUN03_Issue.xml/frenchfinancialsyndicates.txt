french financial syndicatesparis juke the cabinet narrowly escaped a defeat in the chamber yesterday had  of its supporters voted the other way it wvould have been in the minority the participation of deputies in financial syndicates was the rock on which it all but struck and that participation was ultimately condemned with ony ten dissentients this platonic vote however was a poor consolation to the socialists and radicals for the defeat of their attempt to overturn a cabinet on the pretence of the vindication of pojitical moralitythe debate was raised by m rousnet the socialist who alleged that the malpractices of the southern railway company and its accom plices were being screened by the government Â£he late baron reinach he said had stolen f with which he had bribed legislators and members of local bodies a senator had received f but though he had been sum moned by the investigating magistrate it was apparently as a vitness not as a delinquent for he had not pleaded parliamentary privilege nor bad the government applied for the suspension of that privilege m rouanet insisted that if these legislators had given services for their money they ought to come forward and vindicate themselves wnereasif theyhadrendered noservices they ought to be prosecuted he chaired the government with screening scandals the dis credit of which fell on the republic and with singular ides of history he held up the conven tion of t as a model in repressing fraudsthe reply of m trarieux ainister of justice was that according to the investigating magi etrates the syndicates in the case of the southern railway had committed no illegality certain directors of financial establishnents some of whom were also members of the chamber had formed part of these syndicates together with some of their personal friends his own opinion was that directors should not act in this way and that deputies should confine themselves to their parliamentary duties but the law did not forbid ttem and no direct participa tion of legislators in the alleged fraudulent practices had been ascertained heperemptorily declined in these circumstances to disclose the names of persons incriminated in a matter which had shown no ground for a prosecution m trarieux explained that on one charge the magistrate had just reported that there was no caso for a prosecution and that the investiga tion into a second clharge was still pending as to withholding tho names he significantly added  were i in the place of those whom vou suspect i should myselt null off the veil thereiupon m rouvier acknowvledged that he subscribed for a thousandsharesinthoe draguignan line and that as the issue was a success he reaped a profit of  francs ile insisted however that in spite of the  professors of virtue  on the extreme eft hla had a perfect right to do this le had perhaps shared in three or four of such matters but he was not responsible to the chamber for the revolutionarv tribunal ofy had not yet been reestablished and if for  years he had devoted his time to business instead of to politics he should have now possessed much more than his present moderate cormpetencycop jules roche also an exminister like wise contended that participation in syndi cates for launching schemes sanctioned by parlia ment was perfectly legitimate and he vehemently reprobatef the usurpation byr the cbamber of judicial functions he protested that he was tired of the attacks during the past three years on the part of extremists actuated by animosity on account of his having combated and defeated them m jaures on the other hand denounced the acceptance of money comrmissions by legisla tors and argued that such mon could be prosecuted for trading on their parliamentary position or that if the law did not touch them it should be at once amended while m jaures thus censured m trarieux for inaction m goblet  attacked him for having exceeded his powers by saying  as long as i am minister there shall be no prosecution thus assuming a control over the investigating magistratesm jaures submitted a resolution regretting that the government had not prosecuted swindlers of every class and calling upon it to do its duty while m goblet on his part proposed to censure  the too frequent intervention of the government in the province of justice this gave m ribot the opportunity of showing the contradiction between the two mtions and be hit the nail on the head by remarking when two critics join in such an alliance there is some thing more init than disinterested desire for the public weal he emphatically endorsed m trarieuxs refusal to twist the law and disclose names in order to dishonour their bearers he maintained that m goblet if in office would act similarly whereas m jaurbs if he did otherwise would imitate acts stigmatized by history to this home thrust m goblet could only reply that his aim was not to overturn the cabinct but only to insure the independence of justicemi
