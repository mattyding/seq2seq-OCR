italyrome may thero is one phenomenon in the late italian elections which deserves a passing word of ox planation this is the relative prominence which the socialist vote has assumed and which offers apparent evidence of the increase of socialism in italy i believe that there is no considerable increase in tho number of thgse who adhere to the doctrines so known i should attribute the increase in the vote mainly to two causes one being the tendency to differentiation which always exists in sects of extremists and wlhich now influences the men who have hithertovoted for their radical allies because they had not distinct organizations theother is the determina tion of the personal antagonists of signor crispi to vote for anybody who could be elected againsb him the former cause is shown by the fact that on the sshole the radicals have lost as much as the socialists have gained the second cause is shown by the fact that where signor crispi or another member of the government was a candidate all the elements of opposition united against him to the exclusion of third candidates and the vote was beyond any reasonable estimate of the adherents of the party to which the opposition candidate belonged all the miinisters have been reelected but some of their mnost steady adherents have been defeated by these combinations as for instance signor damiani signor crispis alftr ego who was beaten at marsala where a conservative opposition candidate stood no chance all the votes of the opposition went to a radical or socialist the radicals have fallen from nearly  to  and the socialists from being a mere element in the radical group have gone up to  and consti tute the only group of the opposition which has not been practically routed doubtless there is a slight progress in the socialist movement but it is a tendency too doctrinal to becomea great danger to the practical italian who has but a slight regard for theories and much for his per sonal intereststhere is no question about the intentions of the radicals in the chamber of deputies just elected to continue to obstruct busmness and provoke scandals to the utmost of their abilities they make no disguise of their resolution to take up the personal questions with signor crispi where they were left in the late session and it is con fidently predicted in certain circles that the go vernment will not be able to control the minority and will be compelled again to dis solve this is apparently what the radical leaders desire and it remains to be seen whether the ministry can so organize its majority as to enable it to deal effectively with the disorderly element the opening of the chamber is expected to furnish some scenes even surpassing in disorder those of the last sittings of the late chamber for some of the radical leaders avow their determination at any price not to allow signor crispi to continue to hold the reins of government owr own qorrespondentrome jusz the results of b out of the  second ballots are now known  ministerialists and  members of the opposition have been elected the latter are divided as follows ten members of the constitutional opposition three ocialists and nine radicalsreuter
