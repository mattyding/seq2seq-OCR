sir james bacon was the last to sit upon the bench as an ancient institution but sir james bacon was a lad of  years before the office of vicechancellor of england was created and as to the much more recent office of a vicochancellor of the high court of chancery he was within five years of taking silk when the first appointment to it was made it will not be forgotten that while a vicechan cellor he was also chief judge in bankruptcy till the legislation of  abolished the office but his experience as a judicial officer in bank ruptcy went back to days before the acti now regarded as obsolete

dissimilar until the passing of the judicature act of thand accordingly the brampton and longtown railwvay and other abortive enterprises soon found their way into his court the most widely knowvn was

vicechancollorship it wias soon recognized that the machinery of the court of chancery was too cunbrous to deal effectively with so complex a mass of interoests after many summonses had occupied the chambers and court of vicecbancellor bacon to the exclusion of other business the legislature passed a special act in  referring the whole matter to the arbitration of lord cairus the earl of st

his judgments have been varied and iu others confirmed appeals from his decision in bankruptcy matters were not infrequent as was to be expected from the extent of the interests involved and from the fact that appellant trustees have seldom personally to pay costs he himself sat as an intermediate judge of appeal and tbhe act accordingly gave no appeal beyond the court immediately above him except by special leave hee had not often therefore the satisfaction which other judges have felt in seeing the decision of the court of appeal reversed and their own opinion restored by the riouse of lords as a general rulehe despatched the business of his court with great correctness although he was not favoured with so long a list of causes as that which evinced the popularity of some judges those who practised before sir j bacon had often reason to praise his clear insight his readiness to dis regard technicality ant the lucid style of his judgments he was a great caricaturist and when his notes were sent up to the court of appeal they sometimes disclosed very graphic representations of the states of fact which had impressed the mind of the tribunal the same tendency to satire was
