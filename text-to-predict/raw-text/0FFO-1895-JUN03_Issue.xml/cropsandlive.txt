agriculturecrops and live stockthe indications of an approaching change in tho weather appeared to be accentuated as last week drew to its close and if the rain whioh fell on the opening day of june should prove to have been at all general it will have done something though far less than is neededto refresh the muchparched soils the terrific heat experienced on thursday was an occurrence to be remembered and it is no matter for surprise that it was fol lowed by thunderstorms of greater or less violence in various parts of the country the month of may has left behind it no claim to gratitude in the minds of farmers on the contrary it will be recollected as a period of heat and drought interrupted by an abrupt and pronounced fall of temperature during the middle week nowly needed orotps made but little progress owig to lack of moisture the meadow hay crops received Â£ cheek which practically settled their fate for the season and pastures went back in condition instead of bounding forward to that grand flush of grass which in a gentler season is the feature of an english june consequently with in three weeks of midsummer we cannot write in any very hopeful tone of the prospects of the crops extensive breadths of spring corn are at present no more advanced than thoy sometimes nappen to be at midapril and the reports of ploughing up recently seeded ground are becom ing unpleasanltly numerous mangel is develop ing an irregular and unsatisfactory braird and swedes have been sown in the driest seed beds imaginable vegetation of all kinds seemspining for that softness of the atmosphere which comes of humidity and nothing short of a complete change in the weather can bring about the con suimmation which is so widely desired a long steady soaking rain would be gladly welcomed in rnost parts of the country without it farmers prospects must continue to deterioratein the horgrowing districts of the southeast of england the bines have made considerable progress lately and in most plantations they are quite forward enough here anl there may be seen a patchy piece of bine that has been attacked by wireworms millepedes or fleabeetles but es a rule the plant is even and strong and of a good healthy green colour the chief drawback at present is the quantity of aphides upon the leaves  they threaten to cause planters con siderable trouble in washing with quassia and soft soap already this expensive and tedious operation has begun on some of the farms where growers think it preferable to get rid of the flies and lice before the posts in any way exhaast the plants red spider is much dreaded  it occa sioned most serious loss in the dry summer of  in many hop plantations and it may be expected to appear again unless we have a copious fall of rain the fruit crop has suffered from drought in many parts of kent though the blossom was unusually profuse on nearly all kinds of trees and bushes the  settina of the fruit was not altogether satisfactory and the drought has sinco caused a con siderable fall of fruitlets especially of cherries gooseberries and currants appletrees have been badly infested with winter moth and other caterpillars as a check upon which paris green has been somewhat extensively sprayed and with markezd advantage where it has been intelligently applied raspberries which were cut up in some localities by frost are urgently needing rain the strawberry blossom has been generally good but in this case also the plants are in the direst need of rain to develop the fruit which in the absence of moisture is bound to be small and scanty in a few localities in kent meadowgrass is being mown in order to prevent further shrinkage and loss of weight as effects of the droughtmiuch interest attaches to the discovery by m fouquier delrouel of a means of successfully coping with the ravages of the beet carrion beetle silpha opaca it is a troublesome pest in france in the sugarbeet crops and there is no apparent reason why it should not at any time place the enlish mangel crop in jeopardy as occasionally it has done the grub or larva of this beetle growvs to about half an inch long and feeds upon the young leaves of the beet and mnangol in external appearance it presents con eiderable resemblance to a woodlouso though this latter is not an insect as fields of beet and of mangel have had to be resown in france this season because the pest under notice destroyed the braird m dchrouls communica tion to the sociote nationale dagriculture is a timely one his method is to spray the young plants with a mixture containing per b b of colsa oil llb of soap and jb of water in a fewa moments the insects are seized with convul sions which speedily prove fatal the insecti cidal mixture is made immediately before use and it is observed to be more ranid in its effects if applied when the sun is shining about b or nine gallons of the liquid is sufficient for an acre the adhesion for some time of the material to the sprayed plants protects them against a new attack by fresh insects and the crop itself is not injured in any wayin connexiori with live stock the most note worthy event last week was the adoption of a resolution as noticed in tle times of thursday by the council of the royal agricultural society urging the board of arculture to proceed on more stringent lines and to resort to more effec tive measures for the suppression of swine fever in this country in view of the figures relatinto this troublesome and persistent disease which we published a week ago this step can scarcely cause any surprise and it may confidently be expected that the board of agriculture will decide upon some energetic course of action this is the second year in succession in which pig breeders have been debarred from exhibiting their stock at the leading shows which have thus been deprived of a most popular feature to say nothing of the retrograde effects which may not unireasonably be expeited to flow from the protracted suspension of the healthy stimulus to improvement which is one of the results of showyard competition the store eattle trade languished somewvhat last week in view of the impaired prospects of keep but it may be expected to grow brisk again if even at the eleventh hour a copious and feneral rainfall should be enjoyed hides have increased considerably in vaue during the last few weeks bakers haove speedily availed them selves of the moderate rise in the price of wheat to add a halfpenny to the retail cost of the four pound loaf they showed less alacrity in diminishing the price of bread through the long dreary period when the value of wheat was on the down gradethe situation in france appears to be rather more favourable than in england according to the joumal de lagriculture of june  the month of miay closed under conditions particularly favourable at least in most districts altorna tions of rain and sunshine have given a lively impetus to vegetation the cold spell in the middle of the month though ib did bome damage notably in the east was happily very partial in its effects and the same may be said of the hail storms of last week but though the outlook for hay and forage crops is satisfactory it is other wis with the cere is bye is generally a light crop wheat is the subject of very discordant reports and in muny districts the plapt is described as  gappy so that at best not more than an average yield is looked for it is diffioult to speak with any eer tainty as to the springsown cereals save that larger areas have been
