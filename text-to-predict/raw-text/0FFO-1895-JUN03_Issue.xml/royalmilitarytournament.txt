royal military tournamlentit had originally beon arrantged that the shahzadn nasralla khan should visit tho military tournament today when the whit monday crowd may be expected to be prodigious  but for some cause or another perhaps by reason of some restricbion placed tupon our visitor by his religionthe shahzada preferred to pay his visit to this series of military feats and pageants on saturday he was on the scene early the great crowd which had gathered togetlher outside the hall in the ocitainty that the prince and princess of wales would come and in tho hope that they might see the afghan prince and his retinue were not dis appointed for the performance within had not begun long before a string of royalcarriages con spicuous by reason of the familiarsoarlet liveries passed down towards the official entrance in barfordstreet those carriages conveyed the shalhzada in a european frockcoat and the black astrakhan headcovering with the diamond star which london is beginning to know the retinue of darkskinned afghans the pipebearers and tho merryfaced boy who accompanies the shalizada in his wanderings after being received by prince edward of saxeweimar colonel onslow and the principal officials of the zourna ment at the entrance our visitor was conducted at once to tho royal box his retinue beinglaced in the adjoining box to the right nor was there any long period of wait ing before more royal carriages brought the prince and princess of wales thet prin cesses victoria and maud of wales and the duchess of fife with lady maaccles field tiss knollys and sir dighton probyn in attendancie this company entered the royal box as the band of the royal lorse guards played the opening part of the national anthem and the spectators who litsrally filled every available place rose to their feet and cheeredthe afternoons display was well worthy of the illustrious visitors on the oiie hand and of the great gathering of spectators on the other of the perfonnaneos of noncommissioned officers and men of tho regular cavalry at heads and posts lemoncutting and like feats it is not necessary to write at length yet since more meetings of pioked men must take place before the destinations of the handsome prizes can be settled but the tentpegging although it was but the first round deserves a word of mention by reason of the excellent performances of sergeant cane of the th hussars and sergeant darge of the nd dragoons each of whom obtained the highest possible number of markp the riding andjump ing competition also was of great interest anl the horsemanship of the representatives of the th hussars secured the unreserved praise of experts in matters equestrian of whom a large number are always to be found round the arena good and popular as usual were thodis plays by the gymnastic staff of the egyptian a rmy and by the noncommissioned officers under training at the hoadquarters gymnasium at aidershot after the lyptians came the his torical pageant of the r kings own hussars and the buffs this no doubt was the cause of the second visit of the princess of wales to the tournament for she stood up to watch it and obviously commenited upon the marked contrast between the picturesque appearance of the stuart cavaliers with their flowing locks their plumed hats and clean shaven faces and the unlovely blue and yellow ofhe later days of george the fourth very pleasant to view also was the pikedrill of the menatarms who were the predecessors of the buffs and the firelock drill of their successors both the foregoing involved oldtime words of command such as  stand fast  for  halt  join your left hand to  your firelocks poiseyourfirelocks unfixyourdagers these were days before the rule of bringng the heels together was established and the positions of the footmenwith their feet wide apart had a dis tinlet savour of the old world the display over the prince of wales asked that captain willis of the rd ifussars might be presented to him and after complimenting him warmly upon his success inquired with interest whether the men liked the work which they performed so well and whether it involved a great amount of labour for them in the driving competitions by royal artillery which followed the th field battery major p f p hamilton and the th field battery major t s baldock took part both this and the galloping competition by royal horse artillery in which d battery mfajor f iv i eustace and e battery major macdonald participated excited the admiration of the audience nor was there any accident worse than the rolling over of one or two of the posts between which the guns must trot if they are royal artillery or gaulop when they come from the royal horse artillery but stirring as this display is it does produce acciclents on occa sionu and earlier in the week there was such an accident at the sharp turning of a cornerthere still cemained two or three interesting features of the performance firstofthesewas a dislay of bareback riding vaulting and jumping by a etachmentfrom the cavalry depot at canter bury in this colonel onslow takes a special interest and it was pleasant to observe that the hahzada who had remained up to that moment apparently impassive and unimpressedbut then oriental princes are not given to lavish display of their feelingsbegan to show animated pleasure as these active riders and their horses commonced their performance and an instructor in uniform cracked a long whip in the centre of the ringfor all the world as if the arena had been that of a circus the horses were freo of all trappings save bridles and sur cingles on which or the convenience of men who were expected to vault on to horses at the gallop orto vaulton and off while their horseswere leaping lhurdles two siff loops were attached on top it seemed that there wasno trick of horseman ship which these men could not achieve  but the climax came wvhen they swung round on their horses backs andfaced their tailsand in that un accustomed position which might be very useful if they had to use parthin tactics in warfare took their jumps as easily and naturally as possible this feature of the tournament which is quite now is admirable the musical ride of the royal horse guards an eminently stately and rhythmical performance followed and after that came the combined display of all arms in which all the actors are now perfect that was the end hardly had the yells of the zulus of the st middlesex been drowned in the british cry of victory hardly had the din of rifle machine gun maxim and field iece died away before the prince and the shahizada had driven away almost the last person whom they saw being sir evelyn woodthere is one sight which these royal visitors to the tournament miss and that is the sight of the mens quarters in the galleries where the ariangements reflect the utmost credit on all concerned here too the shahzada might have beengreatlyamused onsaturdayafternoon if he had witnessed the ethiopians changing their skins and had seen the zulus of a quarter of an hour ago passing into sturdy little artisans through the miraculous influence of soap and water xnd if thir tour of investigation had been proposed to him he would certainly have come to the con clusion that the triumphant displays in the arena are the results of wellplanned organization behind the scones
