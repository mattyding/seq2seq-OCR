tile ltya l observa tory grbeen tvjfby ancient custom the first s atorday in juno is held as visitation day at the royal observatory o that day tho board of visitors make their annual round of inspection and afterwards the members of the general world of astronomy assemble by special invitation of the president of tho board this year as usual large numbers availed thumselves of the opportunity and visited the observatory on saturday ahe chioe tele scopes were au rentres of attraction especially the great equatorial of in aperture in the completed wing of the newv pliysical observatory a colitetion of solar and stellar photographs vas on view and also the highlyfinished apparatus used for measuring them the iugenious and in some cases intricate instruments of the magnetic and meteorological departmuent were features of interest laere also was to be eeen a diagram showing the close agreement between the curves of magnctic and solarsurfac disturbance in the intervals of scientific devotion the guests cartook of the  tea and cracknels  which an old statute quaintly ordains shall be provided for their refreshtnent tho board of visitors assembled at  oclock in sir christopher wvrens octagon room to hear the astnoxosaer royal ruad his anneal report the first section deals with structural alterations lnd states that the south wiug of the newr physical observatory completed last year has been brought into userelieve the pressure in the chronometer and computin rooms the building of the north wing and centraq dome had been much delayed first by the frost and then by failure in the supply of terra cotta the building of the new altazmmuth pavilion was nearly completed and the heavy portions of the instrument bad been placed on the pier provision had been made in the navy estimates for the erection in greenwich park of a magnetic pavilion which it is proposed to establish in the immediate neighbourhood of the observatory but at such a distance that there would be no suspicion of disturbance from the iron in the build ings a useful modern convenience has been added to the observatory in the form of an electriclight installait was mentioned in the last teport that a new photo graphic telescope of in aperturo the genlerouq gift of sir henry rthompson had been ordered for the observatory from sir howard grubb the objectglass bad been made and delivered and good progress had been made with the mechanical work the part of the report dealing with the observations states that with the transit circle the sun moon planets and funda mental stars have been regularly observed on the meridian and though the weather has been much less favourable than last year as large a number of observa tions has been obtained the annual catalogue of stazr observed in  contains  stars durmg the ear the observations of the pole star from  to  have been discussed with the old altazimuth observations of the moon and certain stars have been regularly made the construction of the new alt azmth is pacticaly completed under the heading of the great euatorial it is stated that the new in refractor has been in use throughout the year and is quite satisfactory the spectroscope has been mounted in teh telescope be sud a new one specially ada tad for photography viith tho in is ndow being mad by mr simms the old position micrometer origially made for the iu blera has been adapted for us with the in after some trouble and measures of  doublestars have been made with it on  nights in  of these the distance between the two stars was under id and in  vwas o or under in particular tho compo nents of the star Â£pegasi though only  apart were distinctly separated with a power of  lseasures havo also been made of the positions of the satellites of mars and saturn  of the diameters of jupiter and his satelltes and of the dimensions of saturn and his rings several attempts were also made to measure jupiters fifth sateuite but the results were discordanturing the year times of disappearance and reappear ance of stars occulted by the moon have been observed with various instruments particularly on the occasion of the total lunar eclipse of amarch  when  observa tions were recorded by  observers cometary observa tions have been made with the sheepshanks equatorial in with the astrographic equatorial of the international photographic survey  plates have been taklen on  nights of these  have been rejected from atmospheric or other accidental causes the region of the heavens allotted to greenwich for the survey is that within deg of the north pole ancd the work is now far advanced at least so far as the plates of the catalogue ceries to show stars down to the ilth magni tude are concerned in the case of the plates for the chart of stars down to the th mnagmtude which require min exposare progress has for obvious reasons been somewhat less rapid besides the routine work for the survey several miscellaneous photographs have been taken weather has in general been un favourable for photography during the past year and further work was stopped for two months by the damage done to the dome during the gale of decem ber  systematic measurement of the plates for the survey was begun on october in regard to spectroscopic observations since decem ber  vhen the s ectroscope was adjusted on the in s measures have been made of the displacement of the f line in the spectra of  stars and  of the o line in the spectra of four some experiments have also been made ia photographic work a record of the olar surface has been secured on  days during the year and the gaps being filed by indian and mann tius photographs there are only a few days left un recorded lhe mean daily spotted area of the sun was only slightly smatler in i than in  the marked falling if ain the spring of  noted in the last report being followed by an increase during the summer the number of sunspots was greater than in  the spring of the present year has shown a decline both in the number and area of spots the variations of magnetic declination horizontal and vertical force and of earth currents have been registered photographically and accompanying eye observations carried on as in former years lncreased magnetic activity was shown in the year  and great disturbances occurred on july u aud august  in july and augest the dis turbances in the earthcurrent registers caused by the south london electric itailway showved a great increase presumably due to the experiments theu being made in the use of motors on the carriages of the railway instead of separate locomotivesduring the  months ended april  the highest daily temperature recorded was deg on july g it exceeded deg on seven days only as compared with  in the preceding year the sumnmer of  was cold and wet in marked contrast to the hot and bright summer of  the rainfall in in the three months june to august exceeded the average by an inch and a half te severe frost which set in on december  and continued with slight intermission until mfarch  was the moat remarkable meteorological feature of the year the cold wave extended from  december  to  miarch

bright sunshine recorded was  out of the  hours during which the sun was above the horizon in the corresponding year ending may   the number was  hours the rainfall was in which is about the average the number of days on which rain fell wras lhe permanent staff of the observatory at present consists of a chief assistant five firstclass and three secondclass assistants and a clerk in addition  computers and a skilled mechanician are emploved the whole number of persons regularly engaged is  two vacancies among the secondclass assistants have not been filed owing to delay in deciding the question of reorganization of the staff and it is stated that great difficulty has been experienced during the past year in carrying on the growing work of the observatory some words of tribute are given to the zeal and energy dis played by the assistants and computersin the general remarks which conclude the report the astronomerroyal cnlls attention to the inconveni ence caused by delay in providing muchneeded building accommodation the astronomerroyal also complaiin that the scheme providing for the strengthening of the supervising power in the higher brauches and also for the appointment of a larger permanent staff of trained observers with a viow to preservinz continuity in the observations still remains under tee eonsideiation ofthe governement after a delay of s monthls hle statesthat sncb a shelving of a vital question must paralyse the activity whibch progress demands aud that it is to be feared that a complete dislocation of the work may result from further delay
