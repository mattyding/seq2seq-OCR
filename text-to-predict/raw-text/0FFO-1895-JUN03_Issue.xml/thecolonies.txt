the coloniesthe victorian parliament was opened on wednesday and it is satisfactory to learn that the first measures which are to occupy the atten tion of me houwe are to be the federalenabling ill and tho proposals based on the recommen dations of tho tariff commissionthe federal enabling bill it will be remem bered is a bill by which in accordance with the resolution of the conference of premiers held at hobart in the early part of the year the proposals of a federation convention may be submitted directly to the people of each austra lian colony notwitbstanding the warm pro fessions of devotion to the federal cause which make themselves heard from time to time in the leading colonies of eastern australia and the constant illustrations which are supplied by the course of external events of the benefit which the australian continent might derivo from an amalgamation of its interests the practical ques tion of federation makes so little progress that it is difficult to believe in the reality of the movement western australia with its lately developed mineral wealth and tho many interests which are involvod in sudden pro sperity and recentlyacquired political auto nomy may well be excused if the directors of its policy have their attention concentrated upon internal questions as a colony it is almost too young to take a responsible position in relation to the affairs of the australian con tinent south australia has preoccupations of a more or less parochial nature which while she professes a general sympathy with the federal movement leave her as a matter of fact indiffer ent to its progress initiatory action in the matter must evidently come from the three great colonies of the eastern coast whose interests are most deeply involved of theso three queensland is to some extent shackled by the questions of coloured labour and northern separation which divide opinion within her borders and have some influence on the view taken by her electorate of federatiou newv south walea and victoria re main as tho two colonies most clearly interested in carrying the sentiment in favour of federation to a practical issue either of thom might very properly take the lead for to both the advan tages to be gained by federation are substantial in new south wales the man who ought to be at the head of the niovement is unquestionably sir henry parkes he unfortunatelyhas not taken his own position seriously he has allowed him self to be distracted by side issues of a merely personal significance from wbat might have been the crowning labour ofl his life and the progress of federmtion appears to be indefinitely set back ininew south wales by party quarrelling of the least admirable kind victoria is thus designated by process of elimination as the colony to which we mus look for any practical lead in the federation nmovemuent it victoria canl do nothing there seems no escape from the assumption that opiniou in australia is not yet ripe for such a movement as that which assured the prosperity of canada a quarter of a century agoyet scarcely a week passes without some practical demonstration ot the natural solidarity of australian interests anl of the inconvenience arising from their artificial subdivision the average rate of interest on the canadian debt is  the average rate of interest on the aus tralasian debt is   tle difference in price of canadian and australian stock bearing the same rates of iuterest is a further indication of the value at which tho public hold their respective securities nor can there be any reasonable doubt that a federated australia would give to an australian stock the same steadiness that has been long enjoyed by canada every loan that is issued by an australian colony whether it be for purposes of redemption or for fresh expendi ture supplies a practical argument for federation so do the public movements in which the velfare of australia is concerned the construction of the pacific cable and the establishment of a single atlantic and pacific mail service would probably before now have been resolved upon had a federated australia been in a position to pro nounce as decidedly as canada in favour of opening furthier communication between her markets and tho markets of the world the im patienco of new south wvales expressed by the perhaps less than diplomatic telegram of mr eid on the subject of the delay which has taken place in tho appointment of a successor to sirobiert duff would have had no reason for exist ence if tho imperial government were as in the case of canada obliged to concern itself only with the appointment of one governorgeneral for the federated colonies the post of governor general of australia might be offered as is that of governorenearal of canadla with some assurauce ox acceptance to men of a rank and standing befitting the dignity of the position whereas it is now an open secret that the deiay which takes piaco in the appointment of aus tralasian governors arises almost wholly from the difficulty of inducing any suitable person to accept the post tradition has attached to the principal australian governorships a necessity for expeniditure which limits selection to men of independent income the resolutions lately passed by the various legislatures to reduce the salary hitherto voted to the govornors have in creased the difficulty not only by making the private expenditure of tho governor so much the greater but also by diminishing the dignity accorded by public estimation to tee positionin victoria the tariff proposals will we are in formed be introduced this week what they may be is as yet only vaguely known but although tho commissioni has pronounced itself in favour of the reduction of duty upon many articles mr turner the premier has within the last few weeks declared himself too warmly in favour of the protective principle to allow of any very sanguine expectations on the part of the advocates of free trade some diminution of customs is however confidently expected and the realization of the full amount calculated for incometax returns places the government in a position to carry out without danger to the exchequer aiiy recommendations of the tariff commission to which they are inclined to give effectin south africa a wave of protectionist feeling has been aroused by the energy of australian exporters who have endeavoured to establish a trade in foreign meat the tariff of the cape colony put an import duty of d a pound upon all salt or preserved meats but imposed none upon froten meat an attempt was accordingly mado to send frozen mutton from australia and the customs officers decided that as it was neither salt nor preserved in the sense intended by the framers of the tariff it must be admitted free something like a panic appears to have been created by the occurrence amongst the parliamentary representatives of the south african pastoral interest and an immediate demand was made upon the government to amend the tariff by the imposition of the practi cally prohibitive duty of d a pound upon frozen mutton notwithstanding tho obvious argument that the protection of the pastoral interost must in common fairness be follonved by the protection of the agricultural interest and that duties on meat are only too likely to lead to duties on grain in a colony where food is already as dear as it is anywhere in the world the pastoral interest has apparently been strong enough to carry its point almost without opposi tion and the tarift amendment bill placing a duty of d a ound upon frozen meat has passed rls second readng in the assemblyby a majority of  to nine it says little for the enterprise of south african pastoralists that they were not prepared to compete in price in their own markets with the products of australia which have to be carried over  miles of sea nor does it proraise well for the prospects of south african support to the prineiples of free trade within the lem pire that the imposition of n high duty upon foodi stuffs should bo the fsrst result of thft attempt of a sister colony to establish mutual trade relations sir gordon sprigg who is theoretically a freetrader justified thet action of the cape governmeent on the groundl that the farmers of the colony wvould be rnimed if australian meat was suffered to come in free and that revenue wvouldl conlsequently suffer mlr rhodes ande other members of the government ppear to have acquiesced ini this view and im the pioimnary ndebate pi which aone thek fullaccount has reached this country only one member of the assembly mr tamplin was found to defend the theory of free trade and cheap food mir rhodes has frankly owned him self to be an opportunist in this matter and attributes his ability to open the markets of south africa to the manufactures of great britain largely to the fact that there are no manufacturing interests to compete with in south africa the action of the cape house of assembly in the matter of australian meat shows what is to be expected from his dutch supporters should they at any time believe their interests to be assailed by a too liberal acceptance of the economic theories of great britain
