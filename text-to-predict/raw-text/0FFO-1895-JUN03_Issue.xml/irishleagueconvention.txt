great and chivalrous englishmen there had always been and now more than ever were there those who recognized the justice of the cause of the irisb national league cheers of such in past times he instanced the im mortal british statesman fox john stuart mill and later on in the course of events their ilustrious friend mr gladstone loud cheers lwlhat he asked had they to be afraid of as regarded the future of the irish nation so long as they had england and scotland and a great part of wales a voice all wales  for their backers and myriads of sympathizers all over the world cheersmr j dillon mr in replying to the toast of the irish parliamentary party said it was  years since the foundation and construction of this party had been seriously undertaken and it had over come what had appeared to be unsurmountable difficul ties as compared with the years sos when they were only  or  in number with more than  opponents in the house of commons now their position was one of pride and power for their numbers they had shown t at they could be as troublesome as any of the same number of men could be anywhere and should occasion arise they could do so again there was nothing they could be so proud of as their history for the last ten years during which they had stuck faithfuuy solidly and steadily to the english liberal party they had aided the english liberals in their restoration to power and it could never be effaced from their memory how the radical rank and file had refued to abandon the cause of irish liberty because of the defeat in  it had been their task to show the irish people that by peaceable and constitutional agitation they could win the liberties of their country the question they had now to ask themselves was had the radical leaders in the present government honestly done their best to get home rule for ireland and he said theyhad cheers that allisnce with the liberals had been an enormous step and as to those newcomers into the fray who would tallk of breaking the alliance he would treat their intelligence with contempt and scom cheers on their part the liberal party had seen that they had sufficient selfcontrol and consideration and steadiness and foresight to prove themselves allies whose friendship was worth cultivatingafter mir j f x oburin had made a few remarks as zo his  years eperience in the rans of the nationalist party the thanks of the assembly were given to the organizers of the dair and the proceedings terminatedyesterday was held the convention demonstration which induded a monster procession in the streets and a meeting of  persous m the coliseum the chair man was arr t p oconnor lp and the same irish nationalist leaders were present as on saturday no west riding constituencies had parliamentary repre sentatives on the platformthe cnramma said that owing to the action of the lords day observance society no charge eould be made for admission  therefore a colleetion would be made the convention on the previous day had been in all respects the most orderly practically wise and nearly unanimous that he had ever known the first topic he dealt with was the attitude of the irish party to the present government during the last three years the irish party had brought home to the world certain facts which were not generally known before when they took up a position in an alliance they knew what they were doing and would stand by what they promised they wiere bound to regard their country as the supreme consideration and it was quite consistent woithi thatpoliey to take a strong and deep interest in theyuby democratic policy of the liberal party in this countrythe two millions of irishmen dwelling in great britaim belonged almost entirely to the working casses a large proportion of whom were unskilled labourers and it was the duty of this league as guardians of those peoples welfare to take a share in upholding every lemocratic measure the object of which was to improve the moral and material condition of the masses ear hear as to ireland the only men who could justly and wisely govern ireland were irishmen and it was part of the gospel of this league that the most enlightened englishmen could not govern ireland as she ought to be governed cheers he askedhad ireland waited long enough for selfgovernment she had the most urgent case and most tragic reasons for her demand that ever any nation could or had put forth where had there been such material and terrible losses such continued and gigantic losses as were those of ireland by her depopulation during the last  years  ireland today and for years had been literally a land of desola tion nine millions of people had been reduced to four and a half through the barbarous mismanagement of england hear hear re had this word of advice to give to tories and liberal unioniststhat so long as this league had behind it a united ireland so long the irish party would remain amid all change vicissitudes and fluctuations a permanent factor in british politics and in the house of commons cheers god forbid that the irish party should be divided but to postpone the relief of ireland for one hour was a crime against ireland and against humanity cheers a long resolution having been moved approving of the policy of the irish party led by mr carthy and giving a pledge of unalterable fidelity to the cause of self government for ireland it was hastily declared to have been carried unanimouslymir mcanhy mp was then called upon for only a very brief sjeechbecause of delicate health and he was rollowedflie john iillon mp who said the majority againt home rule even in great britain as a whole had greatly decreased and in yorkshire durham and the north of england and in scotland and wales the cause of ireland was far more hopeful now than ever had yet been the case cheers in every district of britain with the exception of one which used to be honourably associated with the cause of freedom the cause of home rule held the field and carried the day cheers the defection of the midlands was due to one man only  but practically a majority of the british electors were in favour of home rule the present government might have too many irons in the lira but it was a difficulty always inseparable from the party of porgress but still now for the first time since the ujnion ireland was ruled by the ordinary law of the land instead of being the pandemonium of crime as it once was ireland today was more peaceable than anv other part of the ujnited kingdom and from this it followed that if ireland had been treated with humanity and decency there would bave been no necessity for coercion acts which disgraced the statutebook the unionists he said had no proposal for solving the irish question ireland could be governed for a million less money tbau it now costs the british government and whatever the future might bring forth irish nationalists would go on fighting for the restoration of the rights of the irish peepiea vote of thanks to the chairman was passed
