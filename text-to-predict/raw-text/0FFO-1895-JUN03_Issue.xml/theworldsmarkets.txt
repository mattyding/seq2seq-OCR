me worlds markets for american i productsa new series of bulletins under the above title has been inaugurated by the united states department of agriculture and it is significant that the first number consisting of nearly  pages should be devoted ex clusively to great britain and ireland the title page bears the motto  agriculture is the foundation of manufactures and commerce and the ron j ster ling morton secretary of agriculture contributes a preface dated may  in which the object of these buuetins is succinctly set forth the united states eod in foreign markets during the fiscal year  £ worth of american produets to which the united states farmers contributed £ worth or  per cent of the whole hence it is deemed expedient that the worlds markets aud their demands for american farm products shouid be made familiar to all tne producers of the united states accordingly on december  last air morton sent a circular o nquiry to all united states consuls and commercial agents asking with reference to each foreigu district a series of questions as to the demand for live stock cereals dailry products meats cotton tobacco fruits liquors and seeds it was desired to ascertain  is there a considerable consumption of the products named   do consumers depend and to what extent on importations for their supply   if so what countries faraish the major portion   how are the products sold and at what price s  are the prices paid for american relatively higher or lower than those yaid for similar products from other countries   are there criticisms of any american groducts and what defects are charged if any  kuggestions were invited upon any points such as might induce the people in each consular district to rely more largely unon the supply of their needs by the united states rlecommendations were also sought as to how goods should be put up and on any other points which would be likely to prove of service in promoting the demand for american agricultural productsmr morton remarks that in the five years ended december   the united kingdom of great britain and ireland imported to the value of  and simultaneously exported to the value of  during the period named the above figures show that her inports exceeded her exports by about three billion dollars say j stcrling and yet it is not contended that with this apparent so called i balance of trade  against her great britain grew poorer during those vfie years on the contrary it is claimed tbat having taken in moro than she put out tho apparent deficiency of exports repre sents the three billions of profits made by the engish people during that period of time in an international trafic aggregating  or an annual avelage trade of  such is mr mortons argument and in promising to issue bauetins of a similar character relating to other foreign countries he remarks  the relatively large place however filled by the united eingdom in the trade of the world and particularlr in the foreign trade of the uijted states naturally assigius to the markets of that country the first place in a series of publications of thisabout onehalf of the bulletin is devoted to a com preheusive summary of the agriculture commerce and foreign trade of the junted kingdom the foliowijig quotation may serve to illustrate the keen observations which the bunted states agents bestowl upon other competitors in the english market  the aompara tively limited trade in chilled beef is in our hands an aittem t wrasmaedrn thyer°o sda chlacrofromn australia bet it was not a success oigto the long distance our chilled beef ia apearauce condition and flavour is far superior to tfie defrosted beef from the antipodes this frozen beef trade made a slight increase in quantity during the year but on the whole it has been an unsatisfactory year to the australians who killed their own market by irregularity of shipment once two carroes arrived together and again three and there being lack of storago facilities there were forced saless the re mnaining half of the bulletin is ocupied with consular reports from bradford newcastle tunstall southamn ton cardiff swansea newport and londonderryitn the brad orta report we read the english people feel that the question of reciprocity should enter into the matter of trade the are as they say the largest conmumers of american produce and yet they are begrudged the small percentage of american trade in a textile way that they now secure the united states consul at bouthampton remarks that the english people are very discriminating in the matter of eatables and have no arbitrary prejudices that might interfere wvith the enjoyment uf a good dinnwer  they are apt therefore to disregard economy and other restraminin considerations and to purchase the superior prdduct

agricultural producers of the united states will no doubt have the effect of improving the quality of the american products sent into our markrets it is not less important that english farmers should know what steps are contemplated by their formidable competitors beyonl the atlantic the producing and exporting capacity of whom is fostered and stimulated by an energetic and farseeing miinster of
