mbmoir of ebrbe edmundstreet ramr street had the honour of a restingplace and a monument in westtainster abbey but the real memorials to him have risen all over eng land and are scattered about the continenteven to the banks of the bospborue his was a life of indefatigablo and various activity  the list of the churches and secular buildings he either con structed or restored as it is appended to his life strikes onewith respeotful astonishment that practical tribute td his high reputation is the best proof that the memoir although written by his son ison the whole not overpar tial professionaljealiousy in some caseshonest differences of opinion in many moreinvolved mr street in many controversies and made him the object of much bitter criticism he was a man of decided views and deep ecclesiastical convictions he not only carried as many think to an ex treme his ideas as to the unrivalled adaptability of the gothic to english edifices and the english atmosphere but he had pronounced opinions as to the internal arrangements of churches with regard to decorative symbolism and the fitting accommodation of congregations consequently he had to fight many a battle not only with the champions of rival architectural schools but with zealous low churchmen resenting the ritualistic designs identified with romanism the law courts of which he was the joint architect with mr barry pro voked some violent personal attacks which proved a sore trial to his temperindeed we are told that they killed him yet his son assures us that though with his natural frankness he could be outspoken enough on occasion he was never pro voked to use language which he had reason after wards to regret the memoir gives a pleasant picture of a singularly successful life passed in an almost uninterrupted round of enjoyments for his whole soul was in the congenial pursuit which absorbed all his faculties  his holidays were earnest work in a somewhat lighter form  he enjoyed excellent health commissions kept pouring in upon him and he gained the highest professional honours he could hope to attain wvith the exception of two sad domestic bereave ments late inlife he had a long and rare exemp tion from sorrow and he died in the harness he would have been loath to quithis artistic tastes were pronounced and he was put into training very early an elder brother devoted to church architecture made him almost from childhood the companion of his rambles those tastes were developed and culti vated by a residence at exeter where he was rapt in contemplation of the cathedral and regular in attendance at the services his family were proud of his sketches and resolved to encourage his precocious inclinations he was sent to study drawing under an uncle and subsequently articled to an architect coming to london he showed some specimen drawings to messrs scott and moffatt who immediately offered him temporary employment so well were they satis fied that the temporary engagement became a per manent one and he remained with them until he took courage to start on his own account his quiet selfconfidence thenn and subsequently is striking his son mentions as another example of it that no sooner was he in receipt of a moderate income than he began to make a some what costly collection of paintings which would have been grossly imprudent had he been predestined to failure the calling of an architect is perhaps the most specula tively hazardous of all professions but streets foresight was not at fault from the day when by a piece of good luck he got a first com mission for a cornish church his progress was steady and rapid when only  he was ap pointed architect to the diocese of oxford although as he volunteered to perform the duties gratuitously it was promotion without pay itwas in that year he made the first of those flying foreign trips which were to be his favourite re creation to the last the extent of ground he could cover against time is wellnigh incredible yet all his powers were perpetually on the alert his sketch book was seldom out of his hand and when he cuitted the train or the diligence to strike into side paths he strode forward with a knapsack on his shoulders that he made the best of his time and never  scamped  his observations is shown by the fact that ho found the materials respec tively for his books on the italian churches andgothicarchitecture in spain in the course of a few weels rapid touring in the earlier of those trips he demonstrates his independence of judg ment in his expression of original views he pro nounces the cologne ehurches to be unsketchable and not to his taste  he declares that the cathe dral is more and more distasteful to him going on to give his reasons in detail his first great hit was when he gained the second prize in open competition for a design for the restoration of lille cathedral shortly afterwards he was called upon to undertake the crimean memo rial church at constantinople next he threw himself zealously into the competitionfor the new government offices he ranked second among  candidates who were commended and  was not on the whole dissatisfied with the result a premium of ï¿½ was awarded to him and he spent it in an italian tour which was doubly profitable to him as for his judges he charitably forgave them their lack of dis crimination in not placing him firston the ground of their evident bias against the gothic with his everincreasing professional engagements he still spared some time to society his friendships seem to have been chiefly among the rising painters but he was in the habit of going to brobinsons celebrated sunday breakfasts where he made the acquaintaneo of mr gladstone who invited him to breakfast in turn differing from the great man in politics though he had  an intense per sonal admiration for his talents he went in tear and trembling but he found his entertainer very friendly and was gratified by some compli ments on bis italian bookpaid at a distinguished little partymr arthur street has much that is interesting to say as to the manner of his fathers work and the feelings which inspired it earnest though unostentatious religion was intimately bound up with his work and exercised a very real and very appreciable influence on its character he held firmly to the gothic because it was in his eyes the best of all styles the most flexible the most national and therefore the best adapted to our climate as it was the most richlyendowed with a capacity for general adapt ation as a high churchman he held that all architecture should conduce to making the services of the church acts of real worship  and as churchwarden of all saints miargaretstreet he had opportunities of putting his principles in practice ho maintained that churches whether old or new should serve their veritable purpose even at a sacrifice of beauty to internal decora tion he paid great attention and to the effec tive use of staided glass of mosaics and coloured marbles  and in imitation of the decorations of the olden time he did  original and beautiful work in hangings his ideas are interesting as to the character im pressed on local chureh architecture by thenature of the materials in the neighbourhood in his own opinion one of the most satisfactory things he ever executed was the little church of kingston in dorset where he had carte blanche from lord eldon for marble from the ptir beck quarries  street must have had a rare facility for sketching hand and eye were in per fect unison so that  a mistake seemed out of the question strange to say he would draw with as firm a touch in bitter cold as if sitting in his own snug room at home what we may call his mechanical talent was just as ready and we are told of some remarkable tours de force where he dashed off mtricate architectural plans on the spurof themomentasif they had beencare fully drawn byrule and compass his business life was so overcrowded that he did most things in hasteif not in a hurry yet he grudged notrouble in the personal supervision of even such matters as ironwork he was perpetually travelling on business over the length and breadth of england he would scribble off notes by the dozen in the train and it was in the train when he had no business correspondence to despatch that he did much of his readingwe shall not touch on the somewhat envenomed bmemoir of george edmund street ra   by his songs edmund arthur treet john   way controversies over the building of the law courts and the selection of a site over the restoration of christ church cathedral where a cross of streets proved a stumbling block to certain well meaning persons  or the restoratiorn of st albans abbey where he came in sharp conflict with lord grimthorpe if these quarrels vexed him he had little time to brood over them and he found relief from his annoyances in other worlk on the th of ovember  he was sketching at salisbury and afterwards transacted business with the dean that evening lie had aslight paralytic stroke shortly afterwards there came a second and in a month to a day he was gone
