zondon friday january  since we last wrote on the subject of national iefence it has been elucidated by a ntmber of interesting letters from correspondents well entitled to represent different phases of naval and military opinion beneath many superficial con tradictions it is gratifying to note a great deal of ubstantial agreement men who seom to others and even to themselves to be attacking one another with considerable vivacity turn out upon closer examination to be merely approaching the same point by slightly different paths the memorial presented to lond salisbuy by the five ports appeared to some to advocatealarminglyerroneous views of national defence but cairam grefell has since explained that had the ports been asked what is the best method of protecting our com merce and our coasts they would have repliec without hesitation  increase the navy lie in turn thinks the volunteer home defence association a  fad while andma colomb one of the most energetic advocates of an increased navy adheres to it as the natural complement of a navy completely commanding the sea we might multiply similar examples of distinctions strenuously maintained in which no real differ ence upon essentials is involved such distinc tions are inevitable in the earlier stages of discussion upon a complicated subject  but as they are discovered they ought to be discarded as far as possible in order that there may be no excuse for ignorant or interested persons to raise ehe obstructive cry that the experts are all at odds on the contrary the experts are all agreed that the navy is our first line of defence and the only one capable of defending our interests in their totality they are agreed that the navy as it now exists is inadequate for the work which it alone can perform they are agreed that the strengthening of the navy in all its branches is especially in view of the possibilities of european complicationsthe first and most imperative duty ofthe governmont they are also agreed notwith standing apparent disagreement that the strengthening of the navy does not exhaust the possibilities or the needs of national defence local defences are also required of very great strength at such points as portsmouth and plymouth of less formidablo character inthe case of great commercial ports where serious destruc tion of capital might be effected although no vital blow could be struck at our national security and of a slighter character still at places offering little temptation to an assailanton questions of degree there are differences of opinion and there will be to the end of the ehapter it is unfortunate indeed that on the main question the reinforcement of the navy such differences do not emerge because the navy is below the strength at which the most moderate and most easily satisfied reformer would wish to see it on that question the country awaits with ansiety and not without impatience the develop raent of the govenmments views which ought certainly to be placed before us in a matured form apt the earliest possiblemoment afterthe meeting of parliament loxd snunaw has a splendid opportunity of doi a gretaatiorial service with the full concurrence and suppor of public opinion and we sincerely hope that it may be utilized to initiate the largest and most comprehbnsive sheme of naval reinforcemnent that canbe made compatible with economical and judicious executio it ought at the same time to be of a character to uitiliie much more fully than has hithrto been done the enormous latent resources of the country in the shapo of shipbuilding and the manufacture of ordnance by judicious patronage of private firms we secure a power of expansio in case of need tha value of which can hardlly be over rated it is impossibie to think without angry impatience of tke mismanagement by which that advantage has been  so completely lost in the matter of guns tliat a dozein costly ships have to lie useless in our docks for wantof armament for siuch criminal blundering neither energy nor toney can atone time alone can enable us to overtale the worl we have left un done and whether or not adequate time will be allowed us dopends not upon our volition but upon a score of accidents over which we have no control so far as regards money it is fortunate that the finances of tho country are in very strong hands other chan cellors of the exchequer have displayed a mastery of figures which cannot be surpassed but it would not be easy to name one who can compete with mi goschen in practical knowledge of the motive forces of the financial world or in capacity to wield them for the execution of great national purposes the work he has done and is doing is of a kind altogether different from the disposal of magnificent surpluses and the remission of taxation rendered superfluous by in creasing prosperity ha may be trusted both to take a large and statesmanlike view of the expenditure required to secure our national safety anad to  provide the necessary funds with the smallest possible strain upon our resourcesas to tho minor branch of the subject of national defence the differences of opinion which for the present defy resolution seem to depend to a considerable extent upon a lackof exact definition of terms command of the sea for example is uised in very different senses by different writers it seems to be supposed by some that le cannot have command of the sea until we sweep all other fleets off it that is not the strategical meaning of the phrase as regards the defence of our coasts any more than command of a tract of country by a general means that he must have destroyed all his enemys forces we command the sea for purposes of home defence when the fleet guarding our shores is so powerfal that no enemy dares to attack in force at any point such command of course depends in part upon absolute strength and in part upon strategy while it exists the defence of our ports against attack in force is complete although not one of them can point to ships in the offing detailed for its special protection some people seem to findc difficulty in grasping the idea that a port is perfectly safe so long as the enemy cannot get at it there are attacks which may be made even although we have command of the sea and they may in some circumstances do a good deal of mis chief but they imust be made by stealth in great haste and at very considerable risk they will be made by a particular class of ship the offensive and defensive power of which will be limited by prudential considerations when we speak of defending a port against attack our fleet having command of the sea we have to con sider the nature of the attack that may be reason bly expected if woaretg protect our ports against the most powerful ships the enemy possesses we must make up our minds to a very large expenditure indeed it means studding our shoreswith firstclass forts dnointing the heaviest guns if any one seriously advocatas such a thing the reply is that the money would be much better laid out in increasingthe fleet so as to make a visit by an ironclad certain to result in its own destruction something much more moderato would give efficient subsidiary protection even to our most important ports while as the chance of doing serious mischief diminishes so does the readiness of an enemy to risk his own vessels in attempting it when we get down to mere wateringplaces presenting an indeterminate mass of dwellinghouses the risk of bomibardrient becomes comparatively small the shells would cost at least as much as all the bricks and mortar they would knocl down and the ship that fired them nvould run very serious risk of destruction if our navy were at all fit for its work
