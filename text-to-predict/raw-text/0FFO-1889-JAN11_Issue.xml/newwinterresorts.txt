chiteau which was destroyed at the first french revolution the attention of visitors travellers by rail from lyons to rimes will observe that one of the smaller stations on the line is named beaulieu yet they may not know that a large number of dolmens in the neighbourhood render the locality interesting to the antiquary on the right bank of the river dordogne in the department of the corre is

more commonly belloc the beaulieu on the right bank of the river indre is a manufacturing town which is visited by tourists on account of its abbey church which was built at the beginning of the th centuryand has been partially a ruin since the th but of which enough remains to impress and gratify the hehoider none of these places nor of others which i might name can compare as a health resort with the beaulieu which is in the department of the maritime alps which looks upon the mediterranean and which is the winter resort i am about to describecomparatively few persons out of the many thousands who journey by rail between nice and mentone ever stop at the beaulieu which is the third station after leaving nice by the in habitants of nice this beaulieu has long been held in high esteem many of them spend the summer months there in villas which are built on a promontory facing east during the winter season it is a place of resolt for pleasureseekers a large restaurant situated in a garden and having a tenace facing the seawhere persons may dine or sup in the open airis as much frequented in the season as the trafalgar or ship at green wich or the star and garter at richmond it is scarcely necessary to say that it is called  restaurant de la reserve a restauint of that namo is famous at marseilles and the name is adopted by others along the mediterranean the people of provence displaying more imagination in telling stories than in inventing new names for hotels and restaurants wyhen a wtredding takes place at nice it is considered a becoming arrange mont to have the wedding feast in a restaurant at beaulieuin  minutes by rail and  minutes by road one reaches beaulieu from nice as a place where the nicois go to amuse themselves it is fraught wvith pleasant memories to them this was exhibited in a curious way two years ago when early in the morning of the d of february an earthquake shook the houses and frightened botl the inhabitants of nice and the strangers sojourning there hundreds started for beaulleu as soon as possible in the hope of beinz safe there the hotels of beaulieu were crowdea with persons who were satisfied to sleep in the passages rather than not find shelter wvhy beaulieu was supposed to be a place of safetyhas never been explained as it was small place the damage done there was on a small scale and was less apparent than the damage wrought in many of the nice houses and public buildings two structures in beaulieu were entirely wrecked inside though externally they looked uninjured the one by the small railway station where the stationmaster lived with his family the other boinn the still smaller police office where a singte policeman lived and where there wvas accommodation for a few prisoners notwith standing the fact of the earthquake having shaken beaulieu as wvell as other places along the coast many persons felt more comfortable there and for several weeks after the morning on which the first shocks occurred the hotels and villas were more crowded than they had ever been beforestrictly speaking eaulieu is a suburb of villefranche it may soon be constituted an in dependent commune and enjoy the measure of selfgovernment which the inhabitants desire the place is a group of villas and though it has a boulevard tvhich was formed in  there is nothing of the town and but little of the village about it in the boulevard there is a large store where nearly everything can be had from a joint of meat to a ound of tea  there is a caf there elso and a cobblers shop on the mountain slope behind this boulevard as well as along the boulevard itself aro villas of recent construction wvhich enjoy the double advantage of complete protection fromthe cold winds and a full exposure to the sun from its rising to its setting the mountains form a semicircle behind thehouses so entirely sheltered are some of the nooks that flowers and plants flourish as well there in the open air during winter as they would do in a hot house there is a special section which bears the name of  little africa  on account of its rarmth during the coldest season of the year on this part of the mediterranean these slopes are woocded with olives and are green all the year round at first sight the green of an olive tree is unpleasing it is too dark and dead the leaves have not the vivid tints which make those of an oak or a beech a maple or a pineso brilliant when the sun shines on them it is only in repose however that the olivo branch seems dismal when the small light leaves are agitated by the breeze their lower sides are seen to be as silvery as those of the willow and the contrast between the deep green op the one side and the white hue of the other produces an effect which is indescribably beautiful at the most frequented spots along the riviera the grand old olive trees which have outlived countless governments and maany dynasties are giving dlace to houses which are largely built of dhied mud which look as fresh as a dolls house vhen bought at a toy shop and which qo to pieces as was seen at mentonedlurmig the earthquake as fast as a childrens toy when roughly handled one of the charms of beaulien is that it has not yet been overbuilt and so long as the villas remain few in number it will be a small earthly paradise several eligiblebuilding sites were pointed out to me and rwas told they could not be utilized because they were the properties of some old ladies who had rejected the most temptina offers for them the longer these old ladies live and the stiffer they remain in their opinion the better will it be for beaulieu in one of the most beautiful passages which mr ruskin has penned he depiets man as the great destroyerand acquits time of having smitten wvith his remorseless scythe all that is best worth preserving in nature or art if he had spoken of the builder and the speculative builder in par t cular instead of man in general he would have given precision to his censiue whether in a london or parisian suburb whether on the shores of southern england or on those of southern france the monster who works more mischiefthan the terrible dragon which turner painted is he who substitutes hideous houses for beautiful shrubs and trees destroying in an hour what itaturo had taken centuries to bring to perfectioni am not surprised ildeed that those who canafford the luxury of a villa within sight of the mediterranean should havo chosen a site for it at beaulieu and i must admit that no buildings have yet ldssenied the natural charms of the spot even along the highroad whiuh now runs near the margin of the sea from nice to monaco the new houses are few in number when the mistral blows as it doos herewith a violence as great as the east wind does in the spring months in bng land and with as injutious efrects to those wviho are exposed t its force the delicate man or woman can alk for nearly a mile along the highwaybetween beaulieu and villefranche and not suffer fromi the wind so completely do the olive trees along the road break the force and virulence of the blast at cannes and nice at monte carlo and mentone there is no such pro tection the trees which used to afford it having been rooted up and cast into the fire where they make a prodigious quantity of smoke and give out scarcely any heat a few englishmen have built villas at beaulieu and hord salisbury is now building one he hs bought a piece of ground which is covered witholivctrees unless i am misinformed it extends over  acres so that his villa will stand in grounds of much larger extent than is the rule in this reion a native chapel stands at the lower part of the grounds if it be not ineludqd within them similar chapels are to be seece at intervals along the riviera  there is one halfway between kinte carlo and mentone service is held in them once or twice in the year the house which lord salisbury is building is far less pretentious to judge from the plans than some of the villas here which are architectural abominations it is a long building with two floorsand is so arranged that the utmost advantage is derived from the fine prospect in front the prospect is enchant ing but the situation has the possibla drawback of being not easily accessible the road from beaulieu to it is both steep and in bad condition that leading to and from villefranche is far better perhaps the spot was selected with the purpose of rendering the retirement more complete in any case the distinguished statesman whom cowper would call  the disencumberd atlas of the state can enjoy as absolute repose in his villa at beaulieu asa great statesman can enjoy anywhere but freedom from active toil in a countrys eause is more easily longed for than enjoyed for to quota cowper againbut ask the noble drudge in state affairsescaped from office and its constant careswhat charms he sees in freedoms smile expressd in freedom lost so long now repossessdthe tongue vhose strains were cogent as commands revered at home and felt in foreign lands shall own itself a stammerer in that cause or plead its silence as its best applausehowevor delightful the site and air may be of the spot where the statesman seeks for repose the temptation to leave it and  shine again in place  is almost irresistible still if such a temptation could be resisted with greater ease in one place more than anbother it would be in such a one as lord salisbury lhs chosen for a new abode and especially during those winter months when the sun shines brightly and  the air is heavy with perfume of flowers at beaulieu when in elnglaiid nature is dead and the air and sly appear to be in mourning for herwhile the newest villas have been built n or behind the boulerard which dates from  there are a few older houses on the road running by the sea near which there is a small bay and a fishing hamlet the church which is near at hand is an ancient edifice not far from it is a small fort to wvhich admission is strictly for bidden wkich appears to be garrisoned by one man and armed with some dismounted guns woe betide the unwary strangtr who stops too ong in front of the fort ee is certain to be taken as a spy andno matter what his nationality he will be called a german or at all events in the pay of germany at the hamlet of beaulieu there is a shop in which all things are sold from newspapers to tobacco and close to it is a barbers shop at the corner of the road and almost in front of these shops there is an olive tree which is classed among the gigantic speci mons of its kind and of which a few are to be found near the sea at the height of several feet froma the ground it is about ft in circum ferenee what its age is i do not know but if it were numbered by centuries i should not be surprised jutting out into the sea and forming one side of the bay of villefranche is the penin sula of st jean with the fishing village of that name near its southern extremity and from this the smaller and what may be called the sub sidiary peninsula of st hospice juts off in an easterly direction roads run round and from end to end of the larger peninsulaand villas with large gardens attached are dotted on either side of it fish abound here and tunny fish are cauaght during the season at some parts of the coast the curious fish called girelle abounds this fish is peculiar to the mfedi terranean it is the size of a sardineand is equally good eating in appearance it recalls the magic lish of many colours which are described in the story of thefishermanand the genius  in the arabian nights  some girelles are of a deep violet withbrightorange stripes others are stripedwith red green black and blue the colours be as vivid and varied yet blending as well as those ina turkey carpet if the girelles could be  kept alciv in a bowl like goldfish they would afford a much prettier sightwhile the sea at beaulieu is full of various kinds of fish the land is carpeted with beautiful flowers in the later months of winter nowhere have i seen wild violets lilies and other flowers grow in greater luxuriance at that season when the spring is well advanecd the hedgerows are a mass of roses in the gardens flowers flourish still better than in the fields and their culture is the only industry of beaulieu the nursery gardens of m keller are situated here and from them plants arid shrubs are supplied to all pdarts of europe growing palm trees of all kinds being a special part of ni kelleris business at many places on the riviera the flowers which are on sale there come from the gardens of beaulieu and orders given at monte carlo for instance are executed here many persons in england may have wondered why husbands or  brothers fathers or sons sent gifts of flowers from beaulieu when they were supposed to live at nice or mentono the explanation is that the order was actually given at monte carlo  but for some reason which i shall not attempt to determine the donors of the flowers desired it to be supposed that they had been despatched from beaulieu and m keller has labels prepared to meet this demand some of the occupants of villas busy themselves with flower culture and succeed in making a profit as well as finding pleasant occupation by so doing indeed the gardens of beaulieu furnish a large proportion of the flowers which brighten london rooms during the winter monthsthe stranger who goes to beaulieu to pass the winter cannot take to fiower culture for an amuse ment though he may go fishing he or she may enage in botanizing the flora being very rich and curious here or a part of the day may be passed in walking either b the margin of the sea or on the mountain sides the walks being many and charming for those who desiregreater variety there is none to be found beaulieu is as quiet as it is beautiful it suits the contemplativo man or the invalid who dreads excitement better than men and women who have no resources within themselves and who live only to be amused they have not far to go to find what they seek in the course of  minutes the railway train lands them at mionte carlo and before luncheon and after dinner the small station at beaulieu is filled with persons taking tickets for the same place a like spectacle may be witnessed at mentoneresidents in beaulieu or visitors to it who desire a change which is likely to be more bene ficial than repeated visits to monte carlo may visit nice whore if ladios they can indulge in shopping to their hearts content and if gentle men they may find other fornis of amusement those who simply desire to make excursions can easily gratify their taste they can explore the old and not very picturesque town of ville franche or may mount the eza and have the gatisfaction of having all btit qualified them selves for becoming members of the alpine club many a swiss mountain being more easily ascended than the eminence upon which eza is perched looked at from below it resembles one of the hamlets which as macaulay wrote likoan eagles nest hangs on the crest of purple apenninecan be a pproached without much fatigue from the corniche road but whoever takes the

theformer has not been managed hitherto in such a way as to please visitors but having now passed into new and more experienced hands it will probablyv become as popular as the best hotels along the rivierai have written muchl in praise of beaulieu as a place of sojourn yet i have simply given un exaggerated expression to my own opinions and feelings i fear however that the charms upon which i have enlarged will prove evanescent the expanse of beautiful trees and flowers may become pleasant memories the old ladies who refuse to allow them to be desecrated with buill ings may dio and be succeeded by heirs of less sensible and more grasping tastes where orange lemon and olive trees give perfriie to the air and shade the wayfarer houses which gratify no sense save that which craves for a shelter may blot the landscape happily there has been much overbuilding along the riviera of late years and the destruction of the natural beauties which alone render it attractive may be stayed for a time o long as that blessed truce lasts many spots whiceh might be called small gardens of eden may preserve their primitive and incomparable charm beaulieu is one of them and those who admire it the most will be the most ardent in hoping that it may long remain as worthy of its name as nature has made it
