linstitution of lelocticalenginebrslast night the flrst meeting of the institution of electrical engineers was held in the rooms of the institution of civil engineers at georgestreet west ninster when sir wlilliam thomnson president for the ensuing year delivered his inaugeral addressmjr edward graves retiring presidqnt occupied the ehair and among the very large number of persons present were professor stokes president of the rova soeiety mr crookes president of the chemical society professor ayrton and professor forbesthe cuaxi opened tbe proceedings by atnoune ing that the last legal steps had been taken to chan the name of their body from  society of telegraph engineers and electricians by which name it lad hitherto been known to  iustitution of eleetrical engineers the societys premium for  had been offered to professor sylvanus thomson but that gentleman had waived his claim in order that the award might be devoted to the encouragement of younger members of the institution the societys premium lad therefore been given to mr a c cock burn the paris electrical premium to lur e stalle brass and the fabie premium to miir e  walkersir wnixaa tncsxso then proceeded to deliver his inaugural address on the subject of  ether electricisy and ponderable flatter lie began by reminding his audience that when  years ago lhe thbn threeyearold society of telegraphengineershad appointed him its president it numbered  members mow it vuiniere  it was gratifyig to think how suceessful had been that young society founded mainly by sir villiam eiemens though it as tb be regretted that many of the old members had passed away there were among those who had gone the first two presidents mr frank scudamore and eir wllliam siemens sud after them sir charles bright fir walker and colonel shakllin to the vigour and energy of sir charles bright it must be remebered had been due the temporarily suceessful atlantic cable of  and the great conseqnences whiebbadresulted from it the soclety of telegraph engineere had grown not only in membership but in the extent of its province  ancd the more repreentative name of the imstitution of electrical engineers had now been adopted at the origin of the society telegraphy and clectrometallurgy had been the only two practical branches of science to which electricity wras applied  but since then a vast augmentation of tbe teld had taken place there was the electric transmission of power electric haulage the application of electricity to naval and military purposes tb electric lighting and to many other purposes the province of an electric engineer necessarily touched on that of a civil engineer iudeed electric eigineers must first bh civil engineers young pcople with a taste for electric machines looked upon electric engincering as involving nothing bat ether and electricityg it was necessary constantly to he insisting on the fact tbaponderaole matter bad also to be dealt with the electrical engineer ouht to learn mathematics and dynamics after the elements of a good general esducation then be should mof a good deal of chemistry and of mnechanical and citil engineering and electricity besides it midht be said that the jvepile life was too short fo this bet this was not the case if the other subjects were studied the electricity could be learnt in a few months though that statement did not contradict the fact that ifelectric engmneering were adopted as a profession the  learner would every day become more copscions of the prodigious field of electricity proper which walstto be explored these remarks had suggested the subject for his addressether electricity and ponderable natter the demand for something like z mechanical ex lana tion of electrical phenomena was not mew but it was growing in intensity every yealr the proceedins f several meetigs of the british atssociation and especially of the last illustrated the growing desire that eisted to know somnething below the surface of the internal relations connectdwith those rwonderful mari festations of force energy or whatever it was called put before the observer in the working of a common electric machine maxwell had shown the veloclty of ligt to be related to that of electricity in such a way thatit was impossible to doubt that the propagation of electric disturbances through space and of iigt might perhaps be identical after treating the queston of electromagnetic induction as relating to submarine cables sir william thomson went on to speak of tho effcacy of iron and popper as telephone con dactors information given by mr bennett the engineer of the ational telephone gompany in scot land left no doubt wartever he said that there was very considerably less of clearness in speakingo throujh an iron wrire than in speaking through a copper wiee of the same resistance hir lleavysides investia tions on the subject and lord aayleighs special investigations on the usceptibility of iron to
