 ilicit traffic in salmon iperhaps one of the most formidable deterrents to the further deelopnent of our salmon fisheries is to be found in the easy and indiscriminate manner in which the capture of this valuable migratory fish is carried on at a period of the year when the law wisely declares theyshall be left unmolested and exempt from capture by any means whatsoever christmas tire iri mnanyof our more productive salmon wateri is of all seasons the most important of the year as juat about that time the parent fish are busily engaged in depositing the ova along the breeding grounds lsotwithstanding however the provisions laid down for the preservation of the salmon during the months that the great work of fecundation is taking place it is a notorious fact that hundreds of salmon are ruthlessly slaughtered and after wards shipped abroad to the continent where they find a ready sale for a long series of years indeed it has been openly known that a very extensive tramfic in the illegal exportation of salmon from england has beenearri on in the columns of the times atteiltion has frequently been called to the matter aid cogent reasons have beengiven why every effort shouldbe made to stop or at any rate check a flourishing contra band business which in the face of allauthority has been acting most harmfully year by year to the interests of a valuable foodproducing industry iu the years  and  respectively large captures ofsalmon en route tothe continent were made in london at that time the late ir frank euckland with the usual thoroughness which always marked his actions when dealing with questions relating to the fisheries of the country succeeded in bringing to light several cases of agrant breaches of the salmon acts several consignments of salmon under various disguises such as rabbits  and other edible commodities were seized in london and the persons legally responsible for the possession of the pilfered fish were dully mulcted in fines which although comparatively light were suffi cient it was supposed at the time o put a wholesome chec on the illicit trafflc such however unfortunately has not been the case indeed it appears from information received from time to time that the illegal capture of salmon during the winter months for shipment abroad is carried on as vigorously as ever and hundreds of salmon are annually conveyed out of england at a time when their capture and exportation are prohibited it cannot be said that the authorities to whom the care of our inland waters is intrusted have not been repeatedly made aware of the existence of a traffic which for years has been a serious drain on the productive powers of our salmonproducing waters a warning note of the evils accruing from the practice of this mischievous business wis given in the columns of the times so far back as the year  vhen on the th of november of that year appeared the following in reference to the action taen at that time by the late inspector of salmon fisheriesthe importance of the prosecution instituted by mr buclland cannot be estimated toe highly an that gentleman deserves the greatest praise for the energetic manner in which he has endeavoured to put a check on this ilegal fish traffic which it is feared has been and is still carried on to a somewhat alarming extent the seizures made during the iast two years ia london by the inspectors showing clearly that an organized system has been instituted among certain tradesmen in england ireland and scotland and small dealers in london of illegally shipping salmon to the continent during the close system the exten sion of the eystem must in time work most disastrously on the prospects of our salmon fisheries ard every means should be taken to carry out the intention of the law in enforting as thorough a protection of the fesh during thelbreeding season as possible and check ing promptly any attempts to evade the provisions of the salmon actssubsequently to the publication of the above the subject has been alluded to on several occa sions but until quite recently little or nothing has been done to stop a mischievous illegal traffic which has now been carried on practically un checked for a long series of yearswithin the last few months the fishmonaers company have talen the matter up and lave displayed a praiseworthy activity which has happily resulted in several convictions for offences ragainst the fishery acts in attempting i to export salmon to the continent during the close season among the many services rendered by this company of recent years to the fisheries generally their latter action in regard to this particular branch of the industry will rank prominently as among the most useful the detection of poached fish after they have been conveyed any distance from the districtin which they have been captured is not an easy matter of accomplishment the system however which has recently been adopted by the fishmongers company under the direc tion of mr towse of intexcepting illegallytaken salmon on their way to the crontinent has been carried out with great success and there is little doubt this poaching business has this season received a severe check apart bowever from the commendable course taken by the fishmongerscompany much more remains ota be done to put an effectual stop to this highly pernicious system of fishing on waters durig the close season the prevalence of salmon poaching during the winter monthsmay be attributed ingretparttothelaay in or want of sufficient watching of the spawning beds during the breeding season it may be said there is not a single district in england ireland or scotland in which the rivers are properly pro tected from poachers while along the upper reaches of many waters the salmon are simply at the mercy of any scoundrel who wishes to indulge in a propensity for poaching anl until some measures are taken to make the illegal slaughter of fish a more difficult matter than it is at presentthis demoraizing business is sure to flourish to a i very destructive extent lnaturally enough we look to the local fishey boards to lend assistance in checking the evil this they do to a certain extent but in most instances in only a very limited manner want of sufficient funds and lack of energyand hearty cooperation among the i body of members of the different boards appearto hate paralyzed or rendered in great part use less the working powers of the admirable machinery available for developing the fisheries in a profitable manner to all parties concerned in their welfare further however than this un fortunate state of things there also exist even more deplorable circumstances connected with the efforts which have been made from time to time to increase the salmon fisheries thedifferences between the upper lower and middle proprietors and lessees along the various rivers i continue apparently as far off from reconcilia tion as ever while the netmen belowgather in as a rule a remunerative harvest each year those angling in the upper districts catch comnparativelyj very few fishwhich in many rivers are very scarce until close upon the commencemnent of the fence season in seine districts the suspension of all protection to the breeding aish in the upper waters is threatened owing to the system of netting which is carried on below and which is of o thorough and exhausting a description that a general decline in the annual yield is taking place wvant of harmony between the differentparties interested appears indeed to exist in a more or less degree in every fishery district in the kingdrm mr j m ridley theactive chairman of the tyne fishery board who for years past has taken a prominent partin nall measures for the advancement of the fisheries in his annual report just issued urges thoimportance of all interested in the river working harmoniously together he says  the take of fish is not one quarter of what the tyne is capable of giving if the productive powers of the river were fully developed to secure this the upper and lower proprietors must join heartily together in pro tecting the breeding fish and by just and equit able rules secure to all interests their chance of a fair share of fish and thus secure the sympathy of all in the general interests of the river this wholesome advice is but a reiteration of a funda mental principle for the advancement of the salmon fisheries laid down by the english salmon inspectors in  when they urged the great importance of harmonious cooperation between upper lower and middle proprietorsalong our rivers
