made some observations on the land urchase amendment act of last year which was intended to promoto the success of the act he expressed the hope that neither landlords nor tenants would make any percepti ble rush for the money provided by the ant as the effect of a rmsh would be to produce utdue pressure on one side or the other and hinder that calm and friendly negotiation and the freedom of contract necessary for the successful working of the act to landlords he said  do not sell your estates in a panic there is no cause for panic although statbsmea differ as to how further money is to bo provided they seem to bo practically unanimous io thinking that the money decessary most be procured somehow to tenants he said  do not let any one bully or cajole you into buyinig unloss you wish to buy and are reasonably satisled with tho terms aboveall things do not enter into any obligation with tho stato unless you are reasonably certain that you can discharge them fully riid punctually remember that when once a sale has seen closed and tho money paid off your obligations to the state will commence that unless redeomed hey will continue for nearly half a century and that hey must be enforced with iron severity you may be able to trifl with individuals you canuot trifle with the slate to both parties be said  we cannot sanctioa any attempt by either of you to coerce the ather into sale or purchase or as to the terms of euch sale or purchase if landlords intended to rell or tenanits to buy and both parties came to terms in free contract and if the terms were such as would make it tafe for the state to advance the moneyboth parties wtould receive from the department every help and facility to complete the arrangement but if before the transaction wv closed they btd legal evidence that one party eought to put nmore pressure on the ether the cases would be dismissed and the money refuset the keynote of the success of che act had been its principlo of restraining arbitrary operations and if the commissioners had permitted tenants to be coerced into bad bargains the result would have been loss of public money injury to bdth parties concerned and ultimate failure of the act lhe believed that as a rule the new proprietors woinld honestly and even cheerfully discharge obligations which they had fairly and deliberately undertaken if thoy did not they would have against them not only the m aovwering legal force of the state but the weight of all moral authority and the public opinion of the world ilithurto tby had done so wzith honourable fidelity of the �s which they owed np to may  last they had paid over qll while of the � wbich became due a few weeks ego they had already paid �i the second section of the act limited the advancs they werc empowered to make to any one purchaser to �unless in their opinion the advance if a larger aont not to exceed � wvould be cepedient whatover might be  thought of le advisability of that limitation it must be sdbpred to they would sanction no attempt to evade it by division of holdings or other wise in some cases however heir powers of advancing without gtarantce dcpopited tbreefourths of the purchasemoncy uuder the incorporated sections of the land act of  might be judicially used by the third section the tenants liability for the rent and srrears was to be on and from the date of the order pproving the advance the rate of interest on the purcbasemoney in lieu of rent up to the date of the sale was left an open question all such in terest if any in excess of the halfyears interest would be allotted during the interval between the date of the approval ard the date of the advance they would permit no reservation of claims against the new proprietor in excess of balf a years interest uch rservation would prejudice the security for the advance the fourth section enacted that in the case of a subtenancy they might prescribe such terms as to rent and otherwise as to the part sublet as they might thsnk right it did not enable them to give the labourers any securbty of tenure but he warned farners that any attempt to evade their obligations by evicting labourers would result iu the refusal of their applica tions the commissioners felt a deep sense of the gravity of the trust conf ded to them by the statecor jawr today iessrs considine and bcodkin resident

scries of statements anid allegations respecting the estate aud mr leonards treatment of tjhe tenants and then when he is repeatedly challenged to sub stantiate his allegations be refuses to respond mr leonard had in a former letter january  stated that mir obrien had dictated a speech to a reporter and then had sent it to the press as delivered and had interspersed it with  cheers  and  laughter imrobrien denied this and called evidence to ehow that the speech in question had beeu delivered on the bill side jmr leonard says that the occasion he refers to is the speech reported in unitie irnd of november  iss  i ask bim to ay  ays ar leonard  is the report true or false  was the meeting real or imaginary  let him search his diary and say where hbs was on trlesday afternoon qetober   as to alr obriens denial that ho is the author of the plsn  ir leonard says this is the first time mr obrien has formally done so mr obrien bad com pared the rents on two neighbouring estates writh those of lorc kenmares to this mr leonard replies i not specifically deny that the demand for an all round abatement of  per cent on judicial rents is iustieed by some similar reductions on the marquisofuansdownes estate one reason is that the ken mnare tenants have received the  judicial  abatements on the back as well as on thecurtent gales be com pels me to repeat that instead of the recent revisions on the herbert estate reswtioz in reductions they haveresulted im increases on tbe nts previously payable i cotrheted sir obrien und stated a fact iii aayipg that these estates are distant and not adjoining as to the libel action which according to mr obrien lord lgenmares solicitor threatened to bring against a great daily english newspaper  and which was then ahgodoaed ir leonard repeats that ho never beard of the action mr obrieu picked out of scores of cases two instances of what he called  heart less oppression  phich came under his notice n a single day one was that of a tenant who after malking money in a colony came back to ireland took a farm dn te estate and lost threefourths of his money through rackrentiug tben as soon as one years reat fell in arrear he  was smitten with a writ ur leonards version of the case is as follows  wh tenant pid � for the interest of tbe farm to bis predecessor while he previously paid  for it to dr murphy of killarney wvho for many years used it as a home farm over �ooqd via expended in draining c since the present tenant came into possession op iiich he was not charged aenny interest e paid his rcnt punctually until he ead the misfortune to be attracted bv mr o briens cooing we shall probably be told that the payment of the last of the  golden guineas  coincided with mr obriens descent on the estlte  as a matter of fact therq was more tban  onlya years rentwvith regard to the second case that of the widow who vwas threatened vith proceedings for her arrears of rent dr obrien complained that mir leonard bad shown brutality in saying  she had grownup squs to support mr leonard says that instead of the mother supporting her sons they support their motjer io briens  other statements ibout this case are utter porversions of the factswhich would only be attcrntd by a man vain enough to believe that every word he writes would be accepted as gospel truth i beg to refer the public not mr obrien to the true facts as minated by me in my former letter time alone wiill tell whether these two great cases on which i have been indicted are only  randorn experiences  or samples deliberately selected for publication wzith all the force whbich mir obticns fpinicatur can im part hmr leonard denies tbat he has retreated a single step from the position he at lirst assumed  i amn ready to meet mr obrien
