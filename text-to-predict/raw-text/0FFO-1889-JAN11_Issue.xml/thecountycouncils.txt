the couiity councmsthe returning officers of the various metropolitan divisions sat during the appointed hours yesterday to hear objections and to take note of withdrawals in the tery few cases where objections were made they were overruled only two gentlemen appear to have withdrawn from the contestnamely mr gnildiford richardson at greenwich and mr s s tayler at brixtn i almost all the nominated candidates will therefore go to the poll in most cases the candidates attended to see whether objections were made to their namescrry or londonalderman sir p de keyser pre sided yesterday aftemoon at thoe memorialhall far ringdonstreet over a meeting in support of the candi dature of mr henry clarke cc mr benjamin louis cohen and mr george shaw cc as members for the city of london division of the london county council the chairman in introducing the candidates observed that undoubtedly a great deal of important work would have to be done by the new london county council but he did not attach to it the extra ordinary importance to which reference had been made in some speeches which had been delivered that week from soch speeches it might be supposed that the lon don county council were about to destroy all their municipal institutions all their rights all their privilegesnll that they had cherished for years for nis own part he believed that the county council would know how to respect municipal life and in stitutions as well as those privileges which had been justly and in the right spirit enjoyed and ad ministered for centuries by bodies like the corporation of the city of london who he claimed deserved ad miration and encouragement for the manner in which they had discharged their duties the representatives of the city division on the london county council would sharo with the other members the duty of look ing after the good of the metropolis at large but in the second place they vrould have to watch over the interests of the city of london and to see that its rights were not unnecessarily attacked as representa tives of the city division the electors required men who had worke hard who had served the citizens and who had proved their allegiance to the city the corporation and their privileges in the three candi dates in sapport of wrhom that meeting had been called it appeared to him that the electors had all the elementa that erer required to form real representa tives of the city but for the fct that he had under taken to represent the british section at the paris exrhibition he would have been by the side of his friends soliciting the support ofthe electors for a seat on the councila position however to which he might aspire at another time ho meeting was after wards addressed by the three candidates mir shaw and hr clarke alluding to the public work they had alrsady done and all of them promising if elected to endeavour to discharge the duties of the office in a diligent and painstaking manner on the motion of mrr deputy cox seconded

hear objections to the candidates nominated on wvednesday tshere were two objections one to lady sandhurst who was nominated for the brixton division and the other to mr henry seymour poster who was nominated for the kennington divi sion the objection to lady sandhurst was made on the ground that women were not eligible for election  and the objection to mr foster was that he was described as a member of the school board for len don which it was contended was an iamproper descrip tion of his calling the deputy returning officer having listened to the respective objections consulted acts of parliament bearing on the question and overruled the objection to the nomination of lady snodhurst and with regard to mr foster held that the description vas good and ruled that the nomination was

he said that seven days hence london would be called upon to elect its first municipality it was four years since the great towns celebrated the jubilee of their municipal emancipa tion during  of the  years london had no common government at all and for  years it had been the happy huntmg ground of the board of works it hai been l body without head or members london had lacked almost entirely tho saving virtue of muni cipal patriotism londoners showed wilful ignorance as to the ground and scornful apathy as to the means of government they now had an opportunity to in augurato a new era he hoped that london at last knew itself realized its unity and was alive to its civic duty the days of irresponsible govcrnimnt ware over and he trusted that like a certain historical character the new council might earn the title of incorruptible too much had been left to the oflicial staff of the metropolitan board and in the future there must be a closer scrutiny of departmental work which should be as carefï¿½ll supervised as a private business the servants should not be masters those remedies met the points which were censured by the royal commission the neow council had to cleanse and renovate he considered i that theletropolitan board was more blamable for what it bad left undone than for what it had done in taking onnita seanitas as his motto he believed that under existing powers more could be done to prevent the propagation of disease or anyhow the fertilization of the ground for it it was a vain hope to think that the council had simnly by an abstract resolution to express a legislative wisn and that then the houses of parliament would fall down before it the county council would exercise the functions assigned to it by parliament it could not dictate  at most it could only suggest  and ho would be no party to turning a great municipality into a parliamentary debating society they must sot their shoulders to the real work of adnministration and recollect that until there was some readjustment of the burden of local rates by parliament they must respect the slender exchequer of the poor for it was by the small ratepayers and workingclass occupiers that the bulk of the rates was actually paid they should therefore be modest in their first proposals their aim should be to make the collective life of the com munity better healthier and more homely nd without vrorkin miracles the first council might well leave a memorial of splendid achievement behind it if it did nothing else it might banish the demon of corruption and uncleanness they might create the idea of local lifee and as the unity of londoti became clearer and more emphasized their iowers of manage ment and control would be unificd also without demur by parliamentaismeassathe high
