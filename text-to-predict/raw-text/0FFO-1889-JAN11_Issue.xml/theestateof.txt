tac bstatj of hebi majestys coomtsioners at oufh fkrlyisgtognmuom  comzsoubratthe answers xecently given by sir lvon play fair on behalf of her majestys commissioners for the exhibition of  to questions asled by mr samuelson in tlie house of coammons furnish a crude sketch of the commissioners policy in dealing with their estate at south kensinigton the commissioners have apparently lost faith in a progressive use of their land for public pur poses they propose to let out the unallotted plots of it for the erection of private dwelling houses the groundrents they expect to obtain will increase their present income with this they intend to clear their estate of the mortgages they have raised on it and to have enough to give in the partial advancement of educational and other schemes at present in a visionary con dition the simplicity and directnes  of this course of action are possibly acceptable to a body like the commissioners who have endured vexa tions in the management of a complicated trust but while the commissioners may believe in their immunity from responsibility to consti tuents they are nevertheless intrusted with a dty the discharge cf which affects public

matters to be taken in hand stress was iaid upon the want of space which prevented many institutions and societies from  developing themselves and the cormmissioners deplored  the lament able iet that most of our publie buildings have been placed in such a  situation trom the crowding of surrounding houses that they are wtithoult light or air have ixlconvenient access and cannot be seen with

open space as possible with the � the pur chase was effectedj arid in lass than  years the commissioners hae resold or allotted variouspor tions of their estate for the erection of the natural history museum the south xensington mulseum the schools of science and art the department of science and art thebroyal college of mhusic the royal alberthail the city and gulilds of ilondon technical school and galleries containing the nucleus of a scientific museum and the commercial and atistic collec tions known as the india museum such being the record for  years the previsions of the commissioners published  years ago are amply justified in their wisdomit is well inown that efforts are being made te provide for the proper development of the scien tific mluseumindeed sir lyon playfair him self is one ef the many leading authorities whc have within the last fortnight pressed the government to give immediate and serioue attention to this important institution it ii also well known that the india museum ie cramped in its present premises and requires ex tension and yet incredible as it may seem sir lyon playfair on behalf of the commissioners has stated that the vacant space lyig between the galleries of the scientific and india museums is to be cut up into plots for private housts and so let out by her majestys commissioners on grounrents what the comnissioners deplored in  when referring to lamentable crowd ing of public institutions by  surrounding houses is new the leynote of theirproposedand imminent action however undesirableit appearsto be for the commissionerstobepowderingtheirland with private housea there are certainly strips and plots abutting on to queensgate and princes gate whlich at least might be lass harfully ap propriated for such a purpose than the open space between the alberthall the imperial nsia tute and the galleries containing the indian and scientific collections esides this the commissioners receive incomefrom groundrents for other portions of their estate sufficient to pay annual instalments oef and interest upon moneys advanced as mortgages on the estate by the greenwich hospital com missioners the pressure to raise funds to clear off the mortgages more quickly is not apparently urgent gor when it has been a question of using the estate for even sermi public purposes the greenwich hospital com missioners have acted in a libera and puiblic spirited manner when the erection of the royal albert hal was decided upon the greenwich hospital commissioners  as mortgagees of the estate consented on their part to release the site of the hall from the mortgae in consideration of the great reductica airay effected by us her majestys commissioners  in the mort gage debt have her mjestys com missioners no conicdence that the green wich hospital commnissioners will act similarly when the extensions of the india and scientific miuseums are taken in hand  there is a fnrther complication to be noticed iist spring her majestys commissioners had all but given up to the managers of the royal college of mulsic for their new building a site adjacent to the south of the royal albert hall the blocking in of the all was virtually decided upon but the force of public remnonstrance in duced the commissioners to changethe sitefor one in princesgate the managers of the reyal college of musie c now desire to commence building on this new site to enable them to do so her majestys commissioners have had to give notice to a sclool of art needleworka successful but purely commercial institutionto quit the school of needlework pleads for room else where on the commissioners estate forthwith the commissioners inform the india council that a portion of the galleries containing the india collections must be cleared for this needleworlk slhool iher majestys commissioners may be techni cally within their right in effecting such a dis placement of a part of the india collections but public opinion is against them and manulso turing towns like manchester with its cotton printing macclesfield with its silk weaving lhieffield with its metal work bighsm loeds nottinghwm and bradford are too much interested in the preservation of such valuable art collections to raise no protest against the commissioners extraordinary proposalthe various proposals reoeniily made by her majestys commissioners have combined to create a number of petty difficulties which tuen together cast doubt upon the capay of x commissioners to take a statesmanlike vrdwtheir responsibilities this is most regrettable although sir lyon playfair announced the other evening in theo hoiise of comnmons that the commissioners did not intend to take the public into their confidence before proceeding further with their sehemes for finally disposing of their estate there appears to be ground for the expectation that his royal ilighness the prince of wales as president of the commissioners will cause thorough investigations to be made of the difliculties ana complications above alluded to s that the estate at south kensington may be developed according to original intentions and presered from being crowded up with private houses to the detriment of the public buildings dlready upon it
