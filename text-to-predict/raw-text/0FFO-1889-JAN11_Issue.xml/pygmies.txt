iipygmibsyesterday evening professor flower cb frs lectured on this anthropological subject before a crowded theatre at the london institution se cited the various classical authorshomer herodotus aristotle otesias pliny and othersto show the wide belief in the existence of exceedingly small races of men to which the name pygmies was appro priated the spread of ethnological science and the discovery of races of exceedingly smtll anthropoid apes had revived the interest in the problem early in the last century and the lead taken by m de quatre fages theeminent parisian professor of anthropology and his evermultiplying followers down to the present day had gone far to prove that the two localities in vhich the ancient writers had localized the pygmies namely the interior of africa amd the southernmost regions of asia together with the characteristics assigned to them in classical antiquity weie more or less verified in tbe ascertained facts as to the smal races of human beings to be found in those parts it was however still a question how far these facts had been adulterated with fictions and how to draw the line between the strictly historical and the poetical elements taking leave therefore of the legendary stories professor flower devoted the remainder of the ecture to an account of our actual knowledge of the smallest iaces of men who really exist on the face of the earth or at least who have existed under known circumstances in ancient ages there have been races it was maintained and there seemed to be such now on the surface of our globe to whom with compara tively small inaccuracy might be applied the name pygmies or folks no bigger than a fullgrown mans forearm the andaman islands in the indian ocean were inhabited by a race of very great interest to the scientific anthropologist the earliest notices of these islands were contained in the accounts of arab voyagers of the ninth century by whom the ferocious hostility of their inhabitants to all intruders on their soil and their cannibalism were described in glowing colours it was to this characteristic that they owed their comparative immunity from the visits of timid nvigatdrs and the consequent obscurity of the accounts we had of thema just a century ago the english government of bengal attempted to establish a penal colony in the islands but it was abandoned a few years later and the natives were again left to themselves until  when the project was revived with greater success and a colony was formed of more than  convicts from the indian mainland who were now settled on them at first the natives were very shy and it was years before friendly rela tious were established with them but now owing to the wise and humahe treatment of them by the gover nors they had abandoned their former reserve not to sayhhostility and much infotmation had been got out of them revealing their moral nature and social orga nization in a much more favourable lighbt than the old stories about them had led us to look for they did not till their grournd nor keep domestic animals but they had a rude kind of handmado pottery of which sanmples were shown by the lecturer they made vessels for holding water out of the hollow stems of bamboos theymade also excellent fishing nets and baskets they were good divers andswimmers and were firstrate navi gators of their canoes the bow and arrow were their chief weapons but they used also spears and harpoons metals they had nesfe and seemed not to know how to get fire though they were careful to preserve it as they seldom ate their food raxw they lived mostly on wild swine birds turtles iish wild fruits roots and seeds tbe iervoa of insects and honey water was tbeer only drink the valuable facts about them gleamed by mr e m man referred of course to their condition beforc their contact with europeans bet there was no trustworthy prooï¿½ of their ever having been cannibals at present all was changing it might be feaed not for the better and as a race they were fast vanishing one of the most distinctive physical features of the andamanese was their small size strict measurements of a large number of the men had been made showing the averiage height of the iden to be ft gin that of the women ft oin the skin was of a dark colour almost blacl and their wair was exceedinxly closely curled or frizzly andtheir
