the north cape of new zealand aud new caledonia and about  miles from each the island is about five miles long by three broad with a total area of  acres it is just outside the tropics the extremes of temperature are never reached the climate is most equable and the thermometer never ranges higher than deg in summer and never lower than deg in winter at one time the island was densely wooded with the native pine araucaria excelsa and other trees but now it is covered with open park like downs interspersed with groups of this pine it was originally settled in  by a mixed party of convicts and free persons  in  these were all taken to tasmania and norfolk island was converted into a convict settlement pure and simplea use for which physical conditions and its isolation and umonotony seemed peculiarly to fit it up to  it was used for the very worst type of convicts from among those in tasmania and new south wales and during this period it was described as a hell within a paradise  bet in that year the descendants of the famous mutineers of the bounty who had increased and multiplied beyond the capacity of pitcairn island were presented with norfolk island and the vessel which conveyed them  miles across the pacific to their new home carried away all the convicts not leaving a human being behind except the pitcairn islanders who numbered  in all they are fast increasing and do not occupy the convicts and soldiers barracks left behind but have built for themselves neat wooden tenements all over the island the two landingplaces are dangerous in certain states of the weather but the people handle their strong wellbuilt whaleboats with amazing dexterity the soil is exceedingly fertile being composed of a dark chocolate loam or decomposed basalt there is a complete absence of frost and almost every temperate and subtropical plant grows in luxuriance bat three plants or weeds are so destructive to all other vegeta tion that a portioa of every year is given by the whole cummunity to their destraction  but in spite of this they are steadily increasing these are two solanutns the sodomacum and auriculatum and the eassia levi gata the men are in great repute as expert whale fshers among the whalers that visit these seas besides they hunt the humpbacked whale which visits the island every year between july and october in bad weather the fishermen cultivate the farms

signalmaster and these are met by fines on waifs and strays the surgeon ceaplain c are paid trifling stipends out of the interest of a fund in sydney which began with the sale of  acres of land to the melanesian mission the whole island is parcelled out into acre lots held at a peppercorn rent  the original immigrants received  acres each and for some years each ztaarried couple received the same grant  this was reduced to  acres and in  lord augustus loftus zefused to make any more grants on the ground that the land already given had not been properly utilized since then norfolk island has had a land question  although only  oat of about  acres grantea are under cultivation the islanders resent the stoppage of the grants the other barning political question is annexation to new south
