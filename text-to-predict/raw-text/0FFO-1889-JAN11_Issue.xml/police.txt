the evidenee for the prosecution in these cases is for the most part of a very technical character mainly proof of the strength or gravity of the brew of certain beer the marking of the ghyle the

samples and the stated strength of the original brewafter the numerous witnesses necessary to depose tr all these facts had been called in the case of the present defendant it was shown that the beer
