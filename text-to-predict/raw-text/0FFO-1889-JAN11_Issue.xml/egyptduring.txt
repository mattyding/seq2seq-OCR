egypt domring fo oub o aosfisp rnnoi lcairo drc the year that closes tomorrow although by no means uneventful in egypt has beon tranquil as compared with most of its immediate predeces bois i a complete change of ministry carried out under ciidtimstances in some respects regrettable has only served to show that a change in pashas nb longer makes an appreciable difference in egyptian administration so far as thore is any change it may be admitted in a general way that new brooms are better tan old ones nor is it necessaryto inquirevery deeply into the circum stances which led to the substitution of riaz for ltubar experienced european housekeepers find thatthere comes a time when the most valuable native servant becomes useless his energies are played gutperhaps his familiarity with european ways has bred contempt if not insolence  he has discovered that his master is not a hero and announcing the illness of au aed relative re quirinc his iranediate presence le retires with his welideserved earnings to a life of dolce far iente in his native village until in a short time he again sighs for service and actively intrigues to displace his successor to compare large thlings with small much the same happens in the larger field of egyptian administration no profound differences in policy as to the  soudan or to edonomic reforms are required to account for the change from cherif to niubar in  or from nubar to rias in  master and servant had gottired of each other and a change was to the advantage of all parties all the virtues ascribed to nubar in the early days of his reign are now found to exist in riaz and all the vices dis covered in cherif after his fall are now manifest in nubar the wheel of fortune will doubtless adjust matters fairly for those who surviveto the ordinary outsider it is sometimes a little difficult to remember who is in and who is outor to detect the difference between tweedledum and tweedle deein the administration of thg public works de partment sir colin scott moncrieff has had to contend with the double difficulty of an unduly high nile at the beginning of the year and an unduly low one during the remainder the ex cellent supervision and admnirable management of the chief and all his staff warded off the first dangerand reduced the second ta a loss of only  per cent of the entire cultivable area a fur ther judicious expenditure will practically pre vent the recurrence of even this loss in future the barrage has been rendered still more service able fresh canals have increased the normal area fit for cultivation and the corrve has to an in creased extent been supplanted by paid labour in finance the favourable anticipations of sir edgar vincent for the current year have been fairly verified in spite of a smaller cotton crop than was reasonably expected until september last the closed accounts of the year are of course not yet published but there is every reason to believe that they will show equilibrium of revenue and expenditure  without drawing upon the reserve fund formed last year the coavention concluded  through sir william marriott with ismail pashas family reflects credit on the tact of all parties concernedand has enabled the treasury to make a conversion of two and a half millions oi their debt on terms con siderably more favourable than  any that egypt has ever obtained since entering the money market tlie budget for the coming year  has beeii published showing an estimated surplus of � it is difficultperhaps to share sir edgars buoyant confidence in the elasticity of our revenue but this apart the budget shows a statesmanlike appreciation of the necessities of the situationthe ministry of justice remains in native hands and if there is not much improvement to record there is reason to hope that the recent nomination of mr bond to a judgeship in the native courts may exercise some beneficial in fluence  the international tribunals  are practi cally independent of the mainistry of justice in spite of some defects the work they have to perform is well if expensively dori and the re newal of their powers for a further term of five years it tolerably ceriain they will receive limited powers of criminal jurisdiction and eng lish will be admitted as one of the recognized languages hitherto limited to french italian and arabic the bench has been strengthened by the appointment of mr lionel sandars as english judge of first instance the fusion of the international and native courts however difficult seems the most probable solution of the urgent auestion as to judicial reform in egyptthe mainistry of the interior remains also in native hands under the personal direction of riaz pasha himself there is a general consensus of opinion that the new premierfs energy inti mate knowledge of the country and administra tive capacity are bearing good fruit the mudirs are not only enconraged to reportifreely on the state of their provinces but their reports are pub lished in the official press and the stimulus of publicity and criticism is having its effect even in egypt the department of public security including the management of the police force has during the current year been reorganized and placed under urthe charge of colonel chairles baker vc ably assisted by captain martin fenwaick  lft is too early to claim much success but there is some improvementthere is i am afraid little to be said in favour of theministry of public instruction the very enlightoned ideas of artin pasha found little encouragement under a ministry which regards education as the root of all evil and since that officials promotion to the railway administra tion his projects have been shelvedegypts foreign relations are innumerable and complicated but the conduct of them is rather in europe than in cairo there has however been a marked absence of friction with foreign repre sentatives under lord salisburys cabinet and something is doubtless also due to the tact and good sense of tigrane pashathe railway administration has improved  the english member halton bey has gainedan  ex perience formerly wanting artin pasha the new egyptian representative has shown capacity and common sense by admitting teohnical igno rance and studying to remove it while m thn mermann the french delegate is onlygenially obstructive upon national principle judicious changes have considerably increasedithe revenues without imposing unjust burdens whether the general increase of rates proposed for next vear may be classed under the same headc retnains to be seenbut the responsibility for thismeasure rests rather with the financial authorities than with the administration the customs underur alfred caillaid one of the most successful and least rewarded of anglo egyptian officials have continued to make steady progress while the increased revenue arises mainly from increased charges on tobacco some thing also is due to better management and apart from mere fiscal results it is no small merit to have converted the most disorderly and corrupt of eastern customhouses into a not unworthy model for many european onesthe vpost

daira admbstrations have hitherto been the two black sheep of the egyptian treasury but the latter has almost enteredt the fold of solvency and the former begins to show signs of reform the daira has

harassed an egyptian garrison and berhaps done nothing that iill not have to berepeated but the fault of that if fault it is does not lie either with tlio soldiers or with their com manders the fact remains that the egyptian army organized and officered by enalishmen hasbeen proved worthy of that amount of confidence which was placed in it by those who lieor it best and may be relied on in the
