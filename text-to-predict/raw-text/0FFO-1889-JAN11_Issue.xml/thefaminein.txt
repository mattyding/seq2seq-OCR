tue famine in chinathere are many indications that the famine in china which we repozted yesterday is one of the most widespread and disastrous that has afflicted that country for many years past a paragraph in these columns a few days ago spoke of a famine as impending in northern china over an area including parts of the provinces of bonan shantung and chihli this is in the regin of the yellow river and includes the districts ruined by the inundation last year and it is on the borders of the vast region visited  by the shantung famine of  in this denselypopulated region with its liability to having whole tracts reauced by a sudden inroad of the river to deserts destitution is only too familiar but if famine has really visited the fertile plains of the yangtsze valley as is suggested in the telegram published yesterday china is in a bad state it is probable however that only a certain portion of the yangtsze provinces has sufferedlike southern shantung and doubtless southwestern honan will be found to be the place a disaster so great as a famine in the greatest foodproducing provinces of the empire the feeders of many regions far removed from then would be almost irreparable it would mean tie destruction of the food supply of millions of persons scattered al over the vast chinese territory ut however limited the afflicted area may be the famine comes at a peculiarly unfortunate time china during the past  months has suffered from calamityafter calamity  the resources of the fovernmnentwhich is the most decentralized in the world and scarcely fitted for the ordinary everyday work of administration while it is whollyunfitted to meet any sudden or heavy call upon itare already strained to the utmost by the yellow river disaster this threw a population estimated at a million and a half of persons out of their livelihood excluding the very large number who lost their lives it also caused an et penditure of over t millions sterling in endeavour ing to repair the breach then came the frightful inundations in mlanchuria which seem to have covered almost the whole of the country between monkden and the sea and destroyed one of the sources of food supply but worse even than these was the absence of the rains in the early summer on which the rice crops depend and it is to this that the present famine must be attributedno details have been received in this country of the state of things in the famine districts in the yangtsze valley or even of the provinces in which these are situated  but the last mail brought a peculiarly interesting and valuable letter from a missionary who was visiting the districts in north china where famine prevailed about the middle of october news reached chefoo that great distress prevailed in shantung and on the th of that month dr nevins a missionary started to investigate the matter having hastily got together a little money to afford such relief as was in his power writing on november  from a place called changlo he says that he found the distress more extended and greater than the reports had led him to expect the districts he visited had an area of about  square miles and a population of  it had suffered much from drought during the past four or five years and in one corner from the overflow of the yellow river the present calamity was the consequence of the unusual rains of august culminating in what appears to have been a deluge on the th of that month although heavy rains are common and expected about that time no one had before experienced such a rainfall there the water rushing down from the mountains in the central part of the province swelled the streams which burst their lbanks and uniting in one common flood swept over nearly the whole of a vast plain which slopes gradully to the north and terminates in pechili bay the people who had lost their wheat crop in consequence of drought during the spring and early summerwere rejoicing in theprospect of a goodautuman harvest when the flood destroyed all the millet and bean crops were destroyed at once the tall sorghum with its head above water promised for a time to survive  but much of it was borne down by the current and the wind the housas of the people in many cases are gone as well as the food for the floods rising to the slight elevation on which the villages and towns were constructed entered the houses and softened and dissolved mud bricks which formed the foundations so that they fell to the ground dr nevins describes as an instance one particular town where the destruction and misery are no worse than else where and not so bad as in some other places the town is hanchiao on the miho river with a population of  it is surrounded by an earth wall ft in height the river banks gave way just above the town and an opening was ggradually made for a distance of about a mile the water burst out towards the town tearing away tho surface earth from hundreds of acres of cultivated land and covering it with sand it soon broke down part of the mud wall and poured through the streets filling the whole space within the walls and breaking out again on another side ninetenths of the houses were carried away household goods furniture farming implements and timbers of buildings floated away towards the sea the people saved themselves by climbing trees or the higher parts of the wall where many of themremained standing in tho water for hours for two days they could obtain no food the town when seen by dr nevins was a scene of complete desolation large pools of water stood where there were recently busy streets and com fortable dwellings a few of the original houses remain and some huts have been erected on the open spaces many of the inhabitants have fled to friends living in more favoured loealities and many are reduced to hopeless beggary the whole region bore marks of the flood three months afterwards the surface earth is carried away wholly in many places in the others the ground is too wet to plough small streams have formed lakes and covered large tracts of country around the city of longan the people were found living principally on the seeds of alno grass or shrub which grows on alkaline lands and resembles the sage plant of the high american tablelands in every village the people were found gathering this grass the seed and husk are ground into powder mixed with chaff and made into a kind of cake which is nearly tasteless except that it has a slight herby flavour it can contain but little nutriment li none of the houses was any food except these cakes found in one house a man showed a little flour in a gourd which he had brought for a sick child it was made from coarse sorghum which in ordinary times is only eaten by the very poorest who can afford neither rice nor millet but now it is a luxury death by starvation says dr nevins is staring these people in the  face all the roads leading out of the region were thronged with refuees usually ablebodied men with women and children they endeavoured to plant their land and were on their way to more plentiful regions to beg so that more would be left for those remaining behindthey hope to return to get in their spring crops they take their farm wheelbarrows to carry cloth ing beddingand a few utensilswith the younger children sometimes sitting on top of the load and the adults trudging behnd it was estimated that  persons  were daily leaving the stricken districts in all directions but especially towards the famine districts of  where land is cheap on account of the dearth of the popula tion sometimes illness of the wife or husband brought the family progress to a standstill as the husband was too weak to propelthe wheelbarrow with his wife added to the load and vice versd many refugees were also returning as they found it impossible to get a living by begging but as a rule the frightful privations of this exile deter all who are not absolutely driven to it some linger at home loath to leave until all the food is exhausted but even the chaff bread cannot lasti through the winter those who have property of any kind try to sell it but nothing will fetch a titha of its value in conclusion lr knevinsobserves that any words can convey but a very imperfect idea of the misery and it is sure to be  worse in the spring before which the limited supply of provisions will be exhausted those who have remained at home will be reduced to extremities those wvho return from abroad will not have the means or strength to plant the sprine crops he estimates that a halfpenny a day or fifteen pence a month would in addition to tvhat the people can do themselves support life the district maistrates have remitted taxes but seemto have done nothing further to meet the awful situatigltit will bo borne in mind that although dr nevins speaks of a region of  squaro miles and a population of a million and a half his investigations extend only to a small part of a particular province and leave many others in au equally bad plight wholly untouched thtu vast area suffeling from the yellow river inundations for example did not come under his noticetand the districts in the yangtsze valley referre to inyesterdays message mere many hundred miles off lor several months past reports fromf these places have been dropping into shanghai from missionaries and other travellers during the last fortnight or three weeks these must have becoine detinite and alarming to induce the foreign community in shanghai to telegraph home for aid the foreign communities in china are accestomed year by year to many calls for the relief of distress in the country to which they respond with the utmost readiness and generosity they must have been convinced of the hopelessness of tirying with their own resources to deal with a disaster of the magnitude of the present famine when they sent home the urgent appeal which we published yesterdaya word of wvarning in conclusion may not be thrown away if those who usually take the lead in such matters shoald decide to answer the cry for aid from shanghai by appealing to the ixnglish people it should be clearly understood from the outset that the distribution in the distressed districts should be wholly in the hands of foreigners and that not a farthing should be sent into shantung or onan except by the agents of the relief committee in shanghai ln other words no chinese official should be permitted to have the distribution of the fund on the spot to begin with the chinese have not the capacity for organizing relief of this nature so as to make the most of their means  and in the next p lace the subordinate officials into whose hands the money would linally get cannot be trusted eiven in the case of the yellow river with the eyes of all pekin on the work and the highest officials in charge of it accusations of peculation on an enormous scale have been officially made fortu nately we are not dependent on chinese offlcials to distribute relief efficiently in under the superintendence of messrs richard miuir head and other missionaries the fund then collected abroad was distributed there is a considerable number of missionaries scattered over tlie distressed districts ivhose knowledge of the wants of thie people is unrivalled to thom under the superintendence of the gentlemen already mentioned the final distribution of any fund that may be collected should be confided and to the shanghai committee the funds col lected in this ovuntry should be remitted
