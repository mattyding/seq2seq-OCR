norfolkstreet strand hee first took out his certificate in the year  it would be unauestionably proved that in the year  he was at tokenhouseyard the relations betwreen the defendants appeared to be somewhat anomalous relations in v it would be found that in theearly part of the yearpeacoek was employed as solicitor and confidential adviser to mr and mrs buckle and in the early part of the year cogblan was employed as manager of the sale and exchange news aper of which mrs buckle was sole proprietress e was therefore the guardian of her interests while peacock ias her legal adviser in may  there had been some conversation which ended in negotia tions for the eale of the paper to mr sharman who was to pay � down and � by instalments that agreement however although it was executed was cancelled by theexpress advice of peacock who said it would be unwise to part with the paper as it was a good property mrs buckle listened to his advice and did cancel the agreement mr slharman would say that he had had an interview with peacock who promised to send the cancelled agreement but it had not been received mrs buckle remained owner of the paper and in the month of july  the prisoner

the transfer of two shares coghlan urged the acceptance of the � and advised mrs buckle to expend the sum of i in improving the paper by pushing it forward and advertising it mrs buckle not having a large sum of money to the credit of her draw ing account said she could not do it coghlan was alleged to have said there could be no risk as the writer of the letter guaranteed � and if mrs buckle woruld give the � she could have it retumned in three weeks upon receiving this advico from coghlan mrs buckle consulted her husband and naturally he consulted peacock the subject of the lettervwas discussed aid mr peacock recommended the paymetrt of the money mr buckle had not the money at the nnoment but went to his bankers and made arrangements for the advance of the money on august  mrs

written out payable to mrs buckle who endorsed the cheque it was left with peacock so that he should see it deroted to the paper mr and mrs buckle then went awaly for a holiday and staved until september while at thirsk she received a visitfrom the two defendants and had iconversation with peacock which she detailed in evidence mr matthews then referred to other  conversations detailed in

appointed to conduct the business at  strand onaugust the day the� chequo was signed it wouldbe found that mr buckle took some sbares he held in the lion brewery company to his solicitor leacock with the object of instructing bim to pre pare a deed of gift to his wife peacock and coghlan were together peacock said he could not attend to the matter that dayas there were so many formalities to go through in connexion with the transfer he suggested thatthe shares should be left and he would deposit them  rith his bankers little suspecting mr buckle left the shares it was a fact the defend ants
