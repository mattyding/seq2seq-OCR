in sujth africarom our special war coespowdenjthe south african war may be convenieintay aivided into five distinct periods the iirst of these would be the successful boer inva eion of british territory terminating with the rele of ladysmith on february    and the second the period of boer organized resistance which roughly speaking finished with the formal annexation of the trans vaal on october   and the fuight of espresident kruger to holland the next period which was undoubtedly the most umsatisfactory of the whole war may be characterized asaperiod of transition it marls the opening of earnest gaerilla resistance on the part of the enmy and uncertain casting about on the part of the brftish for a definite system with hich to grapplewith an unforeseen develop ment this phase may rightly be mid to have continued until the abortive middelburg negotiations were broken off on march   the net phase was that which saw the slow building up of the blockhouse system and the inauguration of mnany smal punitive colunrrns and my be considered to have extended to the close of last year the fifth and last period is tait which we have just gone throughthe fina fevelopment of the blockhouse scheme and the sstematie  driving  o the enemy upon fortliled lines of posts which undoubtedly vas tho direct cause of the peace concluded on may  last lord kitehener whom tle contrywelcomes home today has been intiawtely conneeted with four oe tlese five periods with the second as lord robertss chief lieu teant with the last three as comnmanderin chief hionsoifof the period when lord kitchener was in a subordinate position little need be said here as this ground vas adequately covered in the columns of lhe times on the occasion of lord lobertss return from south africa but although it has become falshionable in certain quarters to extol thle rinaes of lord kitchener as a soldier by the inference that he took over the command of the army in smith africa at a period when the mlitary dircetion was to some extent dis orsized it should be borne in mind that lorditcheiner mst be identified in some degree wih all the work for which lord roberts took resposbiity as a matter of fact between july lj and january   a very consider a leamaantofdisoranizationdide dst itwas not of the natare of a general paralysisfar from it bat it rather one of those periods of reaction wicb are to be foumd in the histories of all cam paigns periods of reaction which invariably follw the consumition of some defnite military obzect the definite obect of lord robertss crmangn had been the occnation of the capitals nd moreimportaiut towns of the dutch republics and the establishment of railway communication with all his bases rightly or vrongly it was anticipatud that when once thishad been done the enemy would bow to the inevitable and accept the military superiority of the nation wvhich hadested their capitzals from them but the extra ordinary patriotim nd vitality of the boer proved thlt this had been a miscalculation and for a period the military direction was at a loss hov to maintain its existing position and at the same time cope with the unconventional warfare whic instead of decreasin increased in the dihsfected area to an ahusning degree lord rolertss and general belers armies made a supreme effort to occupy pretoria and komati poort  and havinrg accomplished their immediate eod for the time being were exhausted healambering divisions mnarhed here and counter marched there bxut if we xcet the events vhich resulted in the pririsloo surrender and the action at bothavile they found little to strike but a vanishing enemy whose sting they could feel but whom it ns impossible to see there is no doubt that after the occupa tion of aretoria as after the oceupation ofbloem fentein golden opporunities were allowed to pass not because the fieldmarshal was blind to the opportawties aithin his reach but because he had not the machinery at hand with which to icovw unp the successes lie had gained also the opinion has been expressed we caniot say with wvhat authority or accuracy that if the field miarshal had been possessed of a less honourable and kindly nature a termination of the struggle s lar as the transvaal ras concerned might have been broughlt about when pourparlk s passed between him and louis botha before the battle ve diamond  il but this fact which is an essential in a study of lord kitcheners campaign remains that at one period shortly after the occupation of pretoria law and orderwere practi allv restored in the southern districts of the orange river colony british officers main tained exeentive control and the farmers rlturned to their pastoral vocations lord roberts groping for some system which should be adequate to cope with the new character inifused into the operations unfloubtedly favoured a slow reclaiming of the country by the mili tary occupation of the most important indus trial centres and a system of occupation was in progress when he relinquished tne command of the army in south africa to lord kitchener on november  now those peopie who would make a comparison between the work of the commandelinchief and lord kitehener should not forget that lord kitehener was a party to the operations with whichi lord roberts had been concerned and looking back upon the situation which presented itself in the theatre of war during the closing months of  the unbiased student can only come to the conclsion that the british opera tions for the restoration of peace in the occupied colonies were purely experimental an expedient had to be found to check the partisan warfare and it nas the difficulty of finding the best expedient or an expedient which should prove adequate vhich was the harassing task allotted to the new commanderinchief thus it was that system after system was adopted only to be found wanting before defnite results were brought about there is no doubt that in theory lord robertsssystemnofslow military occupation sas the correct and shortest means to the desired end but to have carried this scheme out would have required four times the number of men morunted and other that were to hand the etemy were not slow to teach us the folly of small garrisons and inordinate convoy services they were beginning to appreciate the valne of the initiative in attack in fact the srvival of the fittest found the boers in the field no longer an army of farmers but a force of seasoned veterans who required no coaching in the art of var their wonderful facilities for getting information and their mobility made it possible for them to concentrate in such numbers against any weak post or convoy that all the smaller of the occupied townsips were at their mercy the attacks on dewetsdorp jacobsdal fauresmith and helvetia the disasters to brabants the body guard and kitchenersfightmng scouts and the captulre of many minor convoys were all proof of this and lord kitehener feeling that we had not a suffleiently large force efficiently to carry out the legacy which had been left him deterined to withdraw the whole of his immobile fores to the railway communications and render them absolutely secure thus forming a permanent basefrom whieh to operate with his mnted men the outcome of this scheme was the discovery that we were hopelessly short of the necessary complement of mnounted troops with which to cope with the remaining force of the enemy which in the light of subsequent evidence at the time of lord ritcheners accession to power comld not have been less than  men lord eitcheners frst intention undoubtedly was definitely to clear the country of stock and inhabitmts by mobile columns operating from the railway the impression generally prevailed in south africa that the boers on account of their proverbial ionestickts could nt on endure seoarationfrom their wives and famuies also for military reasons it wras necessary to remove the occupants from their farms the surrender policy which had alloweed a large proportion of the enemy to return to their farms flurnished with  passes had proved a farce of the most puerile nature we had promised protection to such burghers as sirsendered and returned to their estatesa promise which ougt never to have been made and which in but few instances could be falfilled this undertaking of protection to a great extent prejudiced our influence with the peace party amongst the boersa factor in the campaignwhich aboat this timevwas beginning to appear in bloemfontein and other considerable towns partly to meet the apparent breach of faith to the surrendered burghers consequent upon a withdrawal from the oecupation of outlying townships and in the main to further the  clearance  scheme the concentration camp organization was conceived it is possible that the conception of the concentration camps and the inordinate haste in which lord kitchener pushed hurriedlyrecruited mounted troops into the field are the only two serious blots upon the handling of a campaign fraught with difliculties which at times appeared to be almost insur mountable and although one of those blots namely the placing of untrained and undesirable men in the theatre of warhad dire results yet looking impartially at the situation as it then presenteditsclf it would be childish to let them weighagainsttheworkof ageneralwho hashandled and brought to a successful issue a campaign the magnitude and intricacies of which no living man had anticipated it must always be borne in mind that at this periodthe opening of the year we were still groping in the dark searching for some expedient to cope with a situation without historical paratlel is it to be wondered then that it took time to find the right expedient the formation of concentration camps did not bring about the desired results in fact it rather increased the difficulties of the situation the undesired interference of inquisi tive and notorietyseeking persons brought the concentration camps into public notice so that they became a lever in the proboer campaign at home and on the continent which has been the most nauseating circumstance of the whole war but that was a lesser evil in comparison with the effect which the camps had upon the military situation the scheme which nvas designed to bring pressure upon the boers still in the field instead of goading them into surrender was wel comed by them as a means by which to rid them selves of impcdimenta they cheerfully as cap tured correspondence has shown sent their womenfolk under the proteetion of their enemy and took the feld with a lighter heart but as a movement the concentration camps could not be dispensed with once started these camps had to stay and the world was startled by the unpre cedented spectacle of an army of occupation housing feeding and clothing the women and children of the enemy sti opposed to it in the ield it is not easy to realize the full extent of the responsibility which lord kitchener incurred through the concentration campmovement not only was he called upon to feed his army but  of the enemy as well this was no mean umdertaking when he had to depend for his food supply upon three lines of railway communication exposed to constant attack by an enemy which had chosen train wrecking and railway destruc tion as its chief method of resistance apart from this lord kitcheners positionwas rendered more difficult by the action of the great com munity exiled fiom johannesburg tie principals were itching to resume their moneymaking labours the vast crowd of dependent workers were practically starving on the cape and natal seaboard the enormouspressurewhichmoneyed classes can control was brought to bear upon the patient general sitting steadfastly at the helm at pretoria bat as he said himself  the inte rests of his army were his first consideration he would not let the thousands back to johannes burg until he could rest assured tjhat no untoward turn in the campaign might sever his com munications and saddle him vith a starving popu lation in the great mining centre nor wolid he allow drones in the militaay sense baek to the hive until the working bees of the same family could be released from their duties in the field on this point ord kitchener was firm and all rightminded men will commend his aetion though they may think that many of the  iorking bees  would have been better employed in tunnelling for gold than in bearing arms in warif the question were put to the returning com manderinchief and he were asked which period he considered the most trying in his life we fany that he would say the first six months of  through all this harassing period he satat pretoria searching for a means to solve the difficulty he divided such portion of his army as could claim to be mobile hialf placed umder the command of sir john french xas detached to sweep the great high veld of the transvaal the solutheastern provinces the other half was employed in watching de wet who now made a reality of his promised invasion of cape colony but it was the old story of in sufficient men in a huge country by a supreme effort and the magnificent cooperation of his railvay administration and the gallant plumer lord kitchener was able to frustrate de wets personal invasion but it was a case of conforming to the enemys movement the initiative stl lay with them and the result vas the festering sore which remained open in the colony until the ratification of peace it waslongmonths before lord ritchener was to find the means to vrest the initiative from his enemy wwhen once he did this and caused them to conform to his movements instead of being obliged to conform to theirs the end eame speedily enough sir john freenchs march dificult and harassing as it was was a failure so far as reducing the resistance of the main transval conmandos it added to the list of captures in kind and munitions and indirecly served its purpose but it vas not productive of the results which were expected from it in fact this movement and lytteltons abortive drive in the southeast corner of the orange river colony convinced lord kitehener that he had not yet found the key of the problem which he had so determinedly set himself to solvebut an indirect result of de wets failure in the colony and the active operations which lord kitchener had set in motion after he had secured the railway was found in the nibble at negotiation which came from louis botha the acting commadantgeneral of the boer forces on february   botha wrote to lord kitchener and suggested a meeting this meeting took plaee at middelburg trausval on the same day that de wet finally shook the dust of the colony from his feet great hopes were built upon these negotiations and there is no doubt that provided lonis botha was in earnest they came within an ace of bringing off the peacewhich was fot ratilfed until lmonths later but ijudging from the abrupt tone of the correspon deuce which terminated these negotiations it is impossible to divest oneself of the suspicion that they were never intended to be final by the boer government whatever may have been the individual sincerity of louis botha theirrepresentative the common deduction is that the boer leaders seeing that there could be but one end to the struggle had instituted these negotiations as a feeler to probe the attitude of the british towards themwhatever the motive the negotiations proved abortive but not in any manner which may be taken to reflet upon the tact and diplomatic faculty of the commanderinchief who was simply acting as the agent of a higher authority in england there is no denying the fact how ever that their failure was a deep disappoint ment and there folowed a period of despon dency in pretoria and south africa generally progress seemed so slow no appreciable change was evident in the situation trains were con stantly vwreked the everincreasing populatin in the concentration camps seemed to be a millstone vwith which it would be impossible to swim the supply of horses did not meet the demand and the disafection in the colonies was spreading even the stoical chief of the army who had to shoulder the responsibility of it all was affected by this despondency he was even heard to remark i have tried everytbing what is to be doile now   in fact it looked as if it would devolve upon the nation to stand the enenseof hostileacsationutni tbeasboerwas destroyed or capturedtruly a desperate view to those who can appreciate the size and possibilities of the theatre of onerations but there were brighter lights though at this period they had to be looked for ipretoria johannes burg bloemfontein and other centres were being judiciously administered under careful supervision the situation had improved in the concentration camps consequently the peace party had increased when it was seen that no racial animus was allowved to bias the newvrulers the example set by the administration at bloemfontein had much to do with this also the extension of police posts round that town and the linking up of the capital with ladybrand had becn attended with results which were fll of promise lord kitehener saw all this and doubtless the blockhouse system found its birth from about this date but lord kitchener determined to give orthodox military operations their full chance new and distinguished names were imported from india a redistribution of commands was made and the winter campaign was allowed to proeeed a real advance was made in the situation pietersburg and its rail way communications were occupied sir bindon blood operatednorth of thekomatipoortpretoria railway in the bush veld reorganized columns traversed the western stretches elliot paraded pompously up and down the orange river colony sir john french was sent to take cape colony simmering in halfsuppressed re bellion in hand the high commissioner went home to englanfl and lord kitchener taking the reins of government from him gave some latitude to the longsuffering toilers at the mines under restricted conditions of pay to employps and licence some few mines were allowed to drop stamps and recommenee crush ing but progress was slow and it was still in the hands of the enemy to make us conform to their movements they concentrated in some partieular area a counterconcentration of british columns nvas the result and the enemy would vanish to concentrate elsewhere and so the wearv history went on some small british success wvould be followed by a  regrettable incident unimportant in itself but sufficient to buoy up the enthusiasm of the enemy and hvhat was worse to supply them with ammunitiona niew expedient was necessary as lord eitchener had said  i have tried everything it was then that he reluetantly set himself the task of partitioning the country with blockhouse lines he knew it would be slow blockhouses cannot be built in a dayor in a month for that matter ile knew it would be an ex pensive expedient but it was the only one which seemed to promise any possibility of ultimate success but whilo this network of posts was being constructed the great mill of operations was not slacked for a moment for a time we had no fortunethe proverbial luck of the british army had deserted us by the smallest possible margin rimington missed catch ing president steyn at ieitz by a similar narrow margin major bridgford lost louis botha in the western transvaal but the great captain in pre toria was steeled against rebuffs of this kind re buffs made mere serious by the peevish impatience which began to show itself in e ngland he had set his mind upon one great end and he was steering directly for it his vessel it is true had but little way on yet he from the conning tower in pretoriacould perceive the motion he had  setbacks  it is true  setbacks  which upset all caleulation for the time being

the bed of sickness too after a period of comparative inactivity and returning to the cbarpea with forces which undid an the good that dixons and kekewichs columns had done in the western transvaal

returned to his support the relations of these two great men with each other during the most delicate period of their lives will furnish some day the most fascinating study with which the historian has ever had to deal diversity of opinion there vas sure to have been friction apparently there was none which is the highest tribute possible to the great qualities of both menbat the pendulumwasslowly swinging theblock house system was beginning to bear some small resultsnot appreciable results perhaps but still results which gave evidence of efficacyfor the future moreover a further distribution and de centralization cf commands was bringing younger men to the front the time had arrived when young men eould be entrusted with detached commands the tendency to surrender on the part of the enemy became more prevalent and as a natural consequence it was possible to obtain much more definite and accurate informa tion men who really understood the subtle working of the native mind were employed as intelligence agents the results were seen in the splendid services rendered by colonel wools sampson and others success after success marked the close of  there were one or two reverses such as brakenlaagte and tweefon tein but they in no wise checked the steady march towards the ultimate end in fact if the truth were known it is probable that lord kitchener welcomed aggressive action on the part of his enemy it was a sign of their temper of the desperate condition of their cause we know that he had told botha at the middelburg conference that he invited attack and was never more pleased than wvhen the boers tested the ordeal at the point of the sword to be successful they had to make sacrifices whichwere irreparable while a thousand men more or less made no materal difference to the british cause and slowly while bruce hamilton was crump ling up bothas most dangerous commandos the blockhouse system was nearing a workable com pletionthe vast areas of both new colonies were being slowly partitioned and as experience taught the best methods of making these defences secure innovations and improvements were established in december affairs bad so far improved as to allow of further encouragement to the mining industry in johannesburg in fact wherever circumstances would permit civil jurisdiction was allowed to be resumed as far as possible but it was not until february  that lord kitchener on the bridge in pretoria felt just fied in signauing to his engineroom  foll steam ahead i  he was now about to make the boers conform to his movements instead of reluctantly conforming to theirs the wolvehoek drive took place in february and its results showed that lord kitchener had at last found an expedientcapable of meeting the extraordinary cha racter of the war there can be no doubt that the wolvehoek drive proved to the boers the utter folly of their attitude for a moment they were spurred to a desperation whieh they had never before evinced delareys successes were a proof of this but it was the expiring effort the blockhouses had served their pur pose and on march  three days before the death of mr rhodes the delegatesfrom the boer government arrived in pretoria to treat many theories were then set afoot people generally were sceptical even the best informed of corre spondents expressed doubts when the negotia tions began to drag but lord kitchener kept his own counsel and he managed the difficult question of the delegates with that tact and diplomatic genius which is even more highly developed in him than military jurisprudence this journal held the view that the negotia tions must have had great promise of success otherwise lord kitchener with the memory of the middelburg conference so strong upon him would never have undertaken them how the preliminaries came about is at present unknown by what particular means the more irreconcil aye of the boer rsers were oon oger has noty o transpired  we can only suggest that the result for which we vaited so long i the maim da to to tawcu and kmattitude of the two men in whom the nation had vested power with every cofllideneeas mr chamberlain is credited with having said  there is only one situation fraught with more anxiety than a declaration of war and that is the ratification of a peace the patching up of a peace which left the enemy morose and sullen would hardly have improved the situation in south africa ebt lord kitchener is one of the few men who look beyond the affairs which oceupy them at the moment even in the most despondent moments of his campaign and there must have been many he always had in view the ultimate reconciliation of the belligerent races always worked to the end that he should not leave to south africa a legacy of racial hatred for this reason he encouraged social intercourse between the army of occupation and surrendered boers in the towns and never inter fered with the interduttch feeling which grew up out of the surrenders for this reason he gave his whole weight to the national scout movementan act of diplomacy upon which it is not necessary to dilate his tactful speeches at the close of the ncgotiations the enthusiasm which his attitude infused into his late enemies and the cheerful manly and complete surrender of the boers are testimonies to the services which lord eitchener has rendered not only to south africa but to the empire at largelastly as to the man himself for some reason after his sudan canpaign lord kitchener was painted in colours which to sav the least were misleaing he was represented as a cold calculating machine hard and un bending almost unnatural in his dealings with other mena truly exaggerated portrait he possesses indeed a character wliich is firm determined and steadfast when he is faced with a difficult problem all considerations foreign to the solving of that problem are brushed aside but those who have been in contact with him can never say that he was inhuman or unreason able hlis greatest asset perhaps is his power of judging the character of those around him he possesses a peculiar faculty for surrounding hinself with able mena faculty which has served him well and which has been of immense service to his country may it not be from the mouths of those who have not found favour wvith him that his character has been misrepresented  doubtless he has his faults and perhaps tho greatest of these is a desixe to saddle himself with responsibilitv for everything tnder his control to be intimately connected with more detail than the human mind can conveniently embrace the personfication of mortal energy himself he is prone to expect in others a standard equal to his own that he is feared by his subordinates is true but should it be otherwise  he certainly is loved by those who have worked successfully for him his standard of judging success may be a high one but in the long run the army and the nation will profit by this though he may have made mistakes in judging the quality of some men in the main it will be found that these mistakes are few  and though lord eitchener may not possess the magnetic influence of some great lenders in winning the hearts of his subordinates he will always preserve an ascendency both as soddier and statesman his subordinates will always be drawn close to him by their unquestioning con fidence in him as a leader
