goldraining com panies incorporated under the laws of and carrying on business in the late south african republic and the action vws brought to recover  loss under a policy of insurance granted by the defendants by the poicy which was dated september  s gold to be declared was insured during transit from the mines in the wit watersrand goldfields district to destination in the united kingdom the perils insured aainst included  rrests restraints and detiniments of all idngs princes and people and the policy contained the  free of capture and seizuro  clause which vas in the folow ing terms

vtereeniging a frontier railway station in transvaal territory by officials of the transvaal government actin nnder the orders of the executive council and on ctober  a further quantity of gold amounting to  was seized at a bank in johannesburg where it had been deposited by the plaintiffs on those dates the ultimatum had been delivered by the south african republic to the british government and it was anticipated that war might shortly break out be tween the republic and great britain and it did so break out on october  at the time of the seizures the commandos had been called out and the railways had been taken over by the government of the republic in addition to relying on the  free of capture and seizure  clause the defendants pleaded the same points of defence as were raise i in the case of  driefontein consolidated mtines limited v janson  the liresc lawv reports   coin on  but in viewv of the decision of the court of appeal in that case adverso to the underwriters the defendants did not ina this case argue those points though they reserved to themselves the right to do so hereafter if need be the main question now raised w as as to the effect of the free of capture and seizure  clause which clause was not in the policy sued on in the former case according to the evidence the taking and detention of the gold was in accordance with the lavs of the south african republic mr justice phillimore gave judgment in favour of the defendants holding that iiie loss was caused by  seizure  within the meaning of the exception in the policy the plaintiffs appealedmr lawson walton sc mr j a hamilton kc and mir john dove appeared for the plaintiffs  lord robert cecil sc mr alfred lyttelton rc end mr ir w loehnis for the defendantsthe count dismissed the appealthe master of the rorls said that in this case a large quantity of gold was consigned by a subject of the late south african republic or at any rate by a person living under the protection of the law of the republic to this country and the gold was insured with the defendants during transit against  arrests restraints and deteinments of all kings princes and people then followed the warranty clause relied upon by the defendants  warranted free of capture seizure and detention and tho consequences thereof or any attempt thereat piracy excepted and also from all consequences of riots civil commotions hostilities or warlike operations wvhet er before or after declaration of war  at the time when the gold was consigned an ultimatum had been delivered bh the government of the south african republic to tho british government but var had not been declared a few days before the declara tion of war the gold was arrested at vlereeniging by an official of the south african republic under the orders of the government of that state the commandos had then been called out and the railway and its staff had been taken over by the government of the republic the consignment in question was accompanied by an armed escort composed of persons in the service of that government upon arrival at lvereeniging the gold was taken over by the officials of the government in these circumstances the plaintiffs clairmed under the policy as upon a loss caused by an  arrest restraint and detain mnent of kings princes and people tho defendants contended that the loss did not come within those words but that if it did it came vwithin the exception in the warranty clause the plaintiffs were in this dificulty the risks insured against within which they sought to bring the case inmplied an act of superior force or of paramount authoritv which they were not in a position to resist the plaintiffs accordingly had to bring in the element of force and at the same time to attenuate that element as far as was possible so as to prevent the application of the exception contained in the warranty clause they had to got in a sutilcient element of foree but not enough to bring the case within the exception they therefore said that there was an acquiescence on tbe part of the owners of the gold to hand it over to the government of the republic under the law of the state and that amounted to an  arrest but not to a seizure  wvithin the meaning of the exception in his lordships opinion the plaintiffs had not succecded in getting out of that difliculty there was at the timo the issue of the ultimatum immediately followved bv the culling out of the forces of the country wvhich wcs itself the first preliminary of warlike operations and which led to the suspension of the constitution letting in the maxim salus populi suprena uz a maxim of law which was above law the taking possession of the gold i for the benefit of the country in those circumstances seemed to him to bring the case within the word  seizure in the exception the contention that the surrender of property in such circumstances was not a yielding to force and that the taking possession was not a  seisure was au impossible contention cases bad been referred to to show that such an act of authority was not a  seizure upon looking at those cases it eeemed to him that thev supported the other view in  cory v burr  s app cas  lord selborne said  the first question which has been considered in the argument has been wvhat is the meaning of the words  capture and seizure   lvarranted free  clearly means that the insurers are not to be liable for the things to which the warranty applies i own i should have hesitated even if there had been no authority before i should have been brought to agree with the view which was thrown out in the course of the argument    the view i mean that  capture and sizure  in such a warranty must be talken to mean prita faci belligerent capture and seizure orny my reasons for saying so are that the word  seizure  is used as well as the word capture i am disposed to agres that if the word capture  had stood alone it might have appeared to point to a belligerent capture but the addition of the word  seizure  is only officious as i read the warnty by supposing that it is to exclude that narrow con struction of the word  capture  and to let in other seizures such as lord justice cotton suggests by means of the revenue laws of a foreign state the facts of this case show what the nature and effect of sucha seizure is the ship was seized in every sense we can put upon the word  seined it was taken forcibla possession of and that not for a temporary purpose not as incident to a civil remedy or the enforcement of a civil right not as security for the performance of some duty or obligation by the ovners of the ship but it was carned into effect in order to obtain a sentence of con demnation and confiscation of the ship every word of that applied to the present case the spanish authorities m that case sent the indicia of force and not the actual force and directed the revenue officers to seize the ship and the master yielded to this exhibition of authority so in the present case the escort and the officials of the government were the force to carry out the orders of the government the plaintiffs in surendering the gold yielded to an acttof paramout authority and the seizure was none thetlessaseizure beeam sit wjustified under the law of tle republio�zqwltejlr rgnjl f zjsnthflrtjin the same case lord fitzgereld said   capture i would seem properlv to include every act of seizing or taking by an enemy or belligerent  seizuro  seems to be a larger term than  capture and goes beyond it and may reasonably be interpreted to embrac every not of taking forcible possession either by a lawful authoritv or by overpowering force those words exactly embraced what happened in this case it was said that the lawful authority  must be taken as not including the lawvful anthority of the country itself be did not think that that distinction ws justified by the authori ties and lord blackburn in  cory v burr where he referred to tho decision in  eavelock v tancill   tr  showed that le did not think there wvas any such distinction it was clear to him the master of the bolls that this vas a seizure accompanied by the indicia oi overwlielming force tho authority to seize the gold being based on the suspension it might be the con stitutional suspension of the ordinary law there was a further consideration which strmgthened this view tho waranty clause excepted besides capture seizure and detention all consequences of riots civil commotions hostilities or warlike operations whether before or after declaration of war the coruandos had been called out which let in the suspension of the ordinary lasp of thcestate it was a supreme emergency and let in the doctrine of rains peputi anprcema i tlere wrere there fore warlike operations befora the delaration of vr and the seizure of the gold was a consequene of thosewvarlike operations the case therefore fell within mee i than one of the risks excepted from the poliev the

stated in the report of the case in the law reports   kl  and are as follows flis lordship read the facts which are substantially the same as these set out above and continued the quarter sessions affirming the licensing justices hadheld that the continuity of theappllictats licence hadbeen brokien and that therefore he was not entitled to claim a renewal of his licence unless thehonse in respect of which he claimned had complied wvith the conditions as to value laid down in section  of the licensing act in this case �p the case for tho applicant was that under the second clause of that section he was exempted from the conditions of value therein imposed and was bournd only by those of s and  vict c vi in this case rnd that the premises exceeded that value the case depends on the meaning of the second ckluse of section  of  the licensing act  it is not i think necessary to refer to the first clause which has perplexed the courts and the text writers see r patersons note to the section in his hoo on the licensing acts and  reg v macn  lr s qb  it is admitted trat this case depends on the second clause only that clause is as followspremises not at the time of the passing of this act licensed for the sale of any intoxicating liquor for con sumption thereupon shall not be qualified to receive a licence authorizing such sale unless the following con ditions sre satisfied the section therefore is framed to exclude from qualification for a licence after the pass ing of the act any house not of the prescribed value unless at the time of the passing of the act it is licensed for the sale of amy intoxicating liquor for consumption on the premnises its object therefore obviously was while raising the standard of the value qualification for the future to safeguard to somne extent at all events the rights such ns they vere in respect tohouses already licensed at the time of the passing of the act and the question is how fnr the legislature must be taken to have enacted that such houses and their owners should be relieved from the burden of the new qualification it is contended by the applicant the respondent here and he was bound to contend no less that this immunitv is con ferred once for all upon the house provided it was in fact licensed at the timre of the passing of the act quite irrespective of whether or not that licence has been con tinued by renewals and no matter to vwhat purpose it may have been applied in the interval between the pass ing of the act and the subsequent application it is con tended on the other hand that the legislature must have intended to continue the immunity only so long as the licence in existence at the time of tho passing of the act had oeen kept alive by renewals and that the prin ciple laid dovn by the court of queens bench and confirmed by the mouse of lods in the parallel case arising under or created by section  of the wline and ileerhouse act ls must be applied to this legislation also this makes it necesary to consider that section and the cases decided under it for it seems to me tbat when closelv scratinized the two sections though contained in different acts of parliament are equally enacted with reference to the wellmnown practice of magistrates in dealing vith the renewal of licences nd equally had for their object tho safeguarding of existing licenceholders in respect of their licensed houses secticn  of the act of iso  and s vict c  when first nassed was so far as is material in these words  where on the first of may  a licence under any of the said recited acts is in force in respect to nny house or shop for the sale by retail therein of ber eider or wine to be consumed on the prerises it shall not be lawful for the justices to refuse an application for a certifcate for the sale of beer cider or wine to be consumed on the premises in respect of suchbouse or shop except apon one or more of the grounds upon which an application for a certificate under this act in respect of a licence for the sale of beer cider or wine not to be consumed on the premises may be refused in ccordance with this act it wasamlndedbyan act of the following vear hut before that actcame into operation it was interproted by the court of qneens bench in  hargreaves v dawsn   lt s it was there held that though on the bare languige of the act the condition of immunity fromr obection on grounds onher than the four named was simplyv fiat on mfay   a licence under any of the recited acts wasin force wvith respect to the house to conistrue the conditions so narrowly womd be to ignoro the practice prevailing under the licensing laws and to defeat thsobvions intention of the leislature and the court therefore construed thoso wrds as not extending to the ease where a licence existing at the date of the act had nct been continued by annal renewals the hey to toe decision is contained in the observation of lord chief justice cockburn in the courso of the argument  does not the th section implv that there is an exist ing licene  that is at the time of the appication the egislature by the amending act of   and  vict c  exptessly enacted in section  what the court had so decided the irmt ter csme up for discussion reain in reg v curzon  ll s qb  after the amnding act of s had been repealed and the court held that  on the true onstruction of section  of the act of  confirmed by section  of the act of  s and s ict c  the justices were not prohibited from exeresing their discretion in the aseof a house licensed on miay  is the licence or certificate of which bad lapsed before the atpplication for renewal  and they expressly approved the decision in  argreaves v davison decided without reference to either of the amending acts the matter ultimately came before the house of lords in the clse of  freer v murray  s ac  where the decislons i have referred to were approved and the house held under eircumstances practically indistinguishable fronm tbose in this cese as to the history of the licence that the fact of the chain of continuity having been brolnpt thp auflantostgide theptegilio ofieotjp and left the justices an absolute disoretion as in the case of a new licence ga the argument iu the court of appeal lord esher r expressly agreed with the sew taken bv the court of queens bench in  har greaves v davisoi end approved in  eg v curzon von the construction of section  standing alone and unenimnded lf therefore it is necessary for the applicant in this case to show that his lioence has been renewed up to the date of his last application  freer v miurray  is a clear authority in the house of lnrds that be has firled to do so is there then any i substantial distinction between the legislation of section  of the act of  and that of section  of the act of  which would justify us in refusing to apply to the present case the princiole of the decisions upon the act of sj to wvhich i havereferred icannot think that there is in tho one case that under the act of  the legislature were continuing to persons lioensed at the time of the passing of the act a certain immunity which they then enjoyed while as to persons not licensed thev left unfetterd discretion to the magistrates so here they preserve for persons having licences at the time of the passing of the asct immunity from disqualification on the ground that their bouses fall below a certain value while to others who did not hold licences at the time of the rsasing of the act thev negatived qualification unless their hoises ara of a mucli larger value it seems to me that all the reasons which induced the court to interoret the firstnamed act as they did apply eanlly to the second it is difficult to assign any reason in the one case more than in the other w hy the legislature should have intended to enact arbitrarily that the condition of the honse at the time of the passing of the act should determnine for ever the tights of the occupiersthereafter quito irrespective ofwhether it continued to bs used as a publichouse or fot any other purpose the same reasons that led the courts  to insist in the one case that the section must be taken to refer to a licence kept continually in existence up to the date of the application applv eqnally to the other and no reason was given in argument why any other intention thould be supposed nor does it seem to me that there is any such difference in the language ns to justify any valid distinction lhat the language of the section in the one case is affirmative snd in the other negative can sureiy make no solid difference if tho provision of section  of the act of  be thrown into the affirmative it seems to me that it cannot be dis tinguished from section  of the act of  at my invitation mit avory transposed the sentence thus premises licensed at the time of the passing of this act    shall be qaalified that is on application  to rcceive the licence although the following pro visions are not satisiled if the premises are licensed a licence is  in force  vith respect to them in the same sense as in the act of  and i think no effectual distinction can ba made because the words in the later aet in terms refer to tho premises and not to the occupier wvhat the legislature is oonsidering inboth eases is  right of the owner or occupier in respect of the premises the intzrests they are safeguarding cannot be considered as dissevered from the owner or occupier it is equally the right or expectation of the ownder or occupier in respect of the premnises owhich is to be safeguarded in both cases relianace wnv also placed byr avery on the words  an application in section  of the act of  but as no question as to qualification can arise either for ai newv licenee or a renewal except upon an application i can see no force in this argment in fact the provision of the act of  might be thron into the exact words of section  of the earlier act substituting  except on the ground of value c for  excedt anon one or more of the four grounds c withou irn any way altering the sense for these reasons i think that the decisions in the court of queens benen the icort of appeal and the houso ol lords upon the act of sg have laid down a principle applicable to the interpretation of the section now in question and that we are bourd to adopt it this view seems to me also to be in accordance with that taken by lord chief justice cockburn in  reg v amn  lr s qb at p  where he says referring to section  of the llcensing aet s  the first part of section i must be taken to refer to houses already licensed but to which at the time of the passinv of the act no licence umder the acts referred to in tbe nme and beerhouse act  is attached and it proceeds to enact that they  shall not be subject to any of the provisions prescribing a certain rent or value or rating as a qualification for receiving any licence such houses are excluded from the operation of the subsequent part ofthesection which applies to premises not at the time of the pasing of this act licensed for the sale of intoxicating liquors theln vwith regard to future applications for new licences the section provides that the premises shall be of a certain value depending upon specified circumstances i thmnk therefore that this section is intended to extend only to licences first applied for after therpassing of the act as distinguisbed from the renewal o licences previouslgraned the legislature probably did not wvish to interfere with vested interests because it would be in some cases a hardship upon a man who haa had a licence for snny years without any complaint of his conduct to be compeled to find other premises or to increase tbo value of those he occupies either of which couresit rmoa be beyond his means or beyondphysicalpossibility for those reasons with great respect to the lord chief justice end my brother lawrauce i am unable to agree with their decision which in my opinion munt be reversed and that of the quarter sessions restoredlond jusrica imaraw delivered judgment arriving at the same conclusion in the course of which he said that he would have been satisfied if it were possible to adopt the construction of the act arrived at by the divisional court and to hold that it would have been suficient if the licence had been substantially continuosy renewed the objection seemed to him to be trivial and technical in the highest degree this was a test case stated for the purpose of deterrniningwhethez the continuity of the lcense must be maintained hil lordship referred to section  of the wie and beer honse act s and said that that section contemplated a future time when the qaestion would arise whether tbh licence was  in force  on may   the ac

perfectly clear it ws passed to remove doubts whether a transfer of a licence destroyed the continuance of the licence then cause section of the lieensing act s the first clause of that sectiona apparently if taken literally wiould apply to premises in respect of whic h no licence for the sale ofbero into be consumned thereupon wxas necessary at the tienoi the passing of the act that clause was sonsewhaobscure and unintelligible and had pzzled both cam nnentators and coussel the second clause upon which this case depended was fortunately more intelligible in his lordships opinion that clause by implication referred to premises which were licensed at the time of the passing of the act and continued licensed and it excexted those premises from the requirement as to valun in that section continuity of the licence was the essence of the privilege preserved by that section it was unnecessary to o through the cases as they hai been already rerrsd to by the master of the rolls except to say that in  freer v murray  ac  the house of lords gave their fnal approval to th initerpretation placed upon section  of the wine and ibeerhouse act  by the previous authorities in the present case they were only carrying out the law thera laid down they were not as had been suggested in serting words into the section they were merely con struing it by sayinz that to bring the case within the priviloge there must be a continuous licence in respect of the premises if the premises were odce stamped with the privilege the right to a renewal of the licence was gven but once the continuitv of the renewal was brolen the privilege disappeared i it had been possible he should have liked to support the decision arrived at by the di visional court but he was unable to niace a construction upon the section which would enable ihim to do so he therefore agreed with the master of the rolls that the appeal should be allowedloru justice cezsasmvd read ths followinajudgmentflhe question raised by this appeal is whether it is lawful for justices if in their discretion they think fit so to do to grnt a licence by way of renewal for the council inn at manchester a beerhouse

licence in a citv libk manchester unless the value of the house was � per annum this was the act in forco when the licence was first granted to the council imn in  an act was passed altering the law in some respects and the exten of the alteration now arises for our consideration by section  the section of the act of sto to which i have referred was amended in an unimportant point but as so amended  it renmained in full force section  so far as material is in the following words preamises to which at the time of the passing of this act no licence umder the acts recited in the wine and

receive a licence authorizing such sale unless the follow ing conditions nro satisfied one of these conditions i that in a place such as manchester the valne must be �sil per annum now as a matter of construction it seneis to me that this council in which was licensed in  under the act of  is not within the enacting part of the section which imposes new conditions it in expressly excluded from the operation of section  and is leftsubject to
