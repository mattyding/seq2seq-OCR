signs of the times he said that they were meeting in support of and to advance a principle in therapeutics admitted and practised by many hundreds of medical men thronghout the world but alas still not generally recognized bv the bulk of the medical profession as a valuable aid in the selection of the remedy and as a mode of cure his investigations for many yearls past had not been into theaction of drags and tbe pathology of drug diseases bebt into the methods and technique of the art of surgery and ophthalmology and at this moment it was the relation of surgery to the practice of the honaaopathy of today that concerned him most hle believ ed tbat in the vast majority of cases a wellconsidered hom�opathic prescription would do more for a patient than a remedy given on any other lines but he felt at the same time that they mnst not have too blind a faith in the all powerful curative effects of dros the hahmemann standpoint had changed pans passu with the centurvs advance there was hardly an organ of the human body in coanexion with which they did not occasionally meet with conditions where the piresician and the surgeon must act conjointly if the best interests of the patient were to be considered it was importsnt for a physician to recognize when drugging shonld cease and the more mechanical means of surgery be employed for the past ten years or more thev had been

hope to establish a fullyeqaipped medical school in their present position but that need in no wy prevent them from attempting such educational work as was indicated in the programme of the new association that work would he took it be mainly of two kinds first the expounding by means of lectures and literlatr their science of therapenties and secordly providing the means for investigation and research into all matters concerming the development and elucidation of that science they must remember that they were the only echool that had held an opinion of the science of therapentics for a century they claimed that there vas a therapeutic science and as long as the old school disbelieved in a scence of therapeutics so long must therapeutics be more or less at a standstill and so long too must there be a vital difference between the two schools of medicine by means of literature and lectures they could place an uptodate exposition of the principles and claims of homcoapathy before the medical profession amongst many of the members of which there was a strong feeling as to the unsatisfactory condition of therapeutic science a condition which hampered them considerably in their daily praetice the disciples of bomesopathy had something to offer end it would be one of the duties of the british homaopatbic association to proffer with no stinting hand the knowledge they possossed and to in pene ng the darkness with which ignorance ari prejudice clouded the mind if he read the sigrn of the times aright they might  forward in their work of advancing therapeutic
