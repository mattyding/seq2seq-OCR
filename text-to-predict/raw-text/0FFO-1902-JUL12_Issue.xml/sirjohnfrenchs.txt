sir john freycivs caipaigin soucth africafjno ol spzclal wa corimspondntin welcoming general sir john french we deal with a soldier of a different class to the late commanderinchief in south afriea general french is purely a cavalry leader as distinct a vocation from that of the director of the campaign as the propeller of a steamer is from the steering gear the south african war has proved a series of miscalcula tions the numerical strength of the eney their fighting quality and resources were all miscal culated and even in the matter of our ovwn selected leaders we have witnessed the gravest misconceptions it may not be generally known but it is the fact that sir john french then a brigadier commanding the st cavalry brigade at aldershot was only appointed to eommand the cavalry division ordered to south africa against considerable opposition on the part of certain senior offieers responsible for the selection of the army corps commanders in efilciency to commad in the fieldwas the alleged reason for this opposition yet if there is one single man of the more junior officers in high eommand who has acquitted himself without reproach it is sir john fprench not only has he served on throughout the var vithout a break almost from the sending of mr krugers ultimatum but he has rendered the country as signal service as any commander who has taken part in the struggle and he has carried his service through honestly to the end when in common with less thorough generals he mnight have flitted home leaving the hard and more thankless task of paeification to others to performsir john french opened his campaign in natal where he joined sir george white a few days after the invasion of that colony as soon as he arrived he was directed to conduct a recon nalisnce to elndslaagte which was reported to be held by a boer advance guard this was on the same dav that the battle of talana was fought the reconnaissance found elandslaagte occupied and on the followiung day sir jchn french was sent out with a mixed force to attack it he found the position too strong for the force with him and sent for reinforeements sir george white in sending the required reinforce ments was inclined to supersede french in the command but at the suggestion of sir archi bald hunter to whom the eommand had been offered freneh vas left in command of the first of the many engagements which by his assist anee have beeome victories nominaily he commanded at elandslaagte  but in reality as it was not a cavalry fight the actual direction of the assault devolved on the senior infantry officer his next action excepting the reeon naissance to rietfontein was the battle of lady smith which wnas not remarkable for the slilful handling of any portion of the forces employed the samue day french received telegraphic orders to join sir redvers baler who had iust arrived in cape town by an extraordinary chance french succeeded in leaving ladysmith in the last train which brole south through the eordon by which the boers were investing white the escape of french when a delay of half an hour even would undoubtedly have sent him a prisoner to pretoria may be classed as one of the few pieces of good fortune which attended the eause of the british arms during the opening months of the war directly on frenchs arrival at cane town the commanderinehief directed him to tae command of the troops detailed to hold the country betwveen de aar on the west and sir willian cataeros division on the east in fact it was his duty to protect the exposed flank of methuens communications in cape colony from the free state commandos which after vio lating the cape colony border had concentrated and established themselves in strengtlh at coles berg the operations whieh french undertool and successfully carried out in front of the colesberg position are perhaps the most instre tire and interesting of the whole var it was not on the manoauvregrounds of europe and india it nas not in the sneaessful field of elands laagte or the disastrous morning of october   that french learned the lessons of modern war but it was duringthethreemonths of activity in facing schceman delarey and de wet inturn before colesberg that he acquired the art of south african warfare and the value of time and dash and calculated audacity in war the coles berg operations stand as a record of what might have been done if we had possessed sufficient mounted men in south africa at the outbreak of hostilities and had possessed generals of skidu resource and determination to command them for three months by judieious and skilful flnesse french vith his skeleton command spread over a front of over  miles was able to keep in check a foree that was never less than three ties as strong numerically as his own and often four or five times as strong by constant movement sometimes bv way of reconnaissanee and sometimes by way of  bluff he so mystified his enemy that he reduced them to much the same state of mental paralysis as was seen in both sir george whites ladysmith army and the force colleeted at willow grange when they were surrounded by the invading burghers it was at times a desperate expedient to keep up the character of the  bluff but it succeeded and it trained french and his staff in a manner which was not long in bearing good fruit as soon as the tide began to turn and the general was called upon to act otherwise than upon the defensive that brilliant achievement the relief of kimberley followed closely upon frenchs separation from colesberg this was the cavalrys theatrical coup of the war dramatie and sensational in its results it attracted public attention to the retiring lie man whose heart is as great as his stature is small bat brilliant episode as it was it ranks as far as real generalship may be estimated as insignificant compared with the skill with which the colesberg operations had been conducted and the way in which the reduction of the force holding the colesberg front was masked from an enemy at the moment specially reinforeed in order to force its way to beau fort west the history of the dash into kiinberley is common property but it is doubt ful if many but the closest students of war have realized how nearly that dash might have failed if there had not been a french to take theinitia tive at the crucial moment it was in that moment when french determined fo gallop his divisionthrough the defending line of boersthathe proved himself to possess the essential attribate of the true cavalry leader that attribute is themind and eye that ean select the vulnerable spot and come to a decision in the fraetion of a minnte and having come to that decision has the resolu tion to earry through  at all costs justsueh a man is french yet there were those in authority before the war who would have shelved him as incapable but peace mancouvres do not bring those moments which alone can prove the cavalry leader they are only to be found when success or failure is beyond all argumentwithin  hours of the relief of kimberley french had again brought about another brilliant achievement with the wreck of his magnificent division he had headed off cronje by holding the approaches to koodoesrand drift this was no simple operation the message which informed hin of cronjes intention and insrcted him tomove arrived at a moment when none but a brilliant man could have complied with the requaest it contained it arrived at midnight when the cavalry had worn themselves to a shadow by the attempt to cut off wessels laager and by a whole days fighting at macfarlanes farm yet french moved his force at once and arrived at the drift simultaneosly with the boers in a moment he saw the salent which it vas imperative to hold and he only just mnaged to snatch it from the enemy by the margin of a few short minutes it is at moments like these that war tests the value of a cavalry leader the subsequaent operations attendant upon the march to bloemfontein were not so successful not because the division failed in leadership but because the two brilliant strokes of the last month had used up the material yet though the commanderinchief might have hoped for greater rewlts he had if philosophical smail reason to be dissatisfiedfreaa uet came into urombee in tjmattempt which vas maide to cut off the boer army which had invested wepener and been subsequentlyheldby sir leslie rundle before dewetsdorp bnt the enemy had become wavry of french and they retired rapidly as soon as they learned that he had left bloem fontein dewetsdorp was followed by con siderable hard fighting at thaba nchu in which french was called upon to prepare an opening to alow of the advance of the right flank of the  grand axny  in its forward move upoa the vaal hurriedly recalled from thaba nchn the cavalry division was refitted in bloemfontein in fevered haste with inadequate remounts and required to arrive by a forced march at its appointed position on lord robertss left flank before headquarters left smaldeel it may be honestly said that the cavalry division never recovered from this forced march it sacrifieed its reserve force a force which it vs never able to recoup owing to the rapidity of all subsequent movements until pretoria was reached but although the cavalry division was not able to bring about any sensational captures yet its work on the left flank of the mnain advance enabled lord roberts to make his rapid movement upon the boer capitals without loss or delay the enemv took up successive defensive situations to bar the advanee but the wvatehful french turned them in succession and rendered thern untenalhe the brunt of the fighting which ocurred in is march fell upon the cavalry and although it was not fashionable to sav so at the time yet there is not the smallest doubt that the division vwas most skilfully handled especially in the engagement at the passage of the anrd iliver and rhenoster eop on may   french crossed the tail at parvs drift and pushed forward to envelop jobaunesburg from the vwest this movement brought the whole of bothas available strength against him and in theiceinity of doornkop french refused the enemv maintaining them in position untle general ian hamiltons division eould advance to the attackl while lord robertss two divisions marched into the suburbs of johannesburg practically un opposedbut perhaps the most difieult and greatest ea alry engagement in wvhich french was engaged during the whole of his service in south africa was the battle of diamond mlll outside pretoria on june  and   still operatin on the left of lord rlobertss arm general french reduced by one brigade was called upon to stand the whole brunt of the boer countea attack in the difciult country of pienaars river the united force of his division was only equal to that of a weakh brigade and he was practically enveloped by an overpowering concentration of the enemy under delarey and beyers bult the experience which he had gained at colesberg stood him in good stead he seleeted in a moment the only advantageous position which the nature of the country allowed and extending his front in a madner which in a less cpable leader might have been considered perilou held on against the crushing weight of the vicious counterattaek for s hours until ian faailtons success on the far left pierced the boer left centre and relieved the pressure this was an aetion most creditable to all concerned in it on the extreme left of the british line since the men had to abandon their rle as cavalry and act as infantry on the defensivein thbe advance to eomati poort french bore a prominent part on august  he relieved the british prisoners at nooitgedacht and  days later his division occupied barberton upon the assumption of the supreme command by lord kritchener the nature of the operations necessi tated the breaking up of the cavalry division and general french was appointed to the com mand of the southern transvaal vith his head quarters in johannesburg is next active com mand was that of the division organized by lord kitchener to sweep the high veld from the pretoriavereeniging railway to the swland border ermelo vms occupied on january s  and on the same day botba made a supreme effort to crush general smithdorrien one of frenchs lieutenants during this drive near lake chrissie smnithdorrien repulsed the attack with heavy loss to the enemy and con siderable casualty to himself and forthe time being frenehs operations were not opposed by the enemy in force but the british force had to combat the elements to an extraordjnarv degree the weather was terrifie every donga and burn became a raging torrent all movement came to a standstifland for a eonsiderable period the division was cut off from the outside world its supplies gave out and for days men and officers alike subsisted upon a flesh diet supple mented with such farinaceous food as could be localy procured but though the main results of these operations were disappointing and unsatis factory yet that was no fault of the officer who conducted them in fact they gave furtherproof though by this time proof was not wanted of prenchs abilityas a leader after two months of pitiless trekking on the lnatal border the net results of the operations were the finding of eight guns the capture of prisoners of a kind the unearthing of considerable magazines of am mnunition and the collection of a vast quantity of stockhe heavy work oe campaigning had told upon french and he retrned in april to johannes burg very much broken down in general health his medical advisers ordered him to england but it was not in the heart of this mn to leave south africa until the work which he had seen begnun was finally accomplished in may he re ceived the news of his knighthood and as a com promise with the doctors he agreed to make a sea voyage from durban to cape town andl to take a brief holiday on the seaboardat the end of june french took up the most arduous of al his dutes during his service in south africa re was asked by lord kltchener to undertake the direction of the military opera tions in cape colony the colony was then in a most perilous state it was overrun by de tached groups of desperados who sluceeded in finding a following of rebels in such districts as they setfoot in it cannot be said that french was able to stamp out thisrebeeion buthematerially improved the existing situation it was a most unsatisfactory situation throughout and all that can be said is that he made the most of the material with which he was supplied and by organizing a system was able to keep the rebel leaders more or less  hide bound  in their mountain fstnesses some of his operations were eminently successful notably the drive which re sultedin the captareof lotter in september  but though detailedtothemost unsatisfactorytask vhich could have been set him french stood to his guns to the last even refusing to come home to take up the tempting appointment at alder shot which was given to him upon the removal of sir redvers buller from the command of the ist amy corps as far back as october lastthroughout tae war general french has endeared himself to aii ranks which have served with him as a gallant openhearted leader mis men have always had confidence in hin knowing thatherarelymakesamistakeandthatif he should chance to be in error he would show the mental capacity and energy required to correct theegr without disaster his career has been one long series of seeesses and he has proved himself to possess those peuliar faculties in the field which are essential for the successful handling of cavalry and which have been found in no other cavalry oficer of senior rank in this war in action he has proved selfreliant resourceful and deter mined possessed of an instantaneous grasp almost intuitive perceptionof the right course to pursue even in the most complicubed circulstances andunexpeted dwnoumts tnperturbed by success or danger farsighted and what is more waluable clearminded he has never been known to compromise his subordinates even in the most delicate situations removed from the field of danger he is a reserved and unassuming man in fact perhaps the only fault which hissubordinates will find in him is his diffidence in making himself felt with his superior oficers in the council chamber ile has never asserted himself as the leader of the cavalry division to a large army would have been justsifed in doing but it is a failing which can count but lightly in the scale against his many and proved qualities and he returns today to england to be welcomed as the most loved and mostsue cessfill of the direct commanders in the field who have fought the nations battles in th zecent struawle on the south african tvid
