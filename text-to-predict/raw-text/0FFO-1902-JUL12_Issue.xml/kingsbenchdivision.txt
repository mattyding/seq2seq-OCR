that the chargo of d was reasonable within tho meaning of the order of the court of apneal tho case was tried at huntingdon before his lordsiip and a juty on may  and  when the learned judgo held on the authorities that the question of reasonableness was a qaestion of law for tho court but in order to arrze t a decision upon it he left to the jury certain questions tho jury found that neither gd nor any other tou would be sufficient to provide for all repairs and maintenance mixuch less give the defendant a profit in addition and that a d toll would produce the largest income the case now

provided the defendant asked for no more than would give him a reasonable prof�t beyond the cost of repair and maintenance he was doing no more than be was justified in doing and his lordship would hold that d was a reasonable toll if it could have been shown that d would provido a reasonable profit beyond thc necessary cost of sppair and maintenance and no more in that there would be involved such a degree of traffic as woould produce a revenue for that purpose and this meant a suistantial traffic the order of the court of appeal simply gave the defendant a limit tihe toll was not to be unreasonable if it gave him a reason able net profit and no more that vas all no doubt the finding of the jury as to d minimizing the loss was a matter of opinion but it was opinion based on fact the jury ourht not to leave out of account the existence of otber mgthods of tmnsport the jury had concluded that the d toll was more likely to be productive than nuy other no doubt the gd toll had produced more than the d but thrat was due to special circumstances flis lordship did not thirik gd was reasonable it was prohibitive and it kiled the interest both of the ovnoer and of the traic

crossasminationmr justaca darimg refused the application he said that it was an application to restora to to list a case in which the plaintiffs counsel on monday last after azving fully consdered the matter came to the conclusion that the plaintif could not succeed they did not now consider that they could get a verdict but they wanted the case restored in order that the plainitimight give an explation and vhen that was given it wvas not pretnded tht any other result could ensuevwhen mr gill on monday made his application as to costs he said that the case vws one of a most mpudent chaacter and was absohately without founds tion mr kisch interposed and then mr gill said perhaps i should have said blackmnailing he used thevword when he was interrupted and no doubtpro voked and thero vas nothing to show that but for that interruption he would have used it he the learned judge vas asked to restore the case not because tho plaintiff could get a verdict but in order that mr rucker might present his view of the case as opposed to the defendants counsel ho saw no reason for granting the application and he might further add that he was not surprised that the attempt to get judgment against lord ciurchill under order xiv in a case in which the plintigs couftsl came to the conclusion that he could not sucoced hbnd bean descnbed by nr gill as impudent and of course wvhen mr gill
