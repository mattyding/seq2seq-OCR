for the year ending march   are as follows ileot staff and chief engineers  engineers and assistant engineers  engineers and assistant engineers ara classed together in tho authorized numbers as pro motions depend upon length of service in the caso of engineroom ratings the shortage as compared vith the numbers voted is as follows enginsroom artificers consisting of  fitters  enginesmitbs  boilermalers and  coppersmiths  stolkers  although an addition of  stokers would make up the numbers authorized to be raised during the present year there will still be a shortage in the stolker class as to which i have given the noble lord the particulars in reply to another question the increase of stokers asked for this year ws limited to the increased numbers of the proper class which it was believed could be raised in one year one engineer is at present doing duty in lieu of a chief engineer but there are no assistant engineers employed in lieu of engineers tho regulation number of engine room ratings required for care and mainteinmee parties for vessels in tho fleet reserve compares with the numbers actually borne as follows battleships  required  borne firstclass cruisers  required  borno secondclass cruisers  required  borne thirdclass cruisers  recruired  borne gum vessels is required  borne destroyers  required  borne ihe totals for all clssses of vessels are  required as compared vith  borne or a shortage of  i ought however to add that there are still nearly nine mouths of the financial year to expire during which it is hoped that such deficiencies as exist may be materially reduced if not altogether removedin the american battleships of the inalnois clss the system of intercommunication between various parts of the vessels is very complete and ingenious and apparatus for alternative use is supplied every cabin and com partment is provided with a telephone which through a central emchange gives communication between any one point of the vessel and any other there are also voice pipes of the ordinary type in the conning tower the battle order indicator is a recent device byv which the officer in command is enabled to issue orders to any part of the ship in this part of the ship the apparatus takes the form of one or more electrio switchhoards there being a switch providedfor every necessaryorder relating to speed angle of helm range of guns torpedo dis charges c mhen it is desired to corammunicate an order the required switch is turned thereupon ean eleotric incandescent lamp illuminates from behind a small circular pane upon which is indicated the order given simultaneously the same order is repeated in every portion of the ship which it concerns as for example at tho gun positions or in the engino rocm the electric leads permitting this communication are carefully arranged and protected so that it is not thought the system wvill be specially liablo to damage if however it should break downwholly orinpart the loudspeaking telephone can be used as in british ships the complete character of the system indicates that in this matter the lunited states navy has reached a high level of efficiencypreparations are
