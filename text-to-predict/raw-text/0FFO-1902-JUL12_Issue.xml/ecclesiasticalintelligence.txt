place between colonel le mesurier and the bishop of oxford in regard to the erection of a new church for the northem portion of oxford it appears that an offer vas made of  for the purpose of building and endowing a church for summertowrn to which a new ecclesiastical district was to be attached this offer carrying with it the condition that the patronage of the chuch should ba vested in the council of wycliffe hall a memorial was addressed to bishop stubbs and signed by over iso bends of families resident in the original parish oi st giless the memorialists urging that the services in many of the district churches were too ornate to suit them bishop stubbs however did not fall in with their wishes in october  colonel le mesurier approached the present bishop on the same subject in mrch s after further correspondence it was intimated to the bishop that tho vicar of st philip and st james and his patrons st johns college had no objeotion to part of that parish being allocated to the proposed church in mjay the bishop wrote to colonel le mesurier stating that he demurred to the condition that the council of wycliffo hall ishold have tho patronagne of the proposed church there were already he said five churches in oxford in the hands of trustees and only one in the patronago of tlho bishop and he therefore thought that the new church should be in the bishops gift but he vas villing as an alternative that the pbtronage should be vested in the bishop the archdeacon of oxford the president of st johns college the principal of wycliffe hall and one member a layman by prefereniw who should be nominated by the committee of the church ilissionary society or some such body colonel le llesurier teplied that it was useless to refer tbe bishops suggestion to the donors

the valonarmytge ccty beneficesa return has just been printed and presented by the eishopof london to the hlouse of lords dealingwith the beneï¿½ices in the city of londo it wil beremnam bered thalt the information was asked for by lorilbeau champ who wished to ascertain the rnme of each incm bent and the manes of his curateor onstes if any whether there isa parsonage house and if these is whether the incumbent resides in it if he doesmot reside whatrenthe receives forthebooseandlastly thename or designation of the patrons theemest for this return ws somewhat canvassed at the time as a similar return wasprinted as recently as  buttin present paper provides some imteresting informationit is generally believed for instace that thecity clergy in the large majority of cases ocupy deeiable residences in the westend amd pzy perfunctory visiia tv their churches on siradvys the retmn deals with i benefices for it vas hardly necesry to include the mastershipof the temple and it appes that  incuu bents are nonresident while  either inhabit theiz parsonagesor live close to their parishes if no parsonage house is provided of the  nonresidents  seem to have a suficient reason for their nonresidence in the fact that their benefice has no parsonage attached to it but it is quite another question whether the placeof resi dence which they vsieselected is near enough to enablo them to do anything like justice to theirparxises the return unfortunately does not state iere tho non residents live bt it is sumlynot too much to askrtht failing avicarago theincumbent should live withintwo miles of his cure this was dr temples rule and there is much to be said for it therefore such abuse as there is in coansuion with these city benefices narrows itsli dovn to the cases of those who live elswhere because their parsonage houses are let for commercial purposes thore appear to be  such cases and it is as l that somo attempt should be made to reduce ther nanier though if leaseas have been given the process mavtake time itillhardlybe contended that the cityisnot healthy to live in and short work should be made of teasons for nonresidence such as the one given by the rector of st aisrgaret pattens that his rectuty is unfit for residence the stipean of his benefice is returned by him at ï¿½e a year which may or may not include the ï¿½ received as rent for tha house  unit for residence  it is at least sufficient to enable him to make the house habitable again thera is the case of st olave hartstreet out of which arose the request of lord besuchainp for this return here the income is ï¿½ the rector is nonresident and the particulars about the parsonage are given in this form   rectory house has been let now vacant ia other words the rector wiu be glad to hear of a tenant it may be noted that there are two of the bishop of londons suifragans whose stipends are provnded out of city becegces the case of st mary woolnoth should alsobe noticed as the incumbent retmurs the amount of his income in these words  not possible to say as house just sold  but it would have tx satisfied the purposes of the retunm if he had stated his income for the previous year which presumably included the rent of the house jnst soldone other point is worth notice in the returnthe tnnual monetsry value of these benefices as here stated on the anthoritv of the incumbents themselves the figures differ considerably in some cases from those given in  crockford  and the  london diocese book st mlargaret lothbury is here said to be of the net value of ï¿½  crockford ï¿½  london diocese book ï¿½  while the rector of all hllaovs lombardstrect who happens to be also a canon of canterburv where he resides gives his rectorial stipend as ï¿½  instead of the ï¿½ which figures in the reference boos even though these re extreme cases and will probably imdergo a large reduction on the first avoidance it is obvious tsat the city churches present a problem which wints solsing they are not fl requred even on weekdays and not one in ten of them ia wanted on sundas et manyof them haveoarchitectural merits whichbid the destroyer spare their fabrics the
