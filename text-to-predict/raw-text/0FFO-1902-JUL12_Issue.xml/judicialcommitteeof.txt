othersthese were crossappeals from a judgment of the supreme court of victoria of may  rir e f mitchell of the victorian bar and mr j herbert williams were counsel for the appellants mr haldane kc and mr etowlatt for the kingthe argmments were recently heard before a board composed of lord macnaghten lord davey lord robertson sir ford north and sir arthur nwilson when judgment was reservedlord alacnaghte in delivering their lordships judgment said the appellants were the executors of the will of the late thomas budds payne a gentleman of great wealth who died on august   domiciled in victoria at the time of his death the proceedings com menced by a petition of right whereby the executors sought to recover back probate duty paid in respect of three several sums of � � and � and the interest accrued on those sums respectively at the time of the testators death the three principal sums were secured by three statutory mortgages of land in new southwsles which were referred to in the proceed ings as kiddles mortgage meveans mortgage and mccullochs mortgage the sum of � secured bv kiddies mortgage and the greater part of the sum ot � secured by meveans mortgage were made over by the testator in s without consideration to his eldest son the appellant john fredernck william payne and both mortgages were taken in his name lhe jirst question was xvero those transfers made with intent to evade the pavment of duty  within the meaning of section  of the administtion and probate act of victoria s the answer must depend on the true construction of that enactment and on the proper infer ence to be drawn from the evidence as to the real nature of the transaction between father and son the question in controversy with regard to mccullochs mortgage was whether or not the principal sum secured thereby with the interest accrued at the date of the testators death was an asset in victoria so as to render it liable to duty there that question would also have to be considered in reference to kriddles mortgage and mcveans mort gage in the event of it being held in amcordance with a contention put forward on behalf of the respondent that the transfers of the two sums secured thereby were merely colourable the case came on to be heard before chief justice mdden he decided the first question in favour of the executors and the second in favour of the crown on appeal the position vwas reversed the full court determined the first question in favour of the crowvnand the second in favour of the executors section  of the act of  contained the following enact ment if any person has made or shall hereafter make any conveyance or assignment gift delivery or transfer of anv estate real or personal or of any money or securities of money with intent to evade the payment of duty under this part of this act in case such person should die the property contained in anv such convey nnce or assignment or the subjectmattr of any such gift deliverv or transfer shall upon the death of such person be deemed to form part of his estate for the pur poses of this part of this act upon which duty shaiibe payable under this part of this act and the payment of the duty upon the value of such property may be enforced against such property in the same way as duty under this part of this act is enforceable and as if such person had bequeathed or devised the said pro perty to the person to whom the same may have been conveyed assigned given delivered or transferred the section then wrent on to deal  with conveyances or assignments gifts deliveries or tranfers intended to takeo effect upon the death of the person making the same which were to be  deemed to have been or to be mado as the case may be with intent to evade the pay ment of the duty  under the act and  vith dona tions aortis caulsa which vwero  to be deemed to form part of the deceaseds property for the purposes of esti mating the duty the question of the meaning of the expression  with intent to evade the payment of duty  was discussed in the judgment of this board delivered by lord rlobhouse in u simms v registrar of probates   ac  although the constructionof the southustralian act which vas there in question involved the consideration of points not to be found in the present case their lordships were of opinion that the principle of the decision must be applied and that in conformity with that decision it must be held that the enactment contained in the earlier part of section  of the victorian act of  extended to and struck at colourable transac tions only it would be observed that in its terms the enactment was absolute without limitation of time or amount it was difficult to suppose that the legislature could have intended that on the death of a person dying after the passing of the act a strict account should be taken of all transfers and gifts which the deceased had ever made in tho whole courso of his life being moved thereto more or less by the desire of avoiding payment of death duties a motive which in conjunction with others operated frequently in the case of gifts to charit able institutionsand certainly not unfrequently in the case of gifts to near relatives then came the question was the transaction as regards kiddles mortgage and bfeveans mortgago real or only colourable  on the one handthere was the uncontradieted statement of lr john frederick william paynewho vas examined and crossex amicei on the subjoct he seemed tohave givenhis evidence fairly and frankly he was believed by the chief justice and not disbelieved by the court of appeal be declared positively that in the case of both mortgages the gift to him asn absolute gift outandout not qualified by any reservation or trust or secret understanding of any sort or hind on the other hand there was a circumstance which at flrst sight tended to create suspicion mr john frederick william payne paid substantially the whole of the interest accruin on those mortgage debts to his fathers account ana investedl it or allowed it to be invested with his fathers moneys the learned chief justice thought that the prenliar position in whichmr john frederick william vwayne was placed suggested an adequate and satisfactory explanation of his conduct mr payne the father had been a conveyancer he retired from the profession but still kept his office in melbourne and there he devoted his time and talents tothe accumulation of money by prudent investments mr john frederick william payne also bean life as a conveynncer but about  years ago at hs faters instance he too gave up his profession he was ummarried he went to livo in his fathers house and assisted his father in the management of his business he received no salary for his services but he had the advantage of living in his fathers house there he had all he wvanted he had some means of his own and from time to time he received presents from his father he had no expensive tastes his personal expenditure was not more than � or � a year then the intended disposition of his fathers estate was no secret there were three sons thev were to be residuary legatees in equal shares and they were to bring into hotch pat all capital sums received from their father during his life the gifts to mrr j f w pane large as they seemed were far short of his expectations under the will the object of those gifts was as he said to accustom him to the management of business and tho responsibilities of roperty and to make him feel inde wndet of akinduce him to marry a younger brother who wasmarried at the time had been advanced on his marriage in these circumstances it did not seem so very emtmordinary that the father should make large advances to his eldest son and that the son instead of hoarding the interest which might have given rise to ealousy and illwill should throw the income which he did not care to spend into a common fund investing it with his fathers moneys for the ultimate benefit of himself and his brothers lr payne the father had such command of money and such sldlllin dealing with it that probably the son lost little ornothing by not leeping his ovn money in his own hands on the whole their lorships saw no reason to dissent from the conclusion at which the chief justice arrived tho judgment of the full court was based on a view which their lordships could not accept they thought that there could be no  reasonable motive  for making the gifts in question unless it were found in the intent to evade payment of duty  the motive for saving probate duty they said  reconciled with reason what would otherwise appear to be uselaoss pro ceedings though the gift might be a perfected gift and the conveyance might fulfil all legal requisites a manfest desiro on the part of the donor to avoid payment of duty was in their opinion enough to prove an intent to evade payment of duty within the meaning of the enactmnent thnere remainedl the qnestion asto hlctlullochs muortgage that was the testators property at the time of his death the debtor ns well as the testator resided in victoria and was domiciled there the debt though a specialty debt in new south wales was a simple con tract debt in victoria that being so it seamed to their lordships that the chief justice and mr justice flood who dissented on this point from his colleagues were right in holding that the debt was an asset in victoria and recoverable under a victorian probate although it might well be that in order to discharce the mortgae probate duty would also have to be paid in new southales and the debt if recovered in lictoria might be retained in court until the mortgagoes were in a position to discharge the mortgnge that result seemed to their lordships consistent with the practice as established in england and their lordships saw no reason why a similar rule of practice should not be held to apply in an analogous case in the states of the australian common wealth their lordships would therefore humblv adviso his majesty that the order of the full conrt should be discharged with costs and the order of the chief justice restored as the appellants had succeeded in their appeal and the respondents were successful in the cross appeal there would be no order as to costs here
