francis hewitt stevens wvho were the partners in a firm of solictors carrying on business under the style of stevens bawtrce and stovens it appeared that this firm and partioularly mr charles richard stevens bad acted as tho plaintiffs solicitors from  or carlior till  and had the entire management of her affairs during that period the plaintiff by this action charged the defendants with negligence in the invest ment of her fortune and of improper dealings with the moneys entrusted to their charge she claimed first a general account of all dealings and transactions between her and the defendants secondly that the defendants might be ordered to make good a sum of � invested by them in  without the plaintiffs authority in the purchase of the equity of redemption of certin leaseholdouses at isleworth and of a sum of � invested by them also without the plaintiffs authority in the pur chase of shares in the burleigh mansions company limited thirdly delivery and taxation

the plaintiff in  and  with regarci to the islewvorth property the defendants maintained that the purchase was made with the plaintiffs authority and they also pleaded the statuto of limitations  but with regard to the shares in tho barleigh mansions company they undertook at the trial to make good the loss tney also agreed to the delivery and taxation of bills of costs with regard to the loan to the great north west centrl railway they set up an agreement signed by the plaintiff on june   to accept � in full satisfaction of her claimsthe evidenco ws very conflicting and the effect of it is sufficiently stated in the judgment of the courtmr renshaaw kc and air a l ellis wore for the plaintiff and mr warrington rc and mir beddall for the defendantsthe case was heard in jume lastma justice kekaewich in the course of his iudg ment said that mrs mansfield brought this action against the defendants as hor solicitors and agents thenamed defendant was tho member of the firm vwith wvhom she almost exclusively communicated and he was the only witness called on their bebalf bat it was ad mitted that his partners shared his responsibility to the plaintiff except that the liability of the defendant fh stevens could not be carried further back than janu ary  when be joined the firm the firstnamed defen dant whom his lordship wouldcall mr stevens acted not merely as the plaintiffs solicitor but as her agent in the management of her affairs and the plaintiff reposed great and it might be said unlimited confidence in him it was not necessary to conclude that she was perfectly accurate in saying that she always signed documents which he pat beoore her vithout reading them or requesting explanation but undoubtedly she was readv to sign any document which he advised should be signea and was content with slight explanation it might wvll be that she seldom attended to such explanation if any as wss given he must be taken to bavo imown this his experience must have taught him that it would be so and he must have drawn the conclusion from her conduct towards him he ought to have been extremely careful not to abuse her confidence and he ought also to have been extremely careful to keep an accurate record of all that passed between her and him so that he could fah baok on that if his conduct were challenged ehis lordship then referred to tho fact that mr stevens kept a diary but observed that it was by no means a complete record of his dealings vwith the plaintiff it was he continued only fair to mr stevens to say that as far as his lordship could see he derived no personai benefit from the transaetions inwhichumderhis guidance the plaintiff was involved and indeed his lordship concluded that he had lost and not ganed by many of those transactions but he had other clients whose in terests were in conflict with those of the plaintiff and his lordship was driven to the inference that the in terests of those othor clients were again and again cor siuted rather than those of tho plaintiff and that her interests were sacrificed in his judgment mr stevens had abused the confidence which she placed in him his lordship then discmssed the evidence and referred to the difficulty in using the documents which had been put in evidence because speaking generally he thought that it could not bo concluded from the plaintiffs signature of a document that she really grasped its con tents and intended by such signature to approe it mr stevenss attempt to show that in consequence of his explanations sbe understood the documents which she signed invariably brolke down his lord ship then dealt in detail with the several heads of complaint and discussed first the isleworth transaction with reference to that his lordship saidthattheplain tiff ever understood that any part of her money had been invested in tho purchase of these leaseholds ido not believe if she did not understand as i think she did not understand what the transaction was such informa tion and explanation as was thereafter given to her by mr stevens would of course be useless the real truth of the transaction i believe to be thsmr stevens had a client named mr protheroe smith who bad and i suppose through stevenss agency financed bowen the lessee of this building property the pro perty was not a promising one and there is good reason to believe that it was a losing concern from the first as it proved sn the end to be i do not inovw whether mr protheroe smith looked to mr stevens to get him out of his difficalty but mr stevens did get him out by advancing moneys belonging to the plaintiff and he at the same time relieved iowen by taking an assignment from him the consequences have been serious and the plaintiff justly complains but for one plea she would i think be entltled to relief the defendants have pleaded the statute of limitations and that is unanswerable air stevenss position may be regarded from one of two points of viewv either he acted as the plaintiffs solicitor in which case her remedy against him is by action for negligence or he acted as her fiduciary agent for investment of her money in witich case her remedy is an action for breach of duty in making an improper investment there is no occasion to decido whichwould be the best mode of asserting her case  but which ever bo adopted it is clear that the cause of action accrued more than six years before vrit issued and her remedy is gone either under the statute  james  or under tho trusteo act  by which the former act is applied to breacbes of trust his lordship then dealt with the claim for a general account with reference to this claim he said the solution of this question depends entirely on the accounts of s and  which are pleaded as settled accounts each of them contains items of costs for which no bills were delivered and lfr stevens vws forced to admit at the bar that he could not treat these costa as paid and that therefore he was bound to submit to an order for delivery of hills and taxation of them bnt it was urged on his behalf that this need not open and ought not to open the whole account in which the items occur it was urged that all that could properly be done was to strike these items out of the account to treatit as settled in all other respeots and merely re adjust the balance by making the consequent corrections on the other side as against this it was said that according to the ordinary practice in order to open en allegea settled account it is only necessary to ahow that some substantial items cannot stand and that then the account must be taken throughout i doebt whether it is possible to lay down any absoluto rulo on this point i can conceive a case in which the court is sstisfied that an account has been settled and that it would bo contrary to good faith and honesty to allow it to be opened merely because it con tansk an item or one or two items of costs which san be t wiqh hi neadaiatsa a abwo riadicated on the other hand if tho items of costs are not only numerous or large but so enter into the wvhole dealings to vwhich theo ront refers that it is diflicult if not impozsiblc to sever the costs from the dealings to which they reiate thea it scems to rae a strong case vould be made for directing the whole accotimt to bo takan reserving of course the right to consider whether any particular item lad not been finally agrecd his lordship however thought it tmnecessary to lay down any rule for bis guidanco in this case because he was satisled on tho evidenco that there wero no settied accounts after discussirg tho ovidenceo on this point he camo to tho conclusion that thbapproval of the accounts was not real and that tho paintif vwas not bound by her signature ie added that if this conclusion was erroneous mr stevens must blame himself for it because ho brought these accounts to the plaintiff vithout any word of preliminary explanation or any opportunity afforded of looking at them beforo they wero submitted for signature auid ho took thera away as soon as they wero signed moreover he kept no adequate record of what took place at theso inter views he thought that a solicitor who transaoted busi ness in this manner ought not to be surprised if his evidence was closely scrutinized and even his honesty suspected his lordship then discuszed the transactiozis relating to the loan to the great northwvest centrl company of canada and came to the conclusion that the plaintiff was not bound by the agresment to accept � in dischargo of lher ciainwt in conclusion his lordship said it follows that the plaintiff is entitled to the relief claimed except as regards the isleworth property and judgment must bo frmced on that biss it follows also that she is entitled substantially to tho whole costs of action i must make an exception as regards the one point on which the plaintiff has failed to obtain relief it is by no means an unimportant one but on the other hand it occupied but a small portion of the time spent on the whole case and the evidenco concerning it as comparatively brief and simple and free from reference to al but a few documents this i think is one of the eases in which it is far more con venient to apportion the costs roughly at tho trial than to leave the apportionment to the taxing master y order will be that the defendants pay threefourths of tho plaintiffs taxed costs of action before parting with this case i wish to add one remark of general alpplication in a majority of the cases tried in this court reference is made to oorrespondence and it being seldom necessary to refer to the original letters or to more than a few selected letters there are freuent opportunities for the use of the documentstyled copy correspondence coumsel can renadilv follovw one another in referring to it the document is extremely convenient and saves time and therefore money to make the necessa selection of letters and properly compile such a document as just mentioned requires some skill and care for wbich the solicitor is entitled to a remunerative charge where however there is no such expenditure of skill and care but a large number of letters nra utnnecessarily copied slight remuneration is adequate in the present case it was necessary to put a consideralle number of original letters into the bends of the vit riesset and these of course have been under my eye but cunsel finding it necessary to refer to other letters there havo been handed up to me two illassortd bundles compiled without the care and skill above mentioned and embarrassing from the large number of letters of which only a few aro of imdortancc i believe that the taxing blasers are exitremely careful in this part of their duty and while allowing proper fees where they are deserved ent the fees dowin vwhere therm has been acraultiplication of paper witout ajny good result i hopein this case the taxing iaster will be niggazdly
