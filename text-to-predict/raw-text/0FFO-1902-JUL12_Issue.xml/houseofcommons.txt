sir erskine may had been followed and the bill was sent upstairs because it affected private rights and as to the contention that it was impossible for this committee to judge of the facts until they had considered the evidence he was surprised at such a statement coming from the right hon gentle an the inquiry was held in the most publio manner the proceedings were published in theewspapers the

another reasonif it ware in orderthe action of the chairman of the joint committee and the way in which te report of that committee had as a conse quence come down to the rousethe c girimas said that in the case of a select committee no discussion would bo permitted on the conduct of the chairman although he was a member of the houlse unless by a defdnite motion specifically raising the question and the rule applied with at least equal strength to the action of the chairman ofa joint committee who not being a member of the liouso had no responsibility to itmr buxton said that in consequence of that ruling he should not discuss the action of the chairman of the joint committee which ho considered a matter of great importance as affecting the proceduse of com mittees but he urged again the postponement of the clause on the ground that until the committee were acquainted with the evidence laid before the joint committee they could not properly discuss the amend ments to the clausemr long

nodoubt ned dealt with a large amount of property but after rll tho bill which brought into emstence the manchester ship canal involved more money the right hon gentlemam the late homesecretary had said that the soloreasonwhy this bill was sent to a committee upstairs was because it was an ilhportant bill that was absolutely incorrect if it had not been for the private interests affected it would never have gone to this joint committee the course that was taken was made oblgatory by the rules of parliament but the consideratien of the committee vas not limited to ptivate interests though the bill was sent to tnem in order that private interests might be defended by counsel through the medium of the evidence of witaesses there was no doubt that the whole bill was before the committee when once it was referred to them if the rouse declined to proceed witha measure until the evideoce taken upon it was before it it would creato an absolutely now precedent with regard to private bill procedure he submitted that all that itwas necessary to know in connexion wvith this meesure was in the possession of those interested in the london water question re was assured that not only could any out sider obtain a copy of the evidence taken before a com mittee every day at a trifling cost but that any member of parliament could get it for nothing re could not think it wvas right or jast to postpone a measure of this kind until the evidenco had been digested that course would involve very great delay nud ho must ask the committee to proceeed with the consideration of the clause as it stoodmr lougih pointed out that ihoe bil wasdivided into dine parts and clause  vws in itself a complete part the other eiaht darts defined the work that was to bedone and be contendod that the comittesheold be horougbly seized of the work that ws to be done before it fied the constitution of the body by wiilt tst work was to be performedmr mellor as a proof that the request for post ponement of the clause ws not unreasonable pointed out that both the bodies which had considered the sub jectmatter of this bill at great length had reserved the consideration of the composition of the overmin body till the inst it was reasonable to moertain the duties of a water trust befoe deciding on its compositin the romon why they desired time to study the evideace was that they were in favour of a smalier govetning body and it ws their belief that when the evidenco s read and coinmred with what had beow given before the royal commisron the weight of opinion would be found to be ctclusively ngsmt the governmeit propoimlsib j dicksonpoytdrr accepting the previous decision of the committee would not vote for the post ponement but as he had been hallengedforpug rown an amendment he lwished to elain that his reasons for putting it down wihout tying himself abso lutely toits terms were tosh his dgreementwith the government as to tbe numberefthegverninghody which he considered excessive and as to themodeselection he had reason to believe that the evidence which he had not halan opportunity of reading would fortify him in his viewsdrmacnamiara reminded the committee that wvhen the bill caine first before the house the general opinion was that a governng body of  members was too large the president and tho secretery of the local govern ment board were he thought the only members who did not thinkthe governing body should be smaller the bill as it now stood proposed a larger body of  members the committee ought to have an opportunity of discuss ing what evidence there was to jnstify this change he had just secured the bluebook and hastily searching for any evidence on this subject the first thing he foand was the declaration of r george frederick deacon who said of the proposed water board of  members  i thik it is a great deal too large and that it would be tm wieldy in practice being asked whether he would prefer a committee of modemate size he further said that the inmnber should be so members at the outside there was no evidence in favour of a body of  members but there was an evident desire to arrivo at a reasonable compromise of a smaller body of representatives on a count basis a postponement would alord opportunity for v iews of men practically acquainted with theo wolr to become imowir bartley islington n verymuch objected to ostponementbcasehekew that the people of london desired the passage of a bill of this character and as a director of a water compay he was anxious that a decision should be arrived a aas soon as possible with a directors experience he looked at the proposed board as uanmuzgeably large and believed it would provemcnvieldy and very expensive to ratepayers boee lhe most eflicient management would be by a small paid board doing the work as directors did it otlerwise there was fear that the management woud fall into the hsnds of permanent oficialsmr burns said the hon member bad emeonselously given good reason for postponement if the board was likely to orovo unwieldy extrav ant and disadvan tageons to the ratepayers then members shonld have full opportunity of access to evidence before they under took tbe responsibility of a decision that might entail such consequences where was the definte demand from the corporation of london to be included in this heterogeneous mob collected from the great area of ater london  where outside a drawing room meeting of metropolitan mayors was there any mandate from tho borough councils for represantation  he wanted this to be the last time the house would vesr have to consider a london water bill  but it would not be the last time if the president of tho local govern ment board who as experienced enough to inow better and act more inteuigently allowed this body to be imposed upon london without sufficient consideration of the evidence to which at present they had not had accesssir w houildswothe manchester nw said he supposud he should not bo in order on this motion in rnferrgto the reasons which ultimately prevailed with the joint comunittee in recommending a board of  rather than a board of  no doubt it would ha veto come up opposition cheers  and as a member of the joint committee he should then have an opportunity of showing exactly what had taken place in that com mittee he presumed that they would not be held responsible for tho ruling of the chairman in the joint committee but vith regard to any action that took place in reference to the various propositions put before them he hoped they would have an opportunity of explaining what had influenced them in coming to the conclusion they did he was he thought entitled to claim the special indulgence of the committee in this matter because he rather thought it was on his vote in the joint committee that the vacillations which had been commented on had occurred when the proper time cane ho thought he should be able to make a good caso for the change of his opinion cbeers  but at the moment he would only say that in his opinion every member of a committee upstairs was bound to consider from time to time the decision ho would come to on the evidence that was put before him he merely indicated that as a defence if ho might say so of his chango of opinion although be did not think there ws any reason why a moan hoesatlyahoulduot change his opinion if there were cownsderations for doing so even independently of the evidence which occurred to him afternvards at the sname time he did not believe that this motion was ono that ought to be entertained by the committee he did not see any reason whatever why this clause should be postponed no doubt tho joint committee adopted the course which they thought best for shortening the inquiry and did not follow absolutely the seriatin form of the bill as it stood but he did not thinl that suestion arose here today lho point which had been raised to dy more than ary oher was as to the constitution of the board  but it appeared to him that that would coma up in tho natural course if they now proceeded with the clauses as they stood a good deal had been said which had impressed him as to the desirability of the com mittees having an opportnity of going through the evidence opposition cheershhe did not say abso lutely before entering upon the small portion of tho bill that they would he able to deal with that day as a member of the joint committee he wals exceedingly anxsious that the members of the committee should hsve the opportunity of reading the evidence and of seeing the basis upon which they came to their conclusions in what wvas a very complicated and diflicult inqiry involving very many considerationssir w harcourt momnmouth w said it was impossible to conceive a moro conclusive speech in favour of the postponement of this clause than the ono just made by the hon baronet opposite the hon baronet had said in effect that an opinion could not be properly formed upon these matters without hearing evidence that was oxactly their position a moro extraordinsrv proceeding than the present one be bad never heard of during the whole of his long experieuce of tho house of commons cheers here was a joint committee dealing with enormous pecuniary intorests which were to affect the population of london in perpetuity and all they knew about it was that that joint committee by a majority of nearly two to one came to one conclusion end that afternards for reasons which the hon baronet had said ho would at some time or other explain but which he did not explain nowsir w eouldsworthi should not have been in order in doing sosir w harcourt said that did not make any difference to thom laughter it was the very fact that they eald not on account of the ruling in respect of order arrive at tho thing which was really essential to the question now before the house that theywished to take n course which seemed so clear end obvious and the denial of which was so irrational that it hardly needed the support of the convincing evidence of the hon baroust opposite cheers they were in the position of haning two members of the joint committee of the highest authority with them that day and yet they were precluded by the ruling of the chair fromtellingthe committee that wzhich it was essential they should now why shoald they bo muzzled was itpossible to reduce the house of commons to a position more absolutely end contemptibly impotent cheersmr long said that the adoption of the  amendment would have the certain effect of making it impossible for his two hon friends to give the desired information to the house unless at some distant period of time there were great interests involved in this matter tho water companies did not ask for the championship of hon members in postponing the clauso the great majority of london members out of were supporting the govemmnent in the comse they had adoptod and th local authorities themajorityof the metropolitan boroughs and the urban and rural distridus were also supporting the governnent it was only those hon members who had been opposed to the government from the beginning who were not prepared to go on with tho clause because they wanted further information before continiuing their attael he sub mitted that there was nothing extraordinary or improper in the course which the government had adopted in asking the houso to proceed with the consideration of the clausesir w foster derby illeston said tfat the argument as to tbe opinion of londonmembers ought not to have any weight with the hlause inasmuch as theywere elected on the question of the war end not on tha water question cthis ws ar great question of publichealth nnd he contended that the government were approaching it in a wrong way the whole caso rested on the  pages of evidence in the bluebook and it was but reasonable that the house should have an oppor tunity of studying the question as it was affected by that evidencemir fletch moulton cornwall launceston said he wns satisffed that even the majority of honmembers opposite viewed vith great surprise tho evidence of the committee whose report they were now considering tho ciroumstanco which impressed the people most was that the committee by a large majority decided in one way but that when it met again it was told that the governmnent disapproved their decision tho chairman of the conmnittee then cleared the roonit was decided that evidence should be taken and on tho evidence the committee was reported to havee reversed its former decision if there was a thing which would be disgraceful to the house it would be to fnd that its committees were supple to government pressure  and if there was a thing which would be disgraceful to the government it would be that the government exercised that pressure on committees representing the house cries of  orderthe chaitranthe hon member is not entitled to make attacks on
