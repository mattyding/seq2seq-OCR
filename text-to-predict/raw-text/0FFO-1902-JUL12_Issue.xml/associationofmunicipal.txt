know of my experience in relation to travel ling in italy in respect to registered luggage on june  last my wife and i weretravelling fromsuporence where we registered outr luggage to genoa by early morn ing train wo arrived atlsa at  oclock where we remained until e arriving at genoa at  oclock in the eventing where iflound tbat our luggage had not arrived and was informed that it was coming on with a slow tain and would not arrive until  oclock on its arrival and its being brought into our hotel my wife remarked that her tunmk had been tampered wi th and on openmng the sane it was found that the entire comtents had been ransacked several dresses being wantonly torn and several items of jevwelry kad been abstracted the loss and damage amounting to fully �g in the morning i went to the british consul mr william keene and laid the facts before him he informcd me that the luggage robberies in italy were perfectly scandalous and that they were very much upon the increase and that he had many times mentioned the matter in his consular reports until he was really ashamed of so often calling attention to the grievance he informed me that he feared there was no remedy ecept that of remaining in italy and instituting legal prooeedings and that even then the resut was more than doubtfil he recommended me howcver to lay the matter before the head railway official and also the police i proceedesd to tho railvay station where i saw the head ofcial ec howv evr was absolutely indifferent to the matter and referred me to the police they again took no interest in the case and from that day to this  have not heard a eingle word from either the consul the railway officials or the police    my recommendation is that any valuables should not be placed in registered luggage but should be carried by tho travellers and moreover all registered packages should be sealed and delivery should be refused if the seals are found brokenextramons sturgeas patent lined an order having
