housing policyforecast of inw billdecontrol in government andthe subsidy t by our paraiamentary correspondentit is understood that the main outlines o the governments housing bill are now in suck an advanced state that the minister oe health mir neville chamberlain will be able to spend at ileast some part of the easter recess on holiday and in resting in preparation for the strenuous time which he must expect after the second reading of his bill until whitsuntide when it is hoped that it will have found its place on the statute bookif present expectations are realized the secondl reading of the housing biu will be taken on april  when mr charnberlaiih wil be in a position to explain his proposals in detail the bill itself however will be in the hands of members a week earlier the house would probably have hked to get to grips with housing directly after the easter holiday butmlr baldwin is introducing the budget on monday april  and that week ill be trainly occupied with financial questions once the second reading of the housing bill has been taken however it is hoped to go fuu steain ahead pfew ministers of recent years have had a more anxious or more difficult task than that which has falen to the minister of health called to the position fromi the post office where he had been doing admiirable work after the government had lost its heatth minister and three byelections almost entirly on the twin questions of housing and decohttol it has been generally assutned that in taking over the office at such a thankless time mlr chamberlain insisted that he must be given an entirely free hand and that if necessary he should be in a position to discard all the hotising proposals of his predecessor this is probably true at any rate it is certain to be found when the new proposals are brought forward that they differ very inaterially frota the plans originally  adumbrated a few details will remain but in the main the nevv scherhm wil be mr chamberlains own plan which he has learned in the school of practical experience aj chairman of the birmingham town planning committee and in other municipal activitiesdate of decontrolthe government had originally hoped to be able to submit to the house of commnons one comprehensive measure dealing with housing decontrol and slum clearance but it is under stood that other counsels have prevailed aind that each of these subjects wiul now be dealt with in separate bills it is recognized that the housing question is one which must be dealt with in sections but each section nmust be modeled to fit into one complete whole when all the governments proposals have been brought forward to deal withi the wvhole problem may be a task taking far more than one session but the government in anything that it brings forward is anxious to ht one section into another until the whole edifice is cornplete it is obvious that when the house of commons comes to discuss the housing bill it will want to know something about the govermments in tentions concerning decontrol and it will pro bably be found that when he moves the secoud reading mr chamberlaia will be in a position to indicate the governments intention s witl regard to decontrol although that measuie will not be introduced until a later stage the question of decontrol is daily becoming more urgent as according to the law of the land as it stands at present control is to be removed frm certain types of houses in june next that decontrol will be suspended may be taken for granted and it is not now likely that the policy announced by the goverrlmernt dluring the miteham byelectioa of decontrolling ceitiin houses next year unless a resolution to the con trary is carried by either house of pnrlianent will bs further proceeded with the present indication is that it will be decided that the control of all houses shall be continued until about april  when the whole question vill be reviewed in the light of thoe progress made witli the provisibn f housesa heavy taskhow heavy a task the provision of the necessary number of houses is is not geiierily realized broadly speaking the country is in a wonie position for houses today thenr it was at the end of the war under the addison scheme  houses have been built nd state aid has been given in other ways towards the erection of anothet  houses but this total of less tliani a quarter of a million houses is not sufficient to mcet the normal growth of the population in the years since the war to say nothing of making up the leeway of the war years when building of houses was practically at a standstill the first task of the ministry of health therefore must be to provide enough houses to meet the normal growvtli afnd when that has been achieved it can start upon the task of providing enough houses to meet the whole demandin the normal way three thousand houses have to be built inx birmingham alone every year and it is obvious that the task before the ministry is one that must be spread over a long period of years the housing bill will be concerned in the main with the lowest grade of hoursethe fiveroom nonparlour type as it is knownbecause this is the type of house that the builder at present is quite unable toerectwithout some form of subsidy it is estimated that the building of a house of this kindincluding the acqmusition andc develop ment of the landcosts Â£ and the most that the landlord can expect to get back in rentapart from rates is seven shillingss week it is for this te of house that the subsidy of six pounds a yearfor twenty years willbe made and both the municipalities who put this figure forward and the ministry of fhealth wbich accepted it believe that this sum will be sufficient to encourage the revival of private buiilding there is no limit to the houses of this type that may receive the subsidy provided that they are completed by the spring of  there inay not be enough skilled workers in the building industry to provide all the houses that are needed but the  ovoirn inments one great hope in agreeing iu the principle of a subsidy is that it will encourage private building and the training of young workers in the building trade at presetit veiry few young mien indeed are being trained as skilled workers and it is believed that the subsidy iviu eneourage the private builder to get into harness again witlh good results for the future of the industry if it does not and all the houses have to be erected bvythe municipalities the minister of healthl anld the goveinnicot will be sorely disappointed middleclass eu ultsesthe main criticism that the builders aro likely to level agaiust the housing bill is flnat thero is tobe jio subsidyand oin this the govcrn ment is absolutely detetninedfor thc llext grade of house tho fiveroom parlour housc wbich is built for the betterpaid workitig man the governthent arc convinced from their inquirles that tihse houses and middleplass dxvl lings can he built oin an econonit al bas with out state aid anrd nofinancial help w ill bc fortih cominlg but it will doubtless be faund that the bill in tho se segtjono which deal withother types of houses than the non parlbur variety will in various ways ease the burden both of the builder and the occupier a determined effort is to bo made for instance to encourage the tenant to buy his own house during recent years there has been a great demand by tenants to purchase the houses in which they live but they have only had a limited amount of capital at their backs some of course have been able to utilize the machinery of the building societies but the government hope to be able to  devise machinery by which it may be made even easier than it is at present for the tenant to purchase his house the government is anxiouis to encourage the individual purchase of houses to the utmost extent possible  one more house owvner otne less potential bolshevist mbight almost bc adopted as its slogani is also expected that the housing pt will endeiavour to tackle the ques tion of houses vhich are unoccupied becalse their owners are unwilling tg let them many of the large houses iil both middleclass and working class districts could be easily converted initoflats to accommodate two or more families wvith comparatively small struc turat slterations and a general move of that kind would greatly relieve the present housing congestion the govern i rnnt have not lost sightof this possi bility and the bill is almost certan to contain some plan by which owners will be encouraged to reconstruct houses of tlris description the question of assisting persons who are desirous of building their own houses will also be dealt withcriticism of the governments pro posals may be directed against the failure to provide subsidies for all types of new houses the reply to this  will be thattlhe ministry of health and in fact the whole country has only a limited amount of money to spend even on the mnost desirable social reforms and it hias been decided that such money as there is shall be devoted to that section of tha population which stands mostin need of help it is an open secret that mr neville chamberlain is anxious to tackle the question of slum clearance on broad national lines as soon as he possibly can a number of conferences on the subject have already been held at the ministry of health but there are a verty large number of interests to be consulted and in the short time that the new minister of health has held office it has not been possible to complete the deliberations slum clearance therefore will be dealt vith in a separate measure which it is intended to introduce either this session or next
