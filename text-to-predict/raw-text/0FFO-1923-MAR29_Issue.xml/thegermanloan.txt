the german loanallies priorityirights  ireminder to berlin priom our w cobrespondentparis mabch some misapprehension soeens to have existed concerning tho latest decision of the reparation commission with reference to the reeent issue of a loan by the german government it has bcon representod that germany is not entitled ander the terms of the treaty of versailles to issue loans this is not accurate but any loan which germany raises without having previously obtained tho permnission of the reparation commission is subject to certain risks tho bondholders may here after find themselves in an unpleasant position since the allies have a first call upon the revenues and resources of the ger an state and before interest can be paid the reparation account must in theory at least havre been satisfied this is the legal position under article  of the treaty and the reparation com mission has so informed the kriegslasten koinmission in a letter drafted by sir john bradburv and m do lecroixthe difference between this reminder of allied priority as against the bond holders and the french thesis that germnany has violated the treaty and that the proceeds of the loan were liable to seizure is it will be appreciated con siderable and it should be made clear that there is no change of policy on the part of the british delegate in accepting the responsibility of asserting the allied right of priority he has not emerged from wvhat has been called his retire nient in order to support the french policy of the past few monthsthe letter to the kriegslastenkommission states that in view of the cxtraordinary re ceipts that the rcich has procured by the recent emission of the gold loan the repara tion commission brings to the notice of the gcrman government the provisions of article  of the treaty of versailles the fact that the german government has not thought lit to request an exception under that article obliges the reparation commission to reserve expressly even with regard to subscribers to the loan its right of priority on the funds which may bo assigned by the reich to tho service and the reimbursement of the loan especially if this exceptional income is not applied to the discharge of the annuities due under the head of reparations it is vrobibly rattler late to bring this dcision o the attention of germany since the lists i understand are virtually closed the loan may be tniken to be not altogether a sucecess and certainly the greater plrt of it falls upon the underwriters what prac tical consequences will follow it is difficult to see since it is certain that when there is ao general settlernent the reparatibn debt will be put upon an cntitely new basis for the present it is enough to state that should there be a conflict between the demands of the service of an unauthorized ermanloan aund the demands of tho reparation aecounts the latter vwill enjoy privileges and should thev be refised then germany would be guilty of a new defaulta second and perhaps even more interesting technical question has been brought up has the reparation commission the right by virtue of article  to consider the wbhole product of the german loan as a resource which should be earmarked for repatations and should it therefore demand that the  gold marks l which i understand have been raised in whole or in part by the german government be handed over to the allies  i believe the french and the italian experts favour the view that an affirmative response should be given but the british american and belgin experts were opposed to such an interpretation and the contention was not refused it must be remembered that the allies possess only a general claim to german assets and it is nowhere specified that particular pockets of german resources may be hypothecated there is no more reason for regarding these special moneys as due to the allies thar there is in seecting any other restitution and in the absence of german initiative which would bring them under allied control the priority is a general one and cannot be exercised speciflcauy the document which was sub mitted by the legat experts is exceedingly interesting from the technical point of view and goes far to defne the rather vague priority which the treaty establishesas for the third question which was sub mitted it also presents some nice colisidera tions it asked whether the guarantees offered by the reich to subscribers and especi ally f gold deposits in the reichsbank are vahdo with the exception of the french experts it was generally admitted that the relchsbank being a private establishment escapes from the oblgations set up by the allies and can therefore offer sufficient guaranteesit may therefore be doubted whether the present step taken by the reparation commis sion on the initiative of france is particularly wise france for the hrst time for some months has found the majority of the com mission opposed to her thesis two out of the three questions found either italy or belgium taking up a view different from that of france but it remains true that an im portant point has been conceded and the commission rules that even if the reich has strictly conformed to the stipulations of the treaty in emitting a loan without an authoriza tion the commission remains in possession of liens on the goods and resources of the empire which cannot be devoted in strict law to the payment of interestit is far fetched to suppose that germany will hand over the proceeds of this loan totho allies but were sho to do so wo should have the paradox that she could not without per mission acquit her obligations to subscribers to a fund which benefited the allies i gather that the commission may request the germ an govermnent to explain the utilization of the products of the loan
