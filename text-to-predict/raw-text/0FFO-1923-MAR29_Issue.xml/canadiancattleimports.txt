within a year and even in  as many as  head of cattle and four iundred thousand sheep were sold there the attempt to secure landings of the store cattle at manchester docks direct from canadian ports is made with the advantages both from the point of view of the canadian exporter and that of the british buyer all on the side of manchester and salford the exporter can land his cattle at the actual distributing centre the buyer escapes railway charges for thirtyfive miles carriage from the mouth of the lersey and secures the animals if he intends to fatten them in a far fresher eondition birkenhead on the other hand loses the advantage which it has hitherto possessed in having ten or a dozen lines of steamers bringing fat cattle to its lairages manchester as one of the five ports authorized for the importation snakes its bid for an early supremacy over the other four in tho superiority of its landing and marketing facilities and its proximity to the heavy meatconsuming

the same as those applicable to irish cattle on arrival the store cattle go to authorized places of detention such as lairs or grazing grounds where they may be kept for a period not exceeding seventy two hours until market day to meet this requirement the salford markets committee is asanging for the holding of special markets of which due notice will be given to the trade whenever necessary for the disposal of arriving canadian store cattle irrespective of the usual weekly tuesday market for irish cattle after sale in the marketwhich has over three hundred specially built cattle pensthere is a further period of detention of six days in imilarly authorized places if the cattle are intended for fattening at the end of the sixhays the cattle are practically equivalent from the legal point of view to english csttlethe cost of cattle freightage from canada to manchester is as low as it can reasonably be but it has of course to be borne by the excporters who are the canadian breederswilltherefore desire toget the best iartet prices on this side and they have a etter chance of doing this at salford than at markets more distant from the chief meat consuming towns where a radl charge wiul be added to the sellers price before the english buyer is at the end of his expensesthe canadian government are greatly interested in the development of the trade in store cattle to great britain and are supporting au efforts by the shipping and market authorities at this end the actual hipping facilities as represented by the regular weekly direct canadamanchester service of

house of lords after the easter recess to challene the attitude of the ministry of agriculture towards the introduction of breeding cattle from canada discussing yesterday the  rumours of a disquieting nature  in this connexion mentioned in our agricultural correspondents article on  canadian store cattle in the times of monday lord strachie said that under the importation of animals act  as he read it in the matter of admittng breeding cattle any order which might be proposed must be laid before both houses of parliament and if either house objected to the order it must become null and void therefore on behalf of the central and associated cbambers he was going to take the earliest possible opportunity of protesting in the house of lords against the modification which seemed to be contemplated of the terms of the act in the meantime he intended to move at the meeting of the somerset county council on april  a resolution protesting against the admission of canadian breeding stock and it would be interesting to see whether the minister of agriculture who wsas also a member of that council would be present to take up the challenge lord strachie added that he would also move a similar resolution at the meeting of the council of the royal agricul tural society next month
