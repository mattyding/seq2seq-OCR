new light oninfectionthe spread of epidemicsin schoolsby onb medical coreespondextpew more important contributions to the study of epidemiology have been made in recent years than that of surgeoncommander sheldon dudley rn which is published tofday by the mfedical research council the author is professor of clinical pathology and lecturer on tropical diseases at the medical school rn college greenwich and his work was carried out in connexion with outbreaks of diphtheria and scarlet fever in the royal naval school at greenwichthe original object was to find out whether or not the schick test for immunity to diphtheria was likely to be of use in con serving the sghting efficiency of the royal navy but very soon larger issues presested themselves for the remarkable observa tion was made that while one out of every three boarders fed m with scarlet fever or diphtheriamore than three hundred cases in allnot a single case of either disease occurred among over one hundred day boys this  astonishing fact  was carefully confirmedit became necessary to find an explanation which would fit the following among other circumstances l in two different outbreaks of disease five cases occurred simultaneously in five different dormitories these cases in all probability had no contact with each other or with  con tacts  common to each other the day boys escaped absolutely yet they mixed freely with the boardersthe author points out that it would be improbable that one boy should infectthrough personal contactfour or five other boys with diphtheria ah in different dormi tories classes and messes and yet at the same time not infect any boys in his own dormitory class or mess he adds it is inconceivable that a month later the same series of improbable coincidences necessary for such an origin should repeat themselves with another disease scarlet fevercouoxq pbnormsdirect infection might therefore be ruled out at this point a coleague of the authors discovered that while the boarders at the school used a common stock of pens the day boys brought and used each his own individual pen a series of experiments was at once undertaken and a penholder which had been sucked and bittenby a knowncase of diphtheria was used to stir a tube of culture medium a good growth of virulent diphtheria bacili occurred a similar penholder which had been left fourteen days dry in a cupboard also produced virulent bacilliit was finally concluded that both epidemics started in this way a boy who happened to have a very heavy concentration of the infective agent in his saliva sucked his pen at the end of the hours lesson he threw it back into the common classroom box another class assembled and one member of it picked out the infected penholder which he also sucked possibly enough was left to infect a third boy in a third class in any case the original boy would infect other pens in other roomsthis explains the origin of the epidemics but not their spread why from first to last should the day boys have escaped  surgeon commander dudley produces a body of evi dence to show that  far more boytoboy in fection took place in the dormitories than out side them though at meals and in class boys were much nearer together than in beds with jft between their centres in which the occu peants were arranged head to foot he lays dsown a new principle in many or all in fectious diseases there is a  certain minimal dose of infective agent necessary to cause the disease if a dose smaller than this is rwceived it is destroyed by the defensive powers of the bodythis is the quantity fctor therc is also manifestly a time factor in other words the infective dose may be collected by degrees rather than received as a whole in one moment of time it follows that the velocity at which infection takes place eguals the amount of in fectiveagent received per hour minus the velocity of destruction of infectionwhen the destruction is greater than the amount of infection received the velocity at which infection takes placebecomesanegative quantity and the numerical size of this negative quantity is an indexr of the degree of immumity under the special conditions existing at the timethe amount of infection received varies of course with the source and its distance and thus there is alsoaspacefadeor ventilationand humidity also play a part applying tbis to schools it is easy to see that for a boy to colect a minimal infective dose a certain time determined by the velocity of infection that is by the amount of infection its source and its concentration and by the powers of destroying it possessed by the individual must elapse the normal contact of the boys through the day apparently is not sufficient in point of time to give a minimal infective dose but though at night they are more widely separated the time factor comes into play and a sufficient dose is given over the period of sleep to cause the diseasehence the escape of the day boys hence also a way of preventing infection by in creasing the space between beds and so countering the evil effects of the time factor by means of the factor of space it is a fact that  a ward full of coughing children can be treated in beds oft to ift apart without crossinfection application of this principle helped to fight down the cerebrospinal meningitis outbreak in the army which was in a measure due to overcrowding of sleeping q uartersthis law explains another  mystery  the fact that during an epidemic of diphtheria or scarlet fever great numbers of people develop protection or immnunity without themselves getting the disease they are obtaining doses smaller than the minimal infective dose and s gradually develop and increase their powers of resistance until they are safethis as the author points out means that ch epidemic of  evident disease  is accom panied by two hidden epidemicsthat by means of which large numbers of people develop protection as a result of small doses which do not actually cause symptoms and that of  contact carriers who have the infective material in their throats but are not themselves illother conclusions reached were that the schick test is very reliable for finding who are immune to or protected against diphtheria and that carrier rates of virulent diphtheria may be as low as  per cent and yet spread may occur one attack of diphtheria too it would seem confers immunity mani festly this work is of first importance alike to schools and to public institutions it is also of immense scientific interest
