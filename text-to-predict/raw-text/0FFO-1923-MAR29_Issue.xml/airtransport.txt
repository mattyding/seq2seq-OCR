air transport new company to beformedfrom an aeronautical correspondentthe air ministry announced yesterday that they are prepared to receive pro posals from responsible persons for the formation of an air transport company on the lines indicated in the recommenda tions of the civil air transport subsidies committee hetter known as the ram bling committee by which a govern ment snbsidy of £ spread over ten years was offered to a suitable aerial transport company with £ capital of which the first £ was subscribed as a preliminary condition to receiving a subsidyas the proposed company may have to start operations on april   the date on which the present subsidy arrangements terminate the air ministry state it is desirable that it should come into existence at an early date the air ministry without imposing a specific time limit for offers desire to announce that they hold themselves at liberty to close wvith any offer which they regard as satisfactory by july  and in order that offers may receive full considertion it wiu be advisable that outline proposals should be made by may  proposals should be addressed to the secre tary air ministry adastial house kingaway cfururs of czvm avatioxthis statement is a commendably prompt result of the report of the hambling com mittee which was so speedily set to work by sir samuel hoare the secretary for air and to his influence no doubt is due this expedi tious adoption of its findings the most en couraging feature of that report it will be recalled is the recognition that commercial aviation must be given a definite and ade quate period to establish itself and the reali zation that an entirely new commercial or ganization run on business lines but in a privileged position in regard to air transport subsidies and with large resources of its own is essential to the adequate development of commercial air routesthere are at present three companies in this country operating main air traffic routes and no doubt out of these it is expected that an entirely new concern wil be evolved though the committee definitely set its face against any mere amalgamation of the existing firms there is a widely held opinion that the present londonparis and londonbrussels air routes are too short and that the main future for aerial transport is over long dis tances where the time factor steadily mounts in favour of the aeroplane but it is ob viously a diffcult problem for the companies as at present constituted to embark on any ambitious programmes while the public atti tude to aerial transport remains at its present stage in this relation there is an interesting passage in the committees report to the effect that they have assured themselves that there is a very real desire in their own interests on the part of the commercial world to see effi cient air transport services in operation between this country and the continentfrom a national point of view the success ful operation of such a company is highly desirable in that it promises valuable poten tial military assistance both in material and personnel in times of emergency and the committee while they did not report funlly on that phase of the subject put on record their conviction that only by the develop ment of selfsupporting air transport com panies  could that end be achieved there is in fact an important clause in the pro posed scheme that in the event of war or the imminence of hostilities the government would have the right to take over ali air craft engines and plantit now remains to see what response com mercial aviation will make to the air ministrys invitation but it is obvious that detailed information must be given either publicly or privately to interested persons as to what exactly the air ministry require in the performance of the services in connexion with the operation and develop ment of commercial air transport which are a condition of the granting of a subsidy there are in fact many difficult problems of opera tional costs to be considered apart altogether from the fgure named in relation to capitaliza tion which any group of financiers will require tabled as a preliminary to backing a company intended to be a profitearning con cern and among the vital factors in arriving at the commercial possibilities is some indica tion from the air ministry of the number of miles to be flown daily in order to satisfy the subsidy conditions
