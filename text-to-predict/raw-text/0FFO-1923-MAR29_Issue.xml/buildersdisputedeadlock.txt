tion of wages and to work three additional hours a week but in the wvages and con ditions council they modified these claims with the object of securing an amicable settlement the demand for an extension ot the working week was withdrawn and the proposed alteration of the wages of skilled men was reduced to  per cent or d an hour in london and grade a towrns and to cl and id an hour in smaller towns the employers reserved the right to revert to their first demands if the men did not accept the negotiated terms and this was carefully explained on the ballot paper issued by the opera tives federation the employers have not however reverted entirely to their original claim while insisting on an extension of the working week they repeat the smaller wages demand wbhich was rejected in the ballot according to this the wages of skilled men would be is d an hour in london and grade a towns and is d and ls d in towns graded b and c labourers wages would range froni is ikd to d an hourthe employers decision was communi cated in thc following statementtlhe meeting of the employers in the buill ing industry decidedl to instruct its members throughout the country to post notices n april  to take effect on april  for the extension ot the working hours to fortyseven per week in summer the winter hours to remain as already in practice and a redurc tion on wages in agreement with the mini mpm terms previously offered to the opera tiyes which were the subject of a ballot by te men recently aud other minor details par ticulars of which will be given upon the posters to be issued as soon as possibleas regards certain suggestions for reference of the dispute to arbitration the position of the employers is that they have such conil deuce in the justice of their cause that they are and always have been ready to refer the wrhole issue to arbitration indeed the employers on the national wages and condi tions council made a similar offer during the recent abortive negotiatiolls but the opera tives representatives declined to accept itthe present wage agreement already extended by a month expires this weel the employers by dating their notices from saturday of next week arc allowing a fortnight for the reconsideration of the situation by the workmen under the cir cumstances the ministry of labour will hold its hand and will not intervene for the present it was in touch with both parties yesterday and the repeated offer of arbitration in the employers announce ment may perhaps be attributed to the efforts wvhich the ministry has been making to prevent a stoppage of work it is understood that the mens leaders are prepared to consider arbitration on the wage claim alone but will not enter tain any suggestion in regard to the working week mr george hicks the president of the operatives federation stated the otlier day that the men were willing to submit their case in its entirety to the judgment of public opinion what they are asked to do is to submit their case to arbitration to this mr hicks said last night that the retention of the forty four houir week was too important a social reform to allow any question of a departure from it to be determined by one or more arbitrators when the conditions of half a million men were affected only the men themselves could decide that issue and they could not agree to submit the hours question to arbitration what ever might be the position in regard to wagesthe farm strike the old loyalty andthe newthe national executive of the agricul tural workers union meeting yesterday in london discussed the strike in norfolk and decided to meet again in norwich on saturday to consider the situation on the spot along with the locat leadersthe executive also discussed the state of the agricultural industry generally and resolved to call on the government to de clare agriculture a sweated trade and to bring agricultural workers within the pro visions of the trades boards actroim oua cobre srondm tnorvich wednesdaythe norfolk farm dispute has resolved itself into a tugofwar between two loyalties the oae old and the other new the old is gradually beating the new and the velocity of its movement is likely to grow rapidly within the next few daysthe old loyalty is the innate reverence and in faet the liking for the im memorial structure of rural society which is inborn in the true englsh son of the soil whether ho be farmer or labourer he may occasionally curse squire and parson but in the main he trusts them both and bred in him is the sense of attachment to place and land and house which makes him the most difficult of subjects for union organization iri practicaly all these remote norfolk parishes blood is thicker than water and attachment among men whose forbears ihave grown up together from time out iof among the old oak trees far stronger than newvlyborn loyalty to a union whether that union he henry overmans or that of george edwardsthe principal happening today in connexion with the dispute has been the nnnouncement that the national executive of the union baa regularized the poition of lord hnmberleys men in remainiug at work lord kimberley pays above tlih union minimum and has not reduced hours the men employed by tho king are apparently still included in the strike call altlough his mlajesty has not reduced wages or hlours and pays as a minimum the terms which the union men went out to defend mloreover many of the kings em ployees are specially skilled men dealing with his itunamous red poll cattle soutlh dovn sheep and othler wellknown stock such men of course receive well above the n inimuml i understand the sandringhain men have not stopped work and are not likely tothe farmers uhion terms to the men are being considered on the basis of an offer of s for a lhour guaranteed week and mr j fwright secretary of the norfolk branch of the  farrirets union stated today that he expected the strike to be broken in a fort nights in suffolk the farmers have put before their vorkmen similar conditions to those finally offered in last saturdays negotiations by the norfolk farmers to their labourers viz s for a fiftyhour week s for a fifty twohour week and ts for a fiftyfourhourproposal of s for a fiftyhour week s id for a fiftytwohour week and s d for a fiftyfourhour week the farmers are to take a ballot of their iiembers on the two scales
