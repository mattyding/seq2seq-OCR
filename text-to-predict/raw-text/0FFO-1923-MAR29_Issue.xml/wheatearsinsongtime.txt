wheatears in songtimethe first migrantsfromi a cordrespondentthe sun shone bright a light south easterly wind fanned the cloudy wavelets of the channel and the wheatears were wvaiting where we hoped to find them on the shinglebeaclh where they had landed at dawn their welcome to their native shores was not a kind one bothby the starlings which all the winter have picked for food in the kelpbeds and by the sky larks which claim proprietorship of the rough grass field behind the shingle they were being eyed with bostility as un desirable immigrants and hustled from every post and clod more powerful birds than wheatears are often strangely tame and oomplaisant when they trespass on a site already occupied by another species at the nestingseason and they retreated an silence from each challenge and uttered not a syllable of their spring songto catch that curious and elusive music which only lasts for a week or two after their coming we sought out later in the day a wide combe deep in the downs wheatears and chiffehaffs are seldom near neighbours  for the wheatear haunts smooth hillturf and windywarrens and the chiffehaff clings to thick copses and sheltering trees but here a broad brake of furze and blackthorn and elder and juniper dropped steeply to a sunny valley of chalky sward and in this unusual combination of scenery the two earliest migrants were both singing spring seems born on the first day that the chiffchaff sings  the familiar chime came falling as full of promise as the veil of verdure in the boughs two chiffehaffs were sing ing in this wild brake and neither had yet learnt his full song one uncertain both in tone and rhythm wits softly re peating among the blackthom buds a rudimentary  chiff chiff chiff the very elements of his tribal music from such an uncertain beginning the very dis tinct songs of the chiffebaff and tho willow warbler must both have been developed the second chiffehaff searching for flies among the bristly junipers had attained the characteristic double rhythm but his notes were still identical and he sang  chiffchiff chiffchiff in these tender warblers springs rivalry which perfects birdmusic was still but feebly stirring before those blackthorn buds are wide and starry both songs will ring true to typethe wheatears song was stronger and more animated for among the six or eiulit birds already at home among the rabbit warrens there were at least twvo bens flitting from flintheap to furzestem in restless excitement the cockbirds spread their wings and tail to display the pure white feathers then dashed at each other lilke terriers pouncing on an old shoe a henbird sat by in drabber plumage with no sign of being interested in the game then one cockbird flung itself suddenly into the air and zigzagged into the breeze like an erratic skylark pouring out a fitful song two others eagerly replied from a chalky carttrack the wheatears music is a medley of clear notes suggesting a less powerful misselthrush and chatlike clackings like the clappernotes of the waterousel but its most curious fascina tion is in its mimicry as the birds flicked about the down among their clear spirts of native music they were imitating the partridges creaking call it was strange to hear them mocking this down land cry so soon after their arrival but partridges and migrating wheatears must be companions on breezy heaths in other lands and they may have learnt it far across the channel
