done to british trade by the occupa tion of the ruhr the whole of the exports of one firm which exported yarn to the value of a quarter of a million sterling annualy to the ruhr were held up at the present time the firm was even unable to withdraw its yarn from bond in order to dispose of it else wlhere in the last two months we had imperceptibly passed into an entirely new phase of french policy we used to be con cerned withthe treaty of versailes bat we were now concerned with a new order of ideas far beyond the treaty of versailles he believed every british expert had reported that german disarmament was virtually com plete if proof were needed that germany was helpless and disarmed he would point to ute present state of thingsin the ruhrger many prostrate whilst the heart of her in dustry was invaded and held by a handful of armed men neither reparation nor security in the old form now held the centre of the stage if reparation were the only question of difference between french policy and oas he would notdespair ofcoming to terms with france we had never been any thing but agreed with our french alies on the prineiple of reparation had the mind of france been centred on the question of reparations he was convinced she would have adopted a very different attitude to the many praetical and businesslike proposals which had been madeduring the last six monthsaccording to  newspaper reports the french prime minister had stated to the committee of foreign affairs of the french chaliber that the occupation of the ruhr was economically unprofitable he thought that was sufficient evidence that it was not the economic aspect of the occupation which was now preoccupying tie french mind the  central motive of french policy was not reparations nor security in the old form it was security under an entirely neiv  definition  it took us into a new dangerous and volcanic region of politics m poincare yesterday made an im portant declarationto the foreign affairscom mittee of the french chamber in whieh he stated that the french would not leave essen until everyfpenny qf germnan ieparations had been paid he wat not arguing whether these declarations were fight or wrong the point was that they were the facts which had to be dealt with they were provisions not con tained in the treaty of versarlles  they were of a new description altogether and they con fronted us with entirely new problems m poineare not only said that the occupation of essen would be maintaioed for an indefinite periodbecause france had refused to accept the verdict of the reparation commission andhad become herself the sole arbiter of what germany ought to paybut he also said that the costs of the occupation of the ruhr were to be charged in the same way as the costs of the occupation of the left bank of the rhine that also was a new claim out side the treaty of versailles again under the treaty of versailles the free navigation of the rhine wassecuredtq al countries by an international commission but the functions of that comnmission had been entirely abrogated by the french and belgian occupation of the ruhr the commnission was to meet next week but wvhat it would discuss he did notknowi because the navigationn of the rhine was controlled in an arbitrary manner by france and belgium lphat also was out side the treaty of ver§aillesthe prench aimsm phillippe millet a french publicist who was always moderate in his views and who was a friend of this country had recenuy wvritten an article under the heading  what might be the scheme of peace he was ap parently discussing the terms of a new peaeo and anewtreaty alter a new war hear hear m millet stated that the essential requirements of france werethat france slhould secure the permanent international control of the lelt bant of tle rhine the permanent international control of the rhine railways wvith french and belgian predomi nance on an international body which was to eesrciae that contsol the permanent seces aionto france of thesaarmines andthe permanent annexation of the saar territory and the rhineland all these things constituted a new situa tion altogether how wasthis situation to be dealtt mith  he yielded to nobody in his sentiment of friendship with france he be lieved that every member of the hpuse would a thousand times rather agree with france than disagree cheers he believed  he was not unlike other hon members in feelinga strong natural inclination to agree with france and much more than an iatural pre judice against germany but on an issue of this kind the polcy of a great empire could not be framed on grounds of sentiment alone hear hear it wvs part of the loyalty which we owed to france to be perfectly frank about what we could do and what we could not do at present this new french pohcy meant in substance the alienation of germans and of german territory from gcer many it meant if uwe sypported it that this country was to undertake an obgation to interfere in the internal affairs of germany and to restrict german sovereigrity for all time the rhineland and the saar were ethnicauy german the ituhr was the heart or german industry and international control in any form over these territories must mean the denationalization of them it meant an inevitable explosion in the years to come hear hear paper formuial were useless to cover these realiues hle saw great difllcilty in reconciling the british point ofetievw and the british sense of right with the policy now advocated by france it wnas contrary to our war alms cheers it was contrary to the treaty of versailles and it was the sure cause of future wars it would menn the undertaking by this country of an obligation to interfere in the internal affairs of a european state such as we had never undertaken before if we wished for a wise example we could not follow a better one than that adopted by castlereagh and canning after the napoleonic wars which led to the first cooperation between the british empire and the united stateshe did not ask the government for an immediate declaration of policy but he did ask two things first that they should con sult with the dominions and consult in time the dominions were part of the british empire delegation which made the treaty of versailles we should he thought be called on to give some declaration of policy long before the imperial conference could meet he aslked secondly that the govern ment should be ready with some declaration on behalf of the british empire within a few weeks the govermnent were not only the representatives of great britain but they were the trustees of the britsh empire he hoped wben the time cameas it was bound to come before longthat the govermnent would see that the british empire had a mind and a voice ofits own cheersthe plan of augustsir l worthingtonrvan s cpl chester u after congratulating sir e grigg on his speech said that he supposed every one realized how grave was the present posi tion the country was uneasy and anxious abqut our relations with france ever since the armistice we had been on terms of the greatest friendship with france and our other european allies any differences bad been settled at conferences so that anyaction talken might be joint action we bad alwayssucceeded in doing this until last january since then separate action had been taken by france some newspapers and writers in france had always been incined to view our action with suspicion but on the other hand great britain hlad had active friends who had stood by her in the french press  but these samo writers within the last few months had been shoning suspicion of our motives and had been holding usup as the enemies who were standing in the way of france when she de sired reparations and reasonable seeurity there had been speeches in the house and in the country which bad showvn that the speakers contemplated not continued friend ship with france but a period perhaps of hostility that was tte gravest possible posie tion be asked the government what steps they were taking to remove the suspicion which was at the base of the feeling of ten sion that existed between thetwo countries he denied that this country had stood in the way of france getting either reparations or security we bad been prepared to support every practical proposal that had been made in the matter of reparations and in the matter of security when america was unable to confirm the undertaking to act jointly with us in guaranteeing french sil from aggression we offered at cannes to stand in the breach alone why should not the papers containing that offer be published  cheers the papers relating to the abortise confer ences on reparations in  december and january last had been published why were the papers relating to the august conference not published as well   cheers  the proposals in august last were of ex treme importance it wvas proposed that a moratorium to the end of   should be granted in respect of arrears of payment due then by germany and that it should be ex tended only upon condition that germany took steps for example to stabilize her currency to balance her budget to pass legis lation preventing the flight of capital from germany and to grant auztnomy to the iteichsbank until these preliminary steps were takeen it wasuseless to expect any large sums from germany it was not a complete moratorium that was proposed because de liveries in kind were to continue and the proceeds of the  per cent export tax would also have continued to be collected when these proposals were examined lie believed that both french and british public opinion would free great britain  from the charges which the french press were apt to make against usif the plan of august had been carried out both france and ourselves would have been receiving a considerable part of the amount due lor reparations cheers he estimated francesshare at ie a year in the proposals agreed to so far as the allies were concerned there was to be some supervision over the german customs and the german budget he urged that the report of the experts submitted to the august conference should also be published a proposal was made that france should manage the ruhr mines but great  britain  pointed out that such an attempt would inevitably end in  reduced production the event had amply justified that forecasthe was not surprised that the proposals made in january were not accepted one of those proposals was that belgium should give up her priority no one who had ever been in touch with belgium would imagine that sbe would for a moment consent to that several of the proposals made in regard to france did not seem to be as good security as those made at the august conference he hoped that along the hnes of the august proposals there was still a possibility of arriving at a settlement and he asked the government whether they were prepared to open nego tiations afresh upon those lines he regretted the absence of the prime minister and more especially the cause mnd he did not know whether in the right hon gentlemans absence the government would be prepared to say what their policy was since the prime minister said in february that no polcy was better than a bad policy things had not got better but rather worse it could not be right that we should stand idly by while suspicion was growing and while feeling between our selves aud our allies was hardening into an tagonism and the eeds of war were ripen ing if they could not have a statement of policy tpat day could they not at least have apromnise that the papers which he had asked for should be published ka german opfermr asquitih paisley l said he desired to associate himself to the full with the con gratulations offered to sir e grigg who opened the debate he was hot usilig the language of flattery when he said that he had rarely heard a maiden speech which both in forra and in substince eseenmed t promise more hopefully a distinguished parlianentary career cheers lhe entirely subscnbed to the request made by sir l worthington evans for papers maki g the fullest possible disclosure of what had been going on during the last two years he could see no reason why those papers should notbe published a very remarkable statement had been made on thle previous day ini he relebstag by the ger muan foreign minister dr rosenberg in which he stated that the german governments position on the  reparation  question was that an inter ational comnission iof busin e ss men should determine as soon as possible three pointsnamely  the extent to whicb germany had already fulfilled he r obligations  herability to meet them in tiefuture  the manner in whicbh they could be metthose questions he continued should be de termined by such a commission or a simiar impartial body of experts on which germany and france would be represented on terms of full equafiy and full rights if tlis  or a similar ivay should be taked the government would be prepared to sound the international monriey market with a view to obtaining the highest possible loan and would amply provide any guarantee which the loan syndicate might thinkc necessary this money ould be handed over to france or to the allies as an immeriate advance in cash dr rosenberg proceeded to say that without expressing any request or desire the goverunment had placed those views  before such  powers as vere principally interested in the state of europeand which were not concerned directly in the ruhr conflict the government attitudehe vished to know whether those views had been laid before his majestys government and if so when and by what form of com munication further could the government say whether they had been laid before other powers not directly concerned in the ruhr ad venture such as italy and the united states p be also wished to know if the governmentas be ws informed had for some time been in possession of those views had taken any steps by diplomatic negotiation or com munication or otherwise to bring them selves into concert witb the other powers con cerned or had we been doing this which was really a very important new departure and were we now still committed to an atti tude ef what he night call benevolent im potence hear hear which having regard to the gravity of the conditions and the enormous and possibly disastrous possibilities of the near future was one wvhich was not altogether worthy of a great power which had played such a large part in these matters and which could not either morally or politically disinter est itself from their ultimatesolution cheersmr asquith proceeded to give a summary of the provisions of the treaty of versailles for the real demilitarization of the tirri tory from which france would naturally be most npprehensive of a possible incursion or invasion and said it was not wholly im material to add that by article  which was one of the general articles so long as the presenttreaty remains in lorce germany undertakes to give every facility for any in vestigation which the council of the league of nations acting if need be by a majority vote considers necessary in his view that meant that the provisions of what lie might call the demilitanrization articles were pro visions which the league of nations was en titled to sea by inspection and by supervision carried into effect security for francethereforefrance did receivepeople did not realize this sufficientlyunder those terms of the treaty very adequate security against possibiities of future danger from gentuany that was a totally different thing from the temporary occupation by the allied powers of those various zones of which they had hitherto been in military possession that occupation ceased in  unless when that time came there was such adequate and reasonable ground for fearing that future aggreson either of germany or of france as the case might be  it was quite true that prance had not by the treaty of versailles but by the collateral pact that was entered into between her and ourselvet and the united states a large addi tional and very mcaterial safeguard that safeguard disappeared by no fault of ours he hid alvays thought and he still pressed upon the consideration of parliament that she could not be placed in the sarne position of material still more perhaps of sentimen tal and moral security that she would have been if that pact had been carried out and unless something was substituted for it she got as she ought to get as germany and the people ofthe countries whose future territorial arrangemients depended on the treaty ol ver sailles were entitled to get the assurance of a conjoint solid international guarantee of at any rate all those who were parris to the league of nations if that were so if that could be brought home if those pro posals had been made by germany and were open to consideratiorr they could not help asking themselves the question why are things proceeding on the lines they are p for what purpose and for the enforcement of what demand are the french continuing and extending the occupation of the ruhr and the adjacent country  surely this ought to be plainly stated so that it could he universally understood was it for the pur pose of seeking to obtain irom germany in theshaipe of reparation £ which was the s um estimated as everybody now realized under conditions which had become practically obsolete  had the government now got or sought to jet from france any distinct or definite statement whether that was her objectthe continuance and extension of this operation quite apart from the question of reparation quite apart from the question of material and stiategic security was hi it was to be continued on those lines leading france into a position in which he regretted he hesitated to say it but it had to be said she could not carry this counry with her wlhat did it mean  it was no good blinking the fact it was no good pretending that realities were not realities it meant or might mean the creation for an indeflnite time of a new alsacelorraine situation that would be an appaling result after all that had taken place since the beginning of the wara war which was fought as a war of emancipation a war to prevent the domination of small states by large states and the incorporation of alien popula tions in federations or sovereiguties to which they could never be honestly and genuinely loyal it would be the most tragic com mentary on wasted opportunities that history could afford if they were going to set up again a system wlhch it was their object to destroy and to which they had hoped they had finally put an endhe earnestly hoped that that did not re present the goal to which french policy was tending it would be a terrible thini if they should have to sever the entente which had subsisted now for more than twenty years with the best possible results as he believed to civilization and which he hoped and prayed might still continue he trusted that the government with this declaration on the part of germany and with the agsurance which we ought to be prepared to give that we would do everytbing in our power to strengthen and supplement the safe guards which were necessary for the future territorial security of france herself would be able to give them some hope that tbe situa tion was not so grave as it seemed and that they were striving with all the power and authority which they possessed if they chose to exercise it not only to reestablish to the full the entente between prance and ourselves but to help along the road towards establish ing in europe a situation of stability and permanent peace cheersthe labour viewmr ramsay mac donald aberavon lab said
