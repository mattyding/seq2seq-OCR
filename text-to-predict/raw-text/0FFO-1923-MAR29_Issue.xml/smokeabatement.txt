smoke abatementprof w a bone on howto aid industriesprofessor w a bone in a statement to a representative of the times yesterday de scribed a metbod of procedure by which he beiieved the problem of smoke abatement could be effdicently tackled without endanger ing the tommercial stability of industry or impairing the efficiency of manufacture the government has under consideration smoke abatement legislation presumably orn the lines of the recommendations of lord newtons committee and it is professor bones opinion that this legislation should be postponed until the industrial side of the question has been more thoroughly surveyed i do not consider he said that the late smoke abatement committee had suffi cient firsthand knowledge of the subject its report was lacldng in constructive thought and outlook and could not be accepted as embodying the best informed opinion on tho question in the country having regard to the present industrial and economic situation i deprecate any furtber legislation at the moment i think it is more important to give industry a fair chance to get on its legs again than to be legislating for smoke abatement if legislation is postponed as i hope it wvill be for a period of three or five years the ministry of health should in the meantime take powers if it does not already possess them to appoint an advisory bqard com posed of persons having speciail experience of the nature of coal and its combustion industrial heating operations and the vary ing conditions in different industries and generauy with a wide range of the practice which is comprised in moderin fuel technology this board should investigate scientiflcally and technically the means and pssibilities of smoke abatement in boiler practice and in various industrial operations with a view to advising manufacturers and public authorities as to the most practicable steps that can ba taken actauy to abate smoke in such ipera tions and at the sarme time to conserve and economize fuel having regard to the neces sary conditions under which particular opera tions must be carried ont the board could also stand in a kind of judicial position be tween the manufacturers and the public authoritieswhen a complaint with regard to smoke is made by a public authority it should be referred in the flrst instance to the board in order that inquiry may show whether a prima tacie case exists and if so to what extent the nuisance could be reasonably abated in the event of mitgation being possible itwould be the daty of the board to advise and inworm the manufacturer precsely how mitigation could be carriedout in his special circiu stances and to show that it couldf be done at a reasonable cost and without detriment to the stability of the industry a period would be allowed to the manufacturer to make the abatement then if he neglected the matter and only then the board should have power to issue a certificate permitting a prosecution i believe that such prosecutions would be very rare and the penalties might be much heavier than they are at presentthe keynote of the position would be that the board would be there to help the manu facturer it would be their duty to demon strate that they were going to save him money as well as to mitigate smoke although there would be no compulsion the board might also recommend slrge users of fuel where they thought the result would be beneficial to appoint on their technical stafts properly trained fuel technologists and help persons so appointed to obtain the best results if a large number of these fuel technologists were employed in our industrial establishments that in itself would be the best means of miti gating the smoke nuisance and of economizing fuel and would produce the best results it would remove from smoke abatement legisla tion and procedure the present irritating feature that it is a penalizing system manu facturers i feel sure would cooperate in such a scheme asi have outlined
