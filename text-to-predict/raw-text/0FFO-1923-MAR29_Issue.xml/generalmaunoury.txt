general mainoijrythe battle of the oourcqthe death of general maunoury is announced on page in the great war maunoury first made his mark when commanding a group of three reserve divisions in the fourth army under general ruffey in august  the great german offensive kaocked the bottom out of the unfortunately conceived andrnot too well carried out  plan xvii on which the french general staff had based their hopes of victory after the french defeat at virton the crown prince believing erroneously that the whole freach fourth army had been involved in the defeat endeavoured to turn ruffeys right on the othain maunoury learn ing of this project on august  im mediately forestalled him by attacking and defeating his left flank next day the results of this attack were im portant but only local as joffre could not allow the success gained to be exploited as he had more urgent work for maunoury to do further north namely to formn and command a new army the sixth army destined for an important re in a projected general counterattack from the somme and the falaises de champagnefor various reasons this piojected general counterattack never came off and the opera tion scheme of french general headquarters had once more to be remodelled instead of taking part in a general counterattack maunoury now found himself offering a stubborn but most active defence against the advance of klucks first army between villersbretonneux and proyart on august  under klucks pressure maunoury fel back through st just and creil to the northern defences of paris the great moment of his life was drawing very near for the pieces were beig set or were setting themselves for that most dramatic of crises the battle of the marnebefore recounting the role played by maunourys army in that great battle with which his name is for ever linked it is as weer to call to maind what the situation was and especially from the point of view of the german higher command on august  khuck decided to close in towards bulows second army instead of moving on the lower seine leaving parins between his own army and billows noltke accepted this decision of his subordinate which meant moving across the front of the french forces assembling under cover of the entrenched camp of paris kluck forced the pace so that by september  his army was crossing the maxne in advance of the second army when according to moltkes orders he should have been in chelon behind the right flank of that army briefly he had exposed himself to a blow from the direction of paris whether that blow would be serious or not depended on the forces available and above all on the resolution with which they were handledit was fortunate for france and her allies that they were commanded by so stouthearted a fighter as general naunoury and that thanks to joffre their strength proved to he just sufficient though without a man to spare to accomplish the vital task of forcing kluck to withdraw from the lane more and more men to face maunourys thrust on the oureq during the night of august  maunoury informed his superior general gallieni who was in command of the entrenched camp of paris that kiluck seemed to be offering a flank to his attack gallini rose to the occa sion and failing to get ordersonthesubject from joffre on september  ordered blaunoury to prepare to attack kluck joffre approved of the project during the afternoon and next day maunourys pressure on klucks flank began the retreat of the french armies had ended they were turning ontheiradver sary and the first to turn was maunourys sixth armyit is a moot point whether maunourys advance was not premature possibly much greaterresultswould have been achieved had it not been disclosed to the germans until september  when klucks army would have been more deeply committed across the maie rut as it was the germans were closer to maunoury than he thought so that his advance on the th brought about a collision with the german lvth reserve corps which fought hard delayed his progress and gave kuck rions time in which to rectify his vispositions and eurtail his commitments south of the marne in a desperate attempt to crush maunoury before the british expeditionary force couild inter vene effectively maunourys operations are known to history as the battle of the oureq but as a matter of fact they are part and parcel of that vast operation of joferes which is caued the battle of the barne partisans vill wrangle to the end of time as to what particular feat of arms brought about the german defeat on the marne perhaps we shall be on safe ground if we assume that each and every subsidiary operation was vital to the victory achieved and of those operations maunourys was a very important onemaunoury was in his th year when the war broke out in  he was well known as an artillery officer and had already been governor of paris but his most important appointment was that of commandant of the ecole do guerre the french staff college he
