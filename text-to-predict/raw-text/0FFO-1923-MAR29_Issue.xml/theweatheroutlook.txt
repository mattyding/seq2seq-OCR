the weather  outlookno great changeby our weather correspondentthere is no reason to abandon hope for the holiday weather although yesterday london experienced heavy rain showers in the early morning a broken april sky and a drop of nearly ten degrees in the temperature over england generally the weather was varied some fortunate districts experiencing unclouded skies others broken weather and heavy showers or drizzlewe are still in the region of a mild contest between a coritinental high pressure system with easy gradients and a very large shallow atlantic depression on the western edge of which very small local depressionls tend to develop the conditions are certainly unstable but the changes are not likely to fe great a slight shifting of either large system may make it warmer or eolder but there is little indication of either constant warmth or constant rain on the whole what seems most probable is a rather colder type with occasional and local areas of brilliant sun and of drizzlethe channel steamers should have fair to moderate crossings and although there is little likelihood of airpassages being retarded by fbg the flights may be rather bumpy taking indications broadly they should be better for the road than for the river for openair pursuits requiring active exercise than for lounging and picnicking
