prosecution of the brighton guardiaarto tiue ernttn nv tiie surszi afvertirtvnsiri have read the report published by you on the th inst of the debatc which took place in the magistrates room on the subject of lord d lawartes motion for a vote ot thanks to mir mabbot as nlso tho ardcle headed  from a carreapondc nt tbe firt i affirm to be a very unfir and garhbid detail of those proceedings and the latter calculated to lead the public to a conclusion very favourable to the noble lords crotion aind equilly unfavourable as to the oo tives of its opponentsit is necessary that i should bere state that illessms co hen phillips gold and liallett were the only strangers in tbe room duritg the deblte taking dotes of the pro ceedings and thtt itf tec report you bare published was rumitbed by any one of those gentlemen it has undergone such terations and curtailments that it leaes little resï¿½en blance to the original and the only speeches reported at length and with nny degice of accuracy bebng thote of mr courthope air seejerant dyiy end mtr gear the three gentlemen who supported the motion i am directly led to the concluson that yout correspondent was a person of ficialy present at the meeting and that the report of the debate has been cut nred trimmed to suit his or their purposues and to ac cord with the obserations ofyour anonymous corspondentthe follovwing are quot tions from the latter of the two do cumoents i have above noticed the spcakersa avintt the motion thought the prosecudon of the publisher only made more public that wbich if left unnoticed would have passed into oblivion and been unit tended wlth any injurious effects and they also opposted the motion on the ground that it was an impilcd cenuirc upon those who supported the petition of mr cohen for a mitiga tion ef punisbmcnt thus thent wee find in the minority kvc members of parliament oppostmg a vote of thanks to air mabbott because they thought the same implied a censure upon their parliamentary conduct agrdin  it wras ex pressly unequivocally and disdnctly stated that no such censure was brtctded the supporters of the aiotion onlyi claimed a right of expressing to their brother magistratc air uabhott their approbation ef hs conduct a tsimilar prhvi iege hsving been exercised by the opponents in supporting thethe first assertion as regards mfysel is unfounded i oppoand the motion because i consnidered it to imply a ecu sure upon myself for dissenting from the policy and the jut tice of the proswectlon i st ted that fn my opinion i was justified in the first objection by the reaulesnd that the second and mnain ground of diseent reted on the defendent having in my judgment offered an atonement adequatc to the ofrence when he made mlr c cavendish dir curteis air kcmp and myrelf the channel of a wrtten communcatlon to mr alabbott stadng that he air cohen was not the author of the lel but merelv the publisher of the ofensive article that it cane late to his office was inadrertendly inserted and that he was ready to npologize and retntct whatever it con tained offctsive to the magistratet it was upon this ground that ii stated in the house of cemmons that the prosecution ought not to have taken placeit was for this reason that i could not concur in the vote of thanks to lur alabbott and viewing in that vote an implied censure upon the magistrates who disapproved of the prosecution i opposed the motion and moved the amrendmentyour correspondent it would appear considers the justice of the measure st wholly unworthy consideration and alto gether emits tbat point ef my argument ana itis rather acu ious coincidence that botn air courehopc and air serjeant doyly vwho spoko at such length and fwith sucd great abi ley should also hare passed over unnoticed and disregarded this main ground upon wwhich my dissent restednamely itr cohens appeal to the mercifiul forbearance of a powerful xdy of prosecutorsit is further said to have been expressly stated that no such censure was intended it is true that the nosle lord early in the debate it explainadon said that  he had stru ously endeavoured so to w ord his motion as not to imply any censure  but then the noble lord in his opening peech stated that the vote of thanks arose from certain expres sloni made use of by certain hon gentlemen in the house of commons tending to show that the prosecution of ircohen was one hat reflected disgrace on the prosecutor and that i would be difficult to cotnceive that a body of gentlemen could sit dovn under an accutatfon like this and the same noble lard in his reply spechb further statedsthat in consequence of my having reiterated the opinion before expreased he was sorry hc had excludcd every tbing but a vote of thanks from his motion now i put it to any dispassionate judge whether the caution observed by the noble lord in framing hi motion coupled with the regret subsequently admitted by him the fact of his having gone to that sneeting prepared with notes of my observations in the house togetber with tha tone and substance of the speeches of the two leamed gentlemen mr courthope and mr serjeant iloyly are collectively in accordance with the positive assertion of your correspondent that it was expressly unequivocally and distinctly statte that no censure was intended i am still of opinion it wasbut a candid and open avowal of such a motivewould not have been in accordance with the character of the rest of the pro cecdings ofthat selfconstituted committeehavmg stated as briefly as possible the reasons i gave for questuoning tha policy and justice of the prosecution i pro ceed to make a few observations upon its origin and proit appears that in november   vigting justices including air partington the liberal and learned chairman if the quarter sessions astembled at lewes fior purposes con nected with the gaol at this meeting one of the mngistrates bir seymour i believe produced frorn his pocket the rnghson guardian paper containing a libel on the magis tacy ef sussx a discusslon followed and the result was that those  gentlemen decidcd to posecute the editor formed themselves into a prosecuting committee and selected air miabbott to be the active agent thus the very first step was of a character to create suspicion if the avowed object had been the sole and real one the regular course would have been either to enter a notice on the agenda and have sub mitted tbe measure which was one of a public charactcr as weu as one the most delicate and the most questionable of any that car constitute the subject of a prosecution for considera tlo elnd adoption at theensuinggencral quartersetsions or by someother means to have taken the stnse of the magistrates upon the subject butto retum to theprogressof the protecution the next step of this committee was to draw up and sign a re solution and this document was then made the ground of an application to the government to take the prosecution out of theit handa mlr alabbott and another gentleman had two personal codfercmees at the homeoffice which ended in the noble lord then at the head of that office positively dc dining to make it a government prosecution but agreed to defray the rcasonalble expenscs should the magistrates of ssex decide upon proecdting and were of opinion that a susacxjury would convict ths resolution i conclude was made known to the committee and mr alabbott recelved in structions to retum informatien to the tomeoffice that all the magistrates with the exception of one air gear had no doubt about the jury and he concludes the communication byobserving that the magistrates wcre all ofopinion that no opportunity should be lost to sappress the guardian cewns paperi witi nor trust mysefto make any comment upon this hitherto hidden object lnt t once dispels the cloud that ha rendered tte course pursued by the committee so indis tinct and so unusual it accounts for the rejection of ir cohens offered atonement and well axcords with that part or the sentence which imprisoned tbte defendant in the gaol of a distant connty and far removed from the offire of his paperin addition to tho aforegoing i shau merelv observe that i am attthorized to state that the part taken fby the govern mecnt in this i must stil think disgraceful afflrwas pursued under the impression that the committee expressed the senti ments of the body ofthe magistrates not aware that tt was a selfconstitutei committee and had never been sanctioned by any public notice or special public proceeding and that the fact of mr cohens net being the author ofthe libel together with his offer ofatoncnentwere withheld from the knowledge of the ijovemmentfeeung that i could no longer with the confidence end satisfacdcn essntial to the discharge ofa very responsible duty continue to aet with gendlemen whose views of justice so essentlally differ from my own ttnd who have fitrther thought proper to stek their own justification at my expease it wa with very great reluctance and regret and becausecould see no other course left open to me that  resolved to ceae to act as a magistrate and in order to be wholly ob solved from the responsiility of the of fice and the control of sd eionstitued committees that i havemade application to the lordleutenant respectfully requesting that my rnsmnmay be erased
