report o the criminal lawthe report of the commissioners appointed to in quire into and consolidate the criminal law has at length been laid before parliament we adverted to thlis report some weeks ago and expressed our surprise that no greater progress than appeared upon the face of that octtment had been made by the commnissioners in the ours of a years labour wle were quite aware then that the commniusioners stated they had  made considerable progress in digesting the statute and com mon law relative tc the offences and punishments of homicide theft robbery burglary housebreaking and forgery and wvere proceeding in the further exe cution of tis branch of their labours  the branch referred to being the defaning of offenees and punish ments it is however impossible to guess at what a considerable progress means and when we look at the very slender coutents of the report before us wve are compelled to adhere to the opinion we then expressed and to add that considering the cost of this commission the number of persons engagsd in it and the time which has been given for its operation much more in quantity might have been reasonably expected of its quality we sball saya word by and by ifmndeed the present comrpissioners had been required to enter upon a wholly novel inquiry the difficulties of such a tak might have accounted for the slowness with which thley appear to have proceeded but as there is hardly iany topic to evhich the public attenticn has beenr more i frequently called or upon wvhicht more fficient steps have been taken in the prosecution of tho object for vhicb this eomumission has beenx appointed what re mains to be done might have been speedily as welt as easily accomplishedit has long been felt that the sucmcssive statu tory changes which have been rendered necessarduring a long series of years had made it expedient to simplify and reduce to a more compact system the escattered body of criminal law without referring to the earlier improvements which have been effected it may be asserted that for the last so years some of the mnostdistinguished men iu this country have enter tained the project of consolidatingnot codifying that body of law and the parliamentary debates and the journals of both hiouses of parliament show that neither the govemnment nor the public have been negligent of the subject or supine in fbr thering the work of improvement it has been stated on the authority of mir yilberforce that mr pitt was desirous of reducing the statute law relating to criminal offaetces into one complete system in the year  on a motion of the late earl stanhope a conference was held between the two houses of parliamenton the same subject atid although no positive change in the law ensued upon that delibe ration it was not held in vain nor has tshe subject ever since been lost sight of besides the committee vwhich was afterwards appointed to consider so nuch of the criminal law as related to capitl punishments in fe lony consisting of some of the most eminent public men of that dav including the present lord chancel lor a selsct committee was appointed by tbe house of commons in  who reported that it was expedientthat the statutes relating to the criminal law should be consolidated under their several heads that leave should be applied for to bring in bills for the purpose of consolidating the criminal law without amend ment or alteration and for leave to bring in bills for supplying the omissions and remedying the anomalies in the same law but wvhich latter bills were to ba distinct from the consolidating bills appended to that report was a statement by mr an thony hammond who had been examined before the committee embodying his views on the subjects of amending and consolidating the criminal law and a digest of the law relating to forgery with a draught of a bill for consolidating amending and declaring the law of forgery in the last paragraph of the statement mfr hammond who it appears hsd been occupied dursng many years on the wrork which he submitted to the committee says  the codle consolidation and ameuldmentof the svhole criminal law has been entirely completed further than that he was a barrister and the editor of several law works we do not kinow who mr hammond was or howv he came to be consulted by the committee but it is evi dent from the circumnstance of their having printed his statement which consists of nearly  folio pages that they deemed his iabours of importance and perhaps a more remarkable instance of diligence and care on an intricate and difficult subject than he has displayed in the woik we have mentioned and in his other productions of a similar kind it woould be difficult to point out it is probable that he was em ployed by sir robert peel who was then home secre tary and to whomn the country is indebted for the most efficient improvement that has hitherto been effected in the criminal law for we find that between the date of sle report we have mentioned and the year  ar hlammond published at the expense of the government and under the direction of sir robert peel eight fotio volumes of a criminal code those volumes were distributed to the number of about  among the libraries of public institutions throughout the cotntry they are ef course in the library of the house of commons and are perfectly ll known to all persons whose inclinations or duties may have led them to consider the subjects they embrace the opinions suggested by mr hammond are not always such as are likely to be universally concurred in but these form a very su all portion of thebulk of the work and laying thoae suggestions wholly aside his volumes contain a most elaborate and complete digest of the statute law and common law relating to forgery coin ing housebreaking game laws larceny robbery stolen goods fraud mischief restitution and compensation wvhat has been done sinea by means of the statutes commonly callcd peels acts lord lansdownes act the forgery act and various others which have had for their object the simplifying the criminal law need not be menftioned more particularly but enough has been said to show that a most implortant progress has been made in the work of improvement and that a store of materials has been laid up upon which future labourers may employ thenselves usefully to the countryand without the exertion of any great labourthe path being thus far cleared a commnission was appointed on the d of july last directed to five barristers authorizing them to digest into one statute au the statutes touching crimes their trialand punish ment and to digest into one other statute all the provisions of the common law touching the same and to inquire and report how far it may be expedient to combine both those statutes into one body of enminal lawor the firstmentioned only of the said statutes and geragly to inquire and report how far it fay bcc xipe diett to consotidate the other branches of the existing tatute law or any of them the words in italicsmay at some future time call for particular attention if they are intended to relate to the criminal law only they are unnecesvary because they are included in the directions which precede them  if they are intended to have a more extensive meaning they ought not to have been slipped into sllch a commission as this the commissioners live now made their first report the main object of which an far as we can collect it is to state the conclusion they have arrived at as to the expediency of combining the digest of the common law with the digest of the statute liw and upon which they appear to invite the decision of the legislature at what they call an early period of their hbours because as they state very reasonably if a joint digest should be ultimately determined upon much of the time and labour employed iel the completion of two separate digests will have beent uselessly expeuded no doubt the question which the commissioners purpose is a very important one but surely it should have been put at an earlier period of their labours because if they have already made such progress as they represent in digestin the statute and common law upon the several heails of crimne mentioned in the first page of their report some part of their labours may have been already uselessly expended and what is worse they may have to continue the same wasteful expenditure until parliament shell meet againwhat has struck us ery forcibly and rnust occur to every one upon reading the report is that it contains no notice either of the digest published under sir robert peels direction or of any of the proceedings which have been taken before the authority of thesa coinmisionecr commenced to suppose them un acquainted with such matters would be unjust towards them beause it would imply that they had neglect the most obvious ources of infotmiin it it ela lso that they rnst hate read and made use of mï¿½r haammonds digest of which the text of their own as far as it goes is a mere abridgment the same authoritie being referred to although the arrangement is slightly difrerent and this makes their silence respecting that work the more remarkable butithasscaused us greater surprise still to find that they occupy several pages of their tot very long report in enumerating the difficulties they have encountered in the two distinct operations which their task bas involved  the first of which is the collect ing and arrndging the widely dispersed materials which constitute the law itself and  the second braneh of the process is that of extricating from the collected and arranged materials such general rules of law as they appear to warrant if indeed all this had not been done before ve could conceive the existence of some difficulties but with hlr ham monds digest upon their table as it must have been the difficulties vanish nor do we think that without such assistanee those difficulties would have deserved the great stress which the commissioners have laid upon them because we are bound to believe in justice to them and to his majestys advisers that the task would not have been allotted to any but persons whose practical knowledge of the criminal law qualified them to fulfil it the same vice of exaggeration runs through the whole of the report the defects in the law are magnifid single anpmalies are selected and held up as if tbey were of daily occurrence and ab surdities are pushed te their extremes as if they were the characteristics of our law instead of being as every rnan inowrs they are accidental exerescences to prove that the law does occasionally fall short and that it is difficult to apply its rules to some of the infi nite and varied combinations of facts which attend upon some few offences are things so easy and obvious that it surely does not reqttire five learned lawyers to demonstrate them to suggest a remedy if one can be founlded for such failures of justice would indeed be an acceptable public service but with no disposition to undervalue what they have done we do not perceive that the commissioners have brought that desideratum much snore nearly within our reacfi than it was before they complain of the uncertainty of ome of our defi nitions but they seem to forget that they are only designed to have a technical use and that in the main they serve that use they are as efficient as the legal definitions of other countries and neither the french code nor that of louisiana from which the commis sioners publish extracts at the end of their report are more free than our own from the use of termos which have and must have a peculiar signification why fraudulent which is alr livingstones word or fratudzdeusmzent which is the word in the code napoleon are any better than our ovvn vword felonious we do not clearly perceive but we do understand the dictum of sir mlatthew hale which the commissioners quote  that in cases of larceny the variety of circumstances is so great and the complica tions thereof so mingled that it is impossible to pre scribe all the circumstances evidencing a felonious in tention or the contrary but the same must be left to the due and attentive consideration of the judge and jury wherein the best rule is in dub ii to ineline rather to acquit than convict in the application of that and similar rules of the common law ve perfectly appreciate the advantages of our system not denying that it has defects over all the codes thate seill of all projeetors since the deluge has been able to devisethe most tangible part of the report consists of the notes appended to the digest of the law of theft but re think the comrnissioners have adopted an injudici ous mode of dealing with this inasmuch as they have confined theirdigest to the common law now every man not a lawyer knows that numerous statutes have extended and altered the common law on this subject but none save lawyers can understand the allusions which the commissioners makle to those statutes or how far they extend if they had made the same use of ivir hammonds digest of the statu te law as they have made of his labours on the comlnon lawv their report would have been more intelligible and they would have made out more strongly their case for combining the two digests these notes however are by far the most valuable part of their report for the rest it consists of a quantity of disconnected observa tions upon i things in general relating to criminal matters and containing views which are sometimes unsound and suggestions which we can hardly think have been the result of as much deliberation as the sub jects deserve one instance of which is the proposition that a man against whom the coroners jury has re turned a verdict of homicide should be put upon his trial without the intervention of the grand jury the i proposal to extend the law as to breaches of trust sofar as it is expressed involves some very delicate points and the difficltty of pointing out the limits wbere such oftences are to cease to be treated criminally is one which the commissioners do not seem to have con sidered to go in detail through the observations in the latter part of the report would require rmore time and space than we can at present devote but we shalu probably have occasion to revert to it in the mean time the subject is one which imperiously claims the attention of the legislature and which ought to suffer no longer delay afore than enough has been said about it and much lera than enough has been done we would willingly have bestowed praise upon the labours of the present commissioners if they had fiurnished us any ground for doing so but we must say that their report bg no means answers the expectatious we had formed or justifies the warm eulogium which by anticpation was lately pronounced upon it it will probably occur to some of our rcaders to compare this report with the volumes we have alluded to there may he reasons why the commissioners have not noticed that colleetion but it cannot be because they did not wish unnecessarily to lengthen their report since of the  pages it contains more than  are occupied by a repetition of thdr digest extracts from the louisiana code and tho code napolen and the prefaces to some of ihe most common books on crimi dal law
