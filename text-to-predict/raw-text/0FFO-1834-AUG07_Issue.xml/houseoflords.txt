steamt packets along the clyde from which they aerred that great inconvenience arose now with reference to what had been stated on this subject in another place he had called on the parties who irem psiculadly alluded to as being most inte rested in the rraittr and he found that so far from the state ment to which he zeferrd beingtrue the fact really wass that the pomoffice took the opportunit whenever it co d he done with advantag of transmitting letters by the steam packets and be moble duke mentioned the names of sereral pglaces on the clyde with respect to which that course hadeenadopted certain parties wished thalt the irish mall with reference to sotno places in that country should not take the route by portpatrlick that would have been found in convenienlt and he felt it to be his duty to refuse the apptlia tion that was now snede the subject of complaint by the petitiouers all that he regreteti was that those parties did not inqaire minutely into the rmatter and inform them selves thoroughly of all the circumstances espedall of the local circuxustanices connected writh the cas this petition he bad creryrcason to believe was got up by an individual who hadidistinguished himself elsewbere by his opposition to the postoffice departmenlt an opposition which the facts did not by any means warrnt for he be lieved thst thene was ast a departunent under the govern ment int which moze real was displayed in zouchiog an ithat polnts he felt it niecesary to notice a oub lecation tent ibelth by mnr barrow and he would state therui i lae htta pulcaton was not a report of pmpurporting to have been made in another place it was cdrrected by the individual to whom he had alluded and was a garbled statement of wrhat he really said the public of glasgow had stated to himir by their representatives that thety were satisfed writh what had been done by the postoffice by which the transmission of letters by the mall was considerably accelerated he had received a memorial signed by many of their lordeixips and by several metkbers of the other house of paaliamtnt requesting him to send the glasgow mall through another part ofnorttighamshljre he had refused his assent to the proposition bemause he under stoodi that ir it were complied with it would create an addlidonaldclayof fire mnantes and he knew that a loss of five minutes in one place and five in another was likely to prove a very seriousi detriment to the glastow merchants this showed that he was not unmindful ot their interests hie should only say with respect to the report that had been published iln the mfirror of parltmiren that it contained no les hs  charges against the ptbstoffice departmect he wished that the iindividual who mnade them could induce some oneofrtheir hardships iobringtboseeharges under considers tien int that ease he would underts le to prove te the satis faction of the house that there was no truth in any one of them hear bear ile did not howerer conceive that he was called on fomtally to repel in that house vague attacks that had been made elsewhere but he did feel that it was an act of justice to stand up there and state hit opinon of the gentleman who was at the brad of the postoffice de partment who had for many years filled a most confidentria situation rin that department be was an individual who oncycoccasion deserved and who on many occations had receved the approbation of the coduntry at large hear hear it was too bad after having been for sluch a long time a faithful servant of the public that that individual who was not in parliament and thereforc could not defend himself was to be attacked ins this manner hear hear he should only say that when he waz at the ixca of the postaffice departmnent whenerer he found it to be irisdut todisagree from the opinion of that hon orrble man when he difrered on any point from llthactisze and intelligent officer he always sthowed as much ztal iti carrying any suggestion of his the duke of rich moods into execution as if it had been his own hear hear it had beern made matter of complaint thiat he baj refused to allow french letters to be delivered on sunday  and this it was

countryhouse in the lasitoneandtwenty years hear anud he regretted that that individual had no leisure or very little leisure for relaxation eahear hie had refused the el livery of letters from frneon very different grounds and what he conldered very good grounds if letters from paris were delivered on the sunday how could ho well reforse the delivery of letters from all pam rtofthe country  hear

often in consequence felt a greater degree of hostility towards the individual whomn he had illtreated thani he had previously entertained he at tributed to that individual no imnproper motive and he was the less willing to notie the course he had taken because be was not present to defend himself it was possible and he hoped it might be so that mr vallace was only the dupe of designing persons
