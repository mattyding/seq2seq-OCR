telegraphic communication dated bavonne august  the insurgents are beaten along the whole line from the ist instant rodl has been attacking them with vigour we shal have the details this eveningour letter from bayonne says thst a train of artillery had left that place on the motning of the st for the frontier in consequence of orders received from paris and that another detachment from the same corps was about to follow our correspondent adds that the french government evidently intends assetmbling gradually an imposing force on the spanish line of frontier the french colonel st yow has

correspondenceparis tuesday aug the french papers continue to publish the most contrtdlc tory accounts relative to the civil war in the north of spaln those which arm devoted to the cause of the pretender talk of an army of  men under his rmctcdiste command and would bave us bellcve that nothing is more commnon in the revolted provinces than corps of  and  men under the dlflercnt carlist chiefs ail well armed well discplined and well provided in every respcct other papers evidently uuder the influence of speculators in the funds and speculna tors in the inancial neceastics of the spanish government are but too apt to give currency to end aid the bcltif lnevery contradictory statement as to victories gained or defeits sus tained which is sent forth at the bours with no other view than to raise or lower the value of spanish stock or the credit of the spanish governmet as  may sutt the ma nasuvres or intentions of the moment i would not ad vise your readers to attach any faith to the statements copied from the jourmals publisbed inr pais bordeaux an i bayonne the very telegraph itself is not at all times to he trusted for it frequently transmits reports which bave reached bayonne in a questionable vraythe carilsts affrm that notwithstansing the measurres taken on the french side of the frontier to prevent the impor tadon of arms into spain for the use of the insurgents thousands of muskets and all other kinds of arms go through evey day this is a fabricatonlike all the rest oftbe caritst news no arms have been sent over to the insurgente for a great length of ttme there are none in france to procure cor them nor have the catilsts money left wherewith to pur chase any the attempt to raise the wind made under the apecious pretext of a royal loan has most signally failed the zeal of the lenders has not gone to the length of a sa crifice in any instance every one having refused to advance a franc whec there ces ed to bo any security or prospect of reimbursemcntit is by this time qulite evident that the presecre of don carlos has neither extended the insurretion in spain nor evcn given a new impulse to those of his adherents who had bcen previously disposed to takeup arms not a singletown ias declared for the pretender and the fidelity of the go vemmens troops has remained unihaken it is important to notice this latter point for one of the celef hopes of don carlzs in procceding to spaln and of his fiecnds was that a complete defectlon among the governtment troops would take place so soon as it was ascertained that he was near the very mcn whoflock to his banner enaot be induced to remain the mny time as the following extract of a letter written by a french officer serving in one of the rebel corps will show  these men of navarre are as brave but more ro bust and active than our vendeanne they are not however as capable of persverance nor do they possess so much christian resignation it ls impossible to restrain them they are perpetually in a state of agitation which makes them run to opposite extremes in the space of a few hours they will soon be disgusted with all that they find here if a better use ia not made of their presence those among them who are in easy circumstunces with whom i have been able to converse do not scem to entertain very sanguine hopes as to the success of our armsnotwithstanding the unfavonreble prospects of the pre tendars cauc the civil war is likely fora lng time to con tinue in the northern provinces of spain caris and his tmen will be defeated whenever they shall choose to come out of their mountainous holds and face the government troops but theywill rcturn to tneir hidingplaces to rest and strngthen themselves again and they will carry on a guerlla warfare in the way they did during the war with napolcon and pretty much as the vendeans have done on this side the pyrences today the imoniteur tells us of a total defeat sustained bythe insurgents this may be but tomormw or soon after we habll probably be told of other engayements and other de feats which vill prove that a  total defeat of these rebels is not an annibuationthe rettlement of the julr account on

the garnblinghouses whose best customers desert them for tortonis and the bourethe jerman papers have for some time paet becn inform ing the world of the turkish sultans imperial condescension in appolnting a truly turkish and most purely mahometan ambassador to the ring of the french that pereonage has left constandnople on bis way to paris some inqui sittive people have taken the trouble to ask what could possibly be the object of his sublimity of turkey in thus honouring a giaotcr king with the presence of an extra ordinary ambassador that object it appeara from the result of the inquiry is nothing less than n claim to the sovereignty of algiers it would appear that the sultan is unwilling to let others enjoy that which he and some of his predecessors have shown themselves utterly unable to main tain it wllt bc curious to see what answer will be given by the french government to the application not that there can be any doubt as to its ultimate fallure for however useess the possesslon of algles may be to france at pesent the public voice ir most unanimously decided agaiast its abandonment but it would seem that the sultan had not made up his rmind to claim the restitution if he hbd not had good reason to be lieve that a desire exists somewhere that france sbould get rid of algiers but even if public opinion in france were in accordance with ruch o desire is it for the purpose of making algiers again what it was that it should be abandoned by the french  the sultan surely does not imagine that he would cause his nuthority to be acknowledged and obeyed at
