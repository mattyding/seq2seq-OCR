boxing at the nscdon siiortland beatena year or so ago donald shortland the young slheffield heavyweight who still is in his teens was regarded as a comung man perhaps even a second iron hague somehow or other however in spite of a trip to arnerica where he might have been expected to learn a good deal shortland joined no more formnidable a regiment of boxers than that vulgarly known as the  might have beens and it cannot be said that his reappearance at the national sporting club last night did very much to alter that inpressionagainst salvatore ruggirello a magnifi cently built man but still a complete novice shortland at best kept his opponent at bay with a flabby straight left and occasionally startled him as he came in by means of a right cross at his worst he was flatfooted and without a trace of boxing intelligence unless holding be regarded as an intelligent thing in adversity admittedly shortlands supporters claimed that their man was unfit through an attack of cold that had kept him out of train ing for four days more than four days how ever and mnuch more actual ring experience than shortland so far has obtained would have been required to send him fighting fit into the rinig against ruggirello bombardier wells administered some advice about half way through the contest and it may have been this that extracted from shortland three or four right crosses and one or two stinging left stops to the mouth and jaw but just as the hefty young yorkshireman seemed to be hurt ing as well as worrying his easilv puzzled oppo nent his lack of physical fitnoess told heavily against him at any rate ruggirello reawoke to hope and clumsy activity and the referees decision in his favour was no more than the correct thingshortands passivity of imb and funereal rate of thinking very nearly brought about his downfau in the first round when ruggirello stepped in and comfortably landed a telling left hook ta the jaw this blow was a good one and it was followed up by some hard if less well timed and placed rights but shortland took a couple of counts so levelheadedly and then stood away so steadily that suddenly the italian seemed to lose all his confidence cer tainly ruggirello had no sort of idea how to rush in without at the same time entanigling his facand the various projections there fromin the glove that covered the limp left band of an extended but obviously unstiffened left arm nor at the pushings and wrestlings and neck pattings that had to pass for in fighting was ruggireuo for all his strength any more happy indeed he grew so flustered and wild that shortland could not and did not fail to find some of the blows that once made him look such a promising boxerone or two of the sheffield boxers straight lefts jarred and whenafter wellss first in tervention at the end of round sixhe also ventured upon a right cross as ruggirello came in the fight looked to be taking a very different course it can only be repeated however that shortlands improvement fizzled out as he grew tired and he was lucky that the italian also had not improved in the meantime for there were chances galore for the latter to have landed the knockout blow
