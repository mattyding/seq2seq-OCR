deficit on germanbudget new taxationproposalsfrom our own corpespondent iberlin jan the cabinet met this afternoon to examine the  budget and consider the proposals of herr hilferding the socialist minister of finance for cover ing the deficit of  marks £ with which he is known to be confronted at the present stage herr miuller the chancellor who has recovered from his slight attack of influenza re turned from the black forest to preside as the question has become urgent and the parliamentary parties are showing marked signs of restivenesst he budget is usually presented to the reichsrat before christmas so that the reichstag can set to work on it immedi ately after the recess and pass it by april m accordance with the constitution the delay this time seems to have been due to a very natural disinclination to plunge into an awkward situation herr hil ferding has not found his task any easir than his bourgeois predecessors he boldly reduced the wages tax on small in comes an alleviation which his party ex pected as one of the rewards of assumning office he has now to find the additional contribution from the reich budget to bring the reparation annuity for the first time up to the standard level r and he is deprived of certain temporary revenues and reserves which assisted his predecessorsdrastic reductions of certain departmental expenditures might be undertaken by an en tirely socialist government but with four other government parties keeping a watchful eye on their favourite departments economies have to be effected with caution by careful cutting in the reichswehr and communica tions estimates the deficit has been reduced from  to  marks but at that figure it has stayed it is known that the budget as now drafted balances at about  marks ruo assuming the  marks deficit to be made up all that llerr hilferding proposes to cover the deflcit by increasing the beer tax so as to obtainthe figures are only rough cal culationsan additional  marks  the spirits duty so as to obtain  marks zoo and the pro perty tax so as to obtain  marks £ it is also proposed to tighten up the death duties in order to obtain an extra  marks £ revenue the first year and more later the post offlce which has been doing well is expected to con tribute  marks instead of  marks to the revenues of the reich these measures are expected to make up some  marks and it is proposed to take the last  out of the re venues collected by the reich and shared pro portionately with the states and municipali ties there is very strong opposition among the states to the revision of the distribution scheme so ardently advocated by mr parker gilbert agentgeneral for reparation pay ments in his reports it is suggested there fore that the present percentage basis shall be maintained but that the reich which normally retais  per cent of these revenues shall deduct an extra  marks before distributionmrnere are two possible ways of getting these measures pawsed the cabinet can go ahead and hope to pass them with the aid of different party combinations according to their social charactera haphazard planor it can endeavour to achieve a compromise among the parties represented in it which would probably mean facing the coalition problem squarely there is no doubt that for general political reasons ministers especially those upon w hom the greatest responsibility rests would rather not face the coalition problem now there are other serious differ ences among the parties concerned besides taxation as dr kaas the centre leader recenuy indicated an unsuccessful attem t to consolidate the government parties would result in a crisis which is the last thing any body wants while the committee of experts is at work this view is well expressed by the leipziger neueste nachrichten which con tends that the cabinet is stronger now with out being bound closely to the parties than it would be otherwise the newspaper sug gests that the cabinet should be given a further respite at any rate until the socialist congress of march  has cleared the airthe press as a whole however is full of demands for the coalition negotiations to be opened so that there may be a stronger government when the recommendations of the committee of experts have to be considered the strongest pressure comes from the german peoples party and the centre political prophecy is dangerous in germany no less than elsewhere but the probabilities are to judge by the ordinary course of ger man politics that the budget will be balanced and passed without an upheaval and as the present government pal ties are generally ad mitted to be the only possible combination in the present reichstag passed mainly by them either as a formal coalition or a loose working majority
