the engineeringindustrywages ratessectional or nationalclaimsfrom ouir labour correspondentiiather more than a month will elapse before the unions in the engineering in dustry will collectively face the issue of sectional as distinguished from national claims for wage advances the executives of the unions are at present independently considering the matter they will pre sumably have reached their separate con clusions by the time they meet together at the end of next month to take a deci sion they have before them the report of a special committee whieh is not avail able to the publicmr w sherwood presidenit of the federa tion of engineering and shipbuilding trades said yesterday that the report contains a mass of information to guide the unions in their future wage policy it is at present strictly private and confidential and has been issued only to the executives of the various unions with a special request to the secre taries that they will preserve its secrecy until after the conference the report as it stands in draft form may be revised and modified after considering it the unions will decide whether they will go forwvard with another national claim or endeavour to obtain ad vances in certain of the more prosperous sec tions of the industry which will represent a new policy in negotiationsbalancing of intereststhe decision of the umionsabout  are concernedwill depend upon a balancing of interests and a calculation of advantages the special conumittee is reported to have forned the opinion that some sections of the industry are in a position to pay higher rates of wages than those in force particular reference is made to motor and electrical engineering the unions say that the average wage of a skilled engineer is less than Â£ a week that is correct as a statement of the average time rates it does not purport to be a statement of earnings based upon piece rates but the fact that piece rates make the earnings of a majority of skilled engineers considerably higher than the weekly wage rates would nct of itself be of much im portance in relation to the suggestion of sec tional wage applications were it not that the piece rates are most common in those sections of the inidustry which are the more prosperous and that at all events in some of those sec tions the unions are less strong than else where so it may be found tbat in the branches of the ildustry which the unions decide are able to pay higher wage rates higher wages due to piece work are in fact being paid and that the unions are less well able there because of their weaker organization to carry tlrough a sufnlciently strong wages movementother matters have also to be taken into account the unions have to consider for example whether varying wage rates will not cause internal trouble in their ranks if the policy of sectional advances were accepted by the union executives and also by the employers it might follow that men working for the same firm and in the same locality anid doing similar work but for another department of the industry would receive different rates of pay the uniions have to contemplate the possibility of discontent due to this cause moreover they have to bear in mind that it would finallv rest with the organized employers and not with themselves to decide whether sectional applications should super sede national negotiations without a strugglean imiportant principleif it were possible to prevail upon a section of the employersin the motor section of the industry for exampleto enter upon separate negotiations without reference to other em ployers an important principle would have been conceded there might even then be un welcome reactions in other sections of the industry where it might be contended by the employers that the continued depression does not warrant the current wage rates all wage rates might go into the meltingpot or again the employers might set themselves unitedly in array against sectional advances as they did three years ago vheu with prac tical unanimity the federated associations re solved that any action by the unions as a body or by any union or unions for the pur pose of enforcing an advanice in wages either nationally locally or sectionally    be resisted to the fullest extent even if necessary by a lockout of the members of the union or uniionis concerned at that time the executives of the unions were themselves unconvinced of the wisdom of changing the procedure from national to district or sectional negotiations and the warning of the employers left only one decision possible
