imperial and foreignnewsllarvesters incanadaa farmers diaryin view of the decision of the canadian immigration authorities to reduce the number of immigrants from southern europe during this year and of the creation of five new training camps for oversea settlers the following extract fromn the diary of a canadian farner who employed a british immigrant miner as har vester last season throws valuable light on the attitude of the older settlers to the new type of employeehavilg heard that  unemployed british miners were being sent to help with the harvest i decided to help by keeping a job open for one of them wrote august  to employment offices saskatoon to send me one of these har vesters offered standard wage  a day and if man proves capable would give him work threshing at going wagemet train three nights running no man came already had one man experienced hired and could get lots of good men but am holding job open for one of these britishers phone message saturday th from employment offce do i still wvant one of these men  didnt care iimuch wvhether i got one or not but told them to send him alongman arrived saturday night sent him home in the car did not see man myself again until sunday morning he was a scotsman from the clyde had not been at our place an hour before he started to grumble about this country it wasnt what he had expected said that foreigners were preferred to the britishon sunday had a talk with the man who reeated his complaints of night be fore hve said that they were told in the old country that there was lots of work out here for harvest and that farmers ould pay them £ or more a week and that now they are here they are being offered low wages while foreigners are getting the high wages asked him on what grounds he placed his complaint tod hnm i was offering hun  the same wage i was paying may other man who was a utkrainian boy experienced and able to take hold of anything on the farm and incidentally wortlh to me more than this scot he admlitted then that he had no personal cause for complaint but was going by what he read in the papers out here this man was only a few days in the west and ready to find fault with everything it is no good bringing these xeople out here in mobs they are like a bunch of sheep and need to be hereicd like sarne and taken care of told him that if he came out here by himself he would find things different and much easier to get work but he must be pre pared to get experience before he got the highl wage farmners out here were not going to fall on their necks and kiss them and pay themn wages that they couldnt earn just because they were british a mian out here i told him is judged by his ability not by his nationality all things being equal we prefer the british other uwise it is the man that couints herea bad startstarted man to stook on alonday at  am asked him at noon how he was making out  he said he was pretty tired and legweary so told him the first ten niles was always the hardest and that it would come easier after a few daystuesday night asked man how he feltsaid he was pretty tired  told him to stick it hard work alwavs made one tired wednesday night introduced man to locil bank manager who was also a britishor from manchester he asked man how ht liked the country  he the man said not very much from first impressions but a little better now  bank manager told himu canada was all right for any man that was wiling to work and learnasked my son how the scot was making out stooking he said he was awful slow and not worth half of the other man  told my boy to have a little patience and giv the man a chance he said that was all right but if these chaps expected experi enced mensvwages they should at least earn thern by doing the saine work he said it wasnt business to pay a man more than he was worth just because he happened to be from the british isles if one man could work he didnt see why another able bodied man couldnt do the same after a few days hardening i guess the lads right but i want to give this man a chance isy boy suggested that we teach this chap to handle a team by putting hin at chores so as to give him a chance to go threshing but not pay him harvest wages for it i guess this would be a fine thing for the man if he only knew it but if i made this offer to him he would tlhink i was trying to beat down his wagesi am worried about this chap i want to help him out i am as anxious to se snore british come to this country as any one he seems to be willing enough and a big strong fellow but does not seem to be abla to stand up under the work i know that he is inexperienced which makes stooking harder for him than the experienced man right there lies the whole trouble witlr these newcomers from home they are not willing to earn their experience thev expect to draw down the same wage as a man who has been out here for years andi when a farmer objects to pay them at first more than they are worth to him thev have a grievance right away and say that they are not wanted here and are beiag inposed uponthe wage questionwhy should a farmer any more than any other employer pay an inefficient main more than lie is worth  we do wvant these britishers out here but why do they not think of getting experience first before hiigh wages  there is a lot of good material among these men that wrould go to the making of firstclass settlers but they have to work and earn the good things that this country has to offer thezn just as we fellowcountrvriievl of theirs had to do in pioneering days or the past quarter of a centuryfriday night after he hiad had five days at the work i asked this lad whether it was getting any easier for him  he said not uiuch mry son asked hlim to try to speed up a little on saturday rrmorn as the other stooker was getting away ahead of him i suppose the lad i was doing his best but he just didnt have it in himn he told me at noon that lie would have to quit as he didnt iike the work and it was too hard for hin i told him that there were tens of thousands of men doing that work in the harvest fields of the west surely tie wasnt going to lie down and give up i asked him to try it for a few davs longer i was wilhng to keep him and put him at another job in a day or so not because i needed wim so much but to help him to get a footing in the land but he had made up his mind to qutt so i paid him off at noon and took nirun to the train i paid him the same wagess mny other man was gettinghis chequewas  £ s d for j days work so he had no kick coming he thanked me for the patience i had with him and said he would go back to the old country this fall i asked him to be fair and not to knock this country when he got home just because he found he wasnt suiteti to it i told him that if he thought i had been decent to hirn he would find if he stayed here that the people of this country as a whole were just as decent to a newcomer all they asked of a man here was a spirit of perseverance a wfillingness to work and accept the con ditions here without grousing a man who would take this attitude and who would be willing to work for a year sav on probation as it were and not think of high wages only but to make that a secondary consideration to the gaining ot experience would have no difficulty in getting a place the year round and some reasonable return for his labour by doing this he would get valuable experi ence and the second year could demand all that was going
