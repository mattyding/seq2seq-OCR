offje except on certain terms thtis article explaine hiow after tmuch heartsearching and discussion haidane and grey after au found themnselves the one at the war offce tle other at the foreign officeworld copyright reservedas there has been niuch innocent misrepre sentation of what really happened in this week i think it worth while to reproduce a mxemorandumn about its events which i dictated shortly afterwards to lady homer during a visit to afells in  eor as will appear from its terms it was really she who mainly influenced me to the reconsideration of the decision of grey and myself not to join the new governmnentthe menorandumi want to recall to you in their sequence the events of the early days of december  while they are still fresh in my menory i knew early from arthur balfour that he meant to resign and i asked edward grey to come up at once and work out with me a joint course of action hie came about the last day of november as you know he and asquith and i had decided in the autumnn that we would act together and stand out jointly for certain thinigs mwe agreed that sir h cb ought to go to the lords as prime minister because especially from the point of view of foreign affairs anid also of coming rapidly to firm and quick decisions on current business in the house of comrnons we felt that this was very important to the success of a free trade ministry  the second pointwilicki we held essential was that the foreign office should ho in the hainds not of lord spencer but of grey this became easier to accomplish becauso of poor lord spelncers sudden illness the third was that the office of lord chancellor should receive a larger interpretation than it had in the past in pouit of influence on colonial and general policy and also that it should be filled bv some one who would genuinely represent greys views in the upper house he and asquith expressed their determination that it should be filled by myself rosebery appeared to have effaoed himself but we thought that wvith these points conceded we could usefully enter the ministry and really adld to the foundations on which a free trade inistry could be buil tat isquiti s request i had conimulicated our agreement to the king and had been summoned to balmoral where the king had intimated his worm approval of it this took place in october  in the end of november i asked grey as i have said to come to london and statwvith me wve determiined that the policv so laid clowin was vital and that each of u three must make it a condition of enteriing the covernmnent that these points must be con cedled we had been in conlmuiicatioll witl sir h cb throtugh asquith w ho had more or less passedl on the substance of them to him before the actual fall of the government in the end of november the government went out and sir h cb was sent for crey returned to fallodon and came up again on the morning of monday decemher  i think it was sunday the rd that sir h cb went to the palace and received his commission so far as i knotv the kinig said nothling of our commxunication witlh him to sir h cb early in the week it was obvious that things were not going satisfactorily asquith had done his very best about the chancellorship but to tlat standing by itself and apart fromxsu concession ot the other two points grey and i attached but little importance and it was evident that asquith lhad not been resolute about the solidity of our position in the end and about the middle of the week it appeared that he had yielded and was prepared in re sponse to sir h cbs appeal to enter his ministry in aniy event it was also evident that the lord chancellor would be sir r lueitl it was not eertain whether sir h cbould go to the house of lords or not up till wvednesday niglht it seemed not improbable that he would yield on this but on that evening lady cb arrived from scotland and the next morninlg he resolutely refused to goasquithl was now pledged to enter and all he could do was to fight bard for the inclusion of grey and myself it was certain that sir h cb wanited crey to come to the foreign office and was willing that i should occupy the home office the colonial office was already given to lord egin to whom i think he had at first offered the foreigni office before his mmid turned to grey but the attitude both of grey and myself was sir r cbs difficulty asquith had gone to stav at hatfield and we were not seelng very much of hinm ve both felt that the breakuip of the old tripartite arrangement diminislied our powers of useful ness we thought that the rmajority mighb be a weak and incohesive one anid that it vas better that reserves for the defences of free trade should be kept in hand consequentlv on thursday the th grey had definitely refused to eniter the government i had defi nitely lecided that tuider no circumstances would i enter without him and up to the afternoon of that day no direct or definite invitation to enter the government had been given to me personallyoffer of officeat  oclock that day i was presidillg at south keensington over a meeting of the committee on technical education of which i was chairman when twvo messengers arrived with letters from sir h cil and from asquith sir h cbs letter proposed to me to join his govermluent if i didl iot wisli for the attorneygeneralship he had otijer proposals to malke to me involving cabinet rank asquiths letter presed o to take the war ofiee i had once in conversation saidl to him that that was the only office apart perhaps from the colonial office with the exception of the lord chancel lorship that attracted me i put the letters in my pocket and presided to the end of the meeting i regarded the matter as finished greys decision while it stood and i thought it would and ought to stand bound me i had to see him before dinner at whitehall court and we were to dinie alone together but i did not anticipate any change on the part of either of us on my way home irwoppea at i muckingham gate and asked if you were in mrs crawshay and mrs hope were with you but they left alrnost immediately and we went downstairs to the schoolroom i then showed you the letters i told you that in my view the thing was now settled adversely and that it was best so after a little reflection you made an observation it was this  from your own point of iew antd that of grey this may be right but you told tho king that you would not leavo him in the urchi besides this you are making a real risk for the free trade cause there may be a very heavy reaction against the weak governumernt which is going to be formed in whichi said to gxey that as a matter of inclination as well as the result of his own decision i was going to refuse the office for which i seemed to myself to be mnost ready was the chancellorship moreover to talce office at au meant an enormous loss of income i was making between £ and £ a year at the bar i said to him that one doubt atnd one doubt only had coriie into nmy mind looked at as a matter of individual convenience the decision seemed to me unquesticnable was it quite so clear from an ethical standpoint that we hiad quite fully coisidered the necessities of the king and the nation  it wasnow about  oclockand we had promised to call on acland at about halfpast  grey gave hig answerto these fresh points but he was obviouly troubled and he isaid i let us walk to aclands rooms hnd congider as we go along he added  youare not as blear as you were that we are right i rqplied that i was as clear as evef from a personal point mly doubt was whether we had sufliciently considered the ethical question i told him i had comne to no conclusion but that i doubted whetlher we had exhausted the question and whether the only tenable grounid from an ethical point of view namely the desire to keep a second line of defence for free trade was sufficiently substantial he turnedto me as we walked and said  you are putting on me a responsibility whichl i cannot bearthat of making you take a decision the moral correctness of which you doubt i said to hiizz that was inevitable there could be no question of either of us entering without the otlher he was much troubled i think he felt that we were acting somewhat selfishly the tripartite policy had been shattered through no fault of ours and what right had we to adhere to a line of action which was only a means to an cnd now gone  he was very silentthe settlementas we entered aclands door i said to him that my doubts were certainly not less strong than wlhen we had begun to talk he looked very unhappy acland kept us for threequarters of an lhour he potured into us arguments about destroying the prospects of the liberal party to whviel we both listened without replying    doubtless his nmoral earnestness helped but the real determining cause of the change of view bertainly on my part and i thiink on greys also was tthe new light that had come in the previous hour of mental wrestling and the searchings that arose in my own mind from the talk in the selhoolrooin at buekingham gate grey felt the change and i felt it and the last tinie i saw lady grey before her death a few weeks later she said to me that i hlad saved edward from falling into a moral blunder wliiuh she herself had notrealized to go on wvith the story after listening in silence to aclanid grey said  ai anot talk more without food and he andl i wvent off to thle cafe royal where wvo ordered dinner in a private roon whell wve had finished some fish we deciled thtat the fact that he lhad detinitely and finhaly rejeoted cbs offer ill a letter that afternoon could indeed make a e hange of attitule disagree able but could not alter the moral obligation he turnied to me and said  you may do w hat you please i answeredl that  wtould ro there and then to sir h cb grey said  if weenter it is not for pleasures sake and we must take the most beastly things i will take the nwar omice i said the public interest demanded that he should take the foreign oilice and i would ask for the wvar office i went to sir h cb told him i had come to answer his letter that j vould take one office the wvar ofliceon condition that grey went to th foreign office he said grey had refused in a manner that left him no hope i replied that if he as willing to leave to me the conveying to grey of a renewed offer it was within possibilitv tihat he might hear by ten oclock the next morninig from greypersonaiy that we had hoth acceptcdle was very easy and pleasant to deal with and thoroughly dignified i went to aclandls rooms where grey presently joined me and told him it was settled and acland doubtless thinks that it was he who settled it but i wishi to place on record in case it is ever of interest in the future that i think that so far as grey was concerned the cause of the with drawal of his refusal was almost if not quite wholly due to what passed between him and me and last that my own changed attitude was wholly due to whlat had passed between you and me pre viously in the schoolroom at buckingham gatethe whole week was one of the most miserable i have ever spent in my life the one illumninating hour in it was that of our talk and the new light that came i have never for a moment regretted the consequent decision or the vast change which your influence made in the course of my careerrend of alemorandumlthe new government was quickly formed we went together to the palace to receive our seals it was a dav of the blackest fog that i remember when the ceremony was over we set off with our seals to our respective offices by trudging through the mutd and feeling among the horses heads i at last got to the war oflice then in pall mall for tinately i had kept hold of my seals i was a little exhausted when i arrived i handed the seals to the permanent undersecretary to take charge of and asked the tall exguards soldier in attendanice for a glass of water cer tainly sir irish or scotch to be conliinuedthe first article appeared in tle timeees of yesterdayfree trade will perish you added that from the point of view of personal corfort the case was clear enough but that about the question of duty you were not so clear in your mind our talk made a geat impression on me i said to youow can one join a government which is almost bound to be weak and discredited from the beginning   you answered the better for you to be a member of itthe worse for the king and thim public who cannot escape from it i left you and went down to whitehall court i found grey lying on a sofa in the library i told him of the letters i said that i was going to refuse that i was clear i could not go on in view of his decisionwe must stand and fall together whatever happened this was your own view as well as mine
