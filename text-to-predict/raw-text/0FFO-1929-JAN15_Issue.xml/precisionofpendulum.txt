precision of pendulumobservationswiireless assistancecolonel sir gerald lenoxconynghm at a meeting of the royal tieographical society yesterday described the cambridge pendulum aipparatus which ho said originated in his desire to have an apparatus and set of pendulums made in this eountrv which should embody some ideas that had arisen out of his experience with the apparatus now more utan a quarter of a century old which he had used in indiahe was engaged on the design of such an apparatus when dr veningmeinesz published his accoint of the method that he had devised to meet the peculiar difficulties presented bv the instability of the ground over a large part of the west of holland this publication ug geste a revision of the design he had been nmsking and the cambridge apparatus was the result of that revision he took his general ideas to the cambridge instrumeut companv and it was they vho brought it to fruition the late sir horace darwin devoted much thought to the apparatus aud many of its parts were specially designed by himthe lecturer dealt with the problems vwhich pendulum observations were intended to slve and concluded by saying that the four cor rections to the observed time of swing temperature density arc swayshould not either separately or in combination produce any appreciable error and he hoped that the stability of the pendulums would prove satis factory the sbortt clock at greenwich had done much in providing clock seconds which varied only inflnitesimally from true seconds wireless bad done much in disseminating knowledge of the exact time at one of tbe meetings for the discussion of geophysical sub jects held last year at the rooms of the royal astronomical society it was suggested by mr hinks that it might be possible to develop such a system of cooperation between the tshortt clock and the wireless emission using short waves perhaps as to enable anvone inthe british isles at any moment to  listen in to the beais of the clock and so to measure any interval with which he wvas concerned in true seconds if ever this became possible the precision of pendulum observations would niake a great advauce
