appeared for the appellant mr norman birkett kc and air harold murphy for the respondentscomplicated factsmr foomjosos in opening the appeal said that the facts were complicated but it would not be necessary to go into the whole of the matiers discussed at the trial it was said against the defendant that being a solicitor acting for the plaintiffs he had re ceived sums of money which had come from the managing director that he knew that mr fenton was overdrawn in account with the plaintiffs and that those moneys had been applied by mr fenton to his private purposes further that mr fenton had no authority to draw on the funds of the company and therefore that the money received in that way by the defendant had been improperly paid away the claim on that head amounted to £secondly it was said that moneys had been paid which were in the firms hands as solicitors for the plaintiffs to the national bank for a debt of £ which on the face of it was the debt of mr fenton and the question was whether those payments could be jnstifled thirdly it was said that three payments amounting to £ had been similarly made to three different parties and the question was whether the defendant had notice or knowledge that those payments were not in re tpect of debts due from the plaintiffs and fourthly there was a claim in respect of £ which was on a very special footingit was said that the defendant as solicitor owed a special duty to safeguard the plaintifl interests anid to see that the funds of the plaintiffs were not used for unauthorized pur poses anid that ho had been guilty of negligenceapparently mr fenton thought that at the end of the war the golden age had arrived and tlat everything would go up in price every nerve was strained to manufacture cloth and
