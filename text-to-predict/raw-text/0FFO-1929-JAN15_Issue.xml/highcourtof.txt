maclean from the union was purported to be carried out under rule  which prohibited the issue of circulars by members of the uiiuon unless they had first been approved the present rules of tbe union came into force in  the plaintiff who had been a candidate for the office of presi dent published an election address criticizing the actions of the executive committee and mr john beard the president and mr charles duncan mp the general secretary the view which he took was that his criticisms were necessary in the interestsof the members of the union he had himself been a member of the executive committee in  as the result of his criticisms he had been attacked by mr beard and mr dumcan in a manner which led to his failing to be elected to tne committee in the remuneration of the executive com mittee between  and  was involved in the controversymr c a bennett kc and mr b j c neep appeared for the plaintift sir henry slesser kc and mr howard wright for the defendant unionr bmnnerr  continuing his opening speech said that in january  a vote of censure passed hy the triernial conference of the union on mr maclean for misuse of the unions funds was submitted to the union for the approval of its members mr maclean was not heard but the ballot went against him and he resigned his seat he stood again for election and in february issued a circular in which he defended himself but made no attack on anybody it vas at that point that mr maclean believed that mr beard and mr diuncan were interfering bv giving false in formation to his opponent in the election to the committee and he then issued a circular attacking both mr beard and mr duncan mr maclean attended three meetings of dis trict commuittees in scotland in the course of a reply in one of his circulars to the oral statements which mr beard had made at those meetings mr maclean said that the rewrfinera tior which he drew was sanctioned by mr duncan and passed by the auditor having received that circular mr duncan wrote to the district organizer in glasgow who ad vised that mr maclean should be expelledl from the union as he seemed to be out to make troubletile resolution resclidedat a meeting of the executive committee on august  and  it was resolved that mr maclean should be fined s d and be sus pended from the union for one month and that his nomination for the presidency should not be allowed to stand that said counsel was an attempt to prevent mr maclean from standing for election as president which was quite outside the powers of the committee mir macleans legal advisers communicated with the general secretary calling attention to that fact and stating that an injunction would be apphed for to restrain the presi dential election unless mr mlacleans name was restored to the ballot paper the unions legal advisers were of the opinion that while the rule under which the union had acted was good the legal position of the union was bad as mr maclean had not been heard the resolution was therefore rescinded but the public bad come to know through a state ment in the glasgow evening times of mr macleans disqualinicatioianother executive committee meeting was held on september  and   and a draft letter to mr maclean was prepared in forming him that the committee would at its next meeting at which mrlaclean miglit attend consider the ques tion of his election address mr mfaclean replied that he would be unable to attend the meeting and drew the committees attention to various matters the date of the hearing was then fixed for september  on which day mr maclean attended at the unions office it was quite clear that the charge was preferred by the executive com mittee which sat in judgment on mr maclean the committee thereby put itself in the posi tion of being at once prosecutor and judge rule  contemplated that on a violation of rule  the branch of which the offender was a member should report the case to the executive committee otherwise the position arose that the persons preferring the charge were also judges of it which was a position the law lid not allowhis loardsalbut the branch only knows that it has received the circular it does not know it is not approved in the case forinstance of accountants using the word chartered without authorization nobody has ever sugested that the decision of the body is wrong which deals with it because some third prty does not bring tae charge it is the duty of the officers of the society to bring the eharge the committee here need not act judicially because the breach is admittedmr bisrnorrthen when it comes to excluding from membership i say that the executive who here have a judicial function cannot exclude the plaintiff from membership for sending out a circular if the circular is one in which their conduct is impugned they did not give reasons for their decisionhis lornsmena jury never doesyhe important question continued coun sel was what was the penalty to be imposed there wvas never any dispute that the circular had been sent out no one outside could know what the execu tive committee had taken into consideration before coming to the decision that mr maclean should be expelled the circular for distri buting which he was expelled waqs one reflect ing on the eiecutive committee it was im possible for the committee to inquire impar tially into tht particular offence see law v chartered institute of patent agents  rhe tnelr    ch  the question as to the circcilar was whether it was of such a character as to bias those who passed the resolution of expulsion the remuneration drawn by one of the members was found to be exactly what mr maclean had stated it to be and that fact might well bave caused that particular member consider able uneasiness as to his own position the facts submitted counsel brought the case within law v chartered institute of patent agents supa and the resolution could notstanslmr macraans evidencemr maclean in evidence said that the union had  members when he joined the executive in  he was told that like his pre decessor he would be paid lss wages and s hotel expenses for each day of his attendance on committee work up to five days with thiidclasa railway fare he pointed out that as an mp he had to be much in london they replied that they had nothing to do with that and the figures stood when there was an amalgamation with two other unions the re muneration was increased afterwards mir beard and mr duncan said that they thought there should be economies and he the wit ness then advocated economies in the re organization of the offlcesthe members of the committee proceeded to consider the reduction of their own re muneration and brought it down from £ s to £ is sd with s expensesin answer to his lordsnap the plaintiff said that what he objected to in mr beards letter of august   was the charge of  certain irregularities he also took exception to mr beards figures with regard to his the plain tiffs expenses those figures were calculated to mlslead the members of the unionhe was in no way responsible for the state ment about his disqualification for the presi dency of the union appearing in the glasgow evening timesthe
