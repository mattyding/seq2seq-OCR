were enforced the agency for entorcing them was obviously and rightly the polico with of course the overriding consideraidnxa that innocent persons shuld tot be wrongly convicted they protested against the idea that it was desirable or decessaryfor the protection of the lawabiding public to inpose onthe police detailed regula tions which would hinder them in a policy of enforcement of the lawin reply to the chua arnthe witness said the association engaged in welfare work and maintained a staff of womean woraers at the london railway stationsto giveassistance to girls arriving frop the continent and from wales and the norththe cuarmando you find that the p lice are entirely satisfactory frorn your point of view in the assistance  they give  you  absolutelymr sempkins said that  the protection nlready afforded the public by the supervision of silperior officers ofthe police of magistrates and of judges and juries was a sufficient safeguard against any generil or consistent abuse of power by the police no matter ho tighly restrictions were drawn it vwas practically impossibil to prevent isolated cases of mistaken judgment or wrong procedute there was also the press which was ce inly nqt backward in resenting any infwingeient of the rights of the publicit was tbe associations experience thlat womell p ice could be of great assistance there was acefor women police both with and without inorm the present uniform was nsuitable and required replacing with romething more attractivethe chansswcwhich are the more effectivewomen police in plain clothes or in uniformi should say in uniformmir sempkins emphasized the associations entire disagreement with the opinion which had been expressed before the commission ajs besore the treet offencescommittee that the police should not be used as a means of what was ealled enforcing morals that persons concerned with what was known as com nercialized immorality were frequently con cerned with other offences was a commonplace anything which tended to reduce recruits to the ranks of professionals in vice tended to reduce the recruits to professionals in crime it was therefore a police matter even in its early stagesarrest and searchconstable j i branthwaite wvho was accompanied by an inspector and a sergeant on taking the witness chair was greeted by lord lee of fareha with the remark i think we have met before laughter perhaps i should explain he added  that i was not in trouble constable branthwaite wvas onk the committee with hinm when they were looking into the question of police pay and pensonsthe witness said he wss a constable of tbe metropolitan police and was attached to the rd or devonport division and did dutv at devonport dockyard the federation was established by the police act  and embraced all the police forces of england and wvales the membership consisted of all ranks below that of superintendentconstable brantlhwaite stated that police officers generally well understood their powers and duties with regard to arrestitrbably lbetter than they had done at any time hitherto generally they exercised particular care to keep within these powers they wbuld on the whole refrain from making an arrest in cases where their powers and duties were not clear rather than expose tbemselves to the serious consequences of depriing the subject of his liberty without full and proper authority the police appre ciated the full importance of the rights and liberties of the subject and cases of unlawful arrest wvere very fewin tle opinion of the federation the public had a fair understanding of the powers and duties of the police with regard to arrest in cases of serious crinie with regard to other powers of arrest the public were not well inforrned tienerahy the public vere content to rely on the police exercising their powers and carrying out their duties regularly and properly though it happened occasionally that the power or the necessity to make an arrest was qtuestioned by members of the public on the other hand the public rmight sometimes expect an arrest where there was no power except by warrant the criminal classes had a xery good knowledge of the powers and duties of the police with regard to arrest as with arrest the police well understood their powers and duties with regard to searchthe chiairmaxis it not the case that in practice the police have to exceed their fixed legal powers of search and that that is tacitly accepted in courts of law yes it would be a great advantage if that cotld be regularizeddo you find that y ou are embarrassed in iuatters of search by an insuflicienev of strictly legal authority there is a certain embarrassment but w hether it is of sufticient consequence to warrant us asking for anv thing more i am not in a position to saythe judges ruleson the question of the observance of the judges rules the witness said it was the view of the federation that there was a certain ambiguity vith regard to rule  but the poice as a whole were inclined to accept jord brampton s ruling that an accused person should not be questioned on the charge against himthe chtirmae asked if the witness thought that in taking statements from accused persons undue pressure was sometimes exercised by police oflicers the witness replied in the negative and added that he could not suggest any better safeguards than existed at present it was not the case that the police were stiu influenced by the special powers given to them during the war the police were more careful now and were better trained and equippedthe zhaiamani suppose you will be glad when all these inquiries come to an end i do not think we have anything to fear from them if there is anything in the mind of the public so far as we are concerned we are prepared to answer it is only right and proper that we should do so we should be glad if it could be quite properly cleared upthe witness said there was no feeling in the police force as a whole that the inflltration of women into the force was an invasion of the rights of the menthe chaurirnts there any positive line taken by your federation with regard to the question of more or less women police  simnply that up to the present we have not experienced anything whiclh has shown them to be necessary fie added that they were not suited to ordinary patrol workthe federation were of opinion that the primarv luties of the policethe duties of the prevention and detection of crime and the apprehension of criminals and oftenders and the pfeservation of publie order in which force must rernain the ultimate argument were duties whichi women were neither phvsi cally nor temperamentally adlapted to perform sulitably or suecessfully the federation the witness added were of opinion tbat the police should have right of entry to clubsin reply to mr pijc constable branthwaite said the federation was in favour of the police carrying out all duties that could properly be given them including traffic and other muiscellaneous dutiesreplying to smb reognalid pooie he said that to some extent there was a dread of the witnessbox among the policetut riiqnald pooleis that because a man
