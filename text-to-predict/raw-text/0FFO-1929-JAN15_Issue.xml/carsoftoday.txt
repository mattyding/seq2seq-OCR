cars of todayhp buickby our motorlc correspondentin  the first buick coapmany was formed and  cars were turned out that year since then over  have been made the first had an overhead valve engine and this has always been retained the buick will still stand improvement in design especiady from a european staiid point but it has been tiuch hiproved durig he last year the machine submitted for test was a fiveseated twodoor saloon both the front seats can be slid forward easily by side handles to give reasonable entrance to the back the front seats are also adjustablc there are four le windows the two rear glasses can be let down halfway by the side of the steering column there isa combined steerlng and ignition lock while the linger controls on the top of the wheel and the instrument panel are tily ventilators are fitted either side of the scuttle tools are in a box in the nearside running board there is a folding ard at the rear of the car the spare rim and  by o tire are stored forward of the near side door and the battery is under the off de front floorboard with the pedal brake rod passing over the top of it the floorboards should be made to come out easilythe bcylinder engine is of  andi  emrm bore and stroke and is thus just under utres capacity it is stated to give off   hn on the brake at  rpm the crankshaft rnus in four bearmngs and there is a balaner on the near side there are the inlet aner exhaust manifolds the nuts holding them to the cylinder head are sufficiently accessible the inlet has three branches and the chamber is heated by the exhaust im accoance with the tbrottle opening the degree of heat can also be varied by hand froui the instrument board there are six branclebe to the exhaust manifold and a fornvard pipe connexion the two carburettor adjustments are to hand and there is an exteral petrol pump wvhich is driven across the inside of the crankcase from the back end of the camshaft alongside the pump is a glass bowl filter  the carburettor has an air cleaner attached to it the back petrol tank holds  gallons andalthough there is no strainer in the mouth of the flller the fluer is well to the side andso free of luggage there is a petrol gauge on the instrument board the crankease is properly ventitated and there is a funuel for the air to enter just behind the fau towards the back of the enginc there is an air futer for the system the exit for the air is towards the ground and below the engine shieldthe tilm radiator of honeycomb appear atnce in front and behind is carried in a shell which is chromium plated outside like other external bright parts on the car there is a tap to drain the water in the top of the radiator there is a thermostat to govern the circulation and tle fanbelt is not bard to tighten the grease cup for the clutch thrust race can be reached from under the bonnet the push rods which work the overhead rockers and valves are on the off side of the engie and rightly have return springs at their bases the valves have double springs and there is forced lubrication throughout the engine the overhead valve design of buick ears has always struck me as simple and con ducive to quietness alteration of clearance between rocker and valve stem is made above the push rod end of each rocker the whole of the valve mechanism is enclosed by a cover held by three hand nuts the sparking plugs and their connexions are neatly encased timing is by gear and aft of the easing is the generator and tandemdriven waterpumup a coil is to hand on the top of the generator and just towvards the end of the generator are the verticallydtiven distributor and makeand break these parts are as accessible as they could be the pump too is getatable drainage of the sump entails taking out a plug in the bottom of the base but a large circular external filter is fixed to the dash on the off side steering is by worm and nut the starter uuskt be removed from below after the shield has been detachedlngine clutch and gearbox aro carried on three points with rubber the multiple disc dryplate clutch has ten facings and the driving plates are formned with waves so that gradual contact may asihy be obtained the pedal travel can be adjusted by hand the greaser for the pedal shaft is rather tucked away the gearboy has three forvard speeds and a central flexible lever with a nearside level fqler the lever is sprung in neutral the propeller shaft is enclosed and there aro straight stays to the back axlc ilere the casing is of convenient banjo shalc ilual drive is by spiral bevel and thc asle is three quarter tloating a small level plug iu the back cover plate is the only means forreplen ishing the springs in front are halfelliptical they have a little camber there are stops at the back the rear spriugs are of cantilever type are shackled in front made to swivel at their central anchorages and are held behind the anchorage allows a much longer section of the spring in front than at the rear a battery of grease valves either side of the chassis can be got at by moving a trap in each valance hydraulic snubbers are fitted a central hand lever expands shoes in the back drumskor the fourwrheel brakes contracting bands have been kept rods are used for tbe application of all the brakes except for a short length of cable for each front brake there is the usu adjustment on each band the gear ratios are   and  to  the wheelbase is ft in the track ft in and ground clearance under the rear and front axles ciu and gin this saloon costs Â£ual  i r ktadi found the front seats
