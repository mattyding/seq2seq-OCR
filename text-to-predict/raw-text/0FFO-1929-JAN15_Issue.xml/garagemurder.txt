deceased i shall adjourn to a date to be decided upon later so as to give ample opportunity for the necessary comple tion of the investigationscoroner and  theoriesi need hardly tell you that i do not want you in the meantime to form any theories either newspaper or otherwise about the cause of death and the reason i enjoin you in this respect is because it is my experience that when theories are formed in peoples minds they do not always pay the attention that they should towasx the evidence which is given on oath at such proceedings as these we shall have to establish the cause of death to your satisfaction and although there must be some little difficulty in esta blishing identity in the ordinary way because the body was found some time after death had taken place and the features were not quite recognizable i think we shall satisfy you as to the identitymr albert s h parrott of carltonroad southampton a sports buyer said that mr vivian messiter was his late lodger the witness
