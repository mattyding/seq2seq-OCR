possessionin september the brolpers were in possession for the rent of the flat and these eventually the defendant paid out ile had varied the allowance from time to time and after march  reduced it to � per week ile did not pay the rent due at christmas  nor in march and june  and the piaintiff had to pay it herself after the brokers had again enteredthe plaintiff examined by mr hlogg bore out the above statements she said that her husband left her in  and was now living with another woman he refused to come back as he said he was madly in love with this woman she sent him every thing he asked for in the etter her husband had served her with a petition in the divorce courtin crossexamination bv mr iiealy the wvitness said she had consulted mr arthur newton who was one of the trustees of her marriage settlement she had not writteu the ietter of septkmber  under legal advice she had had tbree firms of solicitors in this matter she considered she ought to have � a year as her husbands incomc was � a vearin answer to his lordsurp the witness said that when she telephoned her husband in answer to the letter of dcember  she was so brokenhearted at his refusal to return that she did not remember what happenedln reexamination the witness said she saw mr newton in january  with reference to her husbands intentionstar defscemr heany on behalf of the defendant contended that there was no evidence of any contract and no consideration and if there was one it had been repudiated by the plaintiff the action was in no  sense a bona ftde one but brought in view of thedivorce proceedings now pending during the time when it was suggested that the plaintiff was in straits � was paid into her account and the jewelry she had sold was worth some � she lived in a flat rented at � a year if she was in want she could apply for alimony which considering her husbands position would be a considerable sumthe reason why the defendant had cut down the allowance to � a week was because his wife was living in an unnecessarily extravagant way and n order to prevent her from continuing to do so the defendant was most attached to his wife when he left her sad it was not too much to say that he was so still he left her on christmas eve which was a rather pathetic circurastance because she had been away for two nights it appeared that she sent him some christmas message which he did not get im mediately on receiving it two days later he was touched and in the fulness of his heart wrote the letter of december  it was not a contract no date of beginning or end to the allowance was fixedteni evrdeiscrmr hobson examined by mr hen said his wife had come to see him once since december  but did not mention the letter of december  it was untrue that she communicated with him on the tele phone in answer to it the jewels she had pawned were worth � the furniture was worth � he had reduced the allowance because she was so extravagant and gambled cambling kept her in straitsin crosexamination by mr roseixxes the wit ness said he was a land surveyor and financier another reason for reducing the allowance was because his wife was receiving money from other men it was true he was not doing very well but he would have been willing to make sacrifices he had written saying that he would have to make a rednution in consequence it was not true as his counsel had saidtthat he stwill had an affection for his wife he did not intend to make the letter of december  a contract though if his wife had accepted it he supposed it would have been one his wife had not complaiined to him as to his conduct witht a french lady they had spoken of her divorcing himr he desired it he had paid the brokers out on the second occauion without his wifes knowledge through a friend of hers in return he got the pawn tickets of the jewelsjunsrxnrmar junce bues in giving judgment saidthat the question depended on the view he tookof the letter of december  and of what happened afterwards the quastion was whether it was the offer of a contractnamely an offer to bind himself to do something it the plaintiff would bind herself to do something if it was only a statement of his present intention one would expect to find parts of it in definite and other parts in veryindefinite language it was hardly likely that a man would bind himself for all time regardless of his future pecuniaay position and aiso of the future conduct of his wife if an offer at all it was one to pay � for life and tle rent of the flat reading it a a whole lie did not think it was an offer or intended to be one but was only a stattement of present and to a limited extent of future intention but assuming the letter to bo an offer it would have to be accepted by the plaintill in order to constitute a contractthe plaintifts own evidence was that she tele phoned her husband and on his rcusal to come baclc was so brokenhearted that sho did not remem ber what happened afterwards thereforo she had not satisfied him that she acepted tlho ofrer the subsequent correspondenco and tho fact that tho defendant varied the allowanco from time to time showed that neither party thought they were bound by any contract there must be judgment for the defendant with coststhe learned judoe refused to certify for two counselsolieitorsbrandon and nichohlon arthur
