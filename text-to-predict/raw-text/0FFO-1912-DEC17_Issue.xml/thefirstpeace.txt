president ho left tle conference the delegates proceeded to discuss among themselves ques tions connected with the organization of the conference as wo were told by our constanti nople correspondent on saturday would be the case the turks raised no objection to the preenceo of the greeks in spite of their not having yot adhered to the armistice in some quarters it is feared that this question may be brought up when credentials come to be ex amined tlhis however seems unlikely as no exception ws taken yesterday to greek participation in the preliminary discussionsthe question of the presidency was sottled by the decision that the chief delegates should take the chair in rotation it was arranged that the first business meeting should bo held at  oclock this morning questions of organization were disposed of to general satisfac tion and the whole proceedigs were of a most amicable character after these prelimi nary matters had been settled all the delegates took luncheon together and turks bulgarians greeks servians and montenegrins engaged in general and friendly conaversationunfortunately while the proceedings at st jamess palace were marked by great cordiality telegrams from various capitals indicate the fear that the turks are not likely to conent to concesions such as the allies could accept and that a breakdown of the negotiations is more probable than notthe meetings of the ambassadors in london will be held in the cabinet room at the foreign office count mensdorff returned to london yesterday from vienna and there seems to be no reason for further delay it is hoped indeed that the fist meeting may be held todaythe effect that this prospect would otherwise have had in dissipating anxiety is weakened if not destroyed by the reports in the german preas and elsewhere of the austrohungarian military  precautions our vienna corre spondent speaks of them as being pushed forward on a scale and with an intensity explicable only by the assumption that the men responsible for the defence of the monarchy feel themselves bound to prepare for the gravest contingenciesthe telegrams from our correspondents wil be found on page tbhe conferenceproceedingsmhe first
