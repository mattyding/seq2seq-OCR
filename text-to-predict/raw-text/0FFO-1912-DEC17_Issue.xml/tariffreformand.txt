tariff reform antfood dutiesmr bonar laws policya conference with thedominionsfrom olr special cobrespondentashtonnunderlyne dec mir bonar law is always a welcome guest in lancashire not only does he represent a lancashire constituency but lie has never shirked tho difficulties which in the minds of many lancashire men are involved in the appli cation of the policy of tariff reform to the cotton trade it was widely believed that toniglht the unionist leader would deal with some of the most recent phases of the contro versy and an eager and expectant audience were not disappointed he was received with a ringing northcountry cheer when he was introduced to an audience of nearly  men who crowded tle theatre royal by sir max aitken the borough member for whom he found time to speak during his busy worth west manchester campaign at the last general electionmir bonar law opened his speech with a brief sketch of the parliamentary position and passed on to a consideration of what used to be known as the  condition of the people  question he combated the claim of his opponents that they had a monopoly of interest in social reform and insisted that the great problem for tho statesmen of our time would be to assist in some fairer method of dis tributing wealth without drying up the sources of wealth under present conditions the one way of achieving this was to raise the level of wages througlhout this countrythe reiteration of his conviction that the state could do something in this direction by giving us a fairer fiscal system brought mr law to the main part of his speechits tariff reform arguments and explanations ure first replied to lord crewes criticism of another of yr laws lancaahire speechesthat at oldhamin which he claimed equality of treat ment on the indian market he pointed out that the views he expressed at oldhain had been elaborated by him during his northwest manchester campaign and that they had been formed after consuhation wiith many anglo indians and with some indians still adhering to those views he was satisfied that his proposal was better for india than the present systemmr law went on to explain to a closely attentive audience the principles on which the unionist fiscal policy would proceed they did not propose to set up industries in this country to which it was not naturally suited they intended to impose duties smaller tlhan those in any other country in the world they did not intend to allow manufacturers to secure a monopoly all that they meant to do was to give to our own workmen a preference on their own home market which would enable thoem to compete better with their foreign rivals another side of their policy was to try to secure for our own people the largest possible amount of preference on the oversea mnarkets of the british empire these several definitions were shortly given and warmly endorseddies os foodmr law had been speaking with much the same rapidity which marks his utterance in the house of commons re became very deliberate when he came to his pronouncement on the question of food duties the unionist party had retaaned those duties because it was essential in their opinion that they should retain aad if they could increase the preference which we enjoyed in the dominions and because for nine years they had advocated preference as a step towards imperial unity speaking slowly and with great impressiveness mr law declared that if there was any sincerity in political life at all this was not the time and at all events he was not the man to haul down that flag the audience cheered wildly but became instaitly still as the policy was further developedif their countrymen entrusted them with power was mfr laws next declaration their policy was to call a conference of the colonies to consider the whole question of preferential trade and the question of whether or not food duties would be imposed would not arise until those negotiations were completed if it was true as they were told that the colonies did not wish for such an arrangement no food duties would be imposed in any cirumstances lie declared with some emphasis that they did not wish to impose them they were not pro posed for the sake of protection they were proposed solely for the sake of preference and unless the conference regarded them as essential for preference they would not be imposed all they asked was that their country men shiould give them authority to enter into that negotiation with power to impose certain low duties on foodstuffs which within strict limits would never be increased this passage in the speech culminated in the double pledge that long before the election came the people would know precisely witliin what limits they wanlted authority from them and that they would never be exceeded by them in any parliament until the express sanction of the people had been giventns refm mymmr law nexet came to the question which many among his audience must have been silently asking themselves for there was con siderable cheering when he put it since he had gone sd far why could he not say that afterthe completion of the negotiations the whole thing would be submitted to the country by a referendum  the sole reason why they objected to that course was that it would be unfair to the colonies they would be bound and we should go freethe peroration made an appeal beyond party to the ideal of imperial federation with an especially notable reference to mir lloyd george mr law spoke for an hour and a quarter and held the attention of the audience witlh every word of ani earnest and clearly planned speech which will be read with the deepest interest throughout the industrial north tomlorrow the meeting over a great crowd with a hundred torchbearers and a band formed up in procession and escorted mr bonar law in a motorcar to the railway stationthle speechmr bonar law having recalled that he had spoken for the chairman at the last general electioni saidin the eouse of commons we have been cngaged in discussingif you can call it discussiontwo billsthhe home rule bil and the welsh dis establishment bill i have had to speak so often and at such length both in the house of commons and out of it on the subject of home rule that i shall say nothing in regard to it tonight as regards the disestablishment bill for wales i shall say only this i am not as perhaps sonuc of you knowv a member of the church of england therefore whatever prejudices i have are not the prejudices ot a churchman if the unionist party were purely a church party there would be no room in it for me anxd more than that i believe that unlews we as a partycan secure the suppot of a section and a considesrabh section of tho nonconformist community in thlis country there must be something wrong in our policybuts though i am not a churchman i am fldly as hostile to that biu as any churchnarr can be i shall do myn utmost in every wvay in my power to prevent its being carried into law cheers i can understand the desire for religious equality i can understand too though i do not agree with it the desire for the disestablishment of the church in wvales but i canuot understand how any fair minded manat a time like this when every penny for religious objects is urgently needed whilen the free churchles themselves know they cannot obtain the funds necessary for their work except with endownmentscan take from a poor churcha chlurch which is poorer now while established tban the church of ireland after disestablishmenti cannot understarnd how any ono can tako those funds away and take them away in the nanae of religion cheers in my opinion it is a mean bill loud cheers and what happened on friday when the government was saved from defecat by the nationalist votewhea but for the nationalist voto thev vould have becn in a minority of something like shows clearly that if tlhe question of disestablishing the church were sub mitted to the people of this counltry it would be rejected bv au overwhelming majority cheersyour chainrnan has spoken of thc kind of life we now lead in the ihouse of comnmons tle govern ment has done away with the sccond chamnber and thev have destroyed the house of commons as a legislative assembly it has become an automnatic machine for registering the decrces and generauy the very illconsidered decrees of the cabinet of the day the machine is going at fuu pressure there is no time for anything except purely political objects except partisan objects wvhich are necessary to keep the coaition together and in their frantic haste to carry through measures which they know would be rejected if they were submitteil to the country thev have not an hour to spare for the great socisl needsi of this great conmunaity cheersocial rbeormyou have referred mr chairman to two bills the housing bill and the mental deficiency bill i have not examnlied the housing bill suflicientlyto be able to say that it would effect its purpose buti i can say that no one who is interested in the social conditions of the people of this country doubts that there is great need for housing roforrn and surely parliament might have spared a little time for the consideration of that subject the mental deficiency bill is in a stronger position every one recgi izes tbat the treatment of these who are maentally deficient is one of the great defects of onr organization and is one of the crying cas for reform the bilu has got through its prelhninary stages in the house of commons ami parties recognzc its value al parties nvould desire to see it pass yet not one single day can be spared to crry out this great reform sbwich woould boenefit all parts of the country i think that is the kind of pu rpose for which a gomnent ought to exist in my belief the main duty the greatest of all tre duties of statmen is to try to improve the social condition of tho mass oftshe people of thisgreat country who are the foundtion stne on m which  all society rests a grest grcek writer once said  it is men that make a city not walls nor things without mcn that is true and the greatness of a nation depends not upon tho nation but upoi tbe character of its people and character is impossible except amidst decent social surroundings yot know that our opponents claim a monopoly of interast in the condition of the people they say lhat re as a party are interested only in the rich ij the privileged i hae never been able to under stantd on what ground they make that elaiml it is net jstsified by history the earliest steps in the direction of social reform were taken by the tory party the flrst attempt and it was a sucocessful attempt was made to regulate the conditions of the employment of women and chiklren that attempt was supported with enthusiasm and conviction by disraeli cheers and it was opposed and bitterly opposed by cobden and bright in our own time the unionist party gave free education and they passed tho wvorkmens compensation actbut we are told the real difference betiveen the two parties is shown in regard to oldage pensions that we promised them for electioneering purposes and that our opponents granted them that is a i think less than justice to the unionist party and is grossly unjust to mr chamberlain cheers what are the facts  the chancellor of the exche quer acknowledged in the house of commons that oldage penisions had become a question of practical politics through the influence of mr chamberlain at the election of  it was mnade a part of the unionist programme after the election a committoe was appointed to inquire into it impressed by the difficulty that commnittee gave an nnfavourable report neither mr chamberlain nor the governnent were satisfied they appointed a conmmission which looked on it more favourably and just at that time the south african war broke out and made a greatt schemues of social reform impossibleplsancez and oldacm pewobut we are told there were two years between the end of the war and the defeat of the late govern ment yes but the finances of the country had been so disorganized that even then such a scheme was impossible tnd that that view is true is proved by this that when the present prime minister the then cbancellor of the exchequer moro than two years after the government camne into office introduced his budget he made this statement they had first to make right the fimances of the country and it xy rs impossible to do anvthing before that was accomplished if it could only be dealt with two years after this government came into office is it not evident thatt the same cause made it impoisible for the unionist party to deal wvith it eazer if this vivw this minority view is not justified by history wvhat is there to justify it in some of those weary hours which i have now topas in the iouso of commnons i sometimes look at my opponents on the front govermuent bench when they occasionally honour us by their presence laughter and i ask myself  do they look as though they took a moro unselfish interest are they more genuinely sympathetic with the poor and suffering than we are  and i have never been able to dis cover anytling to make me believe that they do take such a view and what do you find  do you find that an employer wvho happens to be a unionist is less just is less generous less considerate to those who are dependent upon him than an em ployer who happens to be a liberal   no that is not my experience and i think i am making no exaggerated claim in clairing this that we hbve at least as much sympathy for the poor as our oppo nents rtemember also that the men who talk most about a subject are not necessarily the men wvho tlink most about it or who feel most strongly in regard to it in the old days wvhen absolute power was in the hands of kings amabiticus men in order to obtaini powrer played upon the weak uesses of eings and flattered them power has changed it is novi in the hands of the worling classes of tlis country if they choose to exercise it but human nature has not changed men have the same ambitions and tryto obtaiin them in the samneway now they flatter not kings but the people and therefore it is true that wherever there has been populli govern mnent in every age aud in every country the greatest enemy of the democracy has been the demagogue cheers it is very easy if you have any gifts very small gitstof eloquence or rhetoric to make sympathetic spoeches by pointing out the glaring and even the appalling differences between the rich and thepor no man with any symnpathy at al can fail tothose differences but nhat is the good of talking about them unless vou see some method of remedv ing them speeches of that kind when i read them as i often do read them remind me of the advertisements i see in all our papers they describe with great skill and accuracy the symptoms of disease wvhich those suffering from it recognize and then they end by mentioning the quack remedy that will cure them all laughter and cheers that is very easyvnt st in rez womnsg classesa speech was delivered the other day in aberdeen by the chancellor of the exchequer i do not suggest that he has no sympathy with the poori think he hasbut he is also a politician i have no reason however for thinking that his sympathy is greater than ours in that speech he said i am going to abolish poverty well that is splendid gentlemen that is splendid if he will show me how he is going to do it lf he will convince me that he can do it i shial becorne tomorrow one of his most devoted followercheer but so far the remarks as far as i can judge are quack remarks wrhich instead oi curing the disease will aggravate it cheers i am not satisfiednobody iswith tlhe present social condi tions i am not satisfied either with the present distzi bution of wealth in this or any other industrial country nobody is there is now not only here but in all industrial countries a feeling of unrest among the working classes they have the idea that thev are not getting a fair shsre of the products of their in dustry and they wish to get and they mean to secure if they can a larger share in these profits with that desire i have every sympathy and in my belief the great problem for settlement in our times wil be to assist in some method of distributing wealth without drying up the sources of wealth cheem tat is a desire which every one would shr how is that to be secured  i have always myself ever since i was a boy had a great deal of faith in the cooperative movement in copartnership between capitl and labour i think that one of the great evils of our present industrial work is the absence of human intecourse of human sympathy betvecen emrployers and employed i believe that the gradual evolution of industrial society may develop this cooperative movemntca i do not say that this government or any government can do much to help it but i think that it miight try i think that it would at least be worth while to have a committee of inquiry into it to see what measure of success it has attainedand it has attained a great dealand by ventilating the facts to enable it still more to develop in this countru but after all under present conditions it cannot be donetilann uniox lirirroxsnow today in my belief the one way of distribut ing wealth more fairly without drying up its source is to raise the level of wages throughout this countrv checrs that is my belief that is a view which men of aul parties would share how is it to be done a voice tariff reform i shall come to this as you may believe laughter can trade unionism do it  a voice no i think that in the past trade unionism has done something bhs done a great deal to inmprove the conditions of labour perhaps ywou knor at least i know that an organized cam paign is being directed agaimnst our party on the ground of our assumed hostfility to trade unions we are not hostile to trade unions chee i have said it often and always with sincerity that the last thing i would desire to see would be that caeh in dividual workman had to malke his bargain with the individual employer tmat would not be fair i believe in combination for the purpose of raising the reward of labour it has done less than it ought to have done because from the mnament that the trade unions were scized for political purposesfrom tlat moment their influence and their real object were defeated if traelo unions arc to make the best bargain with their cmployers hle men who lead these unions must undertand the conditions of the trade as well as the employers understand it they must know wvhen to make demands and they must know when it is useless to make demands to under stnd any trade in that way will require the best intellect which trade unions can produce but how can it be exercised for that purpose if the leaders of trade unions go to westminster and posee there as statesmen settling the destinies of the nation  it is for that reason i believe that trade unionism has done so little to help the condition of labour in the last ten years and it is for that reason only i think that the leaders hhave lost their influence over trade unions and obviously unless unions are disciplined their power of negotiation is gone that is the reason i think of their lack of discipline this evil cannot be cured from the outside i do not desire that trade unions should be broken up fromthe outde by political parties or in any otber way that evil is to be cured gradually by the common sense and the experience of the members of trade unions cheersa rairer fiscal systemlnow i shal come to the interruption of my friend in the gallery i do believo the state can do something to help in raising the level of wages by giving us a fairer fiscal systerma fiscal system which wiiu enable our workmen to compete on better and fairer terms than they do today with their industrial rivals i beieve that tariff rmform will tend to raise wages but i am sure of this that without it and without security in our own market which will protect our wvorkmen at their own doors any general rise in the level of wages is absolutely impossiblebut before i deal with this question on gencral lines i must refer though i shall try to do so brieflv to the criticlin of a speech of mine at oldham made by lord crewe lord crewe as you know lhs been for a short time secretary of state for india but that does not make him as i think he would be the first to acknowledge an authority upon india and i do not think it justiflea him in speakinv in the dogmatic tone which he has adopted in thls speech the subject is one of great importance both to us and to india and therefore i shall not discuss it in any controversial spirit what i said on this at oldham was cbntained in two or three sentences only the views i expressed there i had elaborated at the last election in mianchester where as you know i was a candidateand not a successful candidate these views were formed by me after a great deal of thought and after consultation with many anglo indianms and with some indians and to these views  still adhere lord crewe criticizes my speech from three points of view he said first of all my pro posajs would dislocate the finances of india when on this subject in manchester i said that no one was in a position to know and could know exactly how the indian budget is to be arranged it is possible though i do not think this to bh the case it is possible that the proposal i recommend could not be carried ou at once but the change would be made gradually and witth full regard to the financial interests of india cheersthe second criticismand it was his chief criticism was that i had made a clhim upon the gratitude of india as it happens i do not think that was the word i usedgratitudebut what i said was simply this we have done india great services we have some claim upon india and whatever the ecxtent of that claim it was that we should have equality of treatment on the indian narket that does not seem to me an exaggerated claim to have povwer over india but i pointed out most clearly in manchester and i shall repeat it here that though wie have power over india our first tholght must be for the advantage of india but that does not prevent u surely considering england as well as india and if we can do good to england without injuring india surely that is part of our clear duty cheerselcisz ddutmns in indiahis last arguarent was that if we change our fiscal system we shall have no moral right to demand equality of treatment in india why does he make that claim  what is the position now we have imposed on india excise duties on cotton corre sponding with the import duties everybody who has studied or has examined the debates at the time when those excise duties were put on kneess that they were put on for the protection of lancashire and if our ob ject was to prevent indian manufactres from getting any advantage excise duties would have been put on everything on all imports but they were put only on cotton these eclse duties are detested mn india they are detested not so much because they give us inequality of treatment but because of the annoyance that they cause and everybody in india would rejoice to see them removed but we are told that we have at present a moral right to make india keep her markets open whether she likes it or not because free trade is good for england yes but if mv views are adopted the people will think as i think today and that is that there should be iree trade within the empire cheers that is my ideal fiscal system it is not possible to get it now with the colonies but a system of preference would tend in that direction and would end in that direction we could have it tomorrow with india we could have free trade between india and great britain almost tomorrow we believe just as strongly as free imnporte believe of the present system that it is best for india and best for us and we believe that we have at least as good a moral right to enforce our claim as those who enforce theirs today look at it from another point of view if a system of preference is to be put on india will not onlv get the advantage in any unprovement upon our finances today but enland get the benefit too take cocoa and cofree if we give even a small preference on these it would be a great advantage to india and can any sane man contend that we have a right nows to insist on the indian mnarket being kept opcn when wve can give them no advantage wihich is not given to every other countryi look at it from another point of view lord crewe seems to think that indians desire protec tion even against us so far as i can judge so far as cotton goods are concerned the competition which they have most reason to fear is not that of lanca shire it is the competition of japan and perhaps of china cheers will it not be of immense advantage to india to be able to protect them selves if they please against the competition likely to be most deadly to them  i try always to under stand if i do not always agree with the arguments of our opponents in this matter i do not under stand them they are incomprehensible i feel as strongly as anybody that in governing india our first duty mnust be to india it must be so but i am satisfied that the proposal which we make is better for india than the present system and i am certain also that the indlians themselves are recognizing that it is a better system than that which exists today cheerstanuf rnyor and good tradtnow to return to tlc subject of tariff reform i should like first of au to make two general remarks about it the first is that the whole experience of the civilized world is hostile to the system which prevails in this country one after another at different times all the great countries of the world and all our colonies have abandoned our system and in connexion with their abandonment of it two things stand out prccnii nently the first is that in no single case where the system has been abandoned is there a political par cy in any countrynot merely thie govelnment bc the oppositiona serious political party in any country which after an experience of that system proposes to return to the system which prevaiis in englankd cheers the second fact is that in every one of these countries not excepting germany the worlinig men arc tle most determined to adhere to the new system and they are the most determined for this reasontlhy realize and they are right that you cannot improve the conditions of labour that you cannot protect labour unless you protect also the products of labour cheersthe nex it general remark i wish to make is in regaid to the good trade prevailing in this country at the present time we are told that this tood trade has destroyed the last aer ument for tariffeform i do not think so no tariti reformer i haue cver met has ever aintained that our fiscal system is so bad that no matter howv great may be the expansions of the trade of the world we shall never ge any share of it i haxve never thought that it was as bad as that if it were we should indeed be a nation of tariff leformersbut cornsider this if it could be shown that the expansion is greater uaider our system than in other countries wtith a different fica system that would be an argument in favour of our system but suppose it were the fact that the expansion in other counrxies is far greater than with us then will any one maintain that that fiscal system is best where the exuansion is least and that fiscal system is worst where the expansion is greatest  what are the facts  i am going to make a contrast between germany and this country if you take any year you like the result will be the same but i shall take for comparison the year the year before the fiscal controversy was started in this countryand compare it with the present year taking the first nine months of each of these years our total trade imports and exports combined increased to the extent i think of � during that period the total increase of the trade of germany imports and exiports com bined and there was an increase greater than oursboth in exports and imports was not � it was � sterling that does not seem to show that our system alone accounts for the expan sion in our tradebut after all these trade statistics are not the only test they are not the best test because they deal only with foreign trade and in every country the home trade is always more important than the foreigntrade the best tesrt therefore is total production which gives both the foruign trade and the home trade we have no figures to make that comparison in many articles but we can msake them in regard to iron iron was deacribed by cobden as the bread and butter of all industries and it is recognized in every country as the test of the general industzial expasuson of that country in  our production of ra ironnd remember that here the production of raw iron shows clearly the total expansion of thetrade for there are no imports to speak of and trade cannot increase unless there is an increase of the raw materialin  our production of raw iron was a little over � or � in  it had risen to � wvhat about germany  in the first year her production of iron was the same as ours approximately over � in  it was � ani increase of � against an increase to us of � only what is the explanatiorn of it if it were america ono could umderstand the united states bave advautages of raw material which we have not germany lhs no such advantages she imports as we do great quantities of iron ore out cf which the iron is made is regards coal which is more important than iron ore in the iron industries so far from having an advantage over us she buys large quantities of coal from great britain i know of no explantion except this that the security of the german home marketespecially in bad times encourages men to spend moe nnew industries and enables the industries to expandcerook to emligration ind that ought to bea test we have soen germany under two conditions under a free trade system and a system of moderate protection what is the result  under the old system there was a great cmnigration from germany for some years it was as much as firom this country but what is happening now  there is no emigration from germany and now people are actually going into germany to get the work which is there for them but what about us  during ten years we have lost one million and a haf nearly twvo millionso� peopleand what are the kind of people we are losing i remember a year ago after addressing a meeting at glasgow waiting to go back to london i saw an emigrant train and spoke to many of those who were leaving our shores wbat kind of peoplo were they p the young the energetic and the enterprisimg the very class that any countrv would keep at home if they could and they wvere going to protectionist coultries to seck those opportunities for their skill and industry which are denied to them at home cheers i em glad to say that mos of them are going to our colonies where they are strengthening the empire but surely if that sort of thing is happening in good times there must be something wrong in this country take one test that of wages whichi is the most important of all duiing the first ten years of this century as we know by the board of trade return in spite of the tre mendous increase in tho cost of living there was no rise in the level of wages there has been since a slight rise but as mr snowden who is not exactly a unionist said last night it is infinitesimal that is not true in other industrial countries in the united state
