judgmient or a new trial on appeal from verdict and judgment at trial before the lord chief justice and a special jurythe action was for damages for alleged breach of contract and it is reported in the times of fcbru ary   and apil   the action was brought by the famous billiard player and excham pion john roberts against joseph gcorge gray thc wclknown australia blilliard playor tt appcared that in  the plainitiff was in autralia and onlay   an agreement vas entered into bctween bin and the defendant for a totu round the wvorld the defendant had already agreed to play in engcland from october  to the end of march  and the agreement was therefore only to comc into force on april   and wvats to last for  months from that date oni april l i the defendant by his solicitor repudiaed the agrocmnct and the plaintiff therefore clained damages for breach of contractthe defendant put in a numbur of defences in cluding a plea that he was born on march s  and was an infant at thc time of his sisning the con tract this was not denied by the plaintiff hut he contended that as the contract was for the infants benefit be was bound by it another defence was that the plaintiff had induced the defenidant to enter into the contract by a misrepresentation that his obligation to play billiards with bonzoline balls expired on march  the jury found that the plaintiff did not make the false representation alleged and assessed the plaintiffs damages at �a legal argument followed as to the efrect of the defendants infancy on his position and the lord chief justice held that the contract of may  was a contract of employment and that as it was for the benefit of the defendant it would bind him although he was an infant when ho signed the contract and he entered judgment for the plain tiff on all the issuesthe defendant appealedmr j b matthews appeared for the appellant and mr tindal atkinson kic and mir c e dyer for the respondentthe couir dismissed the appealj udgczntthe iasrzr of the royns in the course of his judgment said that the appeal had been ably argued by mr matthews but having heard all that he bad urged upon tbe court he thie master of the llolls was bound to say that he saw no reason to differ from the view taken by the lord chief justice the attention of the court had bcen called to a great number of cases dealing with the extent to which an infant might be bound by a contract made by bim during his infalcyhis lordship did not mean to say that there had been no development of the law on the subject sinec the date whlen the earliest cascs were decided but it was important to remember that as early as lord coke it w as laid down that the doctrine that an infants contract for necessaries was binding upon binm applied not only to a contract for bread and cheese and clothes but also to a contract for education and instruction that had been construed by the court of appeal in walter v everard   qlb  in which case lord justice fry had said that education must not be taken in the narrow sense as being education to enable a man to work to maintain himself as aii artisan but applied to educauion and instruction suitable to the social state in wlhich the infant might expect to find himself whien he became adult then what was the eftect of a contract cntered into by an infant in respect of necessaries including instruc tion it had been argued that such a contract mnight be good so far as the consideration was executed but that it could not be enforced so far as as it was executory so far as his lordship was concerned he was not aware of any authority for that proposition and he thought that the court was bound hy the lecision in clements v london and northwestern lrailway   qb in that case the couri considered the contract as a whole lord esher said if upon con sideration of the whole agreement there is a manifest advantage to the infant he cannot avoid it lord justice kay said i agree with the divisionalcourt that on examination of the whole contract it is for the benefit of the infant although it contuls terms that standing alonc would not be for his advantage there is therefore no right on the part of the infant to repudiate thc contract lord justice a l smith quoted with approval the judg rnlet of lord justice iry in de francesco v barnum  chd   there is another exception which is based on the desirableness of infants employing themselves in labour therefore where you get a con tract for labour and vou have a rcrauneration of wages that contract i thinik must be taken to bc prinia faeic biniding iupon an infant prima facie therefore the contract was binding upon thc infant if the contract feu within the class to which the doctrine of necessaries applied and on the wvholei was for the benefit of thc infant there was no fouuda tion for the argumnent that the infant was not liable for damages the court had acted on that views in gadd v thompson  i kb  wvhere an infant had been restrained by litjunction from com mitting a breach of a covenant in an apprenticeship deedit only remained thereforc to consider what wvas the nature of the contract could it be doubted that playing in company with so noted a player as the plaintiff was instruction of the most valuable iiind for an infant who desired to make his living by billiard playing  the lord chise justice had held that tile contract was capable of being enforced as a contract for necessaries he the mast or of therolls entirely agreed with that construction of the  contract looked at by itself the lord chief justice i lhen had heltl that the casc came within the doctrinc laid down in coke on littelton  and in clements v london and nnorthwestern itailway eupra and had given judgment for thlc plaintiff against the infant lie

the appeal said that under tle finance  act  section  subsection  any person aggrieved by the decision of the referee may appeal against the decision to the high court within the time and in the manner and on the conditions directed by rules of court rules of court were made on lanuary   which he must admit seemed to have been framed on the view that the  person aggrieved  under that section could only be a subject and not the commissioners then on march   therevenue act   geo v c  received the royal assent and by section  it was declared  that the commissioners of inland reovenue if dissatisfied wvith the decision of a referee liaveunder subsection  of section  of the principal act the finance  act   aight of appeal to the high court against the decision as persons aggrieved within the mcaning of that provision no further irules of court were madetle contended that as the right of appeal had been given by statute the proper inference was thlat the existing rules must be followed with such modifications as were necessary as a result of the oommissioners being the appellants the rules must be applied mutdais muttanlis by the statute the crowr wvas a  person aggrieved  within section  of the linance z acti  and the rules were applicable to a  person aggrieved  whether a sbject or the crown it w as true that they were not vcery apt but it could not be said that the avenue of appcal wvas entirely closed further the failure of the rules committeeto frame rules could not deprive either subject or crowni of the absolute right of appeal conferred bv section  of the act the legislatiure could not be regarded ars having conferred on tble rules committee coordinate jurisdiction so that they could take away a right of appeal con ferred by the act on both these grounds the crown wes entitled to succeedr dacncwents for the respondent said it was a fallacy to say that the legislature had given an rnfettered right of appeal section  of the finance  act  only gave a right to appeal  wvithin the time and in tdhc manner and on the conditions directed by the rules of court it was only a qualified right of appeal and depended on the existence of the rules again it was not possible to apply the existing rules to the case of an appeal by thc commissioners there was no provision in the riles that they were to apply mueatis rnutandis and the court could not so hold the legislature had delegated its powers to the rules committee but not to this courtmr austencart mll repliedat the conclusion of the arguments on december  their lordships reserved judgment which was de llvered this morning when the appeal was allowed and the petition remitted to mr justice horridgejljdoaielntthe masten of the rolls in the course of his judgment said by section  of the finance   act  subsections    and  provision was made for appeals to a referee it was not necessary to consider those provisions minutely subsection  contemplated that the decision of the referee might not be acquiesced in and provision wvas made for an appeal to the high court the lanuage of that subsection was important it pro vided that any person aggrieved by the decision of the referee might appeal against the decision to the high court within the time and in the manner and on the conditions directed by rules of court including conditions enabling the court to require the payment of or the giving oi security for any duty claimedon the construction of this subsection his lordship thought the words  any person aggrieved  were not limited to the subject but included the com missioners either the subject or the commissioners might he dissatisfied and feel aggrieved and to each of thsu a riglht of appeal was given apparently some doubt was felt on this point and the rtevenue azt  section  removed au possible doubt lt would be observed that this section was declaratory of a right which the commissioners had and not an enrctmrnt conferring upon the comnissioners a rivht which they did not previously possess what vaen was the nature of the right of appeal given bv subsection   was it an absolute right capable of being exercised although no rules might have been made by thc rule committee  or was it a qualified right subject to directions in rules to be made by the rule comnmittee  for the purpose of the present appeal his lordship assumed without deciding that the latter was the better viewrbights o the rule coairntxrules were made by thc rule committee on january   before the revenue act  came into operation those rules directed that any person aggrieved must appeal within one month fronm the date of the decision rule  and must proceed by petition rule  the rules contained a number of conditions applicable to every appeal whether by the subject or by the commissioners and a number of conditionis applicable only to an appeal by a subject uis lordiship thought it was true that the rule making authority had primarily in their contemplation an appeal by a subject but the language used was apt to comply with ail the rmoqnirements of subsection  it was not necessary that the rules should lay down all the conditions for every case the words  if any  must be implied when rhere was a casus oinisus the general provisions of the rules of the stupreme court might be appealed to see rule  and where no express provision could be found it was compettent to the judge to give such directions as justce and common sense alike called forthe point for their decision arose in the following waythe commissioners had appealed by petition against a decision of a referee a preliminary objection was taken to the appeal being heard on the ground that there was no machinery by which the commnissioners could appeal to the high court as the rules did not provide for appeals by the commis sioners mr justice horridge allowed this pre liminary objection and dismissed the appeal with great respect to the learned judge his lordship thought the objection was not valid for the reasons he had stated he thought the rules did provide for appeals by the commiissioners the petition was properly brought before the court and must be dealt with on iti merits le did not anticipiate any difficulty in dealing with it the appeal must be allowed and the petition must be remitted to mr justice horridgethe lonus jusricis also
