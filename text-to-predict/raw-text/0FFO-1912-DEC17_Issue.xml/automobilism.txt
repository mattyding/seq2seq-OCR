automobhismte car in winterthe recent spells of frost must have brought homo to many a motorist that tho usual winter precautions for his vehicle and in his driving are now necessary sometimes it is said that one of tho advantages of the mechanical over the horsedrawn vehicle is that it is weather proof to somo extont this is true but at the same time unloss certain precautions are taken the frost whieh may cause tho loss of a valuable horse through pnoumonia may equally damage a motor car worth ten times as much as thefuzen radiat rsa frozen radiator and ice in the water con nexions and pump are really serious rpatters but any chaneo of trouble in this direction may be averted beforehand by some simple precau tions it is advisable if the car has to be left out at night or bas to stand in cold places during tho day as in the case of a country doctors car that a proportion of at loast one third of thq water it the rdiator should be mxed with ordinary commorcial glycerine which will prevent tho water from freezing at anything like the same temperature as water not so mited calcium chlorido has the same effect but is rather less efficient a third method is to cover the radiator with a rug or coat whenever tle car is left standing in the day time for so cpvered it will i etain its heat for quite a long time at vight the extra precaution can be talken of emptying all the water out of the watertank pumnp and pump connexions and filling up again in the morn ing with tepid or still better warm water before starting the engine in this practicq there are two dangers to guard against one is the pouring of ordinarv eold water into the radiator on a frosty morning before the engine has been started for a moment or two and the othor is the converse one of allowing the engine to run at the outside more than half a alinute without being suro that there is water in the jackets round the cylinders the result of the first blunder is that very often if the temperature is really low the water poured in immediately freezes on the sides of the pipes and connexions before it can be sufficiently wormed by the action of the engine and then ice obstructs the free passage of tie fluid in tho second case serious accidents such as the cracking of the cylinders may occulr if the engine runs more than one or two hundred revolutions wnithout water in tho cylinder jacket and if water is then suddenly introduced against the almost redhot walls of the cylinders there will be a sudden generation of steam which will develop a pressure sufficient to burst the sur rounding metal by far the best method therefore in starting the car up after a cold nighlt whon the temperature is still low is to fill up the radiator witlh wvarm water and start the engine almost simultaneouslyovercooijngfor motoring in wintry weatlher on the open road there are several hints wvhich mav bo usefully kept in inind first of all in the majority of cars the cooling action of tho fan behind the radiator is calculated on the basis of the maximum heat of summer in order that the circulating wrater may not boil in the dog days in july with the thermometer in the nineties in otlher words in winter time therm is unnecessary and wasteful overcooling and the best way to equalize rnatters is wvhere the blades of the fan are detachable to take off half of them leaving one twvo or three to do the work done by the whole number in simuner another plan is to cover part of the radiator in front with some light material such as canvas which will prevent the air from passing through it and whichi will redtses the area available for cooling yet a third method possible wvhere a belt is uised is to slacken the attach ment between the crankshaft or halftime shaft and the fan itself in order to lessen the number of revolutions made by the latler in some of the larger types of car it is hiardly necessary in winter when a long journey in tho country is contemplated to use any fan at all and many experienced motorists always detach or loosen the fart belt from about the middle of november to the middle of february except when the car is used in towns or for short distances at slow speedsin these days of high prices for motor fuel the overcooling of the cylinders is a matter of some moment it has been found by ecperi g ment that the temperature of the water in thecylinder jacket which produces the highest efficiency lies somewvhere between deg and deg f both above and below these temperatures the engine does not give so much power or in other words consumes more pe trol for the same amount of work done on a really cold morning in winter with the ordinary fan system the temperature of thle water will rarely be found to exceed deg to deg and even that temperature is reached only after the car has been on the road soine time this is especially the case with fast cars where the passage through the air is rapid and where as a matter of fact all the year round the fan after  to  miles an hour has little effect on the temperature of the cooling water ths speed at which the car is passing through the air being the chief cause of keeping the water in the radiator reasonably cool but the amount of petrol saved may be gathered from the following instance a year or two ago the writer made a test in order to ascertain the difference produced by the use and disiuse of the fan in cold weather on a certain type of car his consumption hd deteriorated from about  miles to the gallon to about  miles to the gallon but when he diminished the cooling of the radiator by taking off the fan belt the con sumption again fell to about its normual level and even in the coldest weather  to  miles per gallon were obtainable without any specially economical driving therefore it seems as if something like  to  per cent saving can be brought abput in covering the same distance by preventing the radiator from becoming overcoolod this is a fact which should be borne in mind by those who wish to practise reasonable economy and at the sama tirme obtain high efficiencyanother point which should be remembered when frost sets in is that the vehicle shouid be washed immediately it comes into the garage with wdin water if the cold is intense enough to make ordinary washing by mean of the hose and cold water impossible owing tothe forma tia of iice on the car during the process theuse of a frozen sponge or clamois leather should also be avoided as in a frozen state either of these is certain to scratch the panels almnost e badly as a piece of stone or a gritty duster the chamois leather and the sponge should be well thawed out in warm water before being used on the bodyworkjawgers of tie roadas to driving winter brings with it special dangprs which are by no means insignifieant frozen surfaces especially if the frost be very white in town or country alike are productive of much more skiddint than is ordinarily realized no more dangerous coudition exists thbn when the highway is covered with a light fall of snow which has half melted in the sun in the day time and been frozen again at night thereby producing a surface more nearly pkin to ice than its appearance would suggest when a surface like this bas been corsodate by nmch tragic it becomes nothing better than an ordinary ice slide and in this case the groeatest possible care must be taken when approaching any downhill gradient to keep tho car in hwnd and if possible ofl the tracks formed by other traffic on one occasion the writers car slid with its hind wheels locked down a hill for nearly a quarter of a rnile before ho could arrest the progress of the vehicle if by any chance tere had keen a slowwitted driver of a cart coming up the hill who hadnot appreciated that the car was out of con tfol so far as stopping was concerned a bad couqfir might havo occurred which in the circumstances would have been quite un avoidable the only method of getting over this difficulty  a really steep hill is to keep mqrnae shaort pieces of ropo plle corqid on tho car and to tie thlem rquxld the tires between the spokes irn ordor to prevent the tires olipping over the frozen surfaceentrances to towns and places where the road passes under trees are specially danger ous in weather which has been alternately frosty wet and then frosty again for the road will often be frozen undemeath and yet skiddy end soft pn the top r vic versa both these conditions meaning that the wheel cannot get its usuai grip upon the groundbut the worst condition which the inexperi enced motorist has to face is that produced by heavy snow when the road is entirely covered even heavily studded tires are some times of very little more use than qrdinary plain tread miotorists if tlhey wish to avoid risk in the winter montlhs should niever be without sorae short pieces of cord of such a length that they can bo tied comfortably around the tires in numbers say froni  to  cords to each wheel and these must be repewved from time to time as they wear out with thisprecaution snow two or even three feet deep can be cheerfully encountered for given power it is wonderful what an ordinary motorcar will go through and how well the wheels will grip if fitted with this simple device on one occasion the writer was able to drive througlh nearly ten miles of snow to a railway station in a very exposed country with perfect ease and with very little dimintiop of speed after the great snowstorm of april  in some parts of france and germaany where snow is constant during the winter time and in america sirnilar lengths of small wire rope are used instead of cord and are found to answer admirably the wearing quality being far greater of course than in the ease of hempen cords deep or light snow therefore need not be a bar to motoring if these simple precautions are takenacetylle geanerators ahd omnow that electric lighting plants are taking the place of acetylene lighting on cars there is perhaps npt quite the sarne need to warn motorists about the trouble caused by water freezinig in tho acetylene generators but in the old days when motorists were entirely dependent upon water and calcium cawbide for light it was advisable never to put water in the generator in frosty weather until the light was actually wanted for use in many of the ganerators the admission of water to the carbide was limited by a small hole and as this hole was apt to be frozen up the water was cut off altogether or allowed to come through only in insufficient quantityone more hint in conclusion the grease or heavy oil in the gearcase and the ordinary lubricating oil becomes much less liqtuid when the weather is cold hence the lubricating oil pressure gauges should be carefully watched when the car is started to sep that all connexions are clear and the grease caps should be screwed down ratlher moro frequently than usual in order to ensure that the greass itself shall touch the wearing parts thus can a motorist defy the effects of winteranong other features including some verses on tlso  need of london in which lord montagu emphrsizes the necessity for a centrnl trafric authority
