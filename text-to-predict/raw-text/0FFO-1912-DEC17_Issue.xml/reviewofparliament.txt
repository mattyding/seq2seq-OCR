public declarations were plain and explipit and he knew of no ground for any such sug gestion or belief nothing further was said as to sir f bridgemans retirement except that mr cnutczmi stated in answer to  flatir that in order to prevent mischievous and unfounded rumours the press association and reuters agency had been informed after the ordinary announcement of the resigna tion that its cause was illhealth and not a difference of policy at the end of question time mu asqoui in a few dignified and well chosen words expressed the grief of the house and of the nation at the death of mr whitelaw reid a man of the highest culture social gifts of the most genial and generous kind and keen sympathy with all the many sides of our british life who was in a true and real sense felt to be one of ourselves the government proposed to suggest to the american government that his remains should be conveyed home in a british battleship no motion was before the house but in the absence of mr bonar law mr balfours as the senior privy councillor on the opposition side of the house briefly and admirably added his own appreciation of mr wliitelaw reids character and his concurrence in what mr asquith had said the house listened bareheaded and cheered both these speechesthe fourth day allotted for the consideration in committee of the established church wales bill was spent in discussing the fifth and sixth clauses the first of which provides that the ecclesiastical commissioners shall after the passing of the act and before the date of dis establishment ascertain what property vested in them is wvelsh ecclesiastical property the clause which according to the govermment speakers deals with mere matters of machinery was before the committee until  oclock when the guillotine closure prevented further deliberation the discussion which was highly technical and intricate was carried on in a thin house and was attended by very few of the lnationalist members whose votes saved the government from defeat on fridaymy hoaaa moved an amendment with the object of calling attention to the difficulty of making the required adjustment between welsh church property and property belonging to the church in england and he and other members of the opposition complained that the time allowed for this in the bill was insufficient ma mckxmxas mnain contention in reply was that the work of disentangling the finances of the two parts of the establishment was done in  and that it only remained to bring the figures up to date upon so dry a theme there could not be a lively debate  nevertheless a little excitement was caused by a brief passage at arms an explanation given by mrhi mickenna roused load r ceci who exclaimed  this is not the first time that the home secre tary has played with words he added that mr mcikenna  made a practice of being mis understood and this led to the retort it is the noble lord who makes a practice of misunder standing me after the amendment had been rejected by  votes against mr barlow proposed to exclude queen annes bounty of which he gave a short but interesting historical account from the operation of the clause mal honourse in his answer pointed out that it was only a small amount of the bounty funds that would be affected and that what was proposed had already been sanctioned by the committee the principle of disendowment having been accepted the amendment was rejected by a majority of  lthen the clause was carried under closure by  votes against upon the next clause which limits the power of the ecclesiastical commissioners and of the governors of queen annes bounty to make grants to the disestablished church ma mckenna speaking upon an amendment moved by blr cave and recognizing that the restrictions proposed were too severe agreed to give the commissioners a right to provide the church with an income of � and also to decide year bv year whether an additional grant not exceeding � should be madethe opposition were not satisfied with half measures and pressed mir mckenna to allow the commissioners to give the welsh church as much as they liked out of english church funds the demand for a greater relaxation of the restrictions was supported on the other side by sm f edwards the liberal member for radnorshire and the opposition speakers de clared that the general sense of the conmittee was with them mr mckunxk certainly deemed it advisable to make a concession and he promised that an amendment would be moved on report giving the ecclesiastical authorities and the governors of queen annes bounty unrestricted power to make grants to the dis established church if they should make it clear that they desired such power this con cession did not disarm the home secretarys critics who thought it unnecessary that he should wait for a declaration from the commis sioners of a desire to have the power mn llewelyn willims thinking that the opposi tion ought to have shown greater satisfaction advised the home secretary to pause in future before making concessions as they were met with derision on the other side of the house and might inspire contempt on his own sidethe closure came into force for the second time at halfpast  oclock when the com mittee divided on the amendment which was rejected by a majority of  after this the clause was carried by  votes against  and progress was reported pp  and
