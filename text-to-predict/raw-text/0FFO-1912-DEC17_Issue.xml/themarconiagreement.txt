of commons on the marconi contract at their sitting yester daiy sir albert spicer was in tho chair mlr crompton llewelyn davies solicitor to the post office who drew up the draft agreement was recalled for vrossexamination and was questioned particularly by r h terrell as to the  true construction  of several of the clauses of the instrunent the other post office vitness wvas mr e w farnall an assistant secretary who gavo further explanations of muatters mentioned in the confidential blue book in the hands of members of the cotmmittee mr roland wilkins cb chief clerk to the lreasury presented the view of the agreement taken by that department which was that the terms were on tho vhole the best that thle post office were likely to securemr davies was closelv questioned by mr teitnell with reference to his previous answer that the post mastergcncral was to decide what information he would give to the marconi company when under the terms of the contract he was seeking their advice as to the use of patents or inventions other than those of the marconi company ee agreed that there was nothing either in the tender or the draft agreement to the effect that the postmastergeneral should so decide but in his opinion the postmastergeneral  alone could be in the position to decide what information was necessary for the purpose of seeking the advico which under the contract he was bound to seektaken next to the indemnity clause mr davies said his view was that it gave the post office a they were entitled to under the tender and that it was a very satisfactory arrangementmr ticzuel asked whether the witness suggested that the clause would operate in this wayif the postmastergeneral were to use an unpatented invention which the marconi company were them selves using and it turned out that it was an infringe ment of somebody elses patent he wvould be entitled to claim from the company any damages he mnight  have sustained by reason of the use of that invention mr davies replied that he was inclined to think so the post office were entitled under the powers con ferred on them to use and exercise these specialities and tho clause gave thenm an indemnity against any claim that might arise in respect of matters arising out of the exercise of that power but he did not press this view he thought it was a very subtle point hc did not think it was as mr terrell sug gested  a very important point to clear up ile thought they had made it as clear as the circumstances permitteduarconi cowaaxys rigut of lnspscrionx questioned as to clause is which conferred on the marconi companiy the right in certain events to inspect the wirele ss stations and his statement on thursday that he thought it might be said that the clause gave the marconi company practically nothing more than what thc company would bave got under the patents and dcsigns act  mr davies said he words in the agreement he relied on were  in all cases in which they the companyl have reason to suspect their patents are being infringedmr teall asked whether there was anything in the agreement imposing on the marconi company the obligation imposed by section  of the patents and designs act of proving a prima facie case of infringement the witness replied that the company had got to show that they had reason to suspect that their patents were being infringeddo you suggest that  reason to suspectis the yamc thing as making out a prima jacie case under the act of  eycswhere do you tind in the clause that thc ipost mastergeneral has the right to decide the mtarconi company vwould have to come to us and the postmastergeneral would exercise his discretion as to whether a case had arisen for inspection if the otopad were not satisfied they would have to go tothe courts simply to state that they had  reason to suspect  wvould not be enoughthat is all thle clause says i would advise the postmastrgcneral that he must have satisfactory proof that they have  reason to suspectby mr falconeiais opinion had wavered from time to time as to whhether the acceptance of the tender was an unconditional contract which could be enforced but in the first dlace it vws clear that thcwrhole thing was conditional on the resolution of the i house of commons larther his view was that it would be held that the tender and acceptance wvas only i a stage in the negotiations and that in fact the parties did not intend to bind themselves and verc not bound until they executed the final agreement e did not know the law of the several countries that would regulate the different stations when erected as far as the wireless apparatus was con cernedapart from the mastshe did not know whether that was attached to the soil hc should have thought it was very easily detachable buit whatever the general law might be the point wascovered by direct provisions in the agreement that the stations should remain the property of the govern ment the governmnent vwere absolutely free in any of these stations when erected to introduce any system of wireless telegraphy they might think fit and if they ccased to use any of the marconi patents they would cease to pay tho  per cent royaltyin answer to the camwns question with regard to financial interest the witness said he had not and never had had any interest in the marconi company or any company or syndicate in any way connected therewith and so iar as he was awvare none of his relations hadtin drafr tendermr farnall one of the assistant secretaries of the post officc was further examined with reference to memoranda set out in the bluebook of what passed at certain interviews between representatives of the post office and the marconi company in the course of the negotiations he admitted that he was mistaken in a staterment he had previously made that mr godfrey isaacs brought the draft tender to hiim at the post office the draft tender was actually prepared in thc general post office but it was rather in the nature of a revise of con ditions which had been unler discussion at a previous interview on or about februarv  he had no note of that previous interview he could not say who instructed him to meet mr isaacs it would be open to him to do it of his own initiative referred to what was called an important interview between the postmastergeneral mr godfrey isaacs and himself on december   and asked why a note of it was not put in the bluebook the witness said it was because it was unfortunately forgotten wlhether it dropped out or whether it went to the printer or not he could not find out it was acci dentally omittedmr fabri am sure of that it is unifortunate because thc document is so importantthe witnessthe lacuna was filled up when sir alex eings attention was called to itin further reply to mr faber the witness said that by direction of the postmastergencral he had an interview with mir godfrey isaacs on feb ruary  liis instructions being to see if he could not get better terms all round tihe interview which took place at the companys ofice lasted the best part of an hour and during it he employed every argument he could think of to get mr isaacs to reduce his terms but he found him extremely un willing to do anything of the sort the diffcrence between them in regard to the royalty was repre sented by the  per cent of the postmastergeneral and the  per cent of mr godfrey isaacs but before the interview was concluded mlr isaacs agreed to come dovn to  per cent they discussed the price of the stations only very litulc re could see that it was not worthv while discussing itmir i isaacs had that which the post office wanted to i buy and he was therefore to that extent in tn advantageous positionin reply td mr ainumy thhe witness said that in his interview vwith mr godfrey isaacs he did not think he called his attention to the fact that stations to perve the same purpose as those for which the marconi companv were tenderinxg could be erected at  less than their estimate because it had beern previously pressed upon mr isaacs that if the mtlarconi company were not reasonable the government would get the admiralty to build the stations nor did he stronglv press mir isaacs on the question of the proportional reduction of the royalty as the number of marconi l patents in use diminished bcaiuse when mr isaacs i raised the point of how they weie going to settle thequestion of the values of the differcnt patents he saw the extreme difficulty of carrying out such an arrangement re had had no private correspondence whatever with mr isaacs on the subjectmatter of this inquiry on the affairs of the marconi company or its relations with other companies sincc the con clusion of the contractlrgency of the impeaial chaiqin further reply to mr w reimond the witness said the present wireless communication between clifden and glace bay of the marconi companv was now practically as reliable as the cable rive years ago statements were made to the post office that the poulsen would be in a position very shortly to do this work and they had not done it yet the post office could not do it the admiralty were un willng there was nothing for it but to go to marconiasled what he had to say on the question of urrency the witness saidfrom the commercial point of viewv the matter is very urgent indeed if other countries step in and get a chain of wireless stations established and get hold of the business of commercial business we shau not get that business back at all events it wil be extremely difficultapart from the paramount strategic considera tion you think delay from the commercial poinlt of view is likely to be dangerous for us i think so if we had had our stations well started by now i think france would not propose to erect a chain of her own it is projected and i believe the bill is passed but i am not sureyou have i believe heard all the evidence before tllis committec  have you yoursell modified vour opinion in any wvay vwith regail to this agreement  to some extent i thbink it is rather a better agree ment than i supposed it to bemr w redmond referring to some printed matter in his handcould vou gets us any informattion vith regard to alleged communication between berlin and cambridge i am pretty confident no sueh communication was ever established i vill inquirethe witness in final answer to the cmunxysaid he had no financial interest whatever nor had his family in the miarconi company but of course he could not answer for distant relativesthie treksurys attudemr roland wilkins cb chief clerk at the treasury stated the part which the treasury hadtaken in connexion with the financial clauses of the agreement as regards the  per cent royalty to the marconi company he said the terms were the best the post offtce could get the question there fore for his consideration was whether he should recommend the treasury to break off the negotia tions with the marconi company on that point it was a very diffcult question for him to consider but on the whole it seemed to him that the treasury would be justified in acquiescing in the  per cent the treasurys authority to accept the marconi companys tender was first given verbally that was sometimes done in circumstances of great pressure tllo post office were anxious to get the treasury authority they telephoned through and the autjdority was given in that way being subse quently confirmed in writing the real defence of the clauses of which the treasury took notice was not tbat they were good in themselves but that they were the best they could dobly r hanorn smrrrhel was a member of the imperial wireless committee representing the treasury and he remembhered the appointment of the technical subcommittee asked whether it was a matter of surprise to him that the subcom mittee never reported to the committee which ap pointed it he said it was no part of their business at the treasury to watch for the presentation of that reportyou were not surprised no he assumed that if it was of material importance the report would be circulated as was done in all cases of material im gortazce he agreed however that it would have tcen better it that report bad been circulated the point about proportional reduction of the royalty was pressedby the treasury on thel post office two or thlree times referred to the treasury criticism as to the awkwardness of the situation if after a few years marconi patentls were only being used to a small extent and the government were compelled to pay  per cent royalties tiu  or  he said be still held that view to some extent on that point taken aloneyoi mean then that i he claus was really objec tionable and you stiu think it objectionable oh eesthe examination of the witness had not concluded when thc room wias cleared and the committee after wards sat in private
