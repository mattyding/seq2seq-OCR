external power we regard him as a kinsman hear hear he is nlso an honoured and a welcome guest hear hear sprung from our own race speaking our own language sharing with us by birth and by inheritance not a few of our most cherished traditions and participating when he comes here by what i may describe as a natural right in our domestic interests and celebrations hear hear the office has been held and adorned by a long succession of distinguished men and i am not using the language of exaggeration when i say that none of them has more fully entered into its spirit and maintained its special authority than mr whitelaw reid hear hear he brought to the discharge of its manifold and exacting duties the gathered experience of a veteran in public affairs the endow ments of a nman of the highest culture social gifts of the most genial and generous kind keen sympathy with all the many sides of our british life a mind always open and receptive and the warnest of hearts hear hiear we propose to suggest to the american government that one of his faiestys battleships should convey the remains of the late ambassador to his native land hear hear we shall miss him here nd i am certain that i interpret the senxtiment of the whole house when i venture in their name to offer to his family andl to the president and the people of the united states our deep and heartfelt sympathy inthe

i have nothing to add in substance to the noble tribute which the right hon gentleman has paid to mr whitelaw reid of course i have not the knorwledge which the prime minister possesses of the

understanding which now exists and has for many years existed between the two great branches of the englishspeaking race hear hear the right hon gextleman did not dwell so much ontbbranch of the subject as upon that other branch appropriate to the ambassador of the united states and appropriate to the ambassador of no other country however intimate and friendly our rela tions with that other coiuntry may be the primo minister has dwelt with admirable taste and eloquence upon the position which has so often and for eo long been occupied by distinguished citizens of the united states who have come to this country and worthily represented that great community in the land from which both sprang we in great britain have always been anxious and have always extended to those representatives not merely the considera tion due to those who represent a great and friendly power but something much more something much deeper something much more intimalte and we have welcomed them as the prime mlinister truly said into the very arcana of our social life hear hearthe functions that fau to the representa  tive of the united states in their naturepeculiar were most admiably fulrilled by the departed statesman i had the happiness as doubtless had many i am addressing to be honoured with his friendship aud i shall never forget the kindness hp always extended to me as i kroow he did to others with whom he from time to time entered into close and intimate converse the more any man knew of mr whitelaw reid the more competent ho was to appreciatp his ardente ightened patriotism and the bonds of broad and generous sympathy which made us feel that he also belonged to us his sympathy for england never allowed us to forget that he was representative of another but a kindred nation if i may express an opinion i inow is universal on this side of the house letmesay i think the government have been weu advised in taking the course the right hon gentleman has announced i am glad they have seen their way to extend this honour from the british race to one of the most distinguished citizens of the united states and i think what they have done will be received
