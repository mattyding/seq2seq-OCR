london tuesday january  the journal des dabcts anxious as it would appear to make the various departments of its poli tical system hang well together has trayelled far for weapons wherewvith to bastinado french demo cracv and by implication am thiers and his tiends thisgrave conservative and guizor jour mal has brought its own fire of haughty royalism to bear upon the ultraradical message of mr van burnn to the legislature of the united states it can snd nothing in the message but rabble politics that locument it calls  a manifesto of the democratic a party in support of doctrines which they have been a disseminating for many years and which unhap pily had enjoyed a complete triumph until the very last election there is however much and pointed truth in the severe renmarks of the dclets upon two fatal sentiments of which  america does not stand alone in offering an exam n pleto the worldtake that you gentlemen of the crtrene gauchle that of a spirit of independence  carried to excess and that of an intolerant hatred aof all superiority thus adds the french olicial newspaper does mr van bunew make a last appeal to that gloomy liberty and that inexo rable jealousy the whole article of the journal des deats would be worth translating for its elo quence and for the tone of deep and indignant re prehension of the brutalizing spirit of extreme equality which pervades it and it is to be regretted that want of space deprives our readers of its per sal for we have seldom seen a more forcible or more edifying exposure of the tendency of ila thing called  movement when it once gets ahead and infects the habits of a people to batter down all intellectual excellence all emi tence whether of personal worth or social influence er wordly prosperity or distinction however nobly acquired and founded as being of an aristocratic dcaracter to one dead level of distrustful and dreary mediocrity  those says the journal des dbats  who would prepare for every man and for every people a sort of isolated and repulsive existence are grossly ignorant of human nature they turn their backs upon the road which leads nations to equanimity and to greatness and in yidual men to peaceable prosperous and virtuous lifeto a life of freedoma alsobecause freedom consists in the exercise of the spiritual facultiesw whilst isolation cannot fail to paralyze and famish the most precious of those faculties such men are guides to a life at once base and brief true coun seuors of miserthis is not the first although nearly the best ani madversion that has of late appeared upon that re pulsive selfsufficiency and selfdependence which distinguishes the democrats of north america from amost all other nations of the earth but which in the judgment of the french editor seems naturally xo associate itself with other attributes of that same spirit of morose equality which he finds to be growing amongst certain portions of his own coun trmen and of which he is wise enougli to dread and deprecate the possible ascendancythe journal des dats in some of its reflections pon americaisindebted agood deal to dp tocqus tle but has pioneered its own path in turning bem to account as a warning against imitation within the territories of louis philuppe where it concludes with an anxious hope not merely that the public energies may find vent in works of peace and in useful labours but further still that since m ma  terial undertakings alone can neither constitute fie happiness of mankind nor give consistency to public or private morals nor obtain for any people the respect and confidence of their neighbours nor astabiish the national honour nor nationality itself upon a rock governments ought to seek and cherish this latter class of elevated objects as the chief end of all their efforts and the aim of ail their political na social institutions but if public works of the ost pacific and profitable nature cannot do this for a civilized people what moral influence vill france be likely to secure over mankind by menac ngher metropolis with cannonades or surrounding t with a wall an hundred times nmore impotent against the combined numlers and skill of aimed europe than even the gigantic circumvallation of china proved itself against the tartar hordes which und it no serious obstacle to the conquest of the celestial empireby the way what has become of all our finechinese visions anid of the triumphant shouts of the downingstreet journals for the victories achieved in every quarter of the earth where and how have the english barbarians obtaincd that magnificent  indemnity for the past and security  for the future that  three millions paid down in ready money which was the burden of such pseans and the staple of so many columns of contemptuons ridicule spirted out against the duke of welwxgtox and his conservative supporters by the morning and evening press of the whigswe fear that nothing is settled instead of the little war according to the linkboy globes impertinent use of the duke of wellnrgtons ian guageinstead we say of a little wars having al ready produced great results the great opium war against china has produced no resuts at all not a shiling of indemnitynot an approach to a treatynot even a promise to negotiate worth the least relianceanld what have we really and definitively accom plished in the east of europe what is the actual state of affairs between mehemet ali and the sultan where is still the army of inaxibm pasha how far has he proceeded on his march towards egypt has the turkish fleet arrived at constantinople or is it at alexandria still has the prolongation of the contest therefor in syria the fighting is not yet overnot yet produced any change of posture or return to ilhumour in the french government admiral duperre has at this moment in toulon  sail of the line well manned which our slips as is complained of by scores of british officers in the mediterranean are not nor in a safe condition for conflict wvith a skilful european enemy is our quarrel with the united states made up or the slightest ap proximation towards it ask mr van burmn who hopes as every american president has hoped and every british minister for so many years but not a single point is yet decided nor a single atom of american tenacity relaxed nor a single ground of hope established though many of apprehension which did not exist ten years agothen in fact there is nothing settled anywhere east west north south there is nothing settled yet out of such nothingness a quees speech must be vamped up and everything like an amendment sneered atwill the speech allude to the state of ireland and the repeal agitation too we guess not
