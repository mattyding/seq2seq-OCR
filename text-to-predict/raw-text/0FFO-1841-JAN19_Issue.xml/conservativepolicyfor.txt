kept togethet unless they occasionally act on the offensive it inspires them weith enthusiasmkeeps them to theirposts andinfusesfresh onergy into their it is the duty of sir robert peell as the acknowledged head of a great and powerful political partyto place himself in advance of his troops anu to liad them on victory the cry that the pear is not rinp will be useless the pear is ripe sir robert peel must respond to the cal of the country let the fortress be assailed and the rebel whig fbas he tram led to the earth it is said that it would be foolish m sir r peel to tace possession of the government without the certain pro spect of being able to carry it on for a considerable period this argument is puerile had sir rt peel surmounted the difficulties that surrounded him on the last occasion it is well knownl that he would have met parliament with a majority of at least  had the xtay proniises of support that were made to sir r peel just prior to the bedchamber intrigue been withdrawn on tho first great divo assolution of par liament would have given the conservative ministry a majo rity of oo since that time a very great change has taken place in public opinion the country has become isnequive cauy conservative and a general election at this moment would produce a large accession of strength to the constitu tional party in the house of commons the late parliameaf tary and municipal elections place this matter beyond a doubt how can any man with a knowledgc of these facts maintain that the pear is not ripe sir r peel is said to be regardless of office that he is a man of large fortune and fond of the endearments of domestie life we are ready to admit but he should remember that his position as the leader of the conservative party is one of great responsibility we cannot for one momuent believe what some assert that he is afraid of the intrigues and od position of the court it may be true that the queen wishes to retain lord mlbeaurne as her prime minister and that the ladles about the court will strain every nerve to keep their friends and relatives in their pre sent situations but the conservatives and sir r peel should recolect the factviz that her majestys position is verv much altered and that when the dtule of wellington and sir r peel were compelled to abandon the idea of form ing an administration owing to the opposition of the court the queen had no one to advise with but those who were per sonally interested in keeping the whigs in and tories ont we cannot for a single instant doubt that if on that occa sion her majesty could have consulted one who above all others would be influenced by feelings of perfect disin terestedness the conservatives would have been in power to this day the queen is married and to prince albert she wiu look for counsel in the event of circumstances render ing a change in her ministers necessary that he would advise her miajesty to pursue an unconstitutional course we will not believe for a moment again sir r peel should re collect that even supposing the queen was determined at all risks to retain the present men in office she could not do so against the expressed wishes of the house of commons aud countrvwhen sir r peel expressed to the late king his determi nation to resign in consequence of being defeated on the appropriation clause it is well known that tviuiam iv urged sir rt peel in the most persuasive language to go on he put it as a personal favour to himself and pointed out to the minister the humiliating position in which he should be placed by being compeued to recau lord melbourne to officeir r peel acted firmly but constitutionally he told the king that much ashe should like to grtify himself and his majesty by remaining at the head of the government he could not do it in opposition to the declared sentiments of the house of commons and that he must resign we merely allude to this fact to show that no minister however high he may stand in the estimation and friendship of the sovereign can set at defiance the representatives of the pee ple withont running the chance of undergoing the disagree able operation termed decapitationthe demand made to sir lt peel by the country is action  action  action  the reins of government must be seized and the lvln career of mischief and spoliation he put a stop to never did any british statesman stand in a erouder position than that to which sir r peel is now elevated like his great prototype william pitt he is destined to rule for an almost unlimited number of years the government of this country the cards are in his own hands the couserva tives are anxiossly waiting to hear from his lips the com mand  advance  and like the invincible army led on by welington they will only advance to be victorious and only retreat to eclipse the glory of their advance once the whigs are driven from their position what is there that then can reinstate them in office  in the face of a majority ofthe house of commons they cannot retain the govern ment  and if they try a dissolution eternal ruin waits them they are so situated that it is morally and physicauy impos sible for them to escape if sir r peel distrustful of his ovn splendid abilities and the conserative strength re fuse to obey the cau made upon him it is his duty to retire from his position and to resign into more re solute hands the important trusts which he has been ap pointed by the national voice to protect we firmy believe that sir r peel is alive to his position and that his conduct during the next session will give unequivocal satis faction to the conservative party fhe cry that the whiga can do no harm and that no measures can be caried with out the approbation of conservatives is now considered futile this state of affairs is not satisfactory to the country the present government is an incnbus to the nation every ap pointment that fals vacant is given without any respect to competency to the friends and relatives of the ministry it is time that matters should be changed and that those who have valiantly fought the hattle of the constitution should he placed in situstions for which their great worth and talents so fully qualify them again we repeat that pariament opens unuder the most fayonrable auspices to the con servative party and that the braggadoci languae ofthe whigs is merely indicative of the fearfl struggles whichu are lnown so freqnentt reeed ol u
