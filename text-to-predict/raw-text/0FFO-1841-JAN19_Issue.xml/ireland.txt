the first time that i have had the honour of assisting at a conservative meeting hear hear hitherto at the meetings which i have at tended it used to be our object to endeavour to remove some of the grievances b which our country was oppressed and to obtain some aitionsl portion of the constitutional liberty which the lawvs denied us here however we are met to avert the destruction of a portion of the established and constitutional rights and liberties of the irish people and when those are menaced shall wve tamely look on and submit cries of  hear hear and cheers and under what pretence is the biu introduced  on the pretence of a onesided morality the political pretence for the bil is what i cau its hypocntical side the pretence of morality i call its disgustingiside cheers if there are im proper ways and fraud by which the franchise inay be un justly attained i set my face against the abuse and would most willingly see it removed but let that be done vwithout striking down the franchise altogether hear hearmr siernan said the tories had asserted that oconneu and the priests were disturbing the country by their agita tion but he had no hesitation in saying that it was the con servatives and the tory press who wvere doing so to the detriment of the public peace hear hearmr j h lethbridge an english gentleman and a son of sir thomas lethbridge next presented himseaf and was received with great cheering he saidi need hardly state that i wish well to the present administration and  wiltell you why it is i do so because i firmly and conscien tiously believe you have nothing to expect muless from them i object to the conservatives because they assume to them selves as righteous men a suaeriority over au others in the stateand alege that to the higs are principally owving au the evils which affect this country it is no such thig and as for the misery wvhich does exist the poor law will find a remedy for it when time is given for that purpose but we see the present administration from time to time examine as they ought to do the laws and when they find ihose laws dencient set about reforming them  ear and cheers dont therefore condemn them or plunge into the other misery which the tories would inevitably brng upon the country if they succeeded to power last year being in somerset my paternal count i met a protestant clergyman the rev mr buane worth
