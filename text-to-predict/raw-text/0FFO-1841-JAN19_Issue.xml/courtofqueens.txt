ourt of otteens bench mondray jn mlynch v xurdixtnsittinis in bancolord di snlaa delivered the judgment of the conrt it this case it was an action of tort for negligence committed by the aefendants servant in leaving his cart and horse stand ing for half an hour in an open street the evidence for the piaintiff proved the fact of the cart remaining there thatthe plaintiff a child of only six or seven years of ase wassheard crring and was found to be lying under the wheel of the defendants cart with his leg broken the defendants counsel applied for a nonsait which having beenisrefused wstnesses were called to establish the defence andrit was given in evidence that after the cart had re mawed tbere a quarter of an hour many children came up the plaintiff being one of them and got into the cart and teased the horse the plaintiff having got out of the cart a bos made the horse move and the cart went over the leg of tfe plaintiff upon this state of facts the defendant clailedto have the judges direction in his favonr con tending that as the plaintiff had contributed to the accident it could not be said to be the defend antf fault the case was left to the jury who fonnd for the plaintiff it was now complained that such direction had not been given and that the verdict was contiary to the evidence it had been urged that the mis eheie had not been produced by the mere negigence of the defeedants servant but in combination with other causes bntthe presumptionwas that if a man were gauty of negigence in leaving anything dangerous in a street and an injuiy arose though by reason of the conduct of other parties the bfferer unquestionably had a right to redress if a pamskeeper returning home from his duty left his gun loaded in ap laygronnd and one of the boys fired it off and injured anotler it co ud notbe doubted that the gamekeeper must ansver in damages to the injured party in the present esean additional fact appeared the plaintiff had done wrong he had no right to enter the cart he was a cooperat in cthuse of his own misfortune and the questiozt arose whe therthat fact alone must deprive this child of his remedy the court found there was positive misconduct in this child bet tto prevent a party maintaining an action it must be founded on the plaintiffs on knowledge of the danger betsieen wilful mustake and gross negligence it was the pro vince of the jury to decide upon the circumstances of each aaw as for nstance whether the street in which the cart wasieft was a street liable to be crowded or where children were in the habit of playing and where there would in con seqiibnce be more than ordinary danger had not the plain tiff been egually in fault and couldn he theni maintain his actin t this might be a question forthe jury to be decidedby theliiview of the understanding and motives of the party the defendant had tempted the chbld by leaving the cart there under the circumstances the court was of opinion that there washo rule of law that prevented the action being main taint the case had been left to the jury and they had de dideilin favour of the plaintiff the rule must therefore be diechargedwttes v the marl of

looking at this publication he was very sorry to be supposed to give the least approbation of the tone and manner of it it was not the way in which a puolication connected with an honourable profession ought to etpress itself and supposing the provocation to be ever so great it was an abuse of the situation of an editor of a pube journal to visit any individual who might hbae offended himpersonalls with attacks of this kind but the question was vhethor the court ought to make the rule absolute and his reason for thinking the court ought not to do so was that he wsas confident that if the facts which must have been known to the prosecutor and the motives which actuated ir watts and which must also have been known to the prosheator had been laid before the court the rule would
