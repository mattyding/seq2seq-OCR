declaring that in the event of lord eastnor coming forward they would vote for his lordship but should he decline the honour of representing them then mr darcy might reckon on their support akfter the canvass mr darcy issued the following address which he was nun der the necessitv of getting printed in another town the only printer in ifeigate refusing to print it electorsi have now nearly completed my canvass of this borough the severity of the weather has prevented me from heretofore paisig my respects to a very few of the dis tant voters gentlemen i thank yon collectively and indivi dually i have seen all except some eight or ten for the great courtesy and favour with which you have received me a stranger to your borough though a resident in the county permit me to assure you that whether opposed or unopposed successful at the poll or unsuc cessful i saluu never regret ha  come down amongst you and nade your acquaintance i feel that i am especially called upon to express my pratitude to that imnpoztant bodv of the electors whose poelitical principles are mere liberal than my owm they received me one and all itha straiglt fonvara and manly kindness wvhich i assare them i appr ciate upon these i again would urge that however they niay wish to see their borough raised from the slough of rottenness and the depth of degradatien to a constituency of freeborn engshmenif they realy and practicauy desire to effect it the owect can he attained onty by supporting one who like myself belongs to the liberal theenlightened and popularsectionof the cn servatives lord bacon has well observed that good isten tions unless they can be put in action are no betterftian good dreams pleetors of reigate cease to dream of free dom come forth and assert it that the represertation of the rights liberties and interests of a large bodyaf peorle in the peoples house should be like a picture or a rece of afr niture an heirloom ins a fainily was before the referr biu a matter to be regretted w hilst under the old system at sright be at the same time palliatetl and explained  but iu the present state of things that any one man should be enauled to compel other men to choose after the old gatton fasion any body for their representative down to his blaerksersnt is as atrocious as it is absurdthe address concludes with thanking the electors for their promised support shortly
