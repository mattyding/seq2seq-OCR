the case was argued on saturday last upon which occasion the attorneygeneral mr clarkson and r bodkin appeared for the prosecution mrjervis andnr c phillips for the prisoners and mrlaurie for the

errors and defects of a formal naturc which they stated to exist in the proceedings searches had abeen made in the honse of tho prisoners without any warrant  the prisoners were also committed on some occasions without any warrant the evidence given be fore the justices was not taken down in full at the time when it wasgiven but npon a subsequent occasion the charge itself wasexpressecin language which the learned counsel contended to be illegal and absurd and the evidence given in support of it wras either inadmissible in law or in sufficient in factthe attornetgeneital mr clarkson and mr bon xsm contended on the other side that the statements which were made before the justices were sufficient in substance to justify the magistrates in ordering the prisoners to be de tained for trial and that to admit the prisoners to bail upon the ground of mere technical deficiencies and irregularities even supposing what was not the case that the objections upon that score were all well founded would put in danger the attainment of the ends of justice the attorneygene ral in the course of his observations expressed a high rc spect for the conduct and character of sir peter laurie who had presided npon some of the occasions when the examina tion of the prisoners took placemr laurie who appeared on the part of all the magis trates observed that their only object was to secure as far as was possible for them the attainment of justice and that the manner in which the evidence had been taken in the present instance was in perfect conformity with the course which had been pursued in that respect at the mansion house for the last  yearsmr justice williams after hearing the argument ad journed the decision and took home all the papers to readthis morning upoix coming into court his lodship aid that no case haa ever come before him in whichh headfounnd so much difficulty in coming to a conclusion satisfactory to his own mind the difficufties which he had encountered were not however the result of any legal principle for he be lieved that he could find sufficient authorty in decided cases to enable ihim to get over the objections to the want and form of the warrants and to the manner in which the depositions bad been taken the course which had been adopted in this respect was certainly open to niuch observation all that he should however say upon that point at present was that the agatrates ought to read over carefully the statutes of philip and mary together with the later acts of parliament which had relation to the same subject and that if they intended to continue to take the depositions in the same way thev ought to be well assured that the statutes in question afforded some authority for such a proceeding this method of mak inapartial examination of witnessesat one time and merely maing alight minutes of the proceedings and then expand ing those minutes into fuller statements upon some subse quent occasion ought certainly to have sonie very clear and decisive authority in its favonr if it was to be continuedthe ateorneygeneral said that he vished to take the liberty of saying that the practice according to which the depositions were takeu at the mansionhouse was clearly illegal although it had existed for  years the practice ouoht therefore to be discontinued immediatelyglrlaurix upon the part of the magistrates observed that the practice was not peculiar to the city justices but was the course adepted at the metropolitan policeoffices he hadhowever no doubt that the magistrates upon hearing his lordships opinion from the city solicitor would immediately conform their proceedings to the opinion which had been ex pressed by the coutrtlupon the suggestion of mr justice williasms a sort of compromise was then entered into between the parties and the prisoners were remanded upon the prosecutors under taking to proceed against them in a regular and effectual manner within three days and to bring thenr before the central criminal court for trial as soon as could be reasona bly expected in the circumstances of the casethe queen t srsonthe late fatal accidect upoxthe london and birusinegax rasliwarsir v follett applied to the court for a certiorari to brin up the inquisition which had been taken upon the death of simpson one of the engineers of the abovemen tioned road and another person named dawson who was also in the service of the company the jury it seems had found that simpson had murdered dawson and that simp son himself was felo de se there were various objections to theinquisitionbut one alonewouldbe sufficient to entitle him sir w follett to the rule for which he pryed it appeared that the jury having found that simpson had murdered dawson and afterwarids murdered himself and that he was therefore guilty of two felonies went on to find that the carriages were moving to the death of the parties and levied a deodand upon them ac cordingly to find that the carniage was moving to the death is in fact to find that the death was the ressit of accident and the inquisition was therefore upon the face of it inconsistent with itself whilst the deodand was illegally awarded as it could only be levied where an inianimate thing vwas itself the sole cause of the death vhere the killing was found to be felonious the party who caused the death forfeited all his goods and chattels and the agiving of a deo dand in such a case was against the principle of utility as well as in opposition to the rnle of lawmlr justice williams observed that the question was im portant aiid granted the rnlethe court sat at nisi pxis at il and heard a few cases which were undefended or unimportant
