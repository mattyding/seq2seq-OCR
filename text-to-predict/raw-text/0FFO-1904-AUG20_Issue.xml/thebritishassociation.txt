year is mr axubrey strahan who dealt in his presidential address with the interesting and highly important subject of the nature of those great earth move menets and disturbances that have sculptured the earths surface at repeatsd intervals during geological history ee illustrated his address by a geological map specially prepared by himselfin tho course of his address mr stsaar said that the evrdences of the prodigious movements to vwhich strmta had been subjected and of the extent to which demndation had ensued could not fail to strike the most superfoial observer both mountain and plain presented in varying degree proof that sheets of sedimentary materisoriginally horizontal were now folded and fractured apparently the rocks had been fixed in their plicated con dition and were liable to no further disturbance nowhere in the world could we see strata undergoing such violent treatment as they had experienced in the past hrow then could we disputo the inferenco that the forces by which the folding was prodaced had ceased to opeato  before accepting a conclusion which would amont to admitting that the globe was moribund and that the forces by which land had been differentiated from sea had ceased to act we should do well to look moro closely into the history of the earthmovements to which any particular region had been subjocted the investigation was one which calls for the most intimate knowledge ofthe geological structure and as time wvould admit of his deal ing with a small area only he would conine his observa tions to england and wales selecting such facts as had been established beyond dispute at the outset of the iuvestigation wo found reason to conclude tbat the move ments so far as any one region was concerned had been intermittent on extending our observations we were led to infer that tho movements of the crust wero developed regionally not universally urithertheomove maents of ono region wero not necessarilycontemporaneous wriththose of

determination of the age of adisturbaneo was seldom easy and among tho older painozolo roeks often impossible but at the close of the carboniferons peried during tho great continental epoch which led to and followed apon thedeposition of tho coal measures there came into action a set of movements of olevation and compression which generally could be distinguished both from those which preceded themn and from those which bad been superimposed upon them the distinction dopended upon the determination of the age of the rocks aftected by the movements one of tho most clearly proved examples of prepermian faulting permism denoting the magnesian limestone series in the carboni ferous rocks occurred in the whitebaven coalfield the fault formed the southcastern limit of the coal measures tlnd had been precisely located for a distance of six miles it formed part of the upheaval wlhich brought the older rocks of camberland and westmorland to the surface and in that sense might be said to form the northwestem frortier of the lake district on the northeasternsidealso of the lake district the permian rocks rested upon up tilted carboniferons strata burt the axis of npheaval ran in a northnorthwesterly direction and defined what we mnight regard as tho northeastern frontier along this frontier much movement had taken placein postpermian times but the unconformablo relations of the permian and carboniferous rocks enabled us to distinguish that part of tho tilting which intervened between the two periods on tho southeastern frontier also tho car boniferous rocks had been upheaved and denuded before the permisa sandstones were laid down mho south western frontier was defined by a stiu more mared un conformable overlap by the permian strata which here passed over ta edges o tho lowest members of the car boniferous series and cmo to rest upon tho lake district rocks we had thus defined the sides of an oblong tract which was upheaved in tho period inder consideration tho older rocks forming the northern part of tlat tract had already had imposed upon them a dorminant north easterly strie by a precarboniferous movement of great snergy as a result also of that and other movements they bad boen subjected to vast denudation not only in thae lake district but throughout the northwest of england generally but while it was doubtful whether any of the physical features then produced bad survived it seemed to ha beyoud dispute that it was in consequeneo of tho prepermian movements that the older rocks of tho lake district were freed from their rhboniforous cover

of activity along en old line of disturbance was a fact proved by the unconformities visible among the precarhoniferous rocks and it was importaut for the reason that the geography of this part of the globo at the commencement of the carboniferoas period had been determined by these maovements it had long been known for example that the parts of tho counties of stafford warwick and leicester traversed by the axes of upheaval were not submerged till late in the carboniferous period on the other hbnd some of the area lying immediately west of tho mlvernian axis was submerged at an earlier date as was shown by the existence of carboniferous limestone mt cleobty mortiiner and in greater develop ment in the forest of den the borings near nortz ampton also proved the presenco of carboniferons lime stone a fact which was in favour or the occurrence of aoncealed coalileds in so far as it indicated that tho whole carboniferous series might have once existed there it was
