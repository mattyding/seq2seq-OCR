terharvest of the redgrousefrom a corrpspodftait may be that the committee appointed by lord onslow to inquire into the causes of grouse diseaso and to propose if possible beneficial mewsures for provention or cure will revolutionize the faith of grouso preservers if they do so they will have effected almost as much as by stamping out the disease the prcsent faith is some what paradoxical ia its nattue it may bo expressed in this form if you want grouse you mnst shoot hard and ktep down the stock this is what tho fear of disease bas dorte and it is actually worse than the disease itself for it results in there being at no time enough stock on tho moors to breed in a good season enough young grouse to mnake really good sport  wvas bad for breeding and besides it was a disease year  has confessedly been a splendid breeding season the health of tho grouse except in a very few small areas is unquostioned and yet there appear to have been fewer big bags made on august  than in the bad year of  before making any remarks upon tae errors of a system that advises the slaughter of the old birds for the purposo of increasing the youmg ones it will be necessary to contrast the

may be said as a reflection on modern methods of preservation that coionol canipboll somo years ago made the record bag over dogs on this moor for he kdlled  brace to his own gun in the day on rlannochlodge mir flemings party had  brace last years bagwas  brace for six guns nnd that of tho year before  brace when the late mtr cecil rhodes shot over the moor at the iarraoks grouiid which adjoins tho lastnamed moor csptain rhodes this year had  brace on the opening day and at finnartlodge  braeo were killed by mr bassetts three gunsthe above nearly all refer to bags made over dogs the lowlands of scotlarid whore they usaally begin with driving the grouse and the border counties were last year so badly swept by disease that it is not expected that there was old stock enough left to produce big bags this season the same is true of the wonderful moors in tho teesdale district of yorkshire but in all cases disease seams to have disappeared and the few old grouse left have done the best possible for the reproduction of the species but the disease has broken out on lord boltons moors in the richmond district where last season pro duced a best on record  and some of lord wharaclifies moors aro also badlv affected and some will not be shot over this season on the other hand lord balfour on the apedail rmoorsis said to have a splendid lot of grouse and upnvards of  brace are reported to have been killed on the opening day both last year and the year before pro duced upwards of that bag and all of this is equally true of mr vyners moors at askrigg which have again topped  brace of eourse au these yorkshire bags are made by driving the birds  at the same time mr walter morrison still continues the use of dogs in that countytheduke of devonshire entertained his royal highness the prince of wales last year at bolton abbey when  brce were killed on the opening day and  brace this year improved on the royal sport of last seasonon the dfidgley and lower wadsworth moors mr t f rileys party of seven gunsbagged brace the same guns bad exaetly the same bag lest season tho walshaw moors were shot by lord savile who had s brace for live guns last season  braeo were bagged by six performerssome of tho best moors in yorkshire have not yet been shot over aud the same is true of the scotch driving moors but asfar as can be judged from the work already done the record driving bag for a day of  brace on the broomhead moors is no more likely to be challenged than tho dog bags mentioned above as having been obtained on monzie and at grantuly ieed in spite of the much better breeding season big bags were not as frequent on august  as inst year when nearly all prediction was unfavourable with the splendid breeding season of  there is only one regrettbat the old stock was too small to make a firstrate year possible there hbs never been any proof that nnmbers bring disense and when an average of a grouse to an acre is a splendid bag it is barely possible to think of overcrowding the most wonderful grouse production ever knowvnss something over  grouse on the  acres of wemmergill in  and it is feared that nothiing like this will be possible again lutil the grouse commission or something else has destroyed the view that the right method of increasing the stock is to shoot hard
