dated the th inst from admiral alexeieffi submit to your majesty the report of the commander of the eruiser squatron who returned on the th inst to vladivostok with the cruisers rossia and gromoboiat halfpast  on the morning of the th just as day was breaking i approached the parallel of fusan with the craisers rurik rossia and gromoboi under full steams forty two miles from fiisan and  miles from the northern lightship of tsu shima island i turned estwards we soon perceived ahead of us to our right abouat eight miles to the north a japanese squadron of armoured cruisers which was holding a parallel course with us it con bisted of four vessels of the iwate type we veered to the left and steaming at full speed mlade a course to the northeast with the object of reaching the open sea the enemy who had the advantage in steaming power turned immediately and held a parallel course foreing me to accept battle the sght begi at  oelock in the morning at a distance of moie than  cable lengths shortly ifterwar asen clclass criser of the naniwa type was seen approahinr fron tho southern atraits to rejoinu thenemy observing my intention to miake for the open sekktovajrdls the northeast the cruiser shaped tsdoffise our direction and thus prevented the eieution of our mnancuvre consequently choosing a favourable moment i turned sharply to the right and steamed towards the northeast calculating that i should be able to turn nortlwards before i reached the korean coast this manceuvre was not noticedin timeandas our speed had now increased to  knots it seemed highly probable that we should succeed in our intention but in less than five minutes the rurik left the line and hoisted the signal  steer ing gear not working i accordingly signalled to her to steer by means of her engines and to keep on in our course not receiving a reply to that signal and seeing that all the japanese cruisers were concentrating their fire on the rurik ail my subsequent manceuvres had the sole object of affording her an opportunity of repairing her damaged steering gear by drawing on myself the whole of the enemys fire in order to cover the rurik at this moment we noticed two other second and thirdcliss cruisers coming up to join the enemy the signal i cannot steer was then hoisted in the rurik mancenxvring in front of her i gave her an opportunity of retiring in the direction of the korean coast then two miles distant about  oclock the signal to make for vladivostok was hoisted this the rnrik repeated and held on the desired course the wave raised by her bow indicating that she was steaming at great speed she followed in the wake of the cruisers rossia and gromoboi towards the northwest fighting all the time with the enemy who held a parallel course at a distance of  cable lengths from us the rnrik was then about four miles southwest of usthe light had now lasted fully two hourwe had sustained considerable damage in the cruiser rossia three funnels were holed and three of her boilers were rendered useless she was thus unable to keep up full steam about halfpast  the rurik began to lng very much behind and she again began to veer from side to side we saw that two secondclass crnisers had effected a junctionl and were engaging her thereafter she was quickly lost to sight as admiral kamimura however was following us steadily with four armoured cruisers and was thus drawing away from the rurik i continued the fight on this course luring the enemy further away to the north in the hope that the rurik would beat ofi her two opponents and in spite of the damage she had sustained would be able to reach vladivostok under her own steam shortly before  oclock the enemy with daawing to about  cables distance opened the most deadly fire of the whole engagement lead ing us to believe that he would afterwards come up to attack us but to our general astonishnent his whole squadron still firing bore away from us the ships turning to thezrightbin succession and ceasing fire after five hours desperate fightingi immediately proceeded to ascertain our losses and the extent of the damage we had sustained in the rossia  holes had been made below the waterline and six in the gromoboi the losses of officers in the two cruisers exceeded half their total number while those of the men amounted to  per cent of the entire strength in view of the abovementioned circumstahees it was absolutely impossible to renew the light by returning to the spot where we had parted from the ibrik which was then  miles to the south it was necessary to stop the engines taking advantage of the calm weather hurriedly iepair the more serious breaches and proceed to vladi vostokin the cruiser rossia our casualties werebilled captain berlinsky wounded

iburied at sea nvith the exception of captain ber linsky  i in conclusion i consider it my duty to testify to the gallant conduct and devotion to duty dis played by the officers and men of the squadron they behaved as if they were made of iron know ing neither fear nor fatigue obliged to quit their hammocks to hurry into the fight and being un able to take food of any kind beforehand at the end of five hours of battle they still fought with the same vigour and steadfastness as at the begin ning of the actioni consider it incumbent upon me to add to this report of the commander of the squadron that after making a personal examination of the cruisers all of which were damaged by the enemys projectiles and taking into consideration the losses we sustained i have been able to appreeiate the high degree of firmness eonrage and selfsacrifice with which the respective crews discharged their duty in this unequal battle against numerically superior forces of the enemythe port

accomplished very fortunately but took two hours at  oclock the commander of the squadron had hoisted the signal to makeforvladi vostok just as the sortie began the enemys ships began to assemble from different points at a quarter past  the flotilla of mine dredgers returned to port arthur and the squadron steamed out making at first eight and then ten knots and reached the open sea the sloops gunboats and torpedoboats of the second division went back to port arthur convoying the flotilla of dredgers at noon the squadron was doing  knots a squadron of the enemy composed of the battleships asahi mikasa a vessel of the fpuji type one of the shildshima type and the armoured cruisers nishin and kasuga was to our port steaming so as to cross our course on the horizon were three cruisers of

fleet again approached us an at a quarter to  when it had come within  cables the second battle opened the cesarevitch put about and steaming along the line signalled  the admiral transfers the command the senior admiral was rearadmiral prince uikhtomsky seeing that the enemy was endeavouring to surround our squadron which at this moment was falling back while pouring in a withering fire on the enemys battleships with its stern guns i decided to break through the weakest spot in the enemys line vwithout loss of time having signalled to my squadron to follow me i left with the askold at the head to cut a passage we were struck by the opening shots behind me came the novik and at some distance followed the pallada and the diana the cruiser squadron was sent to cut another passage and encountered four of the enemys secondclass cruisers and several torpedoboats while to the right of it were three cruisers of the matsushima type the seven japanese ships riddled our cruisers with shells approaching the enemys circle i remarked that one of the four cruisers blocking our waywas a vessel of the asama type the quickfiring guns of the aslold seemed to do some damage to the three japanese secondclass cruisers while they also set fire to the big cruiser which then retired leaving the askold a free passage four of the enemys battleships then approached and attacked the askold firing four torpedoes which however did not hit her a japanese torpedoboat was sunk by a lucky shot from one of the askolds in guns while another retreated precipitately the fight which was of a most severe character lasted  minutes shells fell like hail and did much damage to the askold which how ever succeeded in getting through the enemys line followed by the pallada and diana the japanese cruisers started in pursuit of the askold and the novik but steaming at a speed of  knots we rapidly drew away from them dark ness had by this time set in and i could not see whether the pallada and diana were following us or not the japanese ultimately gave up the pursuit and i consequently slowed down to wait for the other ships moreover the damage done to funnels and boilers and holes below the waterline rendered slow steaming necessary i went on slowly until dawn shaping a course which kept me well out to sea in order to avoid torpedo attacks from shantung the cruiser novik which possesses a good turn of speed was allowed to act independently in order to gain time in view of possible attacks and in conformity with the plan for breaking through the blockading fleet agreed upon beforehand and known to all the com manders the askold shortly after dawn put on speed without however overworking the engines or straining too much the parts already damaged it was thenl discovered that the askold had suffered severely from the concentrated fire of the seven japanese ships which was directed against her alone the destruction of two of the vessels funnels necessitated an increase in the quantity of coal eonsumed and obliged us to give full play to the ventilators which led to a greatly increased emission of sparks  in consequence of the damage done to the ships and the short supply of coal i was obliged to give up my intention of proceeding to vladi vostok through the korean archipelago the condition of the cruisers was such that without being docked they could not be safely navigated and i therefore decided to make for the neutralport of shanghai at  minutes past sin the iorning of the th inst i approached bondolon island where i anchored i left shortly after

connrsapondlmtberlii aug the lrtuz zeitung discusses at considerable length the recent naval actions which have culminated in the dispersal of theiport arthur fleet and the opinion is expressed that the russian admiral when he made his sortie had no intention of fighting admiral togo but that he simply desired to gain the open sea at all costs this intention can in the opinion of the critic be read between the lines of the russian commanders report the attempted flight vwas not only a failure but a grave mistake inasmuch as if only the russian fleet had resolutely advanced to the attack more damage might have been inflicted upon the japanese while greater loss could scarcely have been sustained up to a certain point the opposing fleets were not unevenly matched and a bold offensive action on the part of the port arthur fleet might possibly have improved the prospects of the new squadron from the balticthe result of admiral kamimuras engagement with the vladivostok cruisers inspires the berlin journal with still greater amazement the four japanese cruisers were certainly neither collec tively nor individually superior to their three large opponents and the advent of the two small eruisers naniwa and takachiho appears to have occurred only some four hours after the two squadrons bad engaged nevertheless according to admiral alexeieffs report the russians endeavoured to seek safety in flight during the progress of the action finally the abandonment of the rurik by her consorts is condemned as being  unsatisfactorysevere fighting at portarthurpositmons captured w t

dwells at length on the growing importanee as revealed by what is now going on of the navy in mnodern warfare as deeply convinced as is the most ardent partisan of captain mahan that without command of the sea no military suceess is possible this writer says that if a line of sub marines had protected the coast and an outer line of submersibles had policed the open sea the japanese would not have been able to disembark without enormous losses if not complete disaster moreover if in the recent desperate sortie of the port arthur fleet the japanese had not been victorious all the past successes of the japanese army in manchuria would have been of no value and that army would probably have had to capitulate thus far therefore in m lockroys opinion the only real victor is admiral togo not the generals in manehuria as to the possibility for the russians of retrieving their position by means of the baltic fleet the exminister of marine is more than sceptical russia possesses not a single
