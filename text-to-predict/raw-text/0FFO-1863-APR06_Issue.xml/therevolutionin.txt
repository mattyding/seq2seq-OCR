i the rievolution in greeck from our specl corbes fmronmathens manch  i said in my last letter that if the greeks were asked byf uniiversal suffrage what their wishes were at that moment  out of  would answer to go to sleep and not to awfake until a presentable candidate wvas ready to meet their opening eyes this iumost desire of the greek people has been almost literally satisfied and sooner than could be expected although not a minute earlier than it was wanted since i wrote greece has passed through a week of political torpor and a candidate is now presented or rather to speak diplomatically suggested to her a candi date more flattering than the wildest greek fancy could have expected in these latter days when the smallest serene highnesses who figure in the almanach de gotha scoffed at the idea of a con nexion with klephtis and palikarislong was the time the greoeks had to wait many were the scoffers who tried to shake their confi dence but their patience was not to be exhausted and they resisted the temptersas usual the news of the candidature of prince william of denmark found its wvay to the public some time before any official information but ike ill other rnmours lately cuzrent about candidates without producing much impression that first love and strange infatuation of the greelks for prince alfred is of too recent date to allow of a feeling growing up in favotur of anyone else while their experiences in the search after a candidate have been so mortifying as to render them diffident and rather inclined to pause and make sure of success before they give themselves up to premature hopes  the rumours of a danish candidature attracted therefore little more notice than that of the dake daumale prince guillaume of baden or any other of the ntumerous visions of candidates which have passed before the eyes of the greeks what was the use of troubling themselves with it finding out au imazinable advantages be ginning to think it rather acceptable and then being told that it cannot be that the candidate him self will not accept and that no else would accept him in europe candidates seemed so fanciful and foreign powers so fastidious aud disposed to cavilat last however the telegraphspoke earl russell had already previously informed mr elliot that prince wilhiau the second son of prince christian of denmarkseemed aneligible candidate to her mlaiestys government but that it was not known whether he and his family would accept now mir elliot was informed that both the younig prince and his father had consented and that there remained only the approbation of the king of den mark as head of the family to be asked for together with the telegrams fror london came one from lord cowley in paris stating that the em oeror of the french cordially approved and sup ported the proposition of the danish price and that x drouyu de lhuys had bent instructions to that effect to the french minister at athensthis second piece of informationfrom paris was almost as important as that from london for al though the lonain for a siettled state of things is so great that the reeks re ready to take almost any candidate suggested by one of the powers above au by england stisl opposition or even a silent aquiew cence on the part of france is liable to encourage intriguers and frighten the timidyou could see this clearly from what actually happened as soon as the first excitement of the news had abatedevery one began to inquire whether the french minister had likewise received a tele gram and whether he had spoken in the matter it was known that a few days before when the news existed in the shape of a rumour and was re produced in oae of the local papers the french minister had expressed himself very strongly against the candidature as one which france could never tolerate so there was considerable anxiety to know whether this rather premature announce ment of the views of the french government was founded on some previous information or whether it merely represented the unassisted private opinion of the french menister well a telegram had come but the fnch mlinister said nothing for a couple of days and greek countenances fell considerably not that they doubted the correctness of the infor mation sent to mr elliot from paris but they began to suspect all kinds of afterthoughts and underhand intrigues on the part of the french government saying one thing to the british ambassador at paris and acting in an exactly opposite maner at atliens it was quite provoking to hear the absurd conjec tures which tii suspicion of a double dealing on the part of france suggested and yet it seemed natural enough that the french minister who had uttered a decided personal opinion one way should wail as long as possible to announce the instructions of his government which ordered him to act another way the mail camefroxi paris and there was no delay possible accordingly al bouree informed the minister of foreign affairs and all those who came that his instructions were to answer if he was asked that the emperor cordially supported the candidature you would have thought this was clear enough hut stress was laid on the phrase if he was asked and some hidden meaning sought in an inoffensive phrase which meant only what every one knewnamely that iengeland had taken the initiative in the candidature of the prince of den mark which france cordially supportedone might ask and what of russia she has almost entirely vanished from the scene here so that the declaration on her partthat shevwould have no objection if a prince of demnark were chosen as king of greece was taken as a matter of in differencethus after five months of uncertainty there is at last a fair prospect of a settlement the news has been officially communicated to the committee of the assembly charged specially with the election of the king the committee is already busy in making its report which will be submitted to the eouse in the couse of nest fweek there is little doubt that the great majority of the assembly is as anxious as the mass of the people for a king but there always have been and there still are individuals who find it pleasant to form a portion however infinitesimal of the sovereign power of the people and who still flatter themselves to make their way during the interreg num what the number of these individclals may be it is difficult to say but certain it is that they form the most activeand enterprising portion of the assembly and it wouldbe suprisig indeed if they did not make an effort to defeat the candidature of prince william and thus leave the chances a little longer open for themselves if france had been contrary to the candidature or even silent about it they might probably have acted successfully on the timidity of their colleagues btut under the circum stances i donet believe this will be the casenevertheless the most likely course is that uni versal suffrage will be resorted to again which ever side may have the superioritywhether that one which is for the propositionorthe one which will be against it the other will be sure to urge an appeal to universal suffige which with the precedent in the case of prince alred before us can scarcely be denied if asked forthe present mlinistry which is decidedly for the proposition has sent telegaphic messages all over tle country and everywhere the news has given great satisfaction in many places preparaxtions are made for manifestations of pablic opinion ad dresses to the assembly and other demonstrations indicate that popular feeling is favourable to the candidature and above all that it is anxious to put an endto the present uncertainty by hastenimg as much as possible the choice of a king should the assemebly raise difficulties it is by no means impro bable that public opinion may help to solve them by applying a gentle and healthy pressure to those who would fain raise their fortunes nt the expense of the countryin the meantime it is easy to see that there is a fair chance for the success of prince wvil liam of denmark for the personal interests in the assembly begin to stir notice has been given to the mlinisters that their presence was re quired on mionday next to answer divers questionis among them are some respecting promotions made by the minister of war they almost all concern men who took part in the nauplia affair and thus lost their turn of promotion the ministry very justly thought that it was but fair to them to make up for the loss they suf fered when acting as the pioneers of the revolution which brought about the present state of tlhings the other qulestion concerns the budg tet the ministry nnder bulgaria had already proposed a budget in which iooo figured under the head ef exenzes ils the project presented by the preaent m nistryhe expenses hate been redncedto zzoooooo f diie rdct seemed to the menavers of the assembly not cnoughaud it was received  very coolly wfhen it was broaht forward towards the end of last weekno one is talen in by these interpellationa for their meaniug is to turn out the ministry it will be the reopening of a struggle for power all those who have a tollowing in the assembly will nmake au effort to be in power when the election takes place and the king comes whether this time the leaders will be better able to come to an under standing than they were before remains to be seen they have been working in this direction but they have likewise done so formerly and you know with vhat little success so after all the present ministry may remain a glaring instance of that party spirit which knows of no compromise and where the dif ferent leaders prefer ostracizing themselves rather thn t being reasonable in their pretensionswith the proposition of prince william of den mark engwland may be said to have made a full return for the confidence which greece placed in her when she chose prince alfred as king of greece in the first instance the greeks may have had lon to wait and they had certainly a right to com plain of the loose way in which the proposi tion of dike ernest had been managred by some one or other in london or gotla but they must be fastidious indeed if they are not satisfied with the candidate england ugguests now and franosupports they had sat their eyes and hearts on the brother of the fiutre king of england and they are now offered the brother of the future queen of england whho is the brother besides of the fuature king of denmark surely the connexion is sufficiently ilattering for a people who were looked down upon by the smallest germat princely family the prince belongs to a constitu tional country and onae which is on friendly terms with au the three protecting powers of greece that he is recommended by englandis in itself a guaran tee for constitutional rule while it facilitates consi derably the union with the ionian islandsthere remazins the q uestion of the regenev the remembrance of the formerregencyis not calcilated to nake anothar regency very palatable to the greelks but a great deal will depend onthe choice of the regent if for instance as it is hintedl prince christian could be induced to accept the offlce for a few years the regency would lose a great deal of its objectionable character for it would not be handled by a stranger but by the father of the future king nay under such circumstances a regency would have muny advan tages for a great many unpleasant measures must be enforced before the country can get rid of the evil traditions of the last rfgime and these measures if taken during the regency which is transient would leave the fnture king free to begin his career with out having caiued heartburnings or hurt the little private interests of any one of his subjects
