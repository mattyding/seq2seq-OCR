the ottojaiv bmpire wno on o cormsrovdtcontstantrnople zlpxh tnh unanimsons resolution arrived at by the re resentatives of the powers assembled in con ferenco has failed to secure any satisfactory re sult in the mioldovailachian provinces the state oe hairs on the contrary has become more crir ticl the assembly resents the interference which the representatives afected to male public by seudinlg open telegrams to the consuls at bucharest conveying the decision of the con ference and every moment threatens to bring intelligence of a serious collision between the prince and the chamber those who have taken any in terest in the rouman quiestion which is so much bound up in the eastern question cannot have failed to observe the extraordinary contradictions aud inconsistencies which have attended it in its difielrent phases and which are readily ex plined by the serious difficulties attending it sud the consequent anxiety of those interested to postpone by a patchingutp policy the evil day of a serious and conclusive investigation wvhen thle question was first opened after the treaty of paris it was the policy of the porte to show that iu the interest of both principalities it uas advisable that they should reain separate under their respectivo hlospodars and with only sucsal revision of their constitution as might be considered advisable to provide agaist future dull culties in this poecy she was strenuously sup ported by england and austria and as strenuously opposed by frauce and russia who advocated the uuion of the provinces the strong opposition of ninetenths of the moldavian people against the nion gave credit andv weight to the policy of england and the events now occlurring tend to show that it was neither shortsighted nor unsound by a combination of circumstances theresultof faction and intrigue the question of the union was strengthened by the electiol of prince couza simul taneously by the two principalities as i have previously endcavoiired to show the boyards have only themnselves to thank for that result which is nowv a thorn in their side and creates the present complications the necessary consequence of the joint election was the administrative union of the two provinces two years later at the insti gation of the powers who had originauy advo cated their fusion rather than run the risk of starting fresh complications england on that occa sion gavecan unwilling adhesion to the scheme and from that time the difficulties commenced which are noit rapidly culminating in a serious crisis at this momentthe state of parties as far as such indi cations are reliable seems to show a desire to revert to the old system as urged by the porte and sup ported by engdand both the provinces now clamour fora separategovernment under a different hospodar witlh the exception however of that section at the head of which is prince couza which has long been in the pay and interest of russia and whose object it is to maintain the union and by provoking a collision with the chamber to possess itself of uncontrolled power vith the obvious object of introducing a foreign prince in the person of the duke of lieuchtenberg in the settlement or rather the entanglement of this question of the danubian provinces everybody seems to have been playing at cross purposes the most grievous fault which has been committed was the formning of a constitution which not only tutns otut now to lbe impracticable but which it was foreseen at the outset could not by any possibility prove effective in all this there is one thilg unfortunately vhich is too apparent and tbis is that the manceuvres of those wwho oppose the dolicy of england have achieved their object and have brought the question to the critical point which vill no longer suffer or admit of any patchingup nieastures or expedients it is now the object of those acting disinterestedly and in view of the preservation of peace to wait the course of events and at the proper tilne to suggest such a revision of the constitution as may secure more beileficial resuilts the franchise as it now stands places the power of the chamber excltsively in the hands of the boyards who as i have previously shoin look only to their individual interests accoinits which i receive from bucharest state that tere are in that body no less than  can clidates for the respective hospodariates of mioldavia and wallachia under such circum rtances any understanding among the present deputies to the chlamber becomes impossible nor is there the least hope that its dissolution wvill bring about any alteration in its present disposition it would seem that in any proposed revision of the constitution the course to pursue wounld be to ex teud the suffrage to such an extent as would rid the colunty of thte baneful influence of the boyards but experience has shown how dangerous it is to open up sucih questions in this country during the discussion of routnanaflairs in  there

in the capital and within the short timueof his militaryadministration measures have been adopted for this purposein the absolute necessity of meeting these require ments recourse has been had to the local public for loans and some financial operations have bean made which excite general surprise and disapproba tion i understand that before leaving constanti nople the delegates representing the french conces sionaires of the new bank had proposed to advance to the tpurkish government a certain sum of money to enable them to release a considerable amount of conslidd which had been deposited as security with some lozal bankers and also to pay tlhe first instalment of interest due on those bonds in may next this proposition was made in order to prevent these bonds which had been pledged with power of sale from being brought sud denly on the market and depreciating turkish securities generally the terms upon which the proposed advance was based weresueh as to make it tvident that it was entered into more in the view of the future advantege of the bank and in the in terest of turkish credit than with the object of pre sent gain the amount of interest stipulated was  per cent and  pei cent commission and refer ence to the quotationof turkish securities in london iilows that it was more reasonabie than the turks had a rigtht to expect the negotiation was pro ceedingby telegraph and the french capicaistn i understand had actually pledged themselves in the mnatter when it suddenly transpired that the minis ter of finance had concluded a loan with somle local hankzers for about the same sum at the rate of  per cent interest and  per cent commission  such an inexplieable proeesding on the part of the minister of finance cannot fail to irritate the financiers who had offiered their assistance and will no doubt be a lesson to them how they make susch offers in future seeing the ground cut from beneath their feet by the ap proaching establishment of the newbank which by its convention has a prior claim as soon as it is constituted in the negotiation of such operations the local element have made one last diespairig effort to secure some of the good things to be ob tained from the turkish governmnent the result shows that they havesucceeded but it is to be hoped that the speedy constitution of the bank will render sulch freaks on the p art of the government impossible notwithstanding the onerous terms of this loan it is a proof of the beneficial effects to be anticipated by the establishment of the bank be fore the conclusion of the negotiation for that insti tution a loan even on the terms i mentioned would have been impossible now the turks far from experiencing any diffceulty have almost yielded to pressure and importunity from the local people in negotiating a loaneto the extent of  the security for that oan is a deposit of consolides for rather more than twice that amount as a great proportion of these bonds have found their way to european markets the turks feel it incumbent on them to make any sacrifice rather than fail in the paymenti of the interest and sinking fund such defaults were not unfrequent in the case of securities manufactured for local con sumption but a recurrence of such ei pedients would in this instance cause a european outcry which would not only prejudice the staniding of their present securities hut render it impossible for them to obtain any pecuniary assistance in futurea subject of considerable interest to european residerts in turkey is being discussed at the rveekly diplomatic conferences
