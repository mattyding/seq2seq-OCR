london monday aprlr  since the first week in january the military operations of theamerican war have been virtu ally suspended the skirmishes and raids in which the advantage to either side could only be trifling if decided and actions in which an equal success was claimed by both have not had any visible effect the battle of fredericksburg closed the winter campaign but the last iatelligence contains several facts that point to a renewal of active hostilities thero are also some indica tions of a general feeling that the next great movements of the war will be more decisivo than thosw which are now matters of history the impression cau hardly be derived from the con fident predictious of the organs and agents of the federal government thay have been too often contradicted or reversed by events tohave much value now the official assurance therafore that  the south must speedily yield for want of food  may not find universal belief the south is a wide region and the war has not absorbed its labour its millions of cultivators have ceased to grow cotton but wo hav not heard they are kept idle the most evident want of the south are gold and iron and these the labour at its command can not produce from the soil nor procure by com merca the disappearance of coin and the wear and tear of tce railways that cannot easily be reme died are likely to affect the military operations of the south mora than a want of provisionm the promise of a series of victories within the next two weeks that will effaectally crtish the rebel lion  has been made befora at several intervals during two years that have passed by and left the work still to ba done bat tha bold reduction of the term of ninety days to fourteen may have some decision behind it more vigoroas than usual and some plan of action may have been resolved on that reanimates the hope of success which easily takes the form of a promisewhatever degree of credit the official predictions still obtain it is evident enough from the last tele grams that the commercial circles of new york have been thrown into an extraordinary state of agitation a feverish excitement disturbs every market and interest but the cause of it cannot be clearly explained on the th of march the quotations of gold suddenly went down nearly  per cent or in other words the paper currency rose in public estimation to the same extent on the following day there was a reaetion on the  receipt of news from port c hudson and paper fell again  per cent as the rates  varied every five minutes specula tion that must at least see its way a day in advance was paralyzed the sudden fall ir gold drew everything with it in its descent tlhere was a general breakdown in the produce and mer chandise markets causing a large depreciation in prices cotton tobacco wool and provisions all felt the shock it was a disturbance of the mag netic current of commerce that would probably be explained by discovering what caused the variation in the price of gold that too au the markets by surprise accompanying this general depreciation there was an equally sudden improvement in the price of government securities within ten days  of dollars in legal tender notes had been converted into thebonds of a particular stock these investments had produced a feeling of confidence but as to the improvement in the value of paper as against gold the report adds that the fluctuation was  not justified by any cause within the cogni  zance of the publicthe clue through au this confusion must be fol lowed to vicksburg for the south this place is one of the pivots of the war and its pos session is considered so essential that the con federates will strain all their resources to re tain it equally determined are the federals to take it and of the fourth attack now impend ing the movements of commodore farnaeutns flotilla are only a part the operations by land and water are extensive and will require a complete combination to insure success the in telligence from the part of the expedition operating from the mlississippi has been contradictory and to this cause some of the disturbance of the new yorkmoneymarket is ascribed the accounts from other points are unintelligible but it appears likely thatspeculation has employed a revival of northern hope to discount some expected success not at vicksburg only but on other points to which tho official announcement of immediate action refers that some movements certainly importanit and possibly decisive are impending appears to be a general impression but it remains to be seen whether they will not be confederate successesthe conviction is strengthened by the advance of a confederate army under general j jonnstox into the neutral state of kentucky the war that has ravaged virginia will now in au probability be transferred to another territory two points bave already been takenone at miount sterling the second at danville to the south and west of it nearly in the centre of the state whatever may be the deprivations of the south they do not yet impede the march of its armies and if gene ral jornstons force is really sent into ken tucky at the request of the representatives of the state it indicates a stronger approval of the war than has yet been formally given in that great state the object of this recent movement is to establish a check on the federal force concentrated round vicksburg and if the southern command of the mississippi should be lost on that point it may be recovered on another this possibility is only one of the many contingencies that render the conquest and hostile possession of such an immense territory so hopeless for the command of the alississippi alone along the fifteen hundred miles of its navigable course two powers may fight for years and to exhaustion it is a question that must be settled finauy as on the rivers of eutrope by compromise and agreement bnt these are still distant in time though to some arrangement both sides must come at last in the south all prospect of an accommodation is abandoned it is expected that the war will continue and  be more fierce  and unrelenting than ever yet symptoms axe not wanting in the north of a growing aversion both to the war and its consequencestaxation the popular feeling in the northwest is really threatening the citizens will not aid it either by money or personal service in ohio indiana and illinois the resistance to the arrest of deserters is likely to be followed up by a refusal to pay taxes so serious have the manifestations become that the federal government has by decree prohibited the public sale of arms i in all the western cities it has to  crush a revolt with one hand and repress a tendency to a second rebellion with the other the cities ofthewest the centres of a population wvho regard firearms as domestic articles are placed in exactly the condition of polish towns nuder russian governors
