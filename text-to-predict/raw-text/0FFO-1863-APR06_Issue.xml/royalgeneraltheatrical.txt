reference to steaels paper in theatlaer in which the respctive merits of puppet over human actors are canvassed and the decision of the mayor pronounced in favour of the formsr mfr dicken pro ceeded to observe that the wicked player was still necessary were it only to afford comfort and satisfaction to a large number of wellmeaning persous who felt it to be their duty to disparage those who had caontributel to theirentertainment it wasan astonisb thing thatsthere shouldlbe amonga part of wbat as calledl the world a curious propensity to run up a littlc score against those who afforded amusement or entertainment upon the stage that could not be simaly because the actor dressej himself forthe part he had to sustain because as they all knew there was an enormous amount of dressing and making up in high stations he had never seen a wors make up in the humblest country theatre than he could see in the house of commons on anynghtwhen a message came down from the lords laughter and he had personallv known a lord chancellor with s a week who in his wi andl robes looked the part much better than the real article laugh ter the truth ho believed was that the little haraluess disposition to disparage tbe actor occupied a quiet outof theway cornier of our nature but as he rearded it as ungenerous and ungracious he hal alwas set his face against i in private as in public he

memubers it was a fund to which the members contributed periodically according to calculated scales often out of very inadequate nd uncertain earnings with all the drawbacks and bur dens upon the actor no one thoroughly acquainted with the inside of a theatre could point out any place where a more sacred bond of charitable brotherhood existed where a more certain reliance could be placed upon sympathy vith aiction wvhere there was greater generosity in ready rgvin where there was a higher and snore sacred respect for family ties or where there wvas habitually a more cheer ful vohlntary
