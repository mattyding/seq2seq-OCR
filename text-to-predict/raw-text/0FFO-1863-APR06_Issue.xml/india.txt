has been much interfered with by the intervention of the hoolee festival and the few transac tions we have to report took place chiefly in the earlier part of the fortuiht in most cases however prices

be on the way one or two of the leading european firms have also been m the market as biuyers which has further helped to xupgort prices in the bazaar within the last few days duiness has been somewhat checked by the prevalence of afoolish rumour the foundation for whichit is difficult to discover that cotton had seriously declined at home but as the mail of the th ult will probably bring news of the liverpool and manchester markets being strengthened by the advices which the steamer of the th of january took home this will no doubt soon be got over as will be seen from our quotations the pressure of scarcity is in mauy cass forcing up rates very ranidly accounts from upcountry are favourable there bei few goods in the native bazaars and a strong speculative feeling existing imm any of the large inlandcitiesexportscottonthe market during the fortnight has not changed materially and transactions since the departure of last steamer have been on a limited scale and at rates varying but little from those given in our last circular in new cotton business is still chieflyconfined to oomrawattee the quality of which continues to show no improvement we hear of a few purchases

market during the last fortnight the hoolee holydas checked business for several days and there has been but little animation in the market since the telegrams from europe regarding the price of cotton have been rather con tradictory the efect here has been to cause rather a decline in rates of freight for cotton there has not been the same pressure on the market to ship seeds and altogether with the exception of several outside country charters little busi ness has been done arrivals during the fortnight have been heavy nearly doubling in amount of tonnage the de partures and as several of the vessels have arrived in bauast there has been rather more anxiety shown bf ship masters to secure ready cotton even at a slight decline in rate we quote rates as dullfor london cotton s to c

a very fair business the present lull may in a great measurej be attributed to the near approach of a hindoo festival celebrated with great solemnity in the provinces and which naturally seriously affects the demandincaloutta atthe same timegoods are being shipped tothe ports on the east audwestcoasts ofthe bayof bengal and this demandcoupled with the reduced arrivalsof pieee goods from home tends to strengthen and hasheretofore kept up the prices ruling in calcutta it cannot be denied lowever that there is and has been for some time past a very considerable speculation by both enpeau and native merchants we must there fore be careful in calcnlating the sales and comparing these with the estimated stocks to remember that after all a considerable portion of the formeris not bond ide that is to saythe stocks in the hands of european houses are not dimi nished to the etent showvn by the amount of sales over and above the imports when we say then thatafair amount of busioes has been done we mean that a consider able quantity of piece goods haschanged hands  but it must not be understood thait the extra amount of demand among consumers is represented by the increased sales asshown in the daily lists the increased demand if there be any is not from consumers but chieflyfrom speculatorsthere has been a dullness in exports to the united king dom which seems to be daily increasing the amounts of produce having very materiauy fallen off hides alone keep iup and the price of the best northwest slaughtered may be quoted at  to  the market for linseed is rather tighter and quotations are  to  rape  salt petre without change jute  to  somewhat flatter rice table rather lower monghee  to   ballam the same for cotton fine banda  is asked shellac for d c  for orange button  to there is but little doing in exchange rates on london for local bank bil  oths firstclass credits   documents   money is decidedly easier this doubtless arises from a considerable purchase into gover ment paper the money paid for which natmuly comesinto active circulation if we also takeinto consideration the monthly drawings upon the indian treasuries generally and that of calcutta in particular by the secretary of state we need be at no loss to account for an abundance of money the more so as tho export trade has been so slutgish formerly we used to see the moneymarket become affected by the government opium sales the proceeds of which went into the treasury whence they tardily returned into circu lation bymeans of the expenditure on railways and other public works under the present state of affairs how ever the money pouriuw into the treasury to the extent of from  to  lacs mouthly is almost im mediately released by the bius drawn in england by sir chailcs wood and which have in a great mea sure superseded the bils which used to be drawn on this side against produce the high price of silver which has lately been ruliag at home makes these treasury bills a favonritemode for remitting funds from englaud to this on account of the various banks dealing in exchange formerly at certain seasons thetreasury vaults were over loaded with silver which was for al lpurposes of currency absolutely and entirely useless and the market was often pressed for the very commodit of which the governmentad an enormous amount stored upthere has been a considerable amount of speculation in government paper and it is almost impossible to give a fai estimate of the market time bargains more especially in the foar per cents have been mnade for some tsime ptand as the day
