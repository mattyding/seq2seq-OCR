foreign intelugencelfraytcea portion of the following appeaed iu our seconl sditica of saturday intom our own corkspondwnta palils fendr aprim the incident which led to the involuntary retire ment of m magne has attracted attention to the sytm of speaking jministers who are retained at considerable cost to defend and eulogize without any reference to their own opinions or wishes the acts of their effective colleagues the promptitude with which d billault performs his part of the duty in the sam department proves versatility of character rather than the possession of high principle his fellowapolooist ml mtagne would most probably have gone on performing the same irksome functions but for the irritating reflection that m fould held precisely the place which long possession had in his judgment given him a superior right to of which he is known to have made the most any one could make and for which he naturauy considered himself more fitted than any man living m magne ceitainly holds or professes to hold opinions on financial subjects as different from those of l fould as night from day this however as public men go is not much and he would have continued with the same composure as his felloworator defending measures political financial conmercial and social which as inde pendent politicians they would probably have een the first to denounce it was the ra indignatio at his heart that caused the irri tatiag warfare which he kept up against the finance minister ever since m foulds letter to the emperor and the natusocnsdtnm abolshing extrordinary credits by decree the incident has practically proved the clumsiness of the system of double sministersa system as absurd as the contri vance which according to tho abia du bs was rometimes employel on the roman stage when the pronouncin and geticulating parts were di vided and when one actor spoke and another per formed the getures and motions corresponding to what the first said fancy m billault delivering an eloquent speech in a full chamber in praise of the minister of the interior for instance and this impetuous gentleman gesticulating in concert behind him the only way to avoid the repetition of such conicts is that on import ant occasions the effective and not the bre vet minister should be allowed to defend the measures either of policy or finance they are charged to carry outunless indeed the emperor may see the propriety of abolishing the practice altogether this division of words and acts is un just to both parties and there can seldom be found between the man wrho developes an idea and him who carries it out the complete identity indiqpens able for practical puirposes but stringent as the rule is it has been more than once evaded we havc seen for instance rl thouvenel and m fould refusing to leave to others the task of plead ing for them in the senate both are members of that illustrious body and they have occasionally avasiled themnselvesof their position to explain their inisterial acts they of course premised by say ing that they spoke as senators but no one was ignorant that the explanations they gave were those of the government if minister can speak in one branch of the leglature why should they not speak in the other and more important one and when the budget comes on for discussion in the legislative body who can answer inquiries refute objections and defend a financial asytem better than the author of itprince napoleon is about to absent himsaelf from france for a short time his yacht the jerome napoleon has been ordered to get ready to sail at short notice the prince will probably pay a visit to egypt since his speech on the polishinsurrec lion a coldness has sprung up between him and the emperor the feehng was aggravated by his fajestys letter to m billault who as yon may remember was reproachad by the prince in the senate for having givenhis vote to generalcavaignae instead of to prince louis bonaparte in the contest for the election of president of the republic there was a postscript to that letter blaming the prince but which the mifoniteur did not publish it is to be hoped that this brief absence wilm restore harmony between the

that the works forthe restoration of the abbaye of st denis which were suspended for a time shall be recommenced with increased activity the repairs hitherto exe cuited were conined to the crypt of

a lady who had been married by the civil autho rities only but hlad bad her interred in the pert of the cemetery rmserved for persons who have committed suicde nothing can be maore canonical than that tho church should refuse its blessing on the day of death to persons wlho had not asked for it on the day of marriage although it might be more christian but that the church should in a certain manner abrogate the civil marriage upon which society reposes by inflicting on it a pttblic dishonour is an abuse and an eucroachment agaiast which one cannot too loudly protest in the name of morality and of the rights of famniliesin the number of the reviue contemporain wvhich has just appeared is an article on the foreign policy of fraace which purports to show that one of the things wahich the emperor has most at heart is to find  a sircere ally with a liberal and pacific policy who should cooperate with him in removing by a frank and honourable accord the formidable complications which press more heavily on the great powers even than on france though the prin ciple of that accord is the maintenance of the peace of europe with guarantees offered bylouis napoleon himself against his supposed ambition yet nothing has as yet been done the english alliance somuch hoped and sought for has not held austria in the craniean war was wanting to herself and toeurope dthring the war in italy russia mnore decided wsould have allowed france to go on to venice and complete her worl yet events have followed their course from the newv french empire dates the resuscitation of liberal ideas in europe divine right has vanished before the rights of tho people civil equality and commercial liberty are making their way in the world russia has been led to emancipate  serfs austria relaxes her inveterate policy of repression and appears to abandon her old traditions italy has once more appeared on the map of europe and the civilization of equality and christianity is penetrating to the contines of the earththe reviewer judges it worthy of special remark that hitherto france is the only power which seems desirous of maintaining peace and the only one that foresaw and prevented the formidabledifficulties which the errors of the past had left to her after the treaty of paris it was france that called the at tention of the great powers to poland and to the stipulations which are binding on russia england did not think the moment favourable but russix promised to satisfy au just demands upon her and only asked that she should be allowed time to do so of her own motion in the meantime poland is once more in insurrection and this fresh symptom of a radical disease has again appoared to afflict and disturb the world france deeply feels for her saf feringsfor those hopeless and everricnrringstrug gles and she now proposes to europe a common understanding to remedy so many evils and to decide russia to full her promisesto do in fact what her true interests command her the vrriter asks whether the voice of france will be heard but he does not answer his own question england is always enthusiastic at first on al liberal questions but her ardour soon cools down from austria the reviewer does not venture to hope anything ott behalf of poland but whatever may happen france must remain true to herself she is no longer the captive of the holy alliance when at the first emotion she seemed to be on the point of rushing on au europe and when she cursed the prudence of those who kept her back she has entered w with her eagles unfurled into the euro pean concert where she keeps her pace great and respected with her vork commenced she also has her engagements bult on the other hanld europe has duties to fulfil towards her and towards itself the wailings of poland will no doubt have been a salutary warning to all the path of justice and humanity must inevitably be entered upon and it is too evident that the repose of nations and the security and honour of sovereigns are to be had at that pricethe writer of the article of the concluding por tion of which the foregoing is an epitome is m e boinvilliers president of one of the sections of the council of statethe ilegislative corps in this its ast period will probably sit longer by a fewr weelssthan was at first supposed there is stil a good dal of business to get through and the deputies who are ambitious of reelectionas most of then arenaturallyr desire to completo it ina workmanlike manner before they go before their constituents or tho prefects the middle of june may be about the date fixed for its close but the time for holding the new elections is not as yet determined upon by the government an interval of at least  days must elapse between the promulgation of the decree convoking a new chamber and the day of election and whether the legislature reach its full term of six years or be previously dissolved by the emperorin the exercise of his prerogative the electoral colleges mtust be called together within six months from the date of the decree of dissolution or thit of the expiration of the legal term as the convocation isimperative the chamber will be kept together as long as pos sible to aow time to the administration to complete operations for the campaign its principal efforts will be directed against what are called the  men of the old parties particularly those who are advocates of a real representative system of men who advocate the control of government by the chamber and of the rational freedom for the press those who are known to the country and whofrom their moderation their talents their social position and their independence of official patronage think they have as fair a claim as other members of the community to the sufirages of the citizens are especially to be combated by all the means at the disposal of the government the return of half a dozen such persons would be con sidered a greater calamity than if a score of repub licans red or blue were to enter the chamber the speeches of politicians like jufles favre picard or ollivier may be listened to or read with plea sure aud admiration as fine samples of declamation but that is all for the principles which their names represent or represented there is no great sympathy in the coumtry it would be diferent were men of more moderate views of at least equal talent and more defined position to obtain seats in the chamber these would be listened to with attention and respect both in doors and out of doors and the concessions in favour of liberty which they would advocate would be deemed just and necessary or at any rate would not be looked upon with suspiciona certain number of individuals attached to tho court or to ministerial departments are it seems to be put forward as candidates of the government in addition to those who already have seats a chami berlain is ready to start in the vende another in the bas rhin a third in the pas de calais a master of ceremonies in the somme an officer in the grand huntsmanti department in the seineetoise and an equerry of the empress in mayenne mx de jan court the head of the home ministers cabinet will be the official candidate for meaux and there is no doubt that the whole influence of his superiorwill be brought to bear in his behalf whetherhe resigns his post or continues to hold it m do jancourt it appears is to be pitted ageainst  gareau who though known for his devotedness to the govern ment has unfortunately on two or threo occasions of no great importance followed his own judg ment as a deputy m do joulvenel though a decided imperast as unluckily enough namedby the oran of the commission that reported un favourably to the dotation of general miontauban count de palikao and he will now so far as this administration can do so be made to pay the penalty and l h claparide who drew up the report on a railway bill will also be ejected for a similar reason count de flavigny one of the most distinguished members of the majority of the chamber who has committed the fault of giving in one or two instances a vote displeasing to the authorities wil also be strenuously opposed a son of m baroche who held offlce in the council of state which heresigned about the time of the mirbs affair and proceeded to america will be the official candidate in the seine etoisc the subprefect of etamnpes is the official candidate at gien against the viscount de grouchy wi millet who sits for vaucluse and who offered in  to resign his post of attorneygene ral to defend prince louis napoleon in the chamber of peers will be opposed by the administration colonel doumel whe de votion to the dynasty is i believe unquestioued must give up cette his native place for somc acts of indocility all this shows that the government is determined to have a chamber oven stil more docile than the present one from thd deputies who are thus rejected one may judge what is expected of those who are accepted in orderthat nomistake may be mnadeby the electors as to the choice of the government the official candidates accompany the prefects in their tours in the departments for the revision of the conscript lists so that the re vision ofconscripts will in fact be also the revision of mayors and deputies it is said that in one de partment several mayors have asked of the prefect not to present official candidates in their electoral districtin further examining the customs returns just published by the government it appears that the merchandise of hich the importation into france has diminished are timber for building purposes which declined from the value of f during the first two months of the year  to f during the corresponding period of s and to f in the present year tim baruased by cabinetrnakershich has declined from sf to f and f some persons explain the cause of this falling off by the fact of the substitution of iron for heavy tim ber in the construction
