dbvtmarkfrom an occasionl coruespondbetcopenhgen march several circamstances seem to indicate that im portant events may be expected here before long for some time the departure of the princess of wales and the news of her reception in england abgorbad the general interest but it now appeara that just during that period of joyous excitement public steps were prepared which may lead to serious results t allude more particularly to the forth coming meeting in the casino the exeterhall of copenhagen on saturday the th to which of the most influential inhabitants have invited their fellowcitizensandastowhichlwilifurnishyou with further particulars when it has come off those who have calledthemeetingallbelong tothenationallibe ral party who first of all demand an administrative separation of holstein from the danish parts of the state ad modum luxembourg to this same party belonged originally the principal members of the present ministry but these have hitherto exerted themselves to come to an agreement with germany involving less heavy sacrificesviz by some sort of common constitution for the whole stte em bracing also holstein as yet it is iundecided whether the meeting has been called because the national party are dissatisfied with the ministry or whetheritisintended in a friendly waytourgethem on to a more energetic policy this at least may confidently be asserted thaf whatever be the result of this meeting the government must now take some decided measures the holstein estates have separated after having refused to treat the budget which the german diet had forced the go vernment to submit to them although they had no constitutional power over the general affairs of the state the estates have besides lodged a complaint with the german diet they refused to treat the budget because the government had demanded their assent only to those quotas of the individnal items which were to be de frayed by holstein the estates demanding the right to vote also the sums to be paid by denmark proper and schleswig among the financial bills was one demanding the holstein nuota of i for a trousse to the princess of wyales which quota the king now has defrayed out of his privy purse of course this cannot go on and the people here seem to ba convinced that if the holsteiners continue so obstinate all community of government between holstein and the danish parts of the state must cease at any rate propositions on the part of the government fora better arrange ment are expected to be laid befeire the rigsraad which will soon be convokedmleanwhile the government has been strongly attacked from opposite sides in two new pamphlrsts which deserve attention one of them is written by mr kryger a native of schleswig leader of tihe danish fraction in the schleswig estates and one of the members for schleswig in the rigaraad it is a publication which commands great interest on account of the authors influence with the loyal party in schleswigr who uo doubt are willing to support his views the pamphlet treats principally of a proposition for an alteration in the existing common constitntion for denmark proper and schleswigr which the author brought before the rigsraad in  but was lost on account of the opposition of the goverment but the part of msir krygers book which seems the most interest ing to the friends of deulnark abroad are his obser vations on a scheme frequently urged on denmark of late also by the british governmentviz that of dev eloping the selfgovernment of sableawig by granting its provincial representative assembly greater constitutionalpowers mir ekrvger reminds his readers that this can be doneonly by the govern meut submitting a drauight of a new charter to the resolution of the estates and that owing to the now prevailing absurd eiectoral law according to which about  noblemen and great landowners nearly all germans select  out of the  members of the assembly the majority of the estates is on the german side he asserts that the assembly would no doubt accept the offered greater consti tutional powers but would maintain the present electoral law the greater powers of the assembly would thus not benefit the country itself nor the loyal subjects but only the separatists who then would be able to throw very serious difficulties in the way of the government he also fears that the present arrangements for the protection of the danish nationality would then be overthrownwe who live in schleswig who still remember how our native danish languaga was oppressed before  we who have been obliged to submit to german sermons german school instruction and german courts of justice we understand how to appreciate this arraugement and we should consider it a deathblow to the danish cause in schleswig if a single retrogade step wa taken in this mattermr kryger finauy comments on the policy of pruissia in demanding selfgovernment for schles wig he reminds his countrymen how prussia a ean tory ago in the same way demanded independence of the polish crown for dantsic in order to take posses sion of this city immnediately after he addresses those who still believe in a schleswigholstein and shows that if such a hybrid state was ever esta blished on the ruins of the danish monarchy it would not fail soon to become a prussian provnceeverv new post brings us fresh testimonies as to the nature of the prussian style of government and whlat amount of social liberty is to be expected under prussian sway let us compare theni with our position under the danish government for on this we all agree inour inner mnost couviction and no one knows it better than we that no people live under a milder sceptre than the danish and allthese dursery tales of danish tyranny in schleswig with which the german papers abound are mere fabricationssnch words from the acknowledged leader of a party in schleswig which commands  ouit of the  votes in the estates in spite of the above mentioned inequality certainly deserve attentionthe other pamphlet i allude to is written by mtr raasloff formerly a cabinet minister but dis missed two years ago on account of his extraor dinary conduct as royal commissioner at the meeting of the holstein estates it seems that he wishes to avenge himself on his old colleagues by becoming a renegade and to obtain favour witlh the german party by joining in the cry of danish oppression in schleswig ife proposes that it should be left to the individual parishes in the inner districtsto settle what language should be used in the churches and the public schools but mr clausen another exminister who has reviewed mr tanslofts pamphlet in dagbladet meets this apparentlv just suggestion by the observation that in these places the poorer classes which form the great mass of the population and for whom the schoolsare principaly destined are danish while the landowners mostly are german the consequence if mr xaasloffs proposition were to be adopted would therefore be that the landowners would easilysucceed in reintroducing the german language in the schools in spite of the danish nationality of those whose children frequent the schools this would of course be a great injusticetalking of selleswig i may mention that the english viceconsul in copenhagen mr rainals to whose report on the affairs of schleswig lord rus sell appealed in his famous note of september  last year has come into a somewhat curious col lision with the copenhagen authorities he was some time ago called upon to pay a dogtax to which the inhabitants of this city are subject but refused to do so appealing at the same time to a certain decree which exempts foreign consuls from personal taxes the magistrates would not acknowledge his protest because the decree only applies to persons who would not reside in denmark if they were notconsuls and mr rainals was born in copenhagen and has lived nearly all his life in denmark they offered however to remit him the tax a few shil lings a year per dog as a personal favour but he declined the offer and the intervention of the british legation became necessary the most remnarkable point is that the danish authorities assert that mr rainals even took the oath of allegi ance to the danish king when some  years ago he established himself in business in elsinore and it appears that there is an entry in a public register in elsiuore to the effeot that mr painals had esta blished himself in that town  afterhaving taken the usual oath of a citizen bnt although the entry is signed by mr rainals himself he declares that he never tendered the oath and cannot be treated as a resident of demnarkaaetcan m anethe royal mall steamer arabia captain stone siled from liverpool on saturday for halifax and boston
