irelandmon oijb own cofmespondmldubllf aprrl  it seems strange but it is the fact that nowistandinge the state of things in america the tide of emigration has nagain set in from parts of the south of ireland it is stated in the cork ebaminer that the number of persons who have left kerry for the jnited shtats during the last fortnight exceeded all that had emigrated during the two previous years almost every morning crowds of persons princi pauy of the farming class are seen taking their departure from the railwaystation kilarney en route to queenstown for america we are told that the unsettled tate of aflairs in that country does not deter them  they rush out from the country as they would from a contagion fearing that by remaining iy it they may be reduced to pauperism and then become per mnauent inmates of the workhonse it appears that large sums of money have been sent over from america lately by the relatives of persons in that part of the country and in many cases tickets have been enclosed in the letters for the passage across the atlantic a remarkable letter on tais subject appears in the cork eamiler which shows that influential persons are beginning to see the folly of flattering the peasantry and concealing the evil habits which are the real sources of their poverty and degradation the chief of these is iatemperance the writer who is evidently a most intelligent ob server wonders where this reauy bad year the money comesfrom that is wasted in drink before his eyes hte has no hope for ireland while this drinking habit continues hrer people he says will continue the harebrained improvident race they are found to be in every country bought and sold and duped by the canny scot and the smart yankec  even in america he says  before the war and in the best of times the condition of the irish emigrant was very lowv true theyearned high wages but they spent them very fast always living froin hand to mouth  germnans scotch swedes and even ilstermen buy land in fee but the irish peasant rarely becomes the proprietor of land in america he prefers the readymoney wages and seldom accumulates anything for the rainy day though he generously helps his friends at home  he toiled hard lived fast and gene rally died long before his timea destitute pauper the writer thinks that the crowds who are going out now must either enlist or perish but the numerous remittaaces have prodaced an excitement among the peasantrywhich renders them deaf to the advice even of their priests whom they unhesitatingly accuse of thinking only of marriage feesyetathome according to this gentleman at least in that locality no agricultural labourer need be idle the farmers are sorely pinched yet they are tilling the land vigorously and are full of hope the wages of farm servants of womlen aud boys are much higher than they were in fact the peasantry could do better at home than in america if they were a little more careful of their time and money the testimony of this writer bears out what i stated lately about the habits of the peasantry hee says till a totalradical change is wrought in the habits of the people they cannot be benefite they will be fonnd at home and abroad the samne whether the wages are high or low i mean of course the mass he illustrates his posi tion by a very instructive contrast presented by the ilianx fishermen ianx boats visit our coast lately every season to fish for mackerel iast year these boats cleared  nett by the seasons fishing a feet has come in alrealy nothing can exceed the perseverance with which these men pursue their caluing no amount of success males them flag the crews mostik own shares in the craft purchased out of their savings they have the very best and most improved gear theirboats are well foulnd clean anid most comfortable foi the men who live well use plenty of freshmeat coffee and beer and yet save money the kinsale fishermen are first rate seamen but so hopelessly improvident that they neves have a penny for the idle day so when fishing is bad they have to go the workhouse poorrate is is d in the kin sale electoral division chiefly owing to the influx of fisher mens families this same improvidence pursues our tradesmen in the country and towna short filure ol employment brings destitution yet wages were very goodc employment constant tiu lately and provisions cheap al throughthe editor of the cork examiner endorses these statements the proprietor mr maguire mp is i uinderstand so impressed with the prevalenci of intemperance that he is writing a life of fathes mathew in the hope that it may revive the cause to wvhich that good mau devoted his life with sc much success if there be men of hlke spirit amone the priesthood they woould do a thousand times more good to the people by following his example than b making iufammatory speeches at tenantright meet ings the great thinsg to he done is to reform the habits of the workingclasses whichl seems to be the special duty o their religious instructors anc their pastors if the roman catholic press woulc turn its influence in this direction they would seer find it to be the true way of

result of his obser vations to mir j b dillon which occupies nearly five columns of the natio ele had spent some months in that country before and on this occasion he has visited many of the principal cities and towns in the north and south the following is a resfi of what he has got to say about united italy under victor emmanuel of which he is dis posed to speak with gteatdiflidence as it would re qnire the gift of prophesy  to predict the fature destiny of the italian kingdommlr s obrien believesthat the emperor of the french will not allow thepope to be deprived of his temporal dominion and if he did consent and withdrew his troops from rome austria and spain would probably coalesce for the purpose of protect ing the pope from further spoliation lordrussell speaks the sentiments of the english nation upon thissubject but the catholics of the world in cluding four millions of irish catholics are enabled to speak on this question and mr obrien is convincedathat their preponderating sentiment is in fasvour of the territorial as well as the spiritual in dependence of the pope in order to maintain his authority he should be lord over his owvheritage as well as spiritual chief of the churchl if he re sided in anyother country he would soon be con sidered rather as the patriach of that country than as the head of the universal church nor would he be considered independent if he remained in rome after having transferred his temporal sovereignty to the government of victor emanuel and his successors rome is at present  the university as it were of the world it is full of institutions founded by foreign nations and those nations are entitled to protect the pope from the spoliation which would extend to those institutions he thinks it no answer to say that  the unity of italy is necessary to the well being of theitalian people thissort of reasoning would justify everywhere the encroachments of the strongupon thedominions of the wveak it might as well be said that because the people of alta are italians maltas should be given to victor eman uel there is reasou to believe that rome would now be a heap of ruins if it had not been preserved froni destraction by the temporalsovereignty of the popes can it bejustly saidthat half a million of italians are entitled to overthrow a fabric which has stood for a thousand years to the erection and maintenance of which other nations have so largelycontributedc it maybe admittedthatthetemporal government of the pope is open to censure mr s obrien does not say that it is perfect fut he asks   where is to be found the government the acts of wvhich are not liable to objection i under the government of victor emanuel innaples neitherlife norproperty is secure travellers cannot visit places of inrterest without runzning the risk of being captured by brigands and having to pay a heavy ransoin the prisons of naples are full of political prisoners some of them untried for periods varying from ten months tb tivo years he is in dimed to think that the number of political pri soners was greawr at the commencement of the present year than at any period during the reign of the bourbons  besides he believes that mauny thotgand persons have beetn pit to death as brigands without trial in southern italyput to deathin cold bldodwithout ttial in suspicioni that they were brigands c universal discontent prevails in southern itidl theo nobles amd the clergy are ifitensely averseto the pledmonteae usurpation urs obrien cannot contradict those who assert that the people of napleii were happier under the bourbon dynasty than they are now urnder thegovernment of viciou mmmanuel and were hej there he would personally be for  a lpeat vthe union writh regard to the future he pro poses that the popes temporal independence should be guaranteed by the catholic powers that the king of italy should indemnify him for all his ecclesiastical property that he should be re conciled to the pope that the idea of having rome for tne capital of italy should be aban doned that florence would be incomparably a better capital that public offices should be more equally distributed between niorth and souath that in order to keep down national debt which has accumulated enormously the army of  men should be redaced to onehalf quite enough for national defence that some member of the royal faraily should reside at naples that a com plete network of railways should be completed with au possible speed  and that the funda mental principles of justice should be
