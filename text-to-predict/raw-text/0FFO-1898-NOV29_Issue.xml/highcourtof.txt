lilburn and co v ernsthauseu and co i i qb and allison v bristol marine pnsurance ompany   app cas the lord cnnep jusvicz in giving judgment said that although he had formed a clear opinion upon the case ho thought it right after the able arguments addressed to him by counsel for the plaintiffs to take time to consider his judgment having done so he was still clearly of opinion that tho piaintiffs were uot entitled to succeed the point raihed was an inter esting one the plaintiffs were the owners of the l olivebank which as chartered to girvin and eyre ofsan francisco the defendants stood in a curious posi tion the charterparty was entered into and signed by them as agents for the san francisco firm and they were therefore not liable upon the charterparty but the matter having come before ono of the judges of the commercial court the present defendants uuder took to litigate the only question which he n tho learned judge had to decide in this ease namely whether the advance freight was payable in respect of the  tons of cargo leaded on hoard ke ship and aftervards destroyed by flre a peril excepted in the charterparty the result of the destruction of that part of thie cargo in point of law wvas that the charterers who were bound to ship a cargo conformably to the charterpartyaud the ownerswho vwere bound to take the cargo on board wvhero quoad that s tons discharged from their several obligations and the charterers were not bounu to sub stitute any other cargo in its place nor the owners to receive any other cargo in its place even if offered the position of the parties after the fire was as if the charterers had chartered the carrying capacity of the vessel less itrnsthe owner being at liberty to use the space left in any way consistent with his obligations under the charterparty the short point was whether the plaintiffs were entitled to be paid advance fseight on tle s tous it was conceded that in respect of that portion of the cargo they could never be entitled to a penny as freight proper the determination of that question depended upon the construetwon of the chlartse party speaking of a freight in its general character it was a paynient to be made to the ship for the carriage and delivery of goods and until there had been carriage and delivery the ship was not in the absence of special circumstances entitled to freight at all the parties might of course make any stipulation with regard to the payncnt of freight that they chose they might stipulate that it should le paid the moment the cargo was put on board or the moment the ship sailed m an y proportion or in any manner thcy chose but they must do so in a way to make their meaning clear stipulations as to advance of freight vwere common and it pwas easy to see that the real controversy in the present case was as to whether the loss of freight should fall upon the charterers or the shipowners underwriters that question had to be considered according to the rights of the parties his lotdsnisi then read the clause of the charterparty set out above and continued what was the ociuct with which the marginal clause was inserted p it vias quite clear that under the provisions of the charterparty the char terers might have loaded one or more differeit kinds of goods dxifcring in wveight and unless some clause were put in to yrotect the shipowuer might bave loaded acargo weighing far less than tlhe ship could carry and i consequently producing far less freight to the ship owvner the object of the clause was to remunerate the shipowner as if his vessel had been loaded to her full capacity the shipowners contended that although the  tas had gone out of the charterparty end they were never entitled to freight in respect oi it yet they were cutitled to have ttheir advance freight calculated on the basis of a cargo of  tons a short answer to that coitention wvas that by the events which hap pened that basis of calculation had been disturbed by the wvithldrawal of  tons from the cargo which was reduced by that amount ordinarily advance freight was calculated upon an estimate of what the freight would boe u on the safe arrival of the vessel at her destination in the present case in one event only was that mode of calculation displacednamely in the event provided for by the wvords  freight to be paid three days after the ship sails ship lost or not lost that was a case specially provided for by the charter party and teat provision did not affect the liability of the parties in the present case how then did the matter worl out lhe  tons must still be taken as the basis of calculation but the  tons destroyed by firo must be deducted from it leaving a balance of  tons in his judgment the plaintiffs were entitled to advacco freight upon  tons the defendants had paid into court advance freight upon  tonsor on  toes short but as the sole question with which they were concerned was liability for advance freight on the  tons and as the payment into court was sufficient to cover that there must be judgment for the defendantsgiryonnd ad snovn v v ougihbys yrfasonaland sxpxedltioar comspany limrrrd t znr snonalan

director of both companies on december  lssbir john wilpoughby in his capacity of managing directorentered into agree ments with twvo prospectors under which the companies hired the prospeztors for a period of three months at a monthly salary of ï¿½ the prospectors agreed to use their best means during that period to discover and peg off payabla gold properties in matabeleland  and all claims so pegged oun were to be transferred to the companies lhe agreements provided that the pro spectors should receive a sum of ï¿½ from the com panies  on liotation  by tho companies  of every tlock of  claims pegged out by the prospectors  the prospectors entered on the employment and pegged out s claims and in june s sir john wlloughby issued cetltilcates in respect of these claims alocatieg k to the expedition comnpany and  to the development company nowz it appeared that a question of the amalgamation of the two companies had been considered for some time and in dccem ber  a circular in identical terms was addressed to the shareholders of the two coin panies stating that it was proposed to effect the amalga matioa by the formation of a new company to be called willoughbys consolidated company limited with a nominal capital of ï¿½ which would acquire all the properties and assets of the two existing companies the newv company tho third defendants in this action was registered its powers being identical with those of the old companies and contracts were entered into by which the new company took over all the properties and liabilities of the old companies and under which the old compames were to be voluntarily wound up llesolutonas for voluntary winding up were passed and before this action was commenced the expedition company had been wound upand consequently it did not enter an appearance in the action with regard to the claims pegged out by the prospectors the new company had with the exception of the examina tion and rejection of ten of them done nothing and it was problematical wvhether anything ever would be done in the way of working them the plaintiffs contention was that the formation of the new company constituted a  flotation  of the claims within the meaning of the contract with the prospectors and that the plaintifes thereupon became entitled to ï¿½ for each block of ten claims it was noticeable that if that claim was well founded it existed and might have been made in december  the question was what was the meaning of the word  flotation   his lordship was of opinion that flotation  meant more than a mere transfer of a claim it seesned to point to the taking over of the elaims by an independent company with a separate legal entity for the purpose of working themalthoughif that separate company had power to work thelaimahis lordship was inclined to think that there might be a  tation  even if the claims were not in fact worlea but n the present case the new eompany wasformed with the express purpose of amalgasating the two old companies and it simply took over the rights and oblgations of those two companies and brought in no addiitional property of its own his lordship came to the conclusion that under the circumstances of this case there had been no flotation of the claims and the plaintiffs were therefore not entitled to recover judgment for the defendants with costsbeore mu jusmcn lwbsarbcs

that i bicycle cannot be con sidered as ordinary luggag within the meanring of the statute it is far caskr to say what is not than what is ordinary luggage wvithin the meaning of the section i think that there are certain requirements which aricles must meet in order that they may be ordinary inggage first they must be for the personal uso of the passenger secondly they must be for use in con

do not thin that it wvas intedded for instance that the passenger should b aluuwed to take as ordina ry lnggage such things as furniture or things idtended for permnanent use it is not necessary to say that the expression  ordinary luggage  includes everything which is taken by the passenger for his personal use i thinlk that in the word  luggag  is involved the idea of a package or something of
