prince bismarcks autobiographyymst noticethe first question to whieh most readers will look for an answer in these volumes will doubtless bewhat resemblance shall we find inthobismarck of the autobiography to the bismarck of moritz busch  the resemblance it may safely be said is close and striking though it is of course a resemblance with a difference it may perhaps be compared to the resemblance between a nega tive and a printed photograph the one is all shade where the other is au light and rice versa the bismarek that busch presented to us ten weeks ago was a workaday bismarck in his shirt sleeves rugged nnshaven debrailu with hands not over clean brutally plainspoken and as cynical of thought and deed as of speech heed less of all conventionalities glorying as it were in the revelation of the seamiest sides of his un bridled nature in his reflections and remini scences prince bismarck presents himself in the more familiar garb of polite society with the polished manners of a man ol the world keepingis tongue under control a great and commanding fieureselfcentred but selfrestraineda courtierand a statesman filling not unvorthilyvwith his gigantic personality the worldstage on which he moves yet underlying the bismarck cf the autobiography one can harrlly fail to discern in every pi ge the bisiarck of busch scratch off the varnish from the cold statesmanlike surface and you will find beneath it the man of flesh and blood as busch portrayed him the iron will and the implacable hate the unbending spirit and the unscrupulous versatility the calculated frankness and the masterful brutality and withal and covering a multitude of faults the splendid genius which has raised him in the eyes of a grateful father land beyond the reach of ordinary criticism the autobiography does not of course dwell upon those aspects of bismarcks activitv which busch naturallyprefers todilate onbecause theyweropre cisely those of which the latter could boast quorumw pars inagna fui but if in the reminiscences we see nothing of bismarck as the pressman we find constant reminders of the etat ddnein which the great chancellor appealed to his  little saxon archer  to sling his arrows  into the face of the sun himself every reference for instanceto the empress augusta and her entomrageand such referencesareneitherfew nor far betweenbetrays the same spirit of relentless animosity in which were dictated the famous articles against  the angel of peace  and  the bonbonnire  that in vested the grenzboten with  the nimbus of direct inspiration nor does the autobiography bear merely circumstantial evidence to the good faith of buschs oiary the very phraseology in which bismarek himself recounts many of the most im portant incidents of his life already related by  buschlein almost in the selfsame words testifies to the scrupulous fidelity of the latters memory while the text of numerous documents reproduced in both works shows the accuracy no less than the diligence with which the faithful amanuensis improved his opportunities to collect and store up  material for future use the only point upon which busch appears to have been mistaken is one into which he was led into error by his friend lothar ucherand from the pre face of the reminiscences one can hardly help infcrring that the error was intentionally fostered viz as to the value of the memoirs themselves considering the share which lothar bucher is acknowledged to have had in the preparation of the reminiscences one is at a loss to explain the scepticism and despondenev which he constantly expressed with regard to tlhem in his correspond ence and conversations with buschunless per haps the explanation be sought in that atmo sphere of auspicious jealousy which ever pervaded the chancellors catexrage and apparently con tinued to pervade it even after his falltnose who have looked forward to the publica tion of the reflections and reminiscences merely in the hope of new and sensational revelations will unqucationably be disappointed for here again busch has in many cases anticipated the autobiography the transformationscene at babelsberg in  when bismarok accepted offlce from the hands of the king who a few moments before had baen on the point of signing his own abdication the stormy scenes at gastein when the king had to be re strained almost by physical force from going to frankfurt to attend the congress of princes the  graphic account of the cabinet council at which when the schleswigholstein question first arose bismarck dumbfounded his colleagues by announ cing his determination to secure the duchics for prussia  bismaroks strugale with the king and the military party over the terms of peace after sadowa the editing of the ems telegram the controversy over the bombardment of paris and the new imperial title at versailles  the chan cellors repeated conflicts with the empress augusta and the court party at the time of the culturkampf the prolonged resistance of the egmperor to the severance of old ties with russia which he believed the austrogermnan alliance inevitably to involvethese and other secret pages of bismarcks history have already been rescued by dr busch from the exclusive custody of the state archives in berlin some are repro duced almost literally in the autobiography others with greater and others again with less fulness of detail but we find them set in a new frame the author of the reminiscences embodies them in their proper places as part and parcel of a consecutive whole what bismarck clearly in tended to do when after his abrupt dismissal from office he undertook to dictate these reflections and reminiscences was to prepare a sort of  apologia pro vita su explaining for the benefit of his countrymen the principles which through out his career inspired his foreign and domestic policy and illustrating them by an outline of the many striking circumstances in which he had enforced them often against heavy odds or again had been comjpelied to postpone or to modi their application the result so far does not perhaps altogether fulfil the inten tion apart from the fact that for the present at any rate the autobiography breaks off abruptly at the commencement of the young emperors reign it is in some respects frag mentary and inconclusive and here and there betrays something of those lapses of memory deliberate or otherwise of which lothar bucher complained so often to busch no one intimately acquainted with the parliamentary records of the period or even with bismarcks own speeches can possibly accept without considerable reservations the acccount he now gives us of his quarrel with the kreuzeeitung wing of the conservatives or believe as he would have us do that the cultur kamvf originated in the factious opposition of the polish party and that dr fak should bear the sole responsibility for the illstarred miay laws fortunately for english readers criticism of this kind can be confined almost entirely to the chapters dealing with the internal politics of germany the bulk of the autobiography deals with the foreign policy of prussia and of the german empire and its masterly exposition of the broad lines on which it moved under bis snareks guidance forms an invaluable contribu tion to the history of our times seldom if ever has a great statesman who has only justrisen from the international chessboard exrplained so fully and so frankly the why and the wherefore of the brilliant moves which checkmated all his adversariesexcept in the opening chapter in which he alludes briefly to the early influences of home and school and university there is little or nothing of personal introspection in his reminiscences they contain the reflections of the statesman rather than of the man though with so striking an individuality we have little difficulty in reach ing the latter

once spoken to frederick william iv but when the news of the popular outbreak reached him in the country he hurried off at once to berlin and tried unsuccessfully to see the king in order to stimulate him to a more courageous appreciation of his royal duties a few weeks afterwards he was summoned to the royal dinner table at sans souci and the conver sation which took place on that occasion between the fiery junker and his sovereign foreshadows the irresistible influence he was destined later to wield over william iafter dinner the king took me on the terrace and asked me in a friendly sort of way  flow are you getting on   in the irritable state i had been in ever since the aisrch days i replied  badly the king said  i think the feeling is good in your parts thereupon under the impression made by some regulations the conttnts of which i do not remember i replied  the feeling was very good but since we have keen inoculated wvith the revolution by the kings officials under the royal

not have cared if he had been dismissed ungraciously i went away completely disarmed and won overeven at that time however it was not what ho considered the selfmade humiliation of the crown which alone or chiefly distressed him it was that the crown had in his opinion from sheer timidity and vacillation thrown away a winning game abroad as well as at homeif the eing had in march definitely crisbed the berlin rising and had pravented its rcrudescence we should after the collapse of atustria haveo experienced no diffi culty at the bands of the emperor nicholas in reforming germnany into a durable organizationthese at any rate were the great conceptions which were already fermenting in his fertile brain and they contain tho germs of all his later achievements from that time on until  the keynote of his policy remained always the same viz to put an end to the old mutuallvdestruc tive dualism of austria and prussia and sub stitute for it the undisputed hegemony of prussia in a reorganized germany without either placingj her in a position of too great dedendency upon i russiawhose good will heneverthelessknew tobo j indispensable or provoking the implacable enmity of austria whose friendship he could not afforn permanently to estrange the former danger bis marck skilfully avoided in isswhen after having induced the king to offer russia the assistance of prussian troops m putting down the polish insur rection ho uncompromisingly advised his mnster to reject the emperor alexanders proposals for an alliance between prussia and russia against austria tempting as was the opportunity to settle the german question with the help of russia the second danger was even more inmi nent when after sadowa the king for a time appeared resolved to impose upon austria and her allies a peace which would have permanently embittered themhe said that the chief culprit could not be auoved to escape unpunished and that justice once satisfied we could let the misguided partners off more easily and he insisted on the cessions of territory from austria which i have already mentioned i replied that ve were not there to sit in judgment but to pursue the german policy austrias conilict in rivalry with us was no more culpable than ours with her  our task iacs the establishrment or initiation of germanv otional unity under thc ledership of the king of prussiathe resistance which i was obliged in accordance with my convictions to offer to the kings views with regard to fouowing up the military successes and to his inclination to continue the victorious advance excited him to such a degree that a prolongation of the discus sion became im possible and under the impression that my opinion was rejected i left the room with the idea of begging the king to allow me in my capacity as officer to join my regiment on returning to my room i wds in the mood that the thought occurred to me whether it would not be better to fal out of the open window which was four storeys high and i did not look round when i heard the door open although i suspected that the person entering was the crown prince whose room in the same corridor i had just passed i felt his hand on my shoulderwhile he said  you know that i was against this war you con sidered it necessary and the responsibility for it lies on you if you are now persuaded that our end is attained and peace must now be concluded i am ready to support you and defend your opinion with my father re then repaired to the king and came back after a short halfhour in the same calm friendly mood but with the words  it has been a very difficult business but my father has consented  this consent found expression in a note written with lead pencil on the margin of one of my last memoranda something to this effect  inasmuch as my minister president has left me in the lurch in the face of the enemy and here i am not in a position to supply his place i have discussed the question with my son  and as he has associated himself with the ministarpresi dnts opinion i fnd myself reluctantly compelled after such brilliant victories on the part of the army to bite this sour apple and accept so disgraceful a peace  i do not think i am mistaken as to the exact w ords pithogh the document is not accessible to mne at p resent in any case i have given the sense of it  asnd despite its bitterness of expression it vwas to me a joyful release from a tension that was becoming unbearnothing appears more clearly from these memoirs than that russia and austria were the only powers whose policy and interests bismarok always carefully studied and considered france he looked upon as the one irreconcilable foe whom he was bound to disarm and then keep politi cally if not materially disarmed italy ho regarded as merely a useful adjunct to his combination he never relied upon englands friendship though he was alwavs careful not to jeopardize needlessly the good relations of the two countries rie distrusted alike her eastern policy and her liberal sympathies and his own account of a conversation he had with the princo consort at a state ball at versailles during the royal visit to france in  illus trates the attitude of suspicion he always main tained towards our royal familythe prince handsome and cool in his black uniform conversed with me courteously but in his manner there was a kind of malevolent curiosity from which i con cluded that my antioccidental influence upon the king was not unknown to him in accordance with the mode of thought peculiar to him he sought for the motives of my conduct not where they really lay that is in the anxiety to keep my country independent of foreign influencesinfluences which found a fertile soil in our narrowminded reverence for england and fear of franceand in the desire to hold ourselves aloof from a war which we should not have carried on in our own interests but in dependence upon austrian and english policyin the eyes of the prinecthough i of course did not gather this from the momentary impression made during my presentation lit from ulterior acquaintance with facts and documentsi was a reactionary party man who took up sides for russia in order to further an absolutist and  junker  policy it was nor to be wondered at that this view of the princes and of the then partisans of the duke of coburg had descended to the princes dughter who shortly afterwards become our crownu princesseven soon after her arrival in germany in februa i became convinced through members of theroyal house and from my own observations that the princess was prejudiced against me personally the fact itself did not surprise me so much as the form in which her prejudice against me had been expressed in the narrow family circl sh did not trust me i was prepared for antipathy on account of my alleged antienglish feelings and by reason of my refusal to obey english influences bult from a conversation w hich i had with the princess after the war of  while sitting next to her at table i was obliged to conelude that she had subsequently allowed herself to be in fluenced in her judgmeut of my character by further reaching calumnies i was ambitious sbe said in a halfjesting tone to be a king or at least president of a republie i replied in the sameo semijocular tone thati wabs personally spoilt for a republican  that i had growrn up in the royalist traditions of the family and had need of a monarchical institution for my earthly wellbeinz  i tbanked god however i wasnot destined to live like a king constantly en show but to be until death the kings faithful subject i added that no guarantee could however bh given that this con viction of mine would be universally inherited and this not because royalists would give out but becauso perhaps kings might  pour faire un civet il faut un iivre et pour faire ens monarchic ii faut un roi  y could not answer for it that for waent of such the next generation minlt not be bedtblicau i further remarked that in thus expressing myself i was not free from anxiety at the idea of a change in the occupancy of the throne without a transference ot the monarchical traditions to the successor but tbe princess avoided every serious turn and kept up the jocular tone as amiable and entertaining as ever she rather gave mathe impression that she wished to tease a political opponentat that ball at versaiues queen victoria spoke to me in german she gave me the impression of behold ing in me a noteworthy but unsympathetic personality but still her tone of voice was without that touch of ironical supeliority that i thought i detected in prince alberts she continued to be amiable and courteous like one unwilling to treat an eccentric fellow in an unfriendly waywhenever he had as he imagined to chooso between tho interests of england and of russia bismarok never hesitated in this connexion there is an interestin and important passage in the autobiography uvlich more than confirms an indication for the first time we believe publicly furnished in buschs bismarckviz that ger many did not merely support but actually sug gestzd and originated the action of russia m  with regard to the black sea clauses of the treaty of parisin russia the personal feelings of alexander ii not only those of friendship for his uncle but also those against france afforded us a security which might certainly be weakenea by the french sympathies and vanity cf prince gortchakoff and by his rivalry towards nmyself it was consequently a fortunate thing that the situation offered a possibility of doing russia a service in respect to the black sea just as the sensibilities of the rursian court which owing to the russian relation ship of queen mary were enlisted by the loss of the hanoverian crown found their counterpoise in the con cessions which were made to the oldenburg connexions of the russian dynasty in territorial and financial directions in s so did the possibilitv occur in  of doing a service not onily to the dynasty but also to tho ruiissian kingdoni in respect to the politically absurd and therefore in the long run impossible stipulations wlhieh circumscribed the independence of its black sea coasts they were the most inedt con clusions of the peace of paris one eannot pernmnently deny the exercise of the national rights of sovereignty on its own coasts to a nation of a hundred millions of inhabitants a charge of the kind which was allowxed on russian territory to foreign powers was a humilia tion which a great nation could not endure for long we had in this an opportunity of improving our rela tions with russiaprince tortchalcoff entered only reluctantly upon the initiative with which i souuded bim in this direction his personal illwill was stronger than his riussian sense of duty ee did not want any obligation fromn us but estrangenment from germany and gratitude in france in order to make our offer effectual in st petersburg  needed the thoroughly bonourable and always friendiy cooperation of the then irussian mllilitairy plenipotentiary coumt kutusoff i shall hardly do injustice to prince gortchakoff if after my relations to him which lasted for several years i assume that personal rivalry towards me weighed heavier with him than the interests of russia his vanity and his jealousy of me were greater than his patriotismthis did not it will be remembered prevent bismarok from assuring mr odo russefl a fewv weeks later at versailles that the russian note which had been ultimately launched at his own suggestion had taken him completely by sur prise a strange comumentary upon the theory that bismarek introduced a new and vivifying element of franlaess into the metbods of diplomacy still even in his dealings with russia it is more thnn ever evident he could never entirely eliminate his own personal feelings next to the empress augusta prince gortchakoff figures t roughout the reminiscences as tho chancellors mete toirc recriminations against his meanness and vanity and jealousy fill wvhole pages of the autobiography and in tho light of the following quotation one cannot help thinking that bis narcks overbearing attitude towards the russian statesman who wvas after all his senor in years and rank anal from whom as he himself tells us he received exceptional marks of confidence and kindness when he was a young ambassador in st petersburg must have contributed more largely than he would have us believe to the graaual estran ement of the two empires it was in  when germany was suspected of a design which bismarck however stoutly denies to precipitate a new war with francegortchakoff arrived at berlin on mav   and dated fromn this place a telegraphic circular destined for publication

a circus performance at his cost proceed ings of this kind letween us who were the ieiecting ministers could only injure the two monarchies and states if he was anxious to be applauded in paris he

showing his usual security and fluency thus causing me to conclude that he was doubtful whether his imperial master would approve his proceed ings this was further confirmed on my complaining to the emperor alexander with the same openness of goitchakoffs dishonest proceedings the emperor admitted au the facts and confined himself to saying laughingly smoking the while that i must not take this vanica snilc too seriously the disapproval thus expressed never found suflicient authentic expression to rid the world of the myth of our intending to attack frsnce in sj
