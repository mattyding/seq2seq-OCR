that the directors had declared and paid the usual dividend of  per cent  that the respondent as director had issued or permitted the issue of false halfyearly reports and false balancesheets which

balaneesheets purported to show that each halfvear a profit of about per cent on thu capital had been madewhereas no profit had been made that in july si the respondent issued a balaneesheet and subsequently a direetors report both of which he knew to be false that on algust s  the appellant on the faith of the false statements of the respondent was induced to prcrhase  shares for wvhich he

suit dismissed although the courts differed in the result they were agreed as to some of the facts and as their lordships would treat concurrent findings of fact as binding upon the parties it wtas unnecessary to consider the evidence which was only applicable to them both courts had found that the balancesheets issued since ss were false but that the respondent was not responsible for them both courts had also found that the verbal representations alleged to have been made bv the respondent were not proved it appeared in the minutes of the bank on july   when the respondent was chairman that the directors had gone through the necounts and the state of the banks affairs had becorne known to them in the minutes of a meeting on july  the repondent being chairman it was stated that  tbe halfvearly balance sheet endirg june so  having been duly approved of it was decided to declare the usual ad intcrinz divi dend of  per eent per annum and that the usual notice be insrrted in the newspapers both couirts had found that the respondent knew that balancesheet to be false with regard to the  shares bought in septemwber  the rnaterial question was whether the appeilant in buying them nwsacting upon a renre sentation contained in the balancesheet ending oat june   or made by the declaration of thbe ad interim dividend and wats thereby idduced to boy those shares barry v croskey  j and h   peek v gurney  l h e and i iam  the appllat yra exaned as a wizness add in considering the value of hin evidencit should be repeated that  regarded the verbll representations said to have been made by the respon dent neither of the courts below had believed him hei swore that in purchasing the shares he was inflencedthe halfyearly report in crossesamnination he said the balancesheet did not influence him in buying the shares in their lordships opinion the effect of the evidence was that the appellant was not induced to purcbase the  shares by the balancesheet or the declaration of the ad iderim dividend as to the  shares the case was different for the evidence relating to that purchase was mainly documentary and it did not establish that in buying those shares the appellant was influenced by the bifyearly report in their lord ships opoinou the appellant had failed to prove that inl buying the shres he acted upon or was induced by any false representation for which the respondent was liable and they vvould hubly advise her majesty to hlirm the decree of the high court and dismiss the nappeal the costs of it would be paid by theapxellant
