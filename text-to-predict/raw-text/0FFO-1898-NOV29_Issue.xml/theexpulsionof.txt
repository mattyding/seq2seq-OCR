fraternal societies of south jutland and of the socalled educational  colleges for peasants a hundred and thirtyfive persons in all have been expelled from n ortli schleswig since february a number which is largo enough in proportion to that of the local danish population regret is expressed that the expulsions have affected domestic servants aind persons of that class  who in themselves may be regarled as of no political importance but it is asserted that these people are brought into north scbleswig in pursuance of the danish propaganda and merely constitute a means for political ends in the case of the expulsion of dutehmen from gronau it is asserted that there have been  cases in a population of which nearly half is dutch in every case a dutchman avas concerned to nvhom the alternative was given of either proving that he had fulfilled his military service in holland or of acquiring prussian nationality in order to serve with the prussian colours the burgomaster of gronau justifies this procedure which seems to be a new departure from the point of view of international law by maintaining that an inequality of treatment is set up if the children of a dutchman resident in gronau escape military service while the children of his sister who has married a german have to servenovssbux in connexion with the expulsions of foreigners from prussia some recen utterances of the chief president of the province of schleswigholstein herr von keller as published from an interview in a danish journal and reproduced in ithe german  press throwv some light on their motive and on  their genleral oduss aperai herr von ker who was formerly prussian minister of the  interior is represented to have stated that theexpulsions are of a purely local nature under taken entirely on his own initiative the danes ini north schlesuig havo for some time past been engaged in fostering an antigerman feeling among the inhabitants of the frontier and itias to put a stop to this that the policy of exppul sions was instituted they are moreover be continued as yet of a probationary nature and it remains to be seen whether they will have tho desired effect the agitation must be attacked at the roots and in his opinion the expulsion of a certain number of notorious evil wvishers to prussia would perhaps damp the ardour of such as desired to follow in their wake he is also represented as having declarsd that he had no interion or desire to stamp out the danish language in north schleswig but that the expul sions would continue so long as thle antigermian agitation lasted the moment all agitation ceased so would likewise the policy of expulsioilvimena nov with reference to the semiofficial cxplana tion of the expulsion of foreigners from prussia given by the northkgcrnan gazette it may be of interest to put before your readers an interpcllation addressed to the austrian governmeilt in the chamber of deputies last week by a group of czech members of the house the latter decaro that the uninterrunvted and systematic expulsion of austrian labourers from prussia has assumed a character and dimensiors which call for energetic preventive measures the obvious intention of these expulsions as well as of tho probibition issued some time ago against tho attendance of polish and bohemian doctors and men of science at the projected con gress in posen is to drive aw ay such austrian sub jects as are now engaged in business in prussia and to deter others who might be disposed to seek wvork there from coming at all these expulsions of austrian subjects of polish and bohemian nationality are confessedly based on national ad political grounds the prussian authorities have not accused those whom they expelled of having been guilty of any offence nor do they even so much as allege that they had taken part in any political agitation indeed the semioffcial prus sian press openly acknowledges that there are no such grounds of complaint and that the object of thle persecution is to render it impossible for austrian subjects of slav nationality to reside in prussiaaccording to the interpallation these expul sions thus appear as an act of national hostilitv vhich most seriously prejudices the materiali interests of the austrian slavs tho matter is one which affects the relations of germanv to austria in a manner and degree not calculated to improve them it is opposed to the parity exist ing between the two allied powers that one of them should without any justification conduct a persecution against the citizens of the other ofwhich the sole motive is national rancour for these reasons and on the assumption that the government and the austrohurgarian foreign office must be aware of this regrettable stato ofi affairs which is opposed to the treaty relations between austria and germanyand even to the law of nations the czech members referred to ask whether the austrian ministry is tesolved to induce the foreign office to use its influence towards putting an end to this persecution of ausclian slavs in prussia and to give tho latter the protection wvhich they are fully entitled to claim under international law and in consi dera tion of the friendly relations existing between austria and germany
