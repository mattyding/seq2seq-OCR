i genepraxl medical councilthis council rosumed the proceedings of its winter session at the offices in osfordstreet w yesterday sir william turner the president being in the chairsip joni bartty tuxe moved the adoption of a report of the education committee on the revision of the list of recognized preliminary examinations with a view to removing from it on january   those examinations which are of a lowe standard than that prescribed by the council in a resolution passed on kovember   the list of the examinations which the committee thought should be recognized for pur poses of regislration was appended he said that in ereparing the report the committee had been actuated by the very strongest desire to raise the standard of preliminary examinations in connexion with the medical profession at one period of their deliberations they thought the best manner of raising the standard of pre limnary exanmuations was to cut ont all junior exami nations after consultation with vlrious educational authoritiies and after taking the opinion of men who were perfectly unbiased they came to the determina tion most unwillingly that any such step as that would be premature and that once undertaken there would be such a depletion of the medical profession as would materially interfere with the interests of the public the interests of the public were the very first that wvre considered by the council it was to the direct interests of the public that the standard of medical education should se raised he wvas also alive to the opinion that the best way of raising the standard of medical educa tion was to raise the standard of preliminary examina tions inusmuch as by so doing they got men srfliciently wvell trained to enter upon the study of a series of difficult and intricate sciences but he was equally of opinion that it was necessary to gradually approximate the meshes of the net and that they should not by tdnv per soesaum action complieate the already difficllt circumstances there could bo to doubt that the supply of medical students would havo fallen off to such an extent as to have been severely pre judicial to the public interest bad they erdcluded the junior examinations at once the committee had the fullest belief that to a very considerable extent they had been able to offer suggestions to improve the examinations and they believed that by constant steady pressure tbey wonld be still further able to improve them they trusted that the tihe was not far distant when they wvould be able to cut off the junior examinations but they did not thin they could do so for at least five years after the promulga tion of their report meantime thev would do all in their power to raise the standard of the junior exami nations until such time as they could sce their way clear to accepting none but senior examinations bv the cooperation of tne varions educational authorities concerned the committee were of opinion that much might be done to raise the standard even of the junior examinations and a number of these authorities had at the request of the council already underaken to take measures in this direction the council moreover by its own action in henceforth requiring another language in addition to latin and english to be taken up by studens had materially enlarged the scope of its demands in these two ways preparntion was being made for the transition from the standard of the junior to that of the senior examinstions his transition the committee were desirous of effecting so soon as the educational conditions of the country would permit  but they elieved that a gradual and continuous advance along their present lines would be more likely to bring about a substantial improvement in the general educa tion of medical studeuts than any sudden and revolu tionary change in the formal requirements of the council by exercising steady pressure where necessary on the educational authorities sn favour of the adoption of better and more searching methods by withdrawing recognition from examinations which were proved to have become inefficient and by careful supervision or inspection of all the committee believed that they could give material aid in bringing about the desired improvement and they had every reason to expect that their efforts would be supported and confirmed by the council at largedr macalister in seconding the motion oetailed the various steps taken by the committee in the course of their inqury he said that in the statements annually made on behalf of the examining boards for the navy arms and indian medical elervies it was every now and then reported that candidates for appointments wore deflcienc in the elements of general education during the years le in the ase of ten of these candidates the particulars given wvere ir sufficicut to enable the preliminary examination to be traced in the case of  the examination passed by the candidate was one of those at present recognized by the council in no fewer than  instances the examina tion by which the candidate had gained admission to the students register was that of the college of pre ceptors while the remaining  candidates haa qualified by one or other of nine of the recognized examinations there were in addition  candidates who had quali fied for registration by means of the examinations of the society of apothecaries or the royal college of surgeons of ireland but these examinations had now for some years been discontinued it thus appeared that of all the examinations now on the councils list the col lege of pieaeeptors wis that which most frequently gave rise to animadversion on the part of the examining boards and that the college contributed to the returns of comparative failure almost as many instances as all the other educational bodies together the returns rported no single instance of deficiency in general education on the part of a student regi stered by means of a university local examination the facts laid before the committee left them no room to doubt that the pass standards of the college of pre ceptors were in many respects inferior to those of the other junior examinations in england  that even when measured by the ratio of passes to rejections among candidates who offered the subjects required by the council the tests of the college were not so stringentthbt the average age of the candidates for the college examinations wvas appreciably less than that of the candidates for the local examinations who offered the subljects required by the council  and that the papers set by the college were in general of a more elementary character the views of experienced headmasters in various parts of england wvho appeared in the published lists as sending in pupils both to the college and to the university exammastions had been obtained the great majority of them had no hesitation in pronouncing the college of preceptors secondclass examinations to be inferior in standard to the university locals the com mittee svere convinced that the present standard of the secondclass examination was not sufficiently high for the purposes of the council and they proposed accord inglv that its recgnition should be withdrawn should however the aothorities of the college see fit to establish a preliminary examination of a standard equal or superior to that of the other junior examinations recognized by the council the committee would be pre pared to include such an improved examination in thesein ricmasd thoxme expressed the opinion that the education committee who had given two and a half years to the subject had from the very outset carried on their inquiry under a misapprehension the councils obiect was to get a higher and more uniform standard and he did not think they got that in any noteworthy degree by accepting the committees report he sug gested that they should settle at once the question whether in five years time they would not accept any of the junior examinationson the motion of dr leecs the debate was adjounmed until today
