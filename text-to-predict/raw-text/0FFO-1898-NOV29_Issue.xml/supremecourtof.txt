contained the following clause  being a reinsurance of policy or policies    and subject to the same terms conditions aund clauses as orginal policv or policieswhether reinsurance or otherwise and to

day until noon on february  ss the valuation of hull end machinery was reduced to �  the premium was  guineas per cent with out discount the amount insured was  of which the defendants line was � no notice of the e piration and cancellation of the first two policies and of the issue of a fresh policy was sent to the plaintiffs on may s s the collnie became a total loss and the defendant paid his assured for a total loss the plaintiffs paid the defendant and his fellow under writers for a total loss on the policy of november  s without asking for production of original policies when the plaintiffs sought to recover from their rcoinsurers their reinsurers required to be shown the original pclicies whereupon the plaintiffs rsceitained the facts relating to the cancellation of the policy dated juno   and the substitution of the policy of february   lnd this action was brought to recover back the moneys paid to the defendant the plaintiffs case was that the policy of reinsurance was based on the existence of some actual policy or policies then existing and when those original policies came to an end on febrnary   tho defendant had no right to impose a new risk on the plaintiffs the defendant contended that inasmuch as he was interested in the subject matter of insurance at the time of the loss he was edtitled to recover on his policy of re insurance the learned judge at the trial gave judgment for the defendant the plaintiffs appealedmr english hlarrison q mr carver q c and mir joseph hurst appeared for the plaintiffs  mr joseph walton q and mr scrutton for the defendantthe count having taken time to consider delivered judgment on saturday allowing the appeallord juscie a l slith read the following judgnment the point raised in this case is what risk has an underwnrting company the lowver llhine and ivurtemberg insurance association covered under a policy of marine reinsurance dated november  ls ihis depends upon what is the true reading of an unfilledup cause attached to the margin of a policypon ship against perils of the sea by means of a rnbber stamp although the action is brought by the comnanyi to recover back mzoney paid under a mistake of fact it will be convenient to trealt the case as if it wvere an action by mr sedgwick the reinsered to recover from his reiusurers a loss under a policy of reinsurance  for it is not disputed that the effect of the rubber clause atached to the policy is to cot dowwn the poli y upon ship to a polhcy of reinsurauce the question is whether a policy dated february   which i shall c all the new policy and which was effected after the re insurance policy of lnovember  ls is covered bv that policy prior to november  s air sedglick and others had underwvritten two time policies npon the ship collynie the first is dated february   and covers the ship against sea perils frm felirnary   to february vt  to the amount of  ihe hull and machinery aire threin valued at � hull at � and the machinery at  and time clauses are inserted in the policy the second policy is dated juno   by wbich mr sedeick and others underwrote a further ris upon thesamc ship against sea perilscovering her from june i  to juno   to the amount of � this policy with the exception of the time covered and the amounlt nnderwrittenis identical with the policy of february   thchull and machinery areagainvaluedat �  hull at s and the machinery at� sad simiihr time clauses are inserted wvihilst these two policies were runnidg mr sedgwick being under liability as under writer thereon caused the reinsurance policy now in question to be effected with the comnany by this policy november   the compay by way of reilsuring mr sedwick covered the ship coll c against riis of the sea from november  b to june   to the amouut of � the hull and mnachinery being together valued at � affixedi upon this policy by a rubber stamp is the followinglause vhich is called for brevity the rhibber clause  being a reinisurance of policy or policies heie a blank space is left and subject to the swuma terms conditions and clauses as original policy or policies waether reinsuranec or otherise and to paus uav be paid thereon the effect of this clause ihave ferore statd it convcrts a policy upon ship intoa policy of reinsurance but what upon its true con struction re the interests or as i prefer to cal thems the liabilities of ir sedgwick which this rubber ncme i covs p ls the tre read that the vo n imr sedgwrick only against loss which might accrue to him under the two original policies then existing which he had theretofore underwritten as the company con tend or is it that the company also reinsured any loss mr sedg wick might incur under policy or policies which he might tbereafter enderwvrite upon the ship collynie always assuming such loss to occar during the continu anec of the reinsuranee policy which is what myr sedg vick ccdtends for  the ship collynie was lost uponmay   which was after the first policy nnder written by sir sedgwvick had expired and after the second eoeiey had been cancelled wvhich took place upon lebruary  s but during the continunclne of the reinsurance policy upon february   which it will be seen was about three months after the com pany had underwritten the policy of reinsurance november   mr sedgwick underwrote a new risk upon the collynie to cover her from february   to february   in this nevw policy of february   the hull and machinery of the collynio is valued at � and not � this in my opinion for reasons hereafter given plays an important part in this case mir sedgpviclks case is that tis new policy of february   effected after the maidng of the reinsurance policy is covered by the rubber clause annd my brot her klennedy has so held it is argued bv the learnod counsel for r scdgwvick that as by marine insurance law a policy upon ship or goods covers the interests of an assured which exists at the date of lossnot necessarily at the date of the policyand as the interest of an assured under a marine policy may vary between the time the policy is effected and the date of loss the rubber clause by law is capable of covering the new risk mr bedgwik undertook under the newv policy of february  i for at tho date of the less of the ship mr sedgwivick was liablo as undervriter thereunder and consequently had an interest covered by the reinsurancr policy these pro positions of law are not denied by the learned counsel tor the company but they insist and i think rightly that the question still remains what under the remsur ancc policy were the interests or as i call them the liabilities of  sedgwick wbith were covered  it is said for r sedgvick that the company might have irserted in the space left blank in the rubber clause the numbers of the twvo then existintg original olieics and have limited ftc reinsuraece to such policies but not  avin done so the compaay have reinsored any siahility mr scdgwick might undertake by underwriting any policv or policies upon the ship collynio subsequent to the rciasuranzc being effected if the loss then insured against occurred during the time the reinsurance was rmnning  do not agree vith this at the date of the remsuanco policy two original policies and two only yer e in existence upon which mr sedg wick was liable as undarwriter i agree that a re insurer prima feai reinsures the liability he is under when he effects a reinsurance and not a liability he is not then under and ray never thereafter come under to cover this latter liability i should expect to find some words showing that this latter liability was covered do i nd sudh rwords in the rubber clase upon the reinsurance policy  by it the company rein sires policy or policies subject to the same terrns con ditions and clauses as original policy or policies and to pay as may be paid thereon it secems to me that the original policy or policies here mentioned are the two original policies then in existence then what are the policy or policies subject to the same terms and conuitions as the original policy or policies p they may inclule a policy or policies effected after ths original policv or policies and i am not prep red to cay that anc words are not snuficient to embrace a policy or policies effected after the date of the rein surance policy but it is unnecessary to decide this fcr i am clear that to come within the rubber clause thc policy or policies to be thereafter efiected mnst contain the same terms conditions and clauses as the oiginal policy or policies does then the new policy of februarv  ls fulfil these conditions  does it contain the same terms conditions and clauses as the original policy or policies  my brother kennedy saw the point about the difference of values in the original policies ani raissurance policy and the new policy but be sal that this was immaterial because the ship ollynic ws a total loss aud the difforence in value did not matter in this case but i think this point cannot be thus evadecd and must be dealt with in order to sea whetlher the new polie of february   comnes within the rubber clause and the cuestion is not to be d te�uined upon whether the shin happens to bh a tora loss or not the new policy of febrnary  lss is upon hull and machinerv valuedl alt � not � value separately as in the original policies does this make a materiai diference betseentheterms conditions aud clauses of the original policies and the new police  i thiik it certaiily does and to briug out tle differcrce i rail take a concrete case in every case t damage hapnening to the collynie for which lr segvick asv chie nuder the now policy of february   excepting in the case of a total loss of sbip an importanzt factor in ascertaining what was iie thed ehicks lability thereunder woull be the cgced valu of the huill and machineryviz � take the case of the question being as to whether the ship was a constructivc total loss or not nuder the new policy take cost of repairs as being � the agreed vlu is � mr sedgwvick would have to pay under the nev poliev as for a total loss because the cost of rerairs would exceed the agreed value wvhen he camc uplon his reinsurance policy the ship vould not be a cornstructive total loss for the agreed valee oi the ship being � it vwould exccd the cosr or repairsviz �by � what then  lr sedawic would have as underwriter to pay his assured undcr the new policy of febbmary   as for  tota los and conld only recover an average loss from his reinsureds it was stated and admitted by ir sedgwicks counsel that � was to be talen as the agr d value of the hull and machinery between mr iiedgwick and the company under the pulicy of reinsurca now by the rubber clause the reinsureds have greed with r scdgwick  to pay as may be paid thercon that is as hc nays under the policies he has underwritten they will pay him up to the amount of �  underw ritten by them wshich to mny yaind shows that the rubber clanse deals as it says with policy or policies which cortain the same terms condictins arcd clauses as in the two original policies and not with poicies which do not ad this is the position of the new policy of februry   in my judgment upon this ground the new policy of february   is not covered by the rubber cause and r sedgwicr therefore cannot claim from the company as reinsureds losses he mray have had to pay as underwriter thereunder for these reasons i cnnot agree with mv brother eannedy and i think judgment should b cfor the company with costs here sad belowlonds justrces bgboy and coulus delivered written judgments to the like effect
