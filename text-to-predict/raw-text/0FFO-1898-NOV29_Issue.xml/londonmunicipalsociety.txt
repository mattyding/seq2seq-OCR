seats some of the lost seats the report stated ought casily to be regained at the next election and others gained where the progressive majorities were reduced the organization of the society was thoroughly propared for any byelections which might arise lf the moderate party was to secure adequate representa tion at the next clection the council was of opinion that it wvas a solutely necessary that wellqualified candidatusif possible connected with thelocditiesshould  before the constituencies wvithout delay tho council was directing all its energies to assisting the constituencies to secure the services of such candidates and in this vork it relied upon the cooperation of the members of the societylord farqxua in moving the adoption of the report said it would bo affectation to pretend that the past year had been satisfactory from their point of view they must frankly confess that the counrty council election wvas a disappointment undoubtedly it was tree that the difference in the number of votes cast for the two parties respectively pointed to a very different conclusion from thai shown by the results of the poll ing  stil the fact remained that they lost the election and that was what they had to reincdy it lwas put about studiously and persistently at the election that they meant if they had the pover to break up the london county council that was a misrepresentation or rather an invertion of their policy what they advocated was the relief of the london county council of much detail wvork which could be better carried out b poweerful al corporations it required a unionist administration to reform the central govern ment of london a unionist government was now going to reform its local constitution he did not think he should he disclosing any of his right hon friends secrets if he told them that a bill was in process of draft uig fur the creation of the municipalities desired spaking for that socicty of whuch he had the honour to be president they felt very strongly that this ques tion must be dcalt oith as a whole ued as far as pcssible simultanecously it could not be adeqtmately treated piecemeal the net bodies must also he impor taut enough to attract the best moen turning to the other great municipal qfestion that of the london water supply he could not help feeling that it was a great pity it hald been trentei as merely a meatter of controversy beteen thc watir companies and the london county council the point was not homn to punish hut hog to remedy the adbitted defect public opinionseered to be made up in favour of putting the water supply in the hanus of a public authority anudhc for one endorsed that view and hoped as little time as possible would be lost in taring steps in that direction tlhc report dnselt on the imuportance of having good candidates early in the field what they wvanted particularly were gentle men of local influence who would devote themselves to watching over the interests of their owvn locality by serving on the london county council aud on the new municipal corporations he could not leave unnoticed thle anirable wvork done by the staff of the society their defeat was a matter of politics not of organizationlordn gogn haailtosx in seconding the motion said the results of the election mn march were unsatisfac tory they met with a defeat which he thought was cot expacted he alw ays felt that wvhen any such un towvard incident had occurred it w much hotter to look facts in the face and seek to investigate the causes of nonsuccess wih a view to remedying then for the future it sounded paradoxical huat it was perfectly true that th extension of the principles and inftnence of a political party somnetimnes prevented that party from being as successful as it should he at the polls and that was not inrequently the caseo with the con servative party o the conservative and unionist party was naturally a refathetic party than that to wphich it war opposed and they wvere spuciauy apathetic in local and municipal affairs some four years ao wihen that society was started they xvere face to face with a real peril  the lovdot county council wias teinc divertcd from the im pose for whaich it was estatiished narely to ee the adymmi istrativn centre for london and was rapidy i ecoming an ngineering party for advancing the soti ialistic ideas of an extreme saetion of the aradical paty plcar hear it not in frequently happened that a newly elected authority or beds got what he believed our american cousins called  swlveled heads they gut an excessive sense of their orn importance they bmelieed that being invested with the anthority they possessed they could achieved very great oajgcts and they werei disposed rather to divert the authority and influence which they had obtained to purposes alien to that for which their functions were given ishe and so it ceme to pass that when that society was started and they made a general appeal to london they snot wisth an cxtraordinar response themass of the ratepayers ho thought felt that they were face to fae with a real danger the london coanty council had been captured hy a section of extreme politicians the majority of tht house of commons at that time were not uneavourabve to those extreme virews ond th government of the day certainly was not hostile to them lt was fet then t ta real effort should le made to rescue london from their grwnsp tho result was that tho unionist party woke up from their lethargy displayed considerable energy at the polls and in very adverse circumstances secured a majority from the electors and met their adversaries on equal terms so far as the election was conoerned it was a remarkable success and the result was that moderating influences were at once felt throughoutete vwhol action of the london county counc l it became a very disterent body to whas it bad been during pre ceding years but unfortunately this gain to the mfoderate party somewhat slackened the zeal of some of their sup porterswho thought t th the danger pas past unques tionarly at the last eledtion they did not exert them selves so utuch as at the preceding election when the danger seeded very imminent and close upon them hie thought f tha e first cansc why they were not so sucaessful as they ought to have been and thile tbeir friends did not work as hard as before their opponents wiorked much harder aou their candidates too admitted that the gross and systematic misrepre sentation of the primo mtinisters speech delivered at thy alberthall largely increased their electoral diporeulties they must always remember in dealing with municipal affairs inclon london that the london county council was not an unpopular body with a coo siderable section oe the society and bo had always felt that so long as the county council conianed itself to aminirstrative work it ourht to meet with their support ard sympathy hecar hear urdoubtedly its admiuni strative swork ws good it was a mistake and wrong altogether for aty candidate or any section of the society to abuse the coaunty council they muight have seads mistakes but he thought the majority of its members wera influenced by a high sense of publio duty their political opponents seemed really to have come to the b lief that there was an intention to abolish altogether the londono conty cotucil to cat london up ito somo tean municipualities to abolish equalization of rates and that the richer portions of loadon were about to combine for the purpose of declining to contributc their fair share in meetmig the burdens of the poorer rateparers tbese two eanses contributed to thesr defeat although it was quite truo that there was hut an infinitesimal differenee between the aggregate pol of the moderates and of the pro gressives ilt seemed to him that both thoe causes could easily be rectified oa the one hand by steadily persevering in their wsork and being in no sense dismayef at their temporary rebuntithey had he thought elicited the sympathles of the great mass of the ratepayers in london onthe other hand vhen their politiche opponents saw  that they had grossly misrepresented thee aims and obecnts of the prdme minister a feeling of shame would ho thoaght compel them to be more careful in future the conversion of vestries into manicipalities was one of the leading features of the policy of that society and he recollected the indignation wich was inspired in the minds of their political opponents when that idea was first enunciated ee was very glad to find that they had made converts in all directions he observed that a meeting was held thc other day at istihaton and it appeared that hir lon h mp the chairman of thu london reform union ofhad suddenly become converted to their ideas the government undertookla ist year to legislate on this subject but unfortunately tho very important bill they had in con nexion rith local govemrment in ircland absorbed so much of the time of the ouse that it was aimost indossible for them to introduce a bill with any reason abin prospect of the house of commons being able to give sficient time to ita details before the close of thesession therefore they postponed and he believed postponed weith the ascent of the majority of the unionist loodoh members of parliament the considera tion of this bill unti the next session they intendedto introduc that bill this next session end t introduce it at a very early part of the session cheers so thatit should certainly not be defeated by obstruction or the consumption of time and he thought there was every reasonable probability that they would be able to take another definite step towards perfectin the system of local institutions in london cheers there was one matter in which that society had made some advance but nob so great an advance as he could wish there was a larger leisured class in london he maintained than there was proportionately in any great town in the country and unquestionably the leisured class did not give that consideration and attention to local and municipal affails which the same class gavein provincial centres he very much regretted it but during the past four years a very good example had been set and he believed in every case where men of high rank and position had undertaken these duties theresult of their exertions bad been beneficial to the local community and to themselves he knew that the society would persevere in its work and he hoped that in course of time they might be able to raise the tone and objects of civic and local life in london to a standard adequate to the atatus and dignity of themetropolis cheersthe report was unanimously adoptedmr g r asiwr proposed the foulowing resoln tion  that this meeting welcone the aznouncement that ber mfajestys ministers contemplate sub xnitting to parliament an important and comprehensive bil relating to the government of london and trusts that it will be placed in such a position among the government measures as will ensure its passing into law durinn the coming session the resolution was seconded sy mlr beachcrofttne eaasx of oqslowv said no pronouncement made at the meetings of that society had been franght wvith greater interest or importance to the people of the metropolis than that whuch lord george haniton had just made after coming from a meeting of the cabinet councili her majestys government had long promised to deal with the belted question of the minor local authorities of london and the announcement to which they had listened would be welcomed throughout the metropolis there had been a conference at west minster a short time age which sletched in outline the aspirations of the vestries who were represented on that occasion he was much interested therefore wvhen another conference was called upon the same sub ject at the instanco of the vestry of lslington he had gathered that that conference was intended as a counterblast to the extravagant proposals of the wlestminster conference and he was not a little amazed to read the report of its proceedings h ear hear nd laughter he thought they would have been enlightened perhrps on the knotty euestion of what powvers shoul l be transferred from the county council to the municipalities but he observed that that question was not discussed ni hbe was bound thereforeto suppose that the views that obtained at the wvestminster conference were those which practically guided the people of london as regarded the sogges tions put forward at the islington conference he kad very little diference vith them iie believed in point of fact it was impossible to get toether any renre sentatives of the lalc authorities in iondon who wvere not practically agreed upon the great principles which they liad so long been advocatingthat they should be inveted with greater dignity that their chief officer should not be a chairman hnt a mayor  that they should have transferred to them all those powers which miht propely be transferred not only from the london county council but also from many other iodies in london that they should also have powers of applying to pai liament which they had not at pre srent and that gene ally everything should be done to attract upon those bodis men of greater influence and leisure who would devote their time to the service of the municipalities of london thear bear their society had at any rate promulgated doctrines which should lead to the better govemrnent of the metropolis and when the loyal assent was given as he had little doubt that it would be to the mesure that the govern ment intended to introduce next session he thought they wight say that the society bad fulfilled at least one of the great objects which it set itself to accom plish cheersafter some further discussion the resolution was carried unanimouslythe following resolution was carried with a few dis sentients  thht the moment has arrived when it is absolutely necessary that effective and immediate steps be taken to relieve the congestion of both vehicular and pedestrian tr afiic in the principal thoroughfares of london which now so seriously affects the community and which constitutes a very serious loss to all engaged in business in the metropolisthe officers and council of the society for the coming year were then elected lord farcquhar being again elected to the office of president ana the proceedings ended with a vote of thanks to the chairman
