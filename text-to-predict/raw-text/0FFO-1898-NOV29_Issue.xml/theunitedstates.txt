goneral gratification while the pro spective acquisition of the philippines makes their commercial treatment the chief topic of american discussion the president is expected to outline tho policy of the united states in his forthcoming message to congress most americans accept the  open door  as meaning that the home protective policy wll be continued unchanged mr wilson secretary of agriculture expresses the opinion that sulgar and leavv other prodcucts of the philippines hawaii and puertorico will not be admitted into the united states duty free the new york tribune the leading republican and protectionist newspaper strongly supporting the president says that owing to their position the philippines require special treatment and continues as follows we do not presume to say at this time just what commercial regulations will be adopted for the philippines hut at least this may be said that the adoption of certain laws for puertorico is not the slightest indication that the same lavis will be adopted for the pbilippinesrather indeed it might be construed as indicating exactly the revorsei as for the idea which some put forth that the laws of all our utlying possessions must be uniform it is simply fantastic and an absurdity the constitution leaves it absolutely to the dis cretion of congress to make whatever regulations may be necessary for the management of the nations propertyone set for maska another for ptiertorico a third for hawaii a fourth for the philippines to each according to its own peculiar local needs equally preposterous is the notion that the adoption of the  open door  in the philippines must lead to a prompt or even ultimate adoption of free trade by the united states such would not be the case even if the  open door  meant free trade in the philippines why should it be  our constitution does not require the nation to make its own domestic laws conform with the rules it may establish over outlying properties neither does analogy require it great britain is the ideal freetrade country of the world but the british colonies are largely protectionist that is true not only of tho selfgoverning colonies canada and australia but of tie crown colonies as wvell governed directly by the imperial govern ment the same identical government at west sminster that maintains free trade in the united kingdom maintains an elaborate system of tariffs in its possessions in america asia and africa look at the tariff schedules of jamaica trinidad honduras india ceylon mauritius sierra leone ani the gold coast if freetrade great britain can maintain such systems there surely the protectionist united states can without self stultiflcation make the philippine tariff system a little different from its own an  open door  does not mean free trade in the cobdenito sense it means equality in trade which is a different thing tariff may be high or low the list of dutiable goods large or small  the  open door  has nothing to do with such matters it merely insures that tariff rates shall be the same upon the goods and to the traders of all nationsin other words that traders in the philippines will be treated as they are in the british colonies we have mentioned nothing more than that can reasonably be asked ofrbritish kinsmen cannot expect us to open the door more widely than they themsehes have done al others will surely be satisfied if we open it somewhat more widely than they have donethe war department has begun arranging to muster out about q volunteers but none will be brought from the philippines except to bb replaced by others the spanish acceptance of the american terms renders troons unnecessaryexcept for the pufpose of garrisoning the islands acquiredthrough nrrotes agescywasuington nov considerable annoyance is falt at the state department by the publication of a statement to the effect that the americans had increased their demands by adding to them the cession of the sulu islands it is declarecl at the department that there has been no extension of the axmerican claims since the islands were recognized as form ing part of the philippine group in the original demands and were specifically included in themthe department further states that it has not failed to notice certain indirect and sus picious attempts to alienate the sulu islands from the rest of the philippines it was recog nized that these attempts might be made by nations which were not a party to the war in order to secure advantages to which they bad not the slightest equitable claim hence the precau tions taken in the case of the paris commission to avoid leaving any loophole for the entrance of any plea or demand for special privilegges in the matter either of territorial acquisition or of trade concessions accordingly tho american commissioners were specially charged to define the limits of the philippines so as to leave no room for misconception r for laying claims to islands the inclusion of which in the philippines might be regarded as doubtful tho department had learned that a certain power had made efforts to obtain the island of palawan it waa recognized that the sulus might become the object of attackexactly what effect the annexation of the philippines will have on spains trade and fisheries and ontheconcessionsgranted inthe sulus to great britain and germany will be decided says the state department after the annexa tion has taken place a precedent is found in tho anneation by the french of tadagascar when the american treaty with miadagascar was compolled to give way to the french tariff it cannot therefore be foretold whether the special privileges possessed by great britain and germany in the sulus are to continua it is probable that the subject will be dealt with in connexion witla the whole problem in arranging the tariff and shipping lawvs for ttne american colonies
