while they afford at tho same time oprortunities for advancement in science and in knowledge generally i am glad that the gentle men now surrcunding me connected with these two parishes have put their shoulders to the wheel and have produced this buuiding which i have had the pleasure of inspecting as lar as ny experience goes  think the design is well adapted to the work of the inestitution and has been wall carried out by the architectand those who hate instructed him we cannot expect i people to do nohing butt their daily labour  they niust have scein places ot icereatioi and if thev do not get reecation of a judicious and prudent description such as they nmay obtain here i anm afraid they are more likely to go to the publichouses and places of that sortwhich theugh essntialmd lecessarythey must not be put oni one side altogether laughterare not exactly the kiid of places we expect people to look to continually cheers iustitutions such as this attract people and prevent
