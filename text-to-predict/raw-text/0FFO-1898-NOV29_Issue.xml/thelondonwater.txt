the london water commissionyesterday at the guildhall westminster lord llan daff presided over the royal commission inquiring into the metropolitsu water supply the commissioners present were the right hon j w mellor mp sir j dorington mp sir g bruce majorgeneral scobt m de bock porter cb hlr robert lewis and mlr cecil owen secretarymr balfour browneqc and mir freeman qc appeared for the london county council  and mr pope qc mlr littler qc mr pember qc mr baggallay qc mr coward mr richards and lord robert cecil appeared for tho water companies and local authoritiesmr reginald e mliddleton was recalled and further examined on behalf of the water companies the wit ness put in a large number of tables giving the cost of the future water supply from the thames valley and compared that cost with the scheme of sir a binnia for bringing the water from valesin answer to the ceairman he said his general opinion was that to get the supply from wales would be more costly than to get an equal supply from the thamesby mr portmhe did not think it would bo necessary to go to wales within the next o years but if it was necessary he would go there nowby mr mellorsupposing  million gallons were taken from the thames there would still be sulficient water for sanitary purposes fthe chaibmaxthen it would become z question whether it is cheaper to get pure and good water from wales which could be supplied by gravitation or to ge flood water from the thames that would have to be pumped and filtered it would be cheaper to take it from the thames the welsh water would have to be filtered as wellthe chaxiraani thought this welsh water was to be pure nectarr balfour browne said it was proposed to filter the water from wales bhut it was a totally different thing from filtering thames water the cost would be very much lessin answer to the crairmaint witness said that his present estimate of the existing sources of supply was from the thames  million gallons from the lea h millions from wells in the lea valley w millions from wells in the kent companys district  millions from the outhwark and vauxhall well two millions from other wells in kenit  millions or a total of  millions in addition  milions could be taken from wells sunk in the chalk and consequently he esti mated the supply at  mnillions as aeainst the  millions of lord balfours commission he would bave taken  millions from the thames this yearalthough there had been three months in which the natural discharge of teddington weir was not  million gallons there was powver now to take  millions and he did not think that the loss of  millions more per day would be felt in the tideway he had visited the sites of the proposed welsh supply end he did not think that they were so good as some other districts he considered that the cost of the dam for one of the reservoirs given by sir a binnie was underestimated then in the watershed that would have to be taken there were villages farms schools and churchesby sir g brtcrin the thames the watershed was obtained without being paid for the london county councils estimate of a supply from wales of a mil lion gallons per day would be about � while the cost from the thames storage reservoirs scheme to suply a like amount would be little more than �u including  for additional mainsby the cumauen anlooking at what took place this year he did not think that  millions was an extra tagaut amount to get from the lea lie did not think the lea had been reduced to a shocking state its con dition was quite exceptional this yeargeeral scottit is not an exceptional year as regards the supply but only as regards the cleansing of the lea not if there is proper storage suppliedthe ciasnatedo you say the east london have been wanting in foresigbt in providing reservoirs already  there is the fact that they have been short of water he considered that the flow of the thames could safely be allowved to go below the  million gallons a day at teddington weir if there was no flow sewage would oscillate backwards and forwards be suggested that the water dravn from the sourecs of supply should be managed by an amalgamated or joint board the method of doing that would be for the companies to decide ho should suggest a simnilar board to that constituted for the staines reservoirs which should decide how the water was to be distributed how it was to be supplied where it was to be got from and how much each company vas to get from the thames or elsewhere future parliamentary powers should not be granted to any one company but to the whole of the eight companies in such proportions as the board should deterraie no company should apply to parlia ment to draw any more water from the thames but the companies should amalgamate for the purpose of getting water it would not be nu amalgamation for money but so far as the providing of watcr was con cerned if the water supply was in the hands of one authority those advantages could be secured but it would not be a better arrengement this view was not put forward on behalf of the com panies it was his own view he would leave the flood water in the thames to be dealt with by the engi neer he did not attach much importance to the fact that for the first two or three days of the flood a good deal of agricultural sewage came down he would pump it into the reservoirs however infected with manure and farm refuse and sewage of all sorts anv pollution that happens in the thames would not be in juriousby mr polrrewe should want a larger filtering areathe chiaipmaycan you tell us in what way the ss nmillion gauons of storage is now distributed  the southwark aud vauxhall gets  millions  the lambeth  millions  the east london five millionsthe wvest mliddlesex  millions the graxd junotion i millions  and thc chelsea  milions the new river and the kent companies draw nothing from the thames at present that is the existing storage capacity now at worlz hat does not include the staines scheme or the constructive work of the southwark and vauxha the additional storage either constructing or constructed is  million gallons of the southwark and vauxhall  and  million gallons of the lambeth  and  million gallons of the staines reservoirsaccording to you there are  millions of storage now distributed and  mnillions constracted or in course of construction or over  million of gallons of storage piyes and on the s millions of storage  bas been spent out of a million and a quarter of capital authorized but this is available for the benefit of the three companies in the staines scheme onlythe commission adjourned till today
