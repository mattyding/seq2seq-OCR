i zt future of wxihaiwbla representative of reuters agency had an interview yesterday with colonel  f leewis re who hba just returned from weihliwei whither he was ds spatc bed by the government last summer accompanied by survey officers to report to the war office on the possibilities of the place from the point of view of a british garrison iiis report is now in the bands of the war office and colonel lewis wiu shortly proceed to gibraltar to take up his new appointment as colonel on the staff commanding royal engineers speaking to rnters representative colonel lewis said my report is of course of a confidential character and i cannot so into any detailed account of the possibilities of weihaiwei but i can say that it is the general opinion of thoas who have been and are there that in almost every particular wei haiwei from both  naval and a military standpoint will prove one of greater value than was ever anticipatedin some quar ters it has been said that nothing has been done bv the british government snce the lease of wei haiwei to this i would reply that within the short time of our occupation a large amount of worh has been acomplished in the nature of preparation for a wellconsidered development of the place already new charts have been prepared by the admziralty and the land suirvey is well advanlced in addition the govern ment are zow in possession of a nmber of reports on varions aspects of the problem to be solved drawn up by navzl military and civilian officials sent out for the purpose weihaiwei is much more commodiotm than port arthur but its exact possibilities as a harbour for a british fleet i cannot discuss publiclycolonel lewishowevershowed to reutersrepresenta tive a photograph in which two british battleships one iirstclass croiseronc secondclass cruiser and five other warships of various classes were to be seen at anchor in the port there being at the same time ample room for a much larger fleet as showing the safety of tho anchorage colonel lewis continued while i was at weihaiwei there was a tvphoontbe centre of which was within  miles of us and s trtenien dous sea came into the western entrance and aso into the easten but the island gave excellent protec tion the larger vessels of the fleet were not affected at all and the smaller ships although they rolled some what sustained no damage weihaiwei lends itself to the erection of any necessary buildins and of a dock yard establishment as soon as a aecision hau been takenturning to the question of harrncks and forifieati colonel lewis remarled at present au the buildings are the old chinesstructures they consist or th admiralty and other offices a certain number of private bouses and the cottages of the villagers they are all indifferently built a number are in ruins and some have been pulled down tbere iis no accommodation for any number of european troops and at present only a small guard can be put up in the japanese camp the arrangemnents are good but not suitable for european troops especially in the winter this c mp will however prove most useful for the native regi ment which i understand is to be raised tem porary arr uge ments have been made by the government to use some of the old chinese buildings for a small guard but these are only temporary the only british ashore are a few marines from the ships these are quartered in the admiraltyand the survey detachment the masonry of the fortifirationa on the island is intact but the doors windows and all fittings have been carried awvay all good gnms have been removed and any others left rendered usless on the mainland all the forts have been entirely destroyed and blown up by the japanese in the most thorough manner but i may say that suitable sites for barracks and fortifications can be found without difficulty in the new territory very good mcaterial ought to be found for a native regiment as a matter of fact however we know tery little of the aptitude of the chinaman for military service and practically nothing of his abhlltr to act as a noncommissioned officer how far h local guild and family ties will influence his indo p ndence and ailect his power of maintaining disci pline we cannot yet tell that is one reason why british nonconumissioned officers are being sent out at the end of the year to act first as instructors and then as noncommissioned officers over this native regiment which fill be about  strong this however is purely experimental and cannot be counted upon to garrison the place notbing has yet been decided but it is certain that a european gaxrison of some nature must be emoloedif veihaiwei is to be held but neither in this matter nor in the question of the ad ministration of weihaiwei has anything been settled dealing with the climate snd the native population colonel lewis said  the climatic conditions are very fair the heijrts of the island of leu hung tao are bare and wind swept but the lower slopes ore very fertile and are used for maize and millet and other food crops on the mainland the rallevs are ver fertile and picturesmue vwith splendid crops and those parts of the hillsides where it is possible to grow anything are covered with oalk scrb which is devoted to silkworms an indnstir which is a largo source of revenue and in which a big trade is carried on under proper rule a lot more ground might be ultivated and a large number of lagoons and swampi reclaimed the cninese plpulation aro strong healtby and peaceable thev live in the numerous villages which nestle among hevalleys over the british territorv and follow agricutnre and silk grolving there is also a large fishing population living around the shores of the little bays into which come large shoals ot herrings at certain seasons the largest centre in fact ins onlv place ecept the villages is the walled town of vfeihaiwei with an area of about three qua ers of a mile it is not at all overpopulatedit is the chief business qaarter and here tlle chiness exercise jurisdiction as before the place was leased to great britain at present weihaiwei has no roads water supply or draamage but it has the elements of a good place when it is developed it will prove to be a very desirable station in fact i am not going too far in declaring that it is lihely to be one of the bhet stations we possess anywhere
