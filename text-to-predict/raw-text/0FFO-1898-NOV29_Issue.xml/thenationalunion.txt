of tue grand courcil con gratulated tce delegates from the neighbourhood of bristol on havng found the opportunity and time to attend the confereuce of the value of which thev must au be aware the grand council were prepared to hear from the delegates of any new scheme they might think advisable with respect to organization and of any suggestion with a view to remedying any existing defect because this enabled the organization to be improved and their sphere of influence increased at tho present time the league was in an extremely flourishing and strong position enrolling between  and u new members weekly cheers within the last few years there had leen an enormous improvement in the organization of the league in large towns and great urban districts ntile both the political and social meetings had been much cetter of late and this had taken place in a time of political apathv the only districts where the league had not done very well during the last few years were what he might term the rural districts and he hoped that any lady or gentleman connected with a ruri district would bear that in mind imperial ideas had of late taken hold of the people and grown enormously throughout the countrv there was a feel ing in the country tbat what e as called the manchester school or the little englander school should not be any longe followed it was realized that if great britain was to maintain her strength and her importance in the face of the world it was essential that we should be on the best terms and in the closest intimacy with our colonies cheers and that moreover our trade which was far greater than that of any other country should ben properly and eï¿½ciently safegsarded from the attacks osf any possible foe they might at any rate attribute this feeling partly to the wnork of the primrose league cheers the next great principle which the league supported wvas the maintenance of religion that was to say they wished to maintain the coonexion of the state with pure religion and must see that the children in the schools received a proper religious education he mentioned this because he expected that at the next election one of the mostlimportant points in the radicel programme would be in favour of very much modifying end possibly entirely taking away this religious educa tion the next great principle was the maintenance of the estates of the reallm they wished to maintain ttoe ancient kingdom and the ancient royalty cheers end also to maintain the houses of parliament he was not tlere altogether to defend the position fdf the house of lords or the manner in which it might hzve dealt with meastures and bills during the list   or  years but it was essential to have two houses to conduct the business of the countrythe vicecleancntnor next made a statement upon the cfairs of the leaguein which he pointed out chat if th tributes of knights and dames were paid more regu larly the power of the central organization would he doubled or trebled the grand council a few years ago instituted the order of imiperial knights to secure the financial supnort of those who could not take an active part in the political work but whose means enabled them to supdort the wvork ha urged his bearers to do their best to extend the membership of this chapter of imperial knights cheersheiss acrl hill llandaif spoke of the primrose liague as an educational power and discussed the best means of political instruction upon the question of whether the league mnade the most of its opportunities she suggested that there was a tendency in some parts to degenerate into entertinment caterers she deprecated violent political speeches at league meetings and urged the importance of illustrated lectures which cho thought might be locally organizedhir b hcase on behalf of the grana council said shat they would take advantage of miss hills excellent cuggestionson thc question of the progress of the league in country districts hir long a delegate from eendal westmorland desecbed his local branch as in a bfourish ing condition he spoke however of the difficulties of collecting subscriptionsr will am alfoicn clifton referred to the dange to their principles which arose owing to some members being caerried away by fadssan e lrant iilp said he vas more and more con vinced every day of the absolute necessity of political education thosie who depended upon registration and neglected political education were leaning upon a broken readtihe next topic discussed was the proposed localiza tion of the primrose league gaeeue or other magazine for cireulation among the working classes a delegate from the lddesleigh bideford habitation who intro duced the subject suggested that the oazette appealed only to the educated classes and thought that some thing in thu nature of pariah magazines might be eta blished to propagate the principles of the league amongst working menir  f bowns hp suggested that the want might be met by issuing supplements to the gaztee for local usehir fonlxnd kettering thought the value of the gazetec lay in the interest attaching to the news from different districts and therefore he saw no necessity for its localisation but suggested a reduction in its pricethe casi anta said the various suggestions made esould receive the attention of the grand council and thantked the delegates for their attendancethe meeting then closedthe seventh annual meeting of the national society of conservative agents was held at the grand hotel when the chair was taken by the president hr r w e middletou the principal agent of the party among others on the platform were sir w walrond iap chief conservative whip and sir b stone hp chairman of the national unionhr iindllaroi in moving the adoption of the annual report said that whilst they had had a yery quiet year they had had a useful one during the year they had suffered some losses and ho was sorry to say among them were the retirement of their chairman and some other officials but in spite of au that there had been meetings and gatherings in various parts of the country which had been of great service to the agents whilst the past year had not been a strong one for the agents association it seemed to him that there had been no previous year in which it had boen more imnortant that they should keep together an organiza tion of tlat sort he said that because of the great development of the duties that now fell upon political agents their duties increased year by year in the old days the political agent used to have simply to look after the parliamentary register and occasionally to eght a parliamentary battle however all that was ehanoged there were very few days in the year which did not call for the political agents attention besides the parliamentary elections they had thrust upon them a large amount of work consequent upon municipal elections this took up an enormous amount of time and the increased and inereasing electorate necessitated daily ard hourly attention it often struck him whetherthe time was not coming when they ought rsther to direct their influence and interest in gettidg some of the work that now devolved upon the political agents of both parties placed on the shoulders of some publioofficial cheers it seemed to him that the work of registration could very well be done by publio officialsnd that would leave the political agent free to perform the more important duties belonging to his office those duties were becoming more important every day now that they had got a greatlyincreased elctorate among whom were people who largely voted either by tradition or impais people who had to be lead mnto the right direotion nd who could ovly be zo led by the most sympathetic political education if the work of registration could be removed from the shoulders of the political agents they would have mie to carry on the work of organization and education which was so vital in the present day to a successful contest with the increased elietorate the great aim they had im view was to place on the register every man who was entitled to be there they did not want to keep off the men entitled to be there they only wanted to keep off those not entitled to be there and when they got the men entitled to vote then he thooist the justice of the conservative cause would be sufficient to give them a majority cheers the ordinary work of registration could be done by publio officials with a very smal supervision by the political aents if his suggestion were ever carried out he should hope that they might see some of the absurd anomalies ofthe present registration laws reemovedv so that menmight not be disqualified far a merely technical reason because for instance the sides of a room did not reach to tbe ceiling or because men who at one time were quialied as lodgers were disquified when they becamo tenement holders they ought to strive to get the men who were entitled to ote put on the register and then to treat to the work of education to bring them to the polls he believed that if that association pro duced a set of men highly trained not only in the technicalities of registration but also in political ques tions of the day they would be able in each con stituency to carry on the more vital duties of an agent in placing before the masses of the people day by day the views of the conservative party with as much zeal and as much noise if need be as the other side if they did that carefully hq was certain the national society of conservative agents would have done a vork which no other body had been able to perform and he w as sure all present joined w ith him in wishing to the association further utility and prosperity cheersur w j aeculus mid leicester having seconded the adoption of the reportsmr w wstond mp vho was received with cheers said he svas very glad to sav a few words in support of the motion he fully endorsed every thing that had fallen from the president as regarded tho very great importance o the associa tion it was quite true that tho past year had been a quiet one but possibly one of great importauce it was in the times of quiet and peace that they should make all their preparations a great deal more now depended on the agents than in years gone by they had not only general electioas to think of but they had the municipal elections and they also had to le pre pared for any byelections caused by death or promo tion or by tihe fact of a gentleman being converted from the wvays of home rule cheers ard laughter al these things necessitated very great vigilance on the part of every agent in the country and he felt sure that all those present had the full confidence of the con servative and unionist party ho thanked them on behalf of the party for the work they did in the con stituencies they had mr middletons faull confidence and he hoped and trusted whenever the next general election cameit seemed to be some time off laughter they would be the means of sending back as supporters of the present governmaent as large a majority as they had at the present timeu if so he hoped he might be in the same post as chief whip and be able to wfhip as good x party cheersthe report w as unnnimously adopted as was also the statement of accounts mir mddleton was unanimously
