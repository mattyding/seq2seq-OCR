recordsaid that not only were the numbers of the society increasing but the intelli gent interest of the felows in its wvork vas also icreasing mr andrews said tbat as it seemed desirable that a more colmplete examination of the island shouild be undertaken than had up to that time been made sir john murray in  generously offered to pay the expenses of an expedition the lecturer left england to carry out the undertaking in may  he gave a detailed account of the physical features of the island and said that its climate was delightful during the greater part of the year it resembled a very hot english summer tempered with sea breezes the island was perfectly healthy there being no marshes or stagnant pools while there was a fair supply of good vrater the whole island was covered with forest except the sprayswept edges of the sea cliff and the vertical faces of the inland cliffs many creepers and ferns added to the beanty and variety of the forest scenery the fauna was not a rich one there were only fire species of mammals consisting of two kinds of rats a shrew mouse and two bats rats swarmed everywhere and vcre very destructive the reptiles were few and small insect life was fairly abundant there were several species of land crabs the most common being a littie red crab living in barrows all over the island the robbererab was also verv numerons and if one sat down for a short time anywbere in the forest numbcrs could be seen approaching from all sides they w rc good climbers and ascenlded trees in search of foodfor some years hr andrew ross brother of mr george ross

shicldsi hartlepool aud dundee but the dispute is causing pactically no interference with the shipping trade itself the occurrence however of the almost periodical agititions of this character is a matter of some interest by reason of the distinct bearing they have on tnie present altered relations of employer and employed in this particular trade bpfore s there was power to imprison seamen xvho deserted or neglected to join their sbips but under the merchant shipping act of that year imprisonment for these offences was abolished thbeneforward the deserter was liable only to forfeit the effects he left on board and the wages due to him and he might zalso be re quired to pay the difference between the wages he vwas to receive and the amount actuaily given to his substitute while tho  nonjoiner  ra liable to forfeit two days pay in effet however these penalties were found to be practically inoperative and shipowners felt themselves driven to find a remedy for themselves such a remedy they bave found it may be remembered that the original object of the  federa tion ticket  wvas to ensure that seamen on ships belonging to members of the shipping federation would work with nonunionists this object has been accomr plished but the  ticket  is now made to serve a still further purpose the ticketthe possession of which is essential to employment on a federation shiphas to be left with the shipniaster from the date of engagement to the date of disebarge when it is returned to tte seaman but if the seaman should desertor neglect to join in any part of the world the ticket is endorsed accordingly by the shipowner and seut to the head office of the federation there the fact is entered in a  record of offences  kept for the purpose and punishment is awarded according to the nature of the oneucn deser tion involves forfeiture of the ticket which means that the aman cannot obtain employment on another federa tion ship unless he can redeem his character  neglect to join leads to suspension for one month for a first offence for two three or six months for a second offence while a third offence may involve either suspension for  months nr forfeiture altogether though in every case any excuise the man may have to make is listened to and he is given the benefit ot any doubt on the same day that information of the desertion or the neglect to join is received at the head office word is sent to the  branch offices in the  shipping districts coomprised in the organization so that the offender may be at once blocked as regards fede ration ships m every port in the kingdom until he shall have redeemned his offence a duplicate copy of this  record of offenecs bronzht op to date from time to time is supplied to each of the district offices and it is significant of the extent of the oflences in question that the names entered in the  record durin the past seven years have amounted to from  to g it is said that the list has been of more practical service in checking deseltion and nonjoining in the mercantile marine than any acr of parliament yet passed on the other hand the working of the system means that there is always a percentage of soamen whose tickets have been either suspended or cancelled altogether and who are ever ready to join in any agitation which may he started especially when there is a orospect of strike pay in thin way the occurrence ot periodical  dis putes n the shipping trade has come to be regarded by shipowners as almest a mvatter of courselono distance trepronya correspondent teleg aphs from
