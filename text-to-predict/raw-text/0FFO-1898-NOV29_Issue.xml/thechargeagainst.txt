pre cantions es witness continuing said that when he was dismissed deceased wias suffering from rheurmatic fevercrossexamined by msr lawlessthe quantity of whisky and one bottle of beer was allowed by the physician as the general directions were not being carried out witness did not remember saing at thc inquest that he allowed the whisky twice a day and the bottle of beer he also forbade deceased
