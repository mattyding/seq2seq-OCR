claimed and the lord chief justice found that the corporation appellants had prior to  a prescriptive right to certain tolls the amounts and nature whereof are ses forth in the preamnble to the act of i george ii c o hereinafter mentioned in the ninth year of the reign of george  the eorpora tion applied to parliament for and obtained an act e  the more material provisions whereof arc as follow s wihereas the mayor bailiffs and burgesses of the borough of new windsor in tho county of berks are lawfully seized of the great bridge over the river of thames commonly called or known by the name of

and as often as need shall require lrom the passing of this act of  george ii until  period of  yearsthe corporation and its lessees levied the tolls under and in accordance with this act in the year  the ancient bridge had tecome ruinous and the corporation required funds if a new bridge was to be provided it accordingy applied to parliament and obtained the act of  george ill cap cxxvi this act provided for the demolition of the old and the building of a new bridge and enacted  that when and as soon as the said bridge shall be taken down or rendered impassable the said recited act  the act of geo ii  shall be and the same is hereby repealed and it shall and may be lawful to and for the said mayor bailiffs and burgesses of the borough of new windsor aforesaid for the time leing or the major part of them    to build a new bridge in manner and of materials specified it the act power was given to erect turnpikes and tollgates and the tolls chargeable were enumerated it was also

powers granted to them by their charters but that the said corporation shall coritinue to hold and enjoy such rights privileges tenefits and advantages as are granted to them in and by their said charters or to which they are entitled by prescription or otherwise in as full ample and beneficial a manner to all intents and purposesas they did before the passing of this act or could or might have done in case this act had not beeru made anything in this act contained to the con trary notwithstanding  a bridge vas built end erected under the act of this is the bridge the sulbject matter of these pzoceedingsthe money ueing raised in accordanco with its provisions and the tolls authorized by the act of  were levied suoject to its termns in  the debt contracted under the act had not been discharged and accordingly the corporation applied for and obtaiued another act vict cap viiiwhich was to continue to he in force for the space of  years and from thence to the end of the then next session of parliament the act of  expired on august   and the corporation did not apply for any fresh statutory powers and the money raised for buildin the bridge had been repaid the corporation then clalmed a revival of the right to the precriptive tolls men tioned in the presmtle to the act of george ii in january  the respondent gave the appelants notice that he disputed the right to toll and intended to proceed to raise the question of right and on felrnary   commenced this action which was tried on may  and   lefore the lord chief justice of england without a jurymr craclsanthorpe q sir edward clarke qc ir courthopc mlunroe and mr j r atkin were counsel for the appellants bir wvitt qc and mr danckwerts for the responident were not heardthe lord cseancellor in moving that the appeal be dismissed with costs said there was one point which to his nuind was perfectly conclusive and disposed of the whole question which it was necessary to decide and that was the effect of the statute  george ii uipon the existing franchise he was the more desirous of confining what he had to say to the effect of that statute and the consequences following upon its repeal because he did not think that the lord chief justice had fully realized tht effect and those consequences to his own mind the question was one which dissociated from the other questions with which it had been somewhat over shadowed and clouded was a comparatively simple one by prescription the mayor and bailiffs of windsor had a zight to tako certain tolls now the right of atenant under a lord to do certain thiogs could njot be outside the franchise under whicrh he was entitled to do them and if there was misconduct in the nature of fraud or otherwise the personr against whom the franchise was exercised might have a power of forfeit ing the right and such a power was not infcequently exercised that was the nature of the franchise before the act of  george ii was passed but the moment that statute becaue law that rifht was gone and the question did not depend upon the mere identity of the azmount of the suins paid by way of toll before and after the act of parliament whetber or not there wvas any change in any part of the things to be done or the powers to be exercised the nature of the rightthe root of thetitle by which the person entrusted with theright could use it aginst the general publicwas as to its original power gone and a new paliamentary authority was given ithe result was that if there had bcen any misconduct in the user of the franchise though the word was no longer applicablethe lord of the franchise would have no right to interfere a new parliamentary right had been given the nature of the right itselt had been completely altered by being turned into a statutory rightand there was no power of revival or reversion to its original nature eis lord ship fully concurred in the observations of vice chancellor little cited with adproval by sir george jessel in  mayor of manchester v lvons  chd  it was hopeless for the appelarnts to contend as they had contended that the repeal of the statute which created the new right operated to revive the old franchise on the contrary the effect was that all the appellants rights went with that repeal his lordship desired to place his judgment upon that ground and that ground alone but reliance was also placed on the later statutes which the lord chief justice had assumed to be of a temporary character it was not necessary to decide whether they were temporary or not for even wshen a merely temporary statute had superseded an ancient franchise it was clearlv open to argument whether the mere fact that increased tols were given with a reference to what might be done in the next session of parliament after the expiration of the period mentioned in the act did not point to an inten tion by the legislature that the only right left should be that of mnaking a newi application to parliament and that subject to such application the ancient dues wereinstended absolutely to go he did not decide that i matter nowr it was not necessary to do so the act of  geo i was conclusive it was however err t ainly open to rgument that the legislature in repealing a temporary act and then allowing a further timevizthe nest session of parliamaentdid not intend that these rights should continue unless they wvere renewed i by parliament end did intend that if they were not renewed they should absolutely disappear that was an argument which might at some future day present itself to their lordships lie relied upon one pro positionthat the right to take tolls rested entirely on the  geo  hen that was repealed save as to the rights continued by parliament the franchise and all its incidents were gone and now when the superior powers conferred by the legirlature ted expired it appeared to his loraship that all the power ot taking tolls had goneloild watson desired to rest his judgment entirely upon the view which he took of the effect of the act of  geo ii upon the franchise which had been pre viously possessed by the appellants he did not think it necessary to consider the point which did not seem to him to arise how far the legislature could ndd pro visions to the terms of a franchise leaving the fran chise itself alone and unimpaired that they maight do so was possible and he did not intend to express any opiniol to the contrary if the act of ceo  had merely oeen such an act as mr cracikanthorpe had contended it to be it was quite possible tht the franchise might have outlived the passing of that statute l inut there were mauv considerations which led to the con clusion that the legisinture did not intend the frnehise to subsist and be a valuable right to its holdersand that their intention was to substitute for it a superior right wbhich was at least equivalent to the franthise and to leave no other right standing t he enacting words of the statute which his lordship quoted dearly showed that the legislature did vhat it was quite competent for them to doviz create a superior authority in the room of and in substitution for the rights of the fran chise which had previously been vested in the mayor and burgesses the effect of that substitution of a new end superior authority was to deternmine the fran chse there wvas then nlo franchise  there was a perpetual right to levy tolls according to the scheme substituted for the franchise hen the later act of george iii was passed of which he did not intend to refer to the details or to consider what might have teen its application or effect in different circumstances if he was right the only consideration necessary was limited to this pointdid it anywhere set up the franchise anew  in his opinion it certainly did not lhe legislature could not create a franchise that wasamatter beyond their power but he did not dispute their power to create a superior remedy a superior right superior obligations which shoeld form the equivalent of a franchise right which had gone but in that statute and in its successor there wans no attempit to do thatthere a as no new statutory right created the was no substitution for the franchise of rights which renewed the rights and privileges which wereassbmed to be vested in the mayor and bhrgesses i in these circumstances those statntes could not have the effect of recalling into existence and reviving as right which was dead and gone a century beforelorn shassn concurring as he did with the reasoning of the court of appeal did not think it necessary to add anything of his owvnlord davey said that the lord chief justices mind did not appear to have beeni directed to the point which had commended itself to the court of appeal and to that house to his ovwn mind it was en indisnutable proposition of law that when an act of parliaament had according to its true construction impressed a form on a right previously existing by custom of such a nature that the right became thenceforth xa superior right the consequence wras that the lowser title by custom or nlrescniption was mecrged in and estingaifhcd by the higher title derived fromn the act o parliament tumning to the act of george ii he had no doubt whatever that the statute did confer and enact a superior right of an analogoas character and giving a tcle to tolls of the seme amount as those which the corporation had previously received by custom altbough there wrs a difference in some respect as to their liabilities the preamble of the act recited that the corporation were entitled to receive certain customary tolls lhe enacting part fo called of the statute proved to his satisfiction that thenceforth a higher right was given which erased and ectinnuished the lower title by prescription and custom tnis was no nmere teehnical rule but was founded on reason because the difference between a title by prescription and one resting on an act of parliament was recognized by everybody  and the evidence in support of a statutory tite was simply the prodruction ot the act of parliament itself and was not liable to disproof or dis placement by ways familiar to lawyers as to the ripeness of the evidence adduced nor was such a title liable to forfeiture or any other processloan lrndow also coneurred in thinlking that the act of george li extinguished the previously existing franchise and rested isis judgment upon that statute a franchise and a parliamentary title were two distinct things and this case was well within the observations of vicechancellor little app red by the late sir george jessel the appeal was aceurdingly dismissed
