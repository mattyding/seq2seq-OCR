the tsar on curremnt topicsfrom ovxn ovwn coumesponenparis nov si owe to the kindcness of the mlfatin communica tion of the following article which is to appear in that paper tomorrow morning and the great interest of which will be evident to every readeri have had the good fortune to meet an english politician a writer and a diplomatist whose name for the moment i must keep secret but of vwhom i can say that he has played a con siderable rlc in his country and that he enjoys thero universal consideration he has had the great honour of being received at livadia by his majesty the emperor nicholas ii and of having had two long talks wvith him i reproduce exactly wihat he told me am as you may see very enthusiasticabout the sovereign whom i hare just met i have had in my long career the honour of being receied by a certain number of kings and emperorsbut i have never met one who combines iu such a degree a deeper and more accurate vision of things as they are with a higher and nobler sense of his duty and a more natural kindness i durin the long hours in which i havebeen pearnitted to listen to hin i remained under the spell of his ready refined and earnest utteranee the conversation iook place in english in which the tsar expresses himsclf with the utmost i correctness and without the slightest accentlvhon i was introdeed into his study he rose to mect me wvith the simplicitv of a simple average man and his first words avre  i am going to offer you a cigarette because i cannot talk if i lo not smoke of course the conversation turned on the relations between england and russia the tsar ditl not conceal from me that they wvere not what they ought to be  for two years he said wvith a certain sadness in his voice your papers and especially nrctimes have constantly sought to embitter the differ ences which have occurred between the queens government and mine youn know that i am a great reader and thlat i lie to keep up wit what is going on for instance last night i read mvself to the empress mr courtneys speech which wvas published in the parers of yesterday but what grieves me is that your statesmen themselves seem to wish to follow in the steps of your journalists and lately mir chamberlain did not appear to me to be a verv enthusiastic russophil i replied that it was nevertheless my con iction that england would loyally support all his offorts for the convening of a disaruvament conference and i took the liberty at the same time to express to his maiesty my deep satis faction with his noble enterprise  there is finally  i said  some hope of a long and last ing universal peace   a hope  replied the tsar somewhat abruptly  i have enough hopes i am getting tired of hopes i want something more tangible and practical and with an admirable lucidity witlh an ardour born of the matter in hand lho developed his ideas before me and his views on disarmament exnlain ing to me the nature of the solution which he thought possible in the circumstances  there are he said  three points on which an etwcte of tho vvarious powers could be realized first they might bind themselves until further notice to make no increase in existing armaments  they would decide only to maintain their existing armaments and even to perfect them but not to increase them secondly this state of things could be maintained for five years at tile end of vhich the powers could meet again and discuss afresh whether these restrictions should be maintained or abandoned and they  ould fix the duration of the new period for which they would make a similar engagement thirdly they would settle their attitude in case of menace or prospective hostilities   what i would like is that they should proceed as in a duel wlhen two men are on the point of coming to blows before anything else they discuss the importance of the offence and the conditions of the fight each man chooses his seconds and sometimes these seconds appeal to an arbiter very wvell  it would be the same for the powers for instance take the fashoda affair now just settled england would have taken as second the united zftates and france would have taken russia th united states and russia wouild have heard the reasons and explanations of the two parties lhe two secords would have examined and weighed them in their prudence and justice and then given their verdict if by chance they did not come to an understanding they would havo recourse to au arbiter the emperor francis joseph for instance and he would have given the casting tote perhaps the verdict would not always be accepted perhaps in spite of all efforts war might ensue but in any case while the seconds wrere discussing the affair a certain period of time would have eiapsed and the two parties in dis pute calculating the consequences of hostilities would finally lean towards peace rather thanwar  such in his own language is the scheme of nicholas ii ble returned to it several times during our talk for this is evitlently the subject which at present he has most at heart it is in the name of this peace of which he wishes to be the promoter that he protested in indignant terms against the idea recently imputed to him of urging france and england into a conflict  i am aware said ho with emotion t that certain french and english papers havo ï¿½recently declared that muravieff encouraged france to take an un compromising stand and that we urged her not to recoil before hostilities this is monstrous heow could i have done this three months after my circular on disarmament    i had continued my interlocutor  two interviews with the emperor or two separate days at livadia my first visit was rather suddenly interrupted in fact while the tsarwas talking i beheld throngh the by window lookring on the gordeu the empress wralking slowly up and downa among the sowvers and i knew that she wtas waiting perhaps impatienty tie eloso of the interviewv as it wans the hour of luncheon  sire i then ventured to say to him  the last time ihad the honour of seeing your august father after threequarters of an hours conversation ignorant as i was of tre customs of the court and fearing to be import u nate i myself rose to leave i yell well said he gently  this is the first time that i lhave been dismisse i shonld not like to draw down upon my head an observation even so paternal from your majesty but i shall respectfully ask you lindly to dismis me for i see that her i majesty the empress is anaiting vou theihnperor laughed anld ssad ff with you then hat come back the day after tomorrowv when we will have another talk i came back and vwe had another long conversation the chiel points of which i shall reveal to the public latex on i ased my eminent interlocutoreverv one will understand my curiositywhether during these long interviews there had ever been any mention between them of the interminable frightful affair which is holding in suspense the life of the  friendly and allied nation nohe said  i several times had on the tip of my tongue the name of the man to whom yon allude but i dared not utter it i can give vou al the same if you wish it an indication as to the rstate of opinidn in regard to him in russia you know that a play entitled drefas is now being played all over germany and that together with the excaptain who is naturally sapposed inno cent ligure tho princinal personages of the drama this play is an enormous financial success and at the end of each act the curtain is raised five and six times in the midst of wild applause this piece has been translated into russian and novw for a month the imperial managenment of the st petersburg theatres has been assailed with requests to authorize its pre sentation r equests have come in from the most out of the way corners from the caucasus and the urals of course they have all been piti lessy refused but this is all i can say  the tsar himself did not utter the name in my pre sence
