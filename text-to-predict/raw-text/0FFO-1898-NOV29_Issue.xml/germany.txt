germanyyrom oub own copmespondentberlin nov the return of the emperor has been tbe signal for a resumption of political activity which finds expression in so many announcements on various subjects of public interest that it is difficult even to touch upon them all within the limits of a single despatch there is first of all the be lated intimation that the recently elected reichs tag is summoned to meet on december g the parliamentary session has never opened so late in the year except in  when in consequence of the fall of count von caprivi the preparation of business postponed the beginning of the session until december  according to the franjjffrtr zeitu ng the only explanation of the present delay was the absence of the emperor but for this the iteichstag might have been opened at the beginning of november or earlier it is true that one of the bills which will be pre sented to the imperial parliament bristles with unusual difficulties this is the measure which is popularly designated  the bill for the protec tion of those who are willing to work it is really a bill directed against intimidation and was announced in a celebrated spoech which the emperor delivered on september  at oeynhausen it is not anticipated that the proposals of the government on this subject wvill be such as to disarm the vigorous opposition contemplated by the radicals the socialists and even by a section of the clericalstben thero is the bill loaded nith detail for amending the wormiens insurance laws and lastly the txovernment organs have heralded a nevw army bill with regard to which the yorth gfwerman gazette recently warned tho public not to accept as accurate the data furnished by irre sponsible writers in the press it appears how overto be certain that the bill will involve a some what costly reorganization and increase of tho artillery and the establishment of a third bavarian armny corps with its headquarters in nuremberg there is also some talk of the insti tution of a new saxon armv corps the noational zeitunig says that both thesoebills will undoubtedly lead to excited debates on the first reading unless exaggerated rumours with regard to their character are belied by their publica tion but as a matter of fact there will be no time before thd christmas recess wvhich begins on december  to discuss anvthiing except the first readin of the estimates the election of a new presient and vicepresidents will in the present instance create some difficulty as the clerical occupant of the chair during the last legislative period baron von buol is no longer a member of the reichstag and tne liberals show an inclination to endeavour to wrest the two vicepresidential posts from the centre and tho radicalsthe agrarians havo already determined to interpeliate tho government on the subject of theresent  per cen rate of discount of the mperial banlk which they contrast with the  per cent rate of the baux of france but as a bill for prolon ging the privileges of tho imperial bank has leen semofficially anlounced the chancellor will very probably reply to the authors of the intorpellation that they can discuss their grievances on the first reading of that billall these matters will ultimately occasion dis cussion in tho roichstag the samne may porhaps be said of an understanding which is officially announced as having been effccted between the different german tlovernments regarding uni formity of princinle in heepig wvatch over the anarchist niovelnent in order to expedite the exchange of information thc nolice authorities will in future communi icate in certain cases directly with ono another and there will also be a common centre in berlin for the reception of information on the anarchist movementxovxxsex the supreme court of administration has decided that the informal meetings of the members of the bdelin produce exchange in the feenpalast a musichall were illegal and that the police authorities were justified in prohibit ing them since the prohibition of their meetings in the feenpalast the berlini produce dealers havo simply conducted their business from office to office and have found that this arrangement worked verv well the real sufferers are the agrarians in response to whose clamours the new bourse law was passed there are at present no official quotations for the prices of cereals in the berlin market but the organ of the agrarian league is not yet tired of the hopeless struggle it maintains that tho busi ness of thle produce dealers however conducted ought to he brought under the control of the bourse lawv as the noational zcitung says  if tho government wishes to satisfy the agrarians it will have to bring in a bill enacting that two business offices must be a certain distance apart if the transactions between them are to con stitute a i bourse  in the meaning of the lawvit is announced in thoe german catholic press that the board of directors of thhe german association of the holy land has determined to malce excavations in the plot of ground known as la dormition de la sainte vierge recently pre sented to german catholics by the german emparor the hope is expressed that part at any rate of the ancient foundation walls and substructures of the original caemculum may be discovered in the event of any discoveries of this nature being made the reconstruction of the building to be erected on that site would it is stated so far as possible be carried out accord ing to the original model
