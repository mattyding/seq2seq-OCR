latest intelligenceal poincari and the drewyfuscasethee picqttart proseooionfou our own colesrposdentparis nov stodays interpellation in the chamber has been even more interesting than any one had anticipated possible a member of the cabinet of  m poincare seized the opportunity before it was too late to disclaim responsi bility for himself and a number of his colleagues as regards the arrest of dreyfus and the way he chose to accomplish this highly prudent poli tical feat constituted in itself so important and mnexpected an act that for the time being no one remembered the motive of the interpellators but gverybody waited breathlessly while the exmini ster was at the tribune for the authoritative ex position of facts for which the country has been longing for four yearsthis afternoons proceedings therefore must be divided into two distinct parts and before noting the reply of m de freycinet to m milerands speech in which that deputy de veloped the reasons why prudence and justice required the adjournment of the courtmartial until after the court of cassation had come to a decision it will be better to attend to al poincaros absolutely sensational declarations the time has come he said in substance when silence for some of us would be utter cowardice for the last two years with almost every one else and with the majority of my colleagues i have wished for the truth but i have held that the authority of a judicial decision could not be shaken by illegal and almost revolutionary means i have however always asked the government to put an end to certain intolerable abuses comnitted in certain bureaux at the war office cheers today an effort is being made without the re sponsibility of the governmenta final and supreme effortto prevent all these abuses from becoming known it is strange that now for the third time colonel picquart should be prosecuted and i cannot help affirming that these prosecutions have always taken place in conditions giving them i will not say the cha racter but the aspect of reprisals he has been kept in secret imprisonment quite beyond all reasonable bounds and while this enofficer is being prosecuted other more serious acts are unaccountably allowed to go unpunished the authors of a number of forged documents are not in prison  only m picquart is there these methods are such as finally to make even the calmest minds revolt cheers it is the duty of the men who held office in  at all events not in any way to prevent the discovery of the truth in  i like many of my colleagues knew of dreyfuss arrest only a few days after it had taken place through a newspaper articlethere were loud cheers and general expressions of astonishment while m barthou one of the colleagues in question jumping up in his place exclaimed  it is the language of truth i applaud it and support you in your attitude cheersif continued m poincar  if i have hesitated to make a public declaration it is because no competent jurisdiction has had the case in hand at present every one who possesses a single particle of the truth is bound to make it known cheers the ministers of  never beard mention of any other defsnite charcs than that of the bordereau and never did the then prime minister it was m dupuy nor any of his colleagues hear of any such thing as confessions made by dreyfus to captain lebrun renault loudcheers cavaignac rising in his place generali mfercier received these confessions  i willingly accept this correction but he made no mention of it to his colleagues and captain lebrunrenault when summoned by the prime minister never mentioned any such con fessions it was not for any one of us in  to substitute our oon for that of a court martial but today fresh facts have been re vealed the court of cassation is examining them and what we ask is that it should be left to examine them in complete independence all procedure connected with it being adjourned until later on in acting as i have acted i consider that i am following our national traditions of justice and liberty loud cheers and i am happy to have seized the opportunity too long awaited thus to ease my consciencem cavaignac now came to the tribune the greeting was not a sympathetic ono but he was frequently applauded by the right and alvays by the nationalists he said that tho chamber had not been consulted before revision had been decided upon and when he added that by per mitting revision  the most vital interests of the national defence were endangered there were derisive cheers he assured i poincare that the lebrunrenault report did exist and when a hundred voices interrupted with  give the date he did not reply  it may perhaps be he admitted  that captain lebrunrenault said later on that he knew nothing about these con fessionsbut there is a report of colonel risbourg establishing that captain lebrunrenault received the order from his chiefs when he returned to barracks to say if any one spoke to him of the affair that he knew nothing about it revision had been undertaken without the sanction of parliament by the simple declaration that the affair was to be transported from the political to the judicial groundm dupuy that is where it should be left loud and prolonged cheersthis portion of the afternoons discussion was infinitely the most important into the other it is impossible to enter in detail m millerand in a speech which was a little masterpiece of calm clever lucid argumenta speech which was all the more applauded as it succeeded in effective harangues by m bos and m massabuau maintained that inasmuch as general zur lindens aathority was double he having the right to  accomplish acts of jurisdiction and acts of administration a distinction must necessarily be drawn between these two functions and if the minister of war was bound to accede to the act by which he sent  picquart before a courtmartial he was not bound to do so as regards the act of administration as general zurlindens chief he might intervene to alter the date fixed for the courtmartial it is needless to report at length the somewhat byzantine and academic discussion upon this point the im portant thing is the simple declaration of m de freycinet that when he became minister he found the piccuart case regularly under way and that rince then he had had but one concernnamely to get at the truth and to respect the indepen denee of the judicial anthoritythe governmenthe said would refuse the court of cassation nothing  under the guarantee of the interests of the national defence as to the question of con nexion between the dreyfus and picquart affairs the government was less in a position to discover the truth than the sovereign court was this direct appeal to the court to find in law some means of acting so as to render possible an adjournment of the courtmartial was much applauded in a word m de freycinet contended that it was not for the chamberto decide that the government should assumetlis or that attitude in a question so complicalted and grave and accordingly the government asked the chamber to respect its initiative and independence while it in turn meant to respect the independence of the judicial authoritym dupuy when he came to the tribune virtually made the same statement  as to the events of  he said  they are at present before the court ot cassation thoe dreyfus affair is in the hands of justice there it must be left it is the only way of throwing light upon it m barthon in an interruption referred to things which happened in  but i willsimply ask him what he did for two years for the triumph of justice and truthm blline wre respected and secured respect for the lawm dupuy continued  i doubt if the chamber will give an order to suspend the court martial in any case the government would not accept it loud cheers the case has been reularly sent before the courtmartial and to obige it to put off its deliberations would be a violation of the principle of the separation of powers but does this mean that the government has not the right to intervene  that is not the prime ministers opinion it has this right it miht give this order but it will not because it feeds that it is not the moment to use its right to do so in the present circumstances would be risking misconception on the part of the country at largo and of justice in par ticular when the political authority inter venes however slightly it thereby enters upon the region of the purely arbitrary is it for the chamber or the government to settle the question of connexion between the two cases  the court of cassttion knows the extent of the rights conferred upon it by the lawthat is by ciause  of the code it is for the court to make use of them m dupuy made here the same sensation as m de freveinet when he thus indicated the way out of the imbroglio as for the government it remains faithful to its declarations it has always obtained respect for the decrees of the courts and it will continue to do so the court of cassation asked two weeks ago for communication of the documents concerning the picquart affair as the inquiry was still proceeding it could only be given the copies now if the supreme court asks tor the documents themselves the government will provide them our line of conduct is the only one that can assure tranquillity in the country and calm all consciencos we aro a government of the law and we refuse to be a government of thi arbitrary loud cheersthis speech made a great impression and m ribot went to the tribune to express his assent on the whole though he insisted more strongly on the point that the prerogatives of the military governor of paris however great were not such as to ronder the intervention of the executive power out of place if it felt called upon to inter vene but he took note of the declarations of m dupuy as regards the court of cassation and for that reason would not for the moment insist on the interposition of the governmentthe governinent then accepted a resolution as follows  the chamber approving tho declara tions of the government and respectful of the principle of the separation of powvers passes to the order of the day  and this resolutiou was voted by  to zthe following three points become clear in the confusion of this long discussion two weeks after the arrest of dreyfus the ministers learned the fact from the papers they never heard of any other charge against dreyfus than the bordcrcau which was written by esterhazy they never heard of the confessions of dreyfus the prime alinister moreover has very clearly inv�ed the court of cassation to intervene to retard the picquart trial and we have beheld one of the most influential members of parliament one wlho held office during the dreyfus trial declare at the tribune that the in iquitous prosecution of colonel picquart had as its object the divulgation of the abuses com
