was money paid by the house and land investment trust of which balfour was a director of it a sam amounting to about e went to balfour it was supposed to go to another channel but it was turned to balfour by a secret receipt and therefore the question was was there a fraud  prior to january  a man named carr had obtained the right to take a lease oe vhitehallcourt which was crown property and carr had put up the foundations or some very elaborate buildmgs the amount of work done was sold for ï¿½ohi before january  carr and the whitehall company were in difficulties and came to balfour and
