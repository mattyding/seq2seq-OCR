high court of justicecfancery divisionbefore mr justice chittystaples v the eastman photogaptfic matetialscompanyby the memorandum of association of the defendant company which was incorporated in november  it was provided clause  as follows  the capital of the company is � divided into  ordinary shares of � each and  preference shares of � each the holders of preference shares shau be entitled out of the net profits of each year to a prefe rence dividend at the rate of  per cent per annlum on the amount for the time being paid or dearned to be said up thereon after payment of such preferentialividend the holders of ordinary shares shall be entitled to alike dividend at the rate of  per cent per annum on the amount paid or deemed to be paid on such ordinary shares subject as aforesaid the prefereace and ordinary shares shall rank equally for dividend since the incorporation of the company some new ordinary shares had bsen issued eor the years   and  less than a dividend of  per cent had been paid on the preference shares and no dividend on the ordinary sharesthe plaintiff who was the holder of preference shares stated that for the year  the directors of the com pany proposed to pay a full dividend of  per cent on the prefer ence shares and also a dividend on the ordinary shares and hc claimed that upon the trne construction of the mnemorandum of association the dividends on the preference shares were cumulativemir lathamn qc and mir gatey appeared for the plaintiff mr levett oc  and mlr iferly tor ordinary shareholders  an mir  lyttelton chubb for the companymn jutice cezitty said that the question was whether the preference shareholders were entitled to a cumulative or noncumulative dividend there was in the memorandum or articles nothing material to the question except clause  it was said for the ordinary shareholders that the words  out of the net profits of each year  showed that each year was separately re garded and that these words condned the clause to each particuiar year if the words had been  for such year  there would have been no ambiguity and the clause would have been clear the contention for the preference shareholders had the effect of very nearly if not quite attributing no meaning to the words  each year the words  after payment  in the sentence which followed did not affect the construction for they merely pointed to a subsequent operation he thought however there was not enough to cut down the right of preference shareholders to a dividend of  per cent for a given year it was said that if the preference shareholders were entitled to a cumulative dividend the ordinary shareholders must hold a similar ndosition with respct to their dividends end that it was naonstrous or absud to give ordinary shareholders a cumulative dividend but both dividends were cumula tive before the provision for ejual dividend took effect he had received very little assistance from the authori ties adopting the metaphors of lord justice knight bruce in h henry v gnr co  de g and j  p  he could not find that the words  out of the net profits of each year  confined the preference shareholders to the vintage of each year and it appeared to him that they were entitled to receive their tun of wine out of the vineyard the preference shareholders were entitled to cumulative dividendsint be e b smith deceasedthe question in this case was whether the deceased who was by birth a scotchman had acquired an english domicile it was stated that the deceased in  being then about  years of age left his home in scot land and enlisted in the nd highlanders was imme diately transferred to the rd highlanders and after serving in the indian mutiny ultimately served for many years in the united kingdom and abroad as troop sergeantmajor in the th ilussars the only visit he appeared to have made to his parents home was in  when he attended his mothers funeral in  being then stationed in ireland he came over to iouns lov and was married according to the rites of the english chulrch to an engishwoman who a few months afterwards joined him in ireland in  he took his discharge receiving a pension and immediately after wards took a civilan appointment as canteen steward to the th hussars then stationed at hounslow he accompanied that regiment to scotland and ireland and died in  at the marlborough barracks dublin it appeared that in  he had opened a banking account at leeds and had continued it ud to his death he hbad also told his wife that he would like to be buried at heston near hounslow he died intestate leaving adow but no children and with personal property to the amonvt of � by both the law of englaud and suotland his widow was entitled to half of his per sonalfy but by the intestates estates act  which act does not extend to scotland she would have been entitled to an additional  on behalf of the widow it was submitted that the deceased had acquired an en lish domicilear a w rowden appeared for the nextofkin in support of a scotch domicile and mr byrne qc and mr j a hay for the widowmr justice chittry i giving judgment yester day said that the deceaseds lomicile of origin was unquestionably scotch and therefore the burden of showing that he had changed his domi cile was on the widow of course during the period of the deceaseds service with his regiments there wfas no change of domicile the widows case was that the chango of domnicile took place on his dis char e he thought the evidence sufficlent to show that the deceased had some intention to change his domicile and the only question which remained was did he in point of fact change it  he never bought a house or established himself in any way except so far as related to his business which was an itinerant one a man who had actually made his choice and fised his abode would not merely say he would do so but would say that he had done so that too would be a statement merely whereas the law required that the fact should be shown what was required to show that a new domicile had been acquired was permanent and fixed intention and actual residence in his opinion there was not suffi cient evidence here to show that the deceaseds scotch domicile remained and his estate must be distributed according to the law of scotlandbeforce mn justice northin re mauricemauhice v btowntha

the case including a former will a settlement that bad been prepared in favour of miss brown the terms on which miss brown had been taken into the house and the mutaal kindnesses and benefits bestowed for a long period showed that it was clear that the testator intended to bestow the property upon atiss brown for her own benefit it was trae he said that the amount of the benefit was large but the testator was a man of great wealth and had amply provided for his own children in the administration it was desired that these matters should be investigated in this action that was proper the facts had been investigated and he came to the conclasion that the testator intended to confer theso benefits on miss brown it was therefore unnecessary to go into any question of advancement by a person in

yesterday it was an action by certain residents of the illage of theydon bois near epping forest in essex for an in junction to restrain the defendant from playing a steam organ so as to occasion a nuisance or injury to thec plaintiffs the opening of the case wvas reported in thc tiies of february  it mav be remembered that thec plaintiffs case was that the defendant who was a refreshment caterer and proprietor of a steam organ and merrygoround had in  opened in a central position in the village a refreshment room and other premises which he called  dossetts forest retreat and it was alleged that the playing of the organ was a serious nuisane and annoyance to the plaintiffs and other residents of the village the plaintiffs also alleged that the defendant had entered into an agree ment with amr buxton one of the plaintiffs that if a rival organ proprietor named riggs would discontinue the use of his organ defendant would do the same a letter was put in evizience purporting to be signed by the defendant stating that he would not use his organ but if possible would sell it mr rigg had signed a simlar document and in pursuance of his agreemnent he had got rid of his organ upon which the defendant had recommenced to use hisa course of conduct which resulted in the present action a great nutuber of wit nesses were called on both sides lhose of the plain tiffs were unanimous in describing the organplaying as extremely annoyinco and disturbing many of them said that it was n interruption to their work others that persons suffering from illnes were peculiarly dis tressed by it and the vicar of the parish stated that it interfered materially with his reading and was a great annoyance and inconvexience to him when vnstmg the sick and otherwise pursuing his ministrations in the village the gdneral effeet of the evidence in support of the plaintiffs case was that the organ vas played during the excursion season in the snmmer nearly every day and off andi on throughout the whole of the day from  oclock in the mornmg till  or  in the even ing amounting to about four or five hours a day the defendants case as to the agreement was that the letter had not been written by him but by his wife and that it did not represent the true effect of the agreement which he had entered into he said that he had only agreed not to use his organ  while there was one at rciggss and that part of the contract ewas that if he soll his organ mr buxton would bear half tha loss which he the defendant maight sustain he further said that he had reduced the tone of his organ by taking out the trumpet btops and that since that had been done the organ could only ba heard in close proximity to his premises he called a number of witnesses who stated that the organ was no nuiisance to them anld some of whom said that they rather liked it he and his wife had kept independent records of the times at which he plaved his organwhich went to show that inno case had he used it more than for  minutes durinn the whole day and that the average time was about half an hour he suggested that what cansed the complaints wras the two organs being played together and that the noise of the excursionists was far greater than that of his organat the close of the evidence yesterday mr gnosvxyor woods qc with whom was mr butcher for the defendant addressed the court and contended that the noise had not been proved to be so serious as the plaintiffs alleged and that there was no case for an injunctiin as to the agreement it was not clear what that am namted to and it was not binding on the defen dantmr gnarra hastings qc with whom was mr beddall for the plaintiffs in replying upon the whole case said that the fact of the nuisance could not be dis puted it was only attempted to show that the dura tion of the organplaying was not so long as alleged but even on the defendants evidence enough was admitted to justify the court upon the authorities in granting an mjunction upon the question of the agree ment the written doculmentwas plain and the defen dants version of the contract was entirely inconsistent during the course of the arguments a very similar case was referred to which had been decided by mr justice chitty in s lambton v mellish   the times law reports  where an injunction was granted restraining the defendants from playing organs upon their premises at ashteadcommon so as to cause a nuisance or injury to the plaintiffsat the conclusion of the arguments his londusip reserved his jodgmentbefore mn justice kexewichpullisger v eanto brotiiestee atopiullinge poolthis vas a motion by the plaintiff mr david john pulliunger against the defendanits messrs barnett isaacs barnato eenry baruato and woolf joel asking that an account might be taken of the dealings and transactions of the pool or partnership called  the barnatopullinger pool  created by an agreement of december    and that an inquiry might be directed as to the moneys shares debts and assets of the said pool or partnership the facts of the case which is still pending are of a very complicated cha racter and relate to dealings with vary large sums of money and a large quantity ot shares in a south african gold company called the buffelsdoorm estate and gold mining company limited these shares being the aab ject ot thes pool the alleged partnership transac tions in the pool  came to an end on december last with the result it was said that at that time the defeniants who had the management of the  pool had in their hands or under their control some � in cash of which the plaintiff claimed to be entitled under the agreement to onehalf as his propor tion of the profits and  shes of which he also claimed to be entitled to onehalf under the agree ment the plaintiff complained that the defendanthad without his knowledge or consent entered into a contract with some financiers called  the bardac group for participation in what is called  the bardac pool the alleged contract involving it was said dealing with the assets of the barnatoullinger pool and he contended that he was not bound by that contract and that the defendants had under that con tract improperly dealt with his share of profits in the baruatopulilinger pool he also alleged that no distri bution of profits had been made under the agreement of  and that the defendants had not rendered him fuland final accounts of the operations of the barnato pulliger pool or tendered to him any of the shares which he was entitled to receive on its dissolution accordingly in september last he issued the writ in this action claiming specific performance of the agreement of  and ancillary relief and on january is last he served the defendants with a notice of motion in the terms above mentioned since the service of the notice of motion the defendants had furnished an account bat the plaintiff asserted that it was insufficientsir e claitxe qc mr alexasder qc and mir e banaonw for tha plaintiff said that the defendants admitted having in their hands or under their control some � in cash onehalf of which the plaintiff claimed to belong to him and also  shares of which the plaintiff also claimed onehalf the defendants should therefore deliver a statement as to what their contention was in retaining the cash and shares and there should also be an inquiry as to the dealings with this large amount of propertymn justice kekewiecu said it was not the prautice in this branch of the coart to direct accounts and inquiries on an interlocutory application though that ruleought not to be strained thare were serious questions to be tried in this case and if he were to direct an inquiry now he might do so on an entirely wrong basis and thus time and expense might be thrown away and the decision of the reai questions at issue be delayedl his present impression was that the plaintiffs notice of motion as it stood was entirely wrongsir e clarke said be had considered that point and had felt some doubt whether the court would direct an inquiry at the present stage of the case he thought however that his lordship would direct the defendants to deliver a statement of their contention showing what were the exact amounts of cash and shares in their handsmn justice rek wicei should have thought you might have gone farther in your notice of motion and might have asked to have impounded onehalf of the cash and onehalf of the sharessib b clarsethen i ask your lordship to allow me to amend my notice of motionmn justice kekewicnmy suggestion is that every question should be left open for the present and that the cash and shares claimed should be placed under the secure control of the court pending the decision of the questions at issue the cash bemg brought into court and the shares placed in the hands of a receivermr behshaw qc with whom was mr w e vernon for the defendants said his view was that having regard to a counterclaim that was about to be raised against the plaintiff for damages to a very large amount the plaintiff was entitled to nothing but the defendants were wvilling to give an undertaking by their counsel not to part witu the cash in their bands without retaining onahalf and not to part with the shares without retainin onehalfmr justice kekewich ssid that what theplaintiffs counselnranosed was that in orderto abide theemnltof the trial of the action onehalf of the cash should be brought into court and onebalf of the sih rs should be secured by being banded to a receiver he woul gie te paintfi eav toamneud
