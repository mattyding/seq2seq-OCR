the devel opment of ja paits militaryand na val strengthprom our corresrondbnttokio jax the ninth session of the japanese diet was opened by the emperor in person on the th of december in the speech from the throne after brief and modest reference to the successes achieved in the recent war and after urging that all efforts should now be concentrated on main taining peace and promoting national progress in the fields of industry communications and edu cation his majesty addedas to the defences of the country it has ever been our intention to complete them by degrees desirous of repairing the injures occasioned durirg the recent hostilities and of making necessary provisions for self protection wehave charged our advisers with the task of elaborating the measures to be adopted e have further ordered them to seek the diets approval for the outlays involved in carrying out those measures we are confident that our good and loyal subjects will be only too glad to bear whatever increase of their public burdens is thereby entailedit had long been known that large schemes of military and naval development were officially entertained and the opening of this session of the diet was consequently awaited with much impatience not only because of the nations anxiety to become acquainted with schemes having buch an important bearing on its future but also because a thousand different theories had been circulated as to the new sources of revenue from wllich funds to defray the necessary oilays would be procured i shall not attempt to explamn the latter point in this letter but will simply endeavour to lay before readers of the times a brief statement of the belligerentsrce that japan hopes to develop within the next nine years i must commence howeverwith an apology the diet having risen for its new yearsrecess the day after the delivery of the emperors speech has not yet discussed any of the bills submitted to it by the cabinet hence we still lack explanations that will be given byandby in committee xplanations without which it is impossible to summarize the measures with thorough accuracyand we are still without some of the bills necessary to complete the various projects enough material is available however to compile an intelligible resisie of the factsas to the navy the intention is to undertake a scheme of ddvelopment extending over seven years during that time the sum to be expended on building and arming menofwar is  million yen in round numbers and  million will be devoted to the constraction of docks and various edifices necessary for the needs of the greatly increased navy these figures are independent of appropriations on account of vessels alreadv ordered abroad among which are two lineof battle ships of over  tons each which will probably be ready for sea in the course of a year evidently the intenticai of the government is to place the country in possession of a navy which in point of displacement  tons shall be more than equal to the combined squadrons of great britain russia france germany and the united statesaggregating s tonsnow on the pacific station andl which shall include at least six lineofbattle ships far more powerful than any vessel now flying a foreign flag in japanese waters out of the total expenditure  million yen proposed for purposes of naval increment during the next seven years the sum asked for in the fiscal year commencingc next april is  million yen of wvhich i millions are to be spent on new ships and  f million on build ingworks of various kinds itmust always beborne in mind when considering figures relating to japanese expenditurethat direct arithmetical com parison with the outlays of westerncountries would be very misleading of course japan cannot pro cure ships and guns more cheadly than any other country can nut once in possession of such weapons of war she manages to mnaintain them together with their personnel at an outlay almost incredibly small when judged by western standards for example before her struggle with china commenced she had  menofwar and  torpedoboats with an aggregate dis placement of  tons and a personnel of  men these together with her naval schools and her department of naval adminis tration she contrived to maintain at an annual cost of a million yen or about �sterling even during the next fiscal year april  to april  the budget appropriations on account of ordinary naval expenditure amount to only a little over  million yen or less than �u sterling it would be difficult to con ceive a more striking contrast than japan presents in these respects to china in one country we have maximum results achieved at a minimum of cost in the other the pettiest possible achievement combined with prodigious outlayit may be a mere coincidence though few will be disposed to accept it in that light that the period of seven years chosen by the japanese government for completing its scheme of naval development corresponds with the period fixed by the shimonoseki treaty for the payment of the chinese indemnity china is pledged to pay the last instalment of the indemnity by may  until which time japan holds wveihaiwei and japans navy reaches its full strength in the course of the same yearin connexion with the naval extension scheme may be mentioned the establishment of an iron foundry japan uses  tons of iron and steel every year but produces scarcely any although she possesses iron ore and coal in abundance several years ago large ironsmelt ing works were opened under official auspices at kamaishi in iwate prefecture on the north eastern littoral but they proved a complete failure owing partly to mismanagement and partly to the fact that fuel had to be carried from sources of supply several hundred miles distant while transport facilities were still in their infancy after the closing of these works and of the disastrous financial record connected with them the matter remained in abeyance until public men began to ob serve the dangers and inconvenience of being entirely dependent upon foreign countries for supplies of a material so essential to military and naval equipment then once again manufacturing conditions having become much more favourable in the interval the government projected the establishment of an iron foundry hut the scheme was wrecked session after session on the rocks of party dis cord inthe diet it is renived now in a bill awaiting parliamentary discussion and the approval of a majority will doubtless be accorded the programme does not extend to fully satisfying domestic demands these being so varied that to meet them entirely would in volve an unwisely large outlay on account of plant and expert labour it is proposed there fore to manufacture only  tons of metal annually including  tons of bessemer steel the estimated expenditures on account of this establishment aggregate a little more than four million yen say � and are to be spread over a period of four years only two foreign experts will be employed at first japan imports iron ateel and their manufac tures andthese totalled over nine million yenlast year nearly four millions of which eame from great britain the establishment of this iron foundry has consequently much interest for foreign exporterswith regard to the army the exact degree of increment projected by the government cannotyet be stated but it will not be far from the truth to sythat tihe present force is to be doubled the period covered by the operation is nine years ending in a last year the regular expendi tures on account of the army aggregated l million yen this year they are put at  mil lions and an extraordinary grant of i millions is also asked for the latter however has no direct connexion with any numerical increase of the military establishment  it is in tenuied for tlle constructdion of barracks  millions the building of forts  millions the manufacture of small arms  millions the extension of the artillery arsenal  million and so forth the simplest way of giving a general idea of the programme con templated is to say that the regular expendi tures on account of army maintenance are to be doubled within the niext nino years and it is a fair inference that the numerical strength of the army will be correspondingly in creased in other words japans fightingforce in  will be approximately  with the coloctrs  reserves and  landwehrthat is to say halfamillion of men in round numbers it will sound almost in credible to western ears that she should main tain such a force at an annual expenditure of i million yen or about q million pounds sterl ing  but such nevertheless is her estimate and theexperience of  years justifies us in believing that her calculations are not faulty
