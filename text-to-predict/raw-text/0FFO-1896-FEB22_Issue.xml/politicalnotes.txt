political notesopinion in regard to the ministerial procedure scheme having begun to crystallize the possibilities of the situation can now be gauged with something approaching to accuracy a section of the radicals are still unable to reconcile themselves to the notion of a time limit for supply their contention being that under the existing rules a government with a decent majority at its back can always invoke the aid of the  gaillotine if necessary generally speaking however the disposi tion of the opposition is to welcome the idea of spread ing the discussion upon the estimates more evenly over the session and to admit that an antomatio closure is essential if discursiveness and frivolity are to give place to really useful debates the main points upon which doubts are entertained are  whether the form of guillotine proposed by the government is thatbestealon lated to bring about the desired result  whether  days are sufficient  and  whether votes on account ought not to be pleed in the same category as supple mentary estimates and votes of credit with regard to the first point the alternative suggestion is that the principle of closure by compartments should be adopted it is admitted that a satisfactory plan for carrying this prineiple into effect would be difficult to devise in view of the fashion in which the votes are grouped but the desire for an absolute guarantee that every class of esti mates shall have its fair chance of discussion is com prehensible and those who give expression to it are confident that the difficulty could be easily grappled with as to the adequacy of the  days there is a distinct cleavage of opinion but the prevailing view amongst the radicals is that tha total should be increased to  the exclusion of votes on account from the  days compatation is strongly urged by mir john ellis whose position as a deputychairman entitles him to a respectful hearing theo there is the demand that tho resolution should be made a sessional and not a standing order but this the government would probably be pre pared to concedeso far as the radicals are concerned therefore ministers have no cause for apprehension amendments upoa the lines indicated above have beeu tabled by mir lloydgeorge mr john ellis mr dalziel and others  but only such of these as take the acceptance of the time limit for granted are likely to capture the whole body of the radicals in order to give practical effect to the closurebycompartment idea mr channming proposes that the following words should be added to the resolution a committee shall be appointedto be designated the committee on procedure to consist of the speaker who shall be exofficio chairman thereof and  other members eight to be appoirted by the house and seven by the committee of selection the committee on procedure shall consider all notices of motion whether by a minister of the crown or by any other mnember as to the order in which votes are to ne taken or as to any matter relevant to any item in the votes specified in such notice and shall reporb to the house in what order the votes and notices of motion relating thereto ought in their opinion to be taken and what number of sittings of the committee of the whole house are sufficient for the discussion of any elass or classes or groups of votes in the estimates a motion may be made by a minister of the crown or by any member of the committee on procedure one clear day after any such report from the committee on procedure has been laid before the house that the house adopt tha whole or any of the recommendations of such report this may be expected to receive widespread radical support and inasmuch as mr balfour has stated tbat he would have no objection to delegating to a committee of the house the task of deciding the order in which the estimates should be taken the govern ment could not bhb carefully consider itthe opposition to the scheme from the unionist benches which at the outset threatened to assume serious proportions is dwindling away with certain notable exceptions the old members see nothing to cavil at either in the annexation of fridays or in the time limit and whatever original tendency there may have been amongst the new members to follow mr james lowthers leadership they now as a rule shrink from taking a step which would lay them open to a charge of disloyalty to the government upon the first important proposal of the session we stated yes terday the effect of mir lowthers anl mr gibson bowless amendments sir albert rollit proposes that the whole resolution should be dropped and that instead a select committee should be appointed to con sider the scheme embodied in it with power to make additional or alternative recommendations other unionist amendments have been given notice of by sir e ashmeadbartlett who agrees with mr labouchere and mr lloydgeorge that the weekly discussions in supply ought to be confined to morning sittings and by messrs bartley banbury and gedge all of whom object to the time limit mr balfours intimation that there is nothing in his resolution  to prevent a week or fortnight being con tinuously devoted to supply  deprives the irish mem bers of their strongest argument against the permanent appropriation of fridays the right hon gentleman has always contended for a certain amount of elasticity in matters affecting the personal convenience of mem bers and so far back as march  he objected to the idea of devoting one night a week to supply on the ground that a hardandfast arrangement would be unfair to ireland and scotland  if he said  we take the course suggested it must be adopted with refer ence to the irish and scotch estimates as well as the english estimates and the irish members will find that the votes in which they are specially interested wil be spread over three months instead of two or three weeks as at present that i think they would consider very inconvenient and similai inconvenience would be felt by the scotch members under the scheme now sub mitted however the representatives of ireland and scotland will be in no way prejudiced  on the contrary they will have a better guarantee than ever of con siderate treatment especially if the sense of the house proves to be in favour of leaving it to a committee to determine the order in which the estimates shall be brought forwardthe resolution which elicited from mr balfour the abovequoted remarks was in the following terms that in order to secure the efficient discharge of its function of control over the policy and expenditure of the administrative departments this rouse is of opinion that the estimates should be brought before committee of supply as early as is possible in each finncial year and on definite and regular days after wards this was moved by mr john bllis who ex pressed the view that if the government could keep their hands off wednesdays until whitsuntide they might fairly take possession of either tuesdays or fri days for supply and seconded by mr buxton who in the course of his speeeh strongly urged the desirability of systematizing discussion upon the estimates so as to preclude the possibility of miuions being rushed through in one or two days at the end of the session mr labouchere who followed admitted that under the existing arrangement the discussions in supply were most unsatisfactory  but instead of allocaving tuesdays or fridays in their entirety to financial business he thought it would be better to give the government morning sittings on tuesdays and fridays on condition that the evening sittings were left sacred to private members in the end the motion was withdrawn but the debate brief as it was sufficed to commit an important section of the radicals to the principle embodied in the first part of mr balfours motionthe government are being pressed by a section of their supporters who view with concern the inadequateproduction of food supplies within the area of the united kingdom in relation to the population to appoint a select committee to consider the advisability of erecting state granaries for the storing of at least a years supply of wheat for the united kingdom and generally to inquire into and consider means whereby such inadequate food production may be met mr balfour will it is expected make a statement upon the subject at question time on mondayrthe reference to the select committee on distress from want of employmenb which is about to be re appointed will be identical with that of last year ex cept that in place of the instruction to prepare an interim report there will be a suggestion that the com mittee should consider and report as to the means of discriminating in cases of exceptional distress between  the deserving man forced to become dependent upon public aid  and the ordinary claimants for parish re lief in accordance with the recommendation formulated last july that the former class should be exempted from disability as regards thefranchise whether local or parliamentarythe select committee on the royalpatriotiolfund wi be nominated on tuesday as follows mr bayley commander
