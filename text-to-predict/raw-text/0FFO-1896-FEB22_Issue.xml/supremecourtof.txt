for the defendantstho count having taken time to consider allowed the appeal the master of the rolls dissentingthe master of the rors read the fouowing judg ment this was the case of an information by the attorneygeneral against the defendants the executors of the will of mrs frances louisa touemache in re spect of their refusal to bring before the commissioners of inland revenue a  corrective affidavit  required from them by the commissioners under section  of a geo iii e  the information alleged that algernon gray toflemlache the husband of mars frances louisa tollemache died on january   leaving to bin wife onefourth of his residuary estate for her life and that the said a g totlemache was at the time of his death possessed of personal estate exceeding in estimated value �e and that the said per sonal estate included large sums amounting in the whole to upwards of � invested on mortgages of real esate in new zealand the information then alleged that frances louisa tollemache died on april  is hainag by her will appointed the defendants her executors bequeathing her residuary personal estate to them upon trust for sale and conversion and that the defendants proved her wvill in the probate division of the high court in the afidavit made by the defendantsunder section  of  geo il c  for the purpose of obtaining probate they specified the esti mated value of the estate and effects of their testatrix for and in respect of which the probate was to be granted at a certain sum the defendants induded as part of the estate of their testatrix onefourth share of the estate of a g tollemache given to her by his will exclusive of the said new zealand mortgages but they did not include and they claim to exclude intestimating the value of such onefourth share the whole of the said new zealand mortgage securities the informa tion stated that taeresiduary estate of a g tollemache had not been distributed at the time of the death of frances louisa tollemache and no part of the new zealaad mortgages had been transferred specifically to the defendants tho information then alleged as follows  that the executors of a g tollemache afterwards brought ia a residuary account of the estate of a g tollemache from which it apeared that the net value of the said newa d mortgage secarities is  s dand the comnussioners of inland revenue have accord ingly required the defendants as executors of frances luuisa tollemache to bring in under section  a  corrective affidavit and to inclade the sum of � s d being onefourthof � s sd as part of tho estate and effects liable to probate duty of the said frances louisa tollemache but the de fendants refused c the prayer of the information is  that it may be declared that the said stun of � los d being onefourth of � s sd the value of the mortgage securities in new zealand forming part of the residuary personal estate of the said a g lollesuzahe ought to have been included in the value for tle purposes of probate duty of the personal estate of the said frances louisa tollemache and that the said sum was and is liable to dutyc and that the defendants may be ordered to pay the amount of such duty with idterest to the commissioners of inland revenue the answer of the defendants did notvarythe facts stated in the information what the information claimed was that � s d ought to have been included not that the value of a right of action should be included the case was heard before the lord chief justice of england and mr jnstice charles it was contended before them and before us on behalf of the crown that the only right of the defendants as to the new zealand moctgages is a right as against the ex ecutors of algernon gray tollemache to have his estate administered and that such right is an asset of the estate of frances louisa tollemache and is an english asset it was contended for the defendants that the right of action is not an asset at all of the estate of frances louisa tollemache that an asset of her estate was her share of new zealand mortgage debts but that such debts were payable in new zealand and the pay ment of them could bh enforced only in new zealand that therefore they were and her share in them was a foreign asset and therefore they were not liable to probate duty here the first question seems to be what an this case is the asset which can be brought within the purview of the statate as to probate duties  the question is not wvhat in some courts or under some jurisdictions is called and properly called an asset but what is in this case the asset within sections  and  and the schedle part iii of  geo iii c   it is to be observed that the word  asset  is not used in section g or section  or in the schedule part iii what is to be brought into the affidavit in section  and is to be subjected to the duty under section  is according to the terms used in the statate  tho value of the estate and effects of the tostator  and the duty to be paid is a sum of money regulated by the money value of the estate and effects the words  estate and effects  are according to the decisions to be lirmited to personal estate and effects the value in money of anything which is called personal estate in english law is the money amount for which it can or could be sold on a fair sale this description can be applied to a share of new zealand mortgage debts it cannot ba applied to the suggested  right of action a law suit may be a suit in equity or an action at law in either case the question to be de termined by it is what were the rights of the parties before the suit or action was commenced p the law suit does not create the righb  it determines authoritatively that there was before it began a right and it deter guines what that right was and is vhat is called  light of action  s not the power of bringing an action anybody can bring an action tbough he has no right at all the mueaning of the phrase is that the person has at right or claim before the action which is determined by thie action to be a valid right or claim the action or suit does not confer a right which did riot exist before it  it only declares that a right did exist before it ass action or suit is therefore mere procedure an action with regard to a will is no part of the estate of the testator it is a procedure or means cf determlining authoritatively what seas or was not a part of his estate what was or was not an asset of his estate in this case therefore the right of sction by her executors against the executors of a g tollemache was no part ot the estate of frances louisatollemache but her right to a share of the new zea land mortgage debts was a part or asset of her estate the next question then is vaa that right an asaet of her estate liable to pay probate duty and oughbt the value of it therefore to have beea disclosed in the affidavit under section  or in the corrective affidavit under section   the personal estate of a person must almost always consist of different parts the afidavit made under section  in practice in ypecifying what is the value of the estate sets out the different items or parts of which it consists  and each of these items or parts is called an asset ofie a part otthe whole estate in respect of which probate duty is to be paid now it is not every asset of the estate that is to be valued for duty but only such of the asseta of tbe estate as nere at the date of the death of the testator locally within the jurisdiction of the authority which grants the probate this authority which was formerly the ordinary is now the court of probate the dis tinction between assets of the estate which are liable to probate duty and assets of the estate which are noc liable to probata daty though both are assets of the estate was liil down and the reasons were given for it in  by lord lyndhurst cb in  attorneygeneral v dimond   or and j  at p  the dis tinction depends upon the locality of the asset at the time of the testators death if the locality is outside the jurisdiction the asset ia called a foreign asset and is not liable lvhere the asset is a specific tangible article there can be no difficulty in determining its locality where the asset is not a specific article but what is called a chose in action rules have been laid down to determine its locality as to debts due to the testator at the time of his death the rale to be deduced from the cases is that if the debtor is at the date of the death of the testator abroad and the debt is payable only abroad and could only be got from him abroad either by some act to be done there or some proceeding taken toere the debt is a foreign asset but if aithough the debtor is abroad a leal proceeding could be taken here which would in law directlv order and enforce the payment here of the debt then the debt is an asset here liable to probate duty thus in  attorneygeneral v dimoni  the testator was a creditor of the french government for f of rentes at  per cent these were only payable by the french government the debtor in france and payment could only be obtaiued by some act done in france it was for that reason held that the debt the asset was not such an asset as was liable tu pay probate duty in england so inattorneygeneral v hope in   cr mi and rl  it was held in the house of lords that goods in america at the date of the death of the testator sent there by the testator for sale by his agents and debts both simple and contract debts due to uira in america and moaey in american tunds were not liable to probate duty here although all would eventually come to the hands of the executors here so in  pearse v pearse   simon  in  by shadwell vc notes of the government of india payable in india were held not liable because they were payable only in india in  attorneygeneral v bouwens   li and w  dutch bonds due to the testator were held liable but it was because they were payable in england the case ef  attorneygeneral v higgins   r and n  is really to the same effect the head office of the railway company was in scotland the shares were therefore payable in scotland it was held that the executor ought to have exhibited an inventory in scotland in the present case the mortgage debt was payable by the mortgagor in new zealand the debtor was at the time of the death of the testatrix frances louisa tollemache in new zealand  and no action could be brought in england by the defendants directly against the new zealand mortgagor to order and recover pay ment of the moritgage debt the action by the defend ants against the executors of a g tollemache would not obtain the mortgage debts it would oblige the executors of a g tollemache to bring another action in new zealand against the new zealand mortgagors therefore within the authority of all the cases the new zealand mortgage debts and the onefourth share of them in which frances louisa touemache was interested were a foreiga asset and were properly omitted by the defendants from the affidavit under section  and the corrective alidavit under section  unless a different decision is to ba the result in this court from a consideration of the case before lord liannen  in the goods of ewing   p d  in  i cannot think that the case affords any authority apon any question in this case it was an application by a legatee under the will of william ewing to the court of iprobate to appoint an administrator of the will in england although the executors of the will were duly administering the will which had been proved in scot land the crown was no party to the application and was not before the court no question of probate duty irose or could arise at that stage what was said by lord hannen may be authority for saying that the right af frances louisa tollemache to a fourth share of the residue of a g tollemaches estate includmg the newlealand mortgage debts is an asset of the estate of frances louisa tollemache that is not denied bet aothing said by lord hannen goes to show that it is not x foreign asset if it does show that it is contrary to ill other authorities and certainly nothing is said in hat case to show that lord hlannen thought that an tction or sait could be an asset of an estate the claim af the attorneygeneral is in form rightmnmely that the value of the mortgage debt not the value of the ause of action should have been included but that laim so rightiv stated cannot be sustained i agree with the lord chief justice and mr justice charles and am of opinion that the appeal should be dismnissezllord justice lores read the fouowmg judgrment the executors of frances louisa tollemache are entitled to a fourth part of the residuary estate of her husband algernon toulemache a sum of � os d part of such residuary estate is the value of the one fourth part of certain mortgages in new zealand the crown claims probate duty on this sum the ex ecutors resist the claim on the ground that the b los d is a foreign and not an english asset and therefore not subject to probate duty the question is whether such sum is a foreign or english asset i have come to the conclusion that it is an english asset for the reasons which i will shortly give ilis lordship then stated the facts and proceededit is to be observed that neither frances nor her execators could claim any part of this estate in specie the executors of her husband were not trustees of the estate for her all she was entitled to was her proportion of the proceeds of her husbands estate after realization neither frances nor her executors had any claim against these mortgagees to recover the mortgage debtor any portion of it that was a claim enforceable only by the executors of algernon the righbt of the executors of frances as agamt the executors of her husband is a right to have his estate administered administered where  the husband was domiciled in england his will was proved in england his executors are in england and his estate is being administered in england and the money recovcrable will be brought to england the executors of the husband can only be sued in the english courts by the executors of frances it is an english chose in action recoverable in england and is in my opinion an english and not a foreign asset and as such is subject to probate duty here the orr ewing case  pd  is in point a case whichi think is rightly decided the appeal will be allowedlord jistice kay delivered a written judgment agreeing with lord justice lopes in the course of which he said that the new zealand mortgages were not vested in frances louisa touemache they were the property of her deceased husband algernon gray toilemache who died in  having by will given the income of his real atid personal estate to her and his two sisters jointly for life and subject thereto and to another life estate which had expired onefourth of his residuary personal estate to her absolutely the testator em powered his trustees to leave his residuary personal estate invested as they should find it at the time of his death unless they thought pro to change any invest ment the executors of aernon retained the new zealand mortgages and obtamied a transfer of them into their own names but the residue was not divided of course during the life of frances it was evident that the new zealand mortgages were not assets of frances nor was any part of them neither she nor her exeintors could claim any part of them in specie they could not sue the mortgagees to recover the mort gage moneys the mortgages were in fact outstand ing assets of algernon the only right of francesa executors was to call upon algernons executors to realize his estate get in his outstanding assets convert them into money and when the time for division arrived to divide such proceeds among the residuary legatees of algernon the executors of frances could not compel algernons executors to transfer to them any of the new zealand mortgages in respeeb of her one fourth share of the residue that could only be done if these mortgages happened to remain unconverted when these debts and legacies were paid and the residue became divisible and au the residuary legatees agreed that the mortgages should remain unconverted nhat ia law was the interest of francess executors in the estate of algernon p it was a right to recover from algernons executors onefourth of the clear residue of his estate so far as such residue consisted of personalpouety that was a chose in action what wvas its locality  algernon was domiciled in england his will was proved here his executers were in this country they could only be sued by francess executors in tfie enelish courts it was therefore an english choec in action if that was so it seemed to him that anonsuch an asset probate duty was payable if algernon had outstanding assets in many parts of the world his lordship could not see bow that would make any difference the onefourthi share of his residuary estate which belonged to frances would still be an english asset because neither she nor her executors would have any right to any of such investments in specie it was suggested thab algermons executors were trustees of onofurth share of these mortgages for franeess executors and that therefore the case was the same as though frances had invested her own money in mort gages in new zealand in the names of trustees for her self but the difference was that in that case she could have compelled the trastees to transfer such mortgages to herself that seemed tc him the distinction between the sapposed case and the present and in his opinionthe distinction made an essential difference in strictness francess execators  were only entitled to receive her onefourth share of algernons estate in english money he could not see how this coald escape probate duty hlis lordship then referred to the case of  in the goods of ewing   pd  aud said that he agreed with the reasoniag and decision of sir james hannen in that case which covered this point that case was referred to in  laidlay v lord advocate   app cas tqand no doubt was cast upon it he was compelled with deference to the court below to differ frorin their decision he thought that the new zealand mortgages were not an asset of francess estate her executors had no right virtitec o cii to any part of such mort gages their only right in respect of them was to callupon the english executors of algernon to get in his outstanding personal estate convert and divide it when the time for division arrived that right was in his opinion an asset of francess estate whose locality was l un lsh and its valueasin thecaseof au englishassets was subject to probate duty in england in his opnion the appeal should be allowed with costs here and belowbefore lords justices llnmley ray aid snrbsooule v toottethi was an appeal from a decision by mr justice barnes reported in  the timcs lf p  in this case the wife had presented a petition for a judicial separation by reason of her husbands misconduct and an order ha recently been made for a commission to austria to esamine witnesses on behalf of the wife the husband however started proceedings in the austrian courts for a decree of nulity of marriage which he also pleaded in his answer to the wifes peti tion in england the parties were married in austria in s and in november  the wife presented her petition for a jadicial separation which however stood over umtil  as negotiations were going on in september  a supplemental petition was filed by the wife and the same month the husband commenced proceedings in austria for a decree of nuuitv the husbands story was that the marriage was invalid as he thought the ceremony at which be was present was the baptism of the petitioners illegitimate child the case made by him was that he and his wife had agreed to deceive the clergyman who was to baptize the child by representirg themselves to be married but that when they were unable to produce evidence of their alleged marriage in england the clergyman said that for his own protection tbey must go throueh the form again before he baptized tle child that the clergyman then gave them a long discourse in ilatin which he did not understand and ttat he had no idea that he was being married the parties had lived together for ten years in england an elsewhereand it was not suggested that either of them had an austrian domicile the wife applied for an injunction to restrain the husband from going on with the austrian suit on the ground that it wfas vexatious or in tho alternative eor an order on the husband to give security for the wifes costs of defending herself in the austrian conurts mr justice barnes came to the conclusion that the austrian pro ceedings were purely vexatious and made an order re straining the husband from going on with them the husband appealed hut upon the appeal he made au offer to pay afie wifes espenes of
