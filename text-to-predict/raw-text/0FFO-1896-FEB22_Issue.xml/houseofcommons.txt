to the treasury if hi would cause inquiry as to tho convenience of delivering on sundays only those letters and packets except those posted abroad which bore the word  lmportant  written above the addressalr hanbury saidthis is an arrangement which has often been suggested to the post fice but there are objections to its adoption the post ofice has no legal right to withhold letters received on sunday morn ing from delivery to the addressees merely because they are not marked  limportant  by the senders letters can only he withheld from  their proper delivery in due course of post at the request of the addressees and when such request is made it must apply to all corre spondence received seeing that to divide the letters in order to send some only out for delivery and withhold the rest would net tend to diminish sunday labour upon the whole apart from this however it is to be feared that the suggested arrangement might tend to frustrate its own object as there is little doubt that advertising persons who desired to call special attention to their circulars and to insure their being opened would seize the opportunity of marking them  fmportant  laughter and posting them for delivery on sunday morning and thus the number of letters received might be increased rather than diminished cheerssir blundell maple inouired if the post office authorities were aware that in belgium

to flash point varies in nearly every state and that in some states there is no law at all to prohibit the importation of petroleum with a flash point of less than  or  degreeswould be prohibitive of
