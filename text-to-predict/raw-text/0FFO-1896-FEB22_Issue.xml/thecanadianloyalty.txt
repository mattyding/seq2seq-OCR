the oanadlmn loyalty debatei the following extracts from some of thespeeches madeoduring the late debate inthe canadianeouse of assembly on hmr neils resolation expressing the loyalty of the people of canada to the british empire illustrate the attitude of various parties in the housemr mneill in introducing the resolution stated the issue as follows we claim that we have the right of a free people to choose between our own mother country and the american republic and we only ask our good neighbours to let us alono and allow us to work out our own destiny iu the way that to us seems best we choose the british empire as against the american republic should occasion unhappily arise we are prepared to do what men may do to preserve for ourselves and those who come after us what we regard as our most precous political heritagetheir birthright as british subjects cheers it isfarbetterthatthere should be no mistake about this aud i have endeavoured to state the position plainly mistakes in reference to such matters have before now given rise to grave com plications the people of canada are determined to maintain the position of the dominion as an integral part of the british empire and they are fully satisiied that in case of need a united british empire can take care of itself cheersmlr davies in seconding the resolution emphasized its meaning from the imperial and canadian point of view as follows imperial federation seemed to have produced no scheme that nvas practicable but he did not doubt that some arrangement would be made by which the empire would be more closely anited together and the natonal pledge given on canadas behalf by this resolution was an important though perhaps a small step in that direction cheers    as canadiana we can assist great britain in two wayswith means and money perhaps our contribution would be small compared with the amount reuuired for the defence of the empire but the feeling at the back of it would make it valuable but we can assist great britain also bv cultivating the kindest feelings with the republic to the south of us a hearty union between great britain and the united states would be a magnificent guarantee for the wvorlds peace no nation or combination of nations could withstand the united strength of the worlds greatest empire and the worlds greatest republic cheerssir ricualed cantwilightusually regarded in canada as a leader of opinion who has carried sympathy for the united staltes to the point of antagonism to british interestsdeclared his opnion that at the present moment it was very proper that such a resolution should be passed hile he strongly deprecated any attitude of hostility between canada and the united states he expressedhis full agreement with the temper in which the press and people of canada had received what amounted to a menace from america there is he said no doubt that the spirit and pluck with which president clevelands message was received has extorted unwilling admiration even from those who formerly were most disposed to disparage england hear hear and has shown as few other things would ve shown the great vitality and resources which the british empire undoubtedly nosseses it has filled englshmen ar the wrorld over with just and honest pride ihe pointed out with practical good sense the mutual interest of both parties in avoiding any conflictbetween canada and the uinited states and contmued wo are willing to main tain neace and good order in this northern half of the continent and defend it against all comers to the best of our ability bat hand in hand with that comes the right to a free hand on this hemisphere at least all other risks canadians are ready to face if not with a light heart at any rate with a cheerful heart and if the efforts of the combined european powers were to threaten our territory i have no doubt that canada would gird herself up to meet any emergency there is but one foe and that is the foe to the south whom un doubtedly wo might fear to enter into a conflict with not for any anworthy reason english statesmen talk of fratricidal war i will not say it is a mere phrase in their mouths but while they talk of fratricidal war we know it would be a fratricidal war there has been an enormous change in the position of canada during the last  years as every one who has watched the flow of population on this continent knoms there is scarcely one family in ten in the dominion of canada who has not a son or brother or near relative in the ujnited states by no fault of the people of canada canada is one of the most defenceless countries on earthfrom maine to the rocky moun tains at least the united states seaboard from maine to new orleans and from san francirco to oregon is likewise today one of the most defenceless on the face of the earth and if it be possible as some of these people have threatened thne they would carry nre and swvord to every town in canada it is at least equally true that the british fleet coufld lay in ashes every seaboard town on thze united states coast they might destroy tens of millions of dollars worth of property or hold it to radsom but it would be i part property held by british subjects resident in the united states they could do infnite harm to each other but i trust that means will be found whereby england anc the states f will never engage in hostile couision thie true attitudeof the people of canada now and always is that of a people who are loyal butl not subservient who know their rights and nre notaaid to claim themsxit hector larigicyin speaking for the french canadians said that he felt that it was scarcely neces sary to remind his hearers of the constant loyalty of the frenchcanadians it was too well known how truly and faithfully they had always maintained union with great britain only a short time after the cessian of canada an invasion of the country had taken place from the  revolted states but instead of hemn received with open arms as the invaders expected they had been sternly repelled even although the french officers serving in tae unitel states urged the frenchcanadians to join them all overtures had been rejected and the frenchcanadians had remained faithful to the british flag cheers as it was in  so it was in  awhen canada vas again in vaded and again the frenchcanadians had shown that they could not be allured from their allegiance to great britain cheers so it always had been and so he believed it would always be whenever the empire was threatened and whenever a defender was needed there you would eind a frenchcanadian loud cheersmr wxm ridlauaer the french leader of theoapo sition said it is true england was as the miinister of finance said on a former occasion and is yet isolated whether splendidly isolated or dangerously isolated i will not now debate but for my part  thinlk splendidly isolated because this isolation of england comes from her superiority and her superiority today seems to be manifest cheers apart from the realm of letters and artin winch m my humble judgment france is her competitor and even her superiorin everything that makes a people great in coloniznng power in trade and commerce in all the higher arts of civi lization england not only excels all nations of the modern world bat au nations in ancient history as well cheers she is isolated today but we can remember that tho present position of england the degree of marvellous development she has attained dates from the day when her fortunes seemed to be at the lowest ebbthat is from the close of the american war in the last century at that time england had just lost her colonial empire she had lost her american colonies  the only colonies left her were a faw isolated spots here and there and the colony of canadaat that time containing only about u souls since that day the career of england has been simply marvellous since that day she has conquered india grappled with napoleon and brought down the colossus reduced her public debt reduced the number of her paupers and gaols doubled her popu lation trebled her trade and planted strong and per manent colonies in asia africa australia and almost every corner of the world as i said these splendid accomplishments date from the day when her osition seemed to be at the lowest ebb she has done more  she has done what has not been done by any other nation at the present day when the nations of europe her competitors have been concentrating all their energies in the creation of standing armies and in maintaining stupendous armaments england has de voted all her energies to the arts of peace and today her accumulated wealth is such that she is the banker ot the world the ci izens of england today hold ia their pockets the bonds of kings and nations and on the recent occasion when she was threatened with warfare across the sea from a quarter where she had reason to expect nothing but friendship iust by declining the bonds of that nation she inflicted upon it almost as much harm as war itself well these are guarantees of peace i think they are splendid gua rantees of peace  but if the day should comevwhich god forbidif the day should ever comewhich again i say god forbidwhen england should have to repel foes i am quitd sure that all british subjects all over the world would be only too glad to give to her what help they couldall british subjects all over the world not only british subjects of her own blood but british subjects who are not of her owvln blood but who have received from her the inestimable blessing of free dom cheers
