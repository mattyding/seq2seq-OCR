dr jaiesons rfeturn the utmost secrecy is maintained in naval and iitary circles at devonport as to the time of the expected arrival of dr tameson and thearrngerments for landing him and his fellow officers should it talko placs at plymouth under ordinery circumstances the victoria would  be due at plymouth shortly before midnight to night it is stated however that the govern ment tug mtna has been ordered to proceed from the dockyard into plymouth sound at  oclock on sunday night and remain at anchor inside the breakwater until the victoria arrives for tho disembarcation of the pcoyal lancashire regi ment the trusty another government tug will leave the eamoaze at  oclock on monday morning by which time it is expected the letnahaving embarked luggage up to her carrying capacity will be ready to return to the dockyard strict orders have been given that no one shall be permitted on board the tug except the military officials whose duty it is to superintend the dis embarcation of the troops and only colonel j w blmes the assistantadjutantgoneral of the wvestern district and a quartermasterser geant are likely to be taken out as regards the landing of dr jameson every communication received at devonport on the subject since wed nesday has been marked  contidential and every precaution has been adopted to keep the most insignificant details from leaking out it is understood that the victoria is under orders to slacken speed on approachin the english coast shouild it be found that she isbefore her time and in advance of the arrangements which are pre sumed to have been made for intercepting her it is stated to be extremely doubtful whether dr jameson will beo landed at plymouth or on the cornish coast ono  wellinformed  opinion is that he and the officers will be trans ferred from the victoria to another vessel and landed at some quiet place further up the coast salcombe or dartmouth being suggested as likely spots tho fact is however that if the disembarcation does not take place at plymouth there is no reason why it should not be arranged for any other of the ports between falmouth and portland presumably the prisoners are to be conveyed to london by the great western rail way an official of the london and south western company arrived in devonport yester dayto inquire if arrangements had been made for conveying dr jameson and the officers and received a reply in the affirmative the inference drawn is that they will travel by the great western linethe folloving first and official lists of the officers and men concerned in the
