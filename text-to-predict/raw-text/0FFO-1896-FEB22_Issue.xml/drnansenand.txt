dr nansen ad the worthpolest feteisburg fea fresh telegraphic information this niorning from eastern siberia states that the news about dr nansen remains indefmnite the report therefore remains vague and uncertain it may be as well to remember that the news arrived here last week during the russian carnival when the whole population from one end of the country to the other were devoted almost entirely to pleasure and feasting what occurs inthe butter week must not be talen too seriously at a banquet for instance in a remote pro vincial town the original news of dr aansens return was madetoconfirmitself andtthispseudo confirmation was gravely telegraphed back to the russlan capital all that can be done in the circumstances is to combine the opinions and suppositions of the best authorities and try to form some idea of the probabilities of the case there are not many of these authorities in st petersburg only foreigners and a few russians connected with siberia take any interest in the intrepid explorer while the rest including the press which is still occupied with bulgaria are absolutely indifferent king oscar has shown the liveliest interest in the matter and the swedish minister here has consulted everybody likely to know or to be able to suggest anythingat the present moment the governorgeneral of irkutsk general gorymykin and also baron toll the siberian traieller are in st peters burg lt was this baron toll who at immense risk and peril left provisions for dr nansen on the northernmnost island of the siberian group and  dogs on the main coast at the mouth of the olenek river westward of the lena general gorymnykin immediately telegraphed for all par ticulars and no doubt a special messenger was seut on to yakutsk at once an answer by this means cannot be expected in less than a month provided that dr nlansen or his men are not met on the road from kirensk the end of the tele graph wire the post takes  or  days to go to yaktatk and beyond that place there is a post only tvice or three times a yearbaron toll considers that the correction of the fist report to the effect that the news emanated from the month of the yana river instead of from eolimsk adds additional weight to the probability of its being trne as it implies that it came from mi kuchnareff the wellknown trader at yakutsk according to the first telegram the news might have come from some other kuch naxeff at irklutsk where this name appears to be tather common and therefore at flrst baron toll was very sceptical about it the kuchnareff in quastion however has never furnished any ting to dr wansen as the latter did not touch any other part of the siberian coast after picking up provisions at khabarowa and passing through the kara sea the dogs left at the month of t he olenek lhave remained there they might have served a good purpose as captain wiggins suggested in case dr nansen was obliged to retreat by that route dr nansen was to have left despatches for captain iggins at dicksons eaven at the mouth of the yenisei but he evidently passed on without being able to do so as nu despatches have been found on that groupf islands although they have been thoroughly searchedthe fact that the venue of the news has been changed from kolimsk to vist yansk which are hundreds of miles apart does not necessarily imply that it could not have reached yakatsk by way of kolimslr although it must be confessed that the way in which the official kandakoff who is said to have received the news from xl kuchnareff has been moved about over vast distances and invested with various official func tions is not calculated toinspire great confidence the strange vagaries played by news coming across siberia is illustrated by the experience of baron toll who arrived in st petersburg from northern siberia two weeks before the delivery of a telegram which he had sent off three months earlier to announce his departure for home it is quite possible therefore that dr nansen or some of his crew might appear at yakutsk or elsewhere long before any further news would reach st petersburg even should any more news come hero it wi probably be in the posses sion of the public all over the rest of europe many hours before it is published in st peters burg as was the case with the first telegramfebbuamy baron toll further states that men sent every summer from ijst yansk by il ruchnareffs nephew to the southernmost islands of the new siberian group to collect mammoth bones may have very probably reported the finding of dr nansen or traces of him also that he thinks he purchased some tea from mi kuchnareff when passing through yakutsk in  for dr kansens dept which may account for  kuchnareffs being called purveyor to dr nansen regarding l kndakoff baron toll says that there are many officials of that name in yakutsk province the one in questionhowever is to be identified by his having been a member of  sibiriakoffs ethnographical expedition among the yakut aborigines he was then policemaster of verkhoyansk and after was appointed policemaster at kolimsk aron toll explains the discrepaney in the location of this offilcer at krolimak and then at yakutsk by the supposition that although appointed to kolimsk he may have temporarily remained a member of the administration of yakutsk yl nansen wrote to baron toll in november  that he would go with the lena water northwards which must take the ship and the ice still further north into the current of the jeannette but that he might be stopped by unknown lasnd it was no doubt possible he said to drift north from cape cheliuskin but the further eastward he started the higher northward he expected to getbaron toll believes that a succession of islands stretchlfrom the nkewsiberiangroupoversannikoff and bennett islands right to the pole and every thing he thinks speaks in favour of dr nansens returning by this route that he has not yet given any direct sign of his return may be ex plained by conditions already mentionedanother illustration of the dilatory trans mission even of telegraphic news in siberia isfur nished by the siberiau gazete which says that the small staff of telegraphists wth their in sufficient apparatus and wires can no longer cope with the everinreasing correspondence no feiver than  telegrams having recently been sent on allthe way from irkutsk to tomsk by estafette although fte siberian railway has already reached far beyond the latter town vur ouvr corraepondent
