when their royal highnesses bad been escorted to a dais in the hall where the ceremony was to take placemlr j g wanxwrght delivered the following rddress blay it please your royal highnessour meeting today naturally brings back to memory the gracious act of her majesty the queen who in proof of her deep interest in this great hospital in  laid its foundationstone on its uew site and in  again honoured us with her presence and declared it open for the reception and treatment of poor patients it was from where your royal highness now stands that declaration was made there are some here who can well remember the enthusiasm which prevailed  but alas  can also remember how our hearts sank within us when soon afterwards owing to the unexpected demand for parochial rates combined with other causes we realized the impossibility of meeting the expenses attendant upon the working of the whole hospital and we were reluctantly obliged to close five of our magni ficent wards at the same time london south ot the thames began rapidly to increase in population as the census returns for  compared with that of  clearly show so that today the district which the hos pital helps to serve numbers some  people whilst the hospital accommodation is represented by only  beds twentyfive years have passed since then two treasurers have come and gone today i am the holder of that responsible office and encouraged by the presence of the right hon the lord mayor representing the corporation governors i ask your royal higbness as president of our hospital to again declare open for the reception of poor patients two of oar so long closed wards named respectively  bea trice  after her royal highness the princess of batten berg and  florence  after that noble lady ilorence nightingale it may fairly be anticipated that i should say a few words explaining how tha governors feel justi fred in now throwing these two wards open yoar royal highness will remember that in february last in your capacity of president of this hospital you appealed for pabloc support and under the kind sympathy of the laord miayor a most buccesifol meeting wass held at the tilansionhoase wvhen an appeal for � wras made wye had looked forward to a larger response to oar ippeal but unfortunately what with agricaltural and ommercial depression combined with so many other institutions feeling the stress of the times  am only ble to report the sum of � as having been received leor many years past we have been obliged to levote about  per annum towards the liquidation of the debt incurred in rebuilding the hospital this  now received has enabled us to repay ab once about half of our remaining debt and tho charity com missioners recognizing the great needs of south london have extended the period durin which the re maining half of that debt shall be repaid we antici pate therefore that a sum equal to aboat � per annum of our present income will be available for tue noble purposes for which the hospital was designed under these circumstances we have resolved to open two wards accommodating  patients each and pro viding for the treatment of some  extra inptients each year i do most sincerely hope that good fortune may follow us so that these wards may never again be closed from waar of the necessary funds to maintain them but evea upon so auspicious an occsion as the present i feel bound to remind all here of the past and to appeal most earnestly for the liberal support of all our friends in the future and would point out that the most satisfactory way in which help can le given is by annual subscriptions hitherto we have never appealed for such aid  bat our circcmstances are so different and the needs of our poorer brethren so over wheimiur we feel constrained to seek for annual sub scriptions to supplemuent our endowment your royal hitghness will observe in the two wards now to be opened many alterations which the governors have taken this opportunitg to carry out and which we confidently believe will be found most useful and enable st thomass to maintain its position in the fore front of english hospitals on account of its arrangements for the successful treatment of dibease the comfort of its patients the facilities for teaching future generations of medical men and last hut by no means least the increased efficiency of its great nursing schoolthe pioneer of all other narsing systems in the country which owes its inception and practical organization to miss nightingale and which i rejoice to feel is stiu greatly guided by her constant solicitude i have received the following letter from bliss nightingale which with your lroyal hrighnesss permission  wiiu read  hy dear sirit gives us all joy and patients especially your reopening of two muchwvanted wards lying empty for wzant of funds through no fault of their own these wards also contain some of the latest im provements and i hope that all the money still wanted which yon desire and deserve will come in i beg to send my � wishing it were much larger for tne benefit is great not only to the bodies of the patients bus towards rendering those bodies able to tread a nobler more useful course in life by the practical lessons they learn in the wards of order kindness and moderation or selfdiscipline this is especially the case with the children lb is delightful when a hospital is a school of good morals to the patients as well as a training school for nurses and for students and such is st thomass hospital we rejoice that our president the iduke of connaught is to perform the ceremony of opening the wardsi beg to remain my dear sir yours very faithfully rflorence niighitimgal wvith these few remarks i would ask your royal high aness to express to our most gracious sovercign our deep sympathy with her and with her royal highness the princess beatrice in the loss they have sustained by the death of his royal highness the prince henry of battenberg  and at the same time to convey to her majesty our respectful thanks for her good ness in subscribing to oar funds and to assure her that her sympathy is a constant support to us in carrying on this ancient noble and royal hospitalthe dune of connauget in reply sail my lord archbishop my lord mayor ladies and gentlemen i am nowv asked to declarethese two new wards the beatrice and the florence wards open it is a great satisfction to me that the endeavours of this hospital to enable us to at least open some of the wards which have been closed for several years have met with success thanks to you my lord mayor who helped us in the meeting at the mansionhouse last year we have obtained the success which we have of course it wasa disappoint ment that instead of � we have only got �  bat i think half a loaf is better than none and i think we must be very grateful especially thank ful that we have met with so large a response wve know the difficulties at the present moment of obtaining funds for the large number of institautions we are so prdnd of and i am happy to think that we are now able at least to open twro out of the ive wards that are closed nd i cannot help thinking with my friend imr wain wright that this openig today wil prove to the pubiic that the moment there was sufficient money to do it we immediately opened two wards i think they will see that we appealed merely for a practical purpose and that this practical purpose has been demonstrated on this occasion mr wainwright referred to the peculiar difference which exists between north and south lon don with regard to hospital accommodation it is peculiarly striking that in north london with a popu lation of two and ahalf millions with some  ar  bospitals there is an accommodition of  beds while in south london with a population of one million anl ahalf we have but two hospitals with an accom modation of  beds surelv such facts as these will enconrage others to come to the assistance of south london because all of us know the teeming population and we know that it is a poor population ank therefore contains those who cannot subscribe as our richer brethren could we therefore hope that the others who are able to subscribe although they may have no con nexdon with south london will remember the circum stances under which we are placed i do not wish to take up your time with a long retrospect of the history of this hospital it is known to you all you know its ancient foundation in edward vis time in which the sovereign ana the city of london combined we are very grateful to the city they have always takenkr
