latest intelligencethe french crisisparis fleb the scene has been ehifted today from the palais bourbon to the luxembourg in the court of the neighbouring barracks of the republican guard behind the old palace in the gardens and indeed evefywhere within the imsnediate precincts this quiet quarter wore an unusual aspect policemen were on every hand what fact throughout this weelk of incidents and tension is more interesting or significant than thia these unusual precautions were directed against a possible demonstration of lawlessness on the part ofwhom  whom if not the socialists and their followers  reallywhat could be more ironical than the spectacle of these efforts on the part of a primo minister to keep well in hand a motley throng of his supporters without whose aid yesterday in the chamber he would have been upset and forced to rotire the decision come to at the meeting of the three groups of moderate republican senators today was what i foreshadowed yesterday it was resolved to draw up a declaration explain ing why these groups considered that it would be extremely unwise as well as out of piaceto inter pellate the government on its conduct towards the senate it was almost  oclock in the after noon when the senate after the terms of this declaration had been most carefully rigorously and repeatedly revised at a series of meetings which lasted from  so to   received cogni zance of it amid a silence which waas an almost tangible expression of the serioas mood that per vaded the entire house m demole read this declaration as follows after the statements of the prime minister in the chamber of deputies we think it needless to maintain an interpollation which has no longor any grounds and to which the attitude of the ministry has refused beforehand its conatitu tional sanction the ministry means to govern without the senate it has thought itsolf em powered to appeal from one house to the other and alleges thatthe questionof ministerialrespon sibility cannot be raised in the senate we protest against this blow dealt at the clear provi sions of the constitution we intend to pre serve intact the trust which the republican con stitution has placed in our hands we affirm afresh our right of control and the responsibility of ministors before the two houses the parlia mentary reply to the utterances and acts of the cabinet might be on our part an absolute refusal of cooperation but the senate does not choose to suspend the legislative life of the country and in spite of the attitude of the ministry the senaert does not mean to renounce doing its duty it intends to maintam its right in their entirety it will pronounce in its independenceo and writh out any other consideration than the intereses of the country on the proposals of the ministry and will tall on it for an account of its acts the country will decide between ministers who have not shrunk from provoking a most serioiu crisis and an assembly which in order not to com promise the public peace is resolved not to aggravate the constitutional conflict although it his right and law on its sidom bourgeois immediatoly ascended the tribune and said  i wish to notice only one word in the declaration just read it is the word  provo cation which does not exist either in my inten tions or in the facts this disclaimer uttered in a tone rather of defiant protest than of con

endeavoured against the feeling of the entire senste to enter on a discussion of tho constitutional question he was twitted more over by m joseph fabro with unconsciously advocating a revision of the constitution inas much as such a point on which not only the two houses but eminent jurists differed in opinion must be settled if settled at all in a congress at versailles m thzard however was loth to desist and amid the uproar appealed to the president to secure him a hearing the presi dent accordinly asked for a hearing for m thezard but simply as he said to enable him to explain his objection to the order of the day pure and simple the interruptions however continued and m lavertujon protested against any discussion of the constitution for the reason that the declaration had been framed expressly to avoid this eventually m thezard fmding it imwossible to obtain a hearing left the tribunea division was then taken on the question of priority for the order of the day pure and simple

of brandenburg to the members of the provincial diet and in reply to the toast of his health made the following speech our honoured host has referred to the great days through which we have just passed and i should like out of the reminiscences connected with them to relate to you one of my own expe riences which at the time i determined to make known in the autumn of last year during my visit to the battlefields near metz i came to a spot which gleams blightly in the history of our nascent empire i ascended also the heights which witnessed the onset made by the corps of the mark in order to help to win the imperial crown for its king and margrave with ceeply moved heart and eyes bedowed with tears i looked down upon the fields and in my mind s eye i beheld the companies and regiments of the old men of the miark marching by on their blood stained path i saw them falling and struggling with death with their eyes though dim turned towards heaven and with the firn conviction of triumph and of a battle won in their hearts there for the first time became fully clear to me the magnitude of the feat which the mark accom plished for its king in the great war and my heart was roused to vow that ior men who could perform such deeds nothing was too good or too great for their margrave to do in order to show his gratitude this is a retrospect into the great days which we have just commemoratedn now let me place before you a picture out of the jubilee days of last year we human beings are fain anld wont to see in the natural phenomena which take place around us the finger of our gods providence as last june the hohen zollern approached the entrance to the emperor william s canal the night was drawing to an end a heavy storm accompanied by thunder and lightning in quick succession was raging above us presenting an impressive spectacle nature appeared to be in a state of violent agita tion as such a storm could jeopardize the success of the whole opening ceremony my heart grew apprehensive as to whether this undertaking also would be crowned with triumph for it was the great work begun by my grandfather which now approached its consummation before the eyes ofthe whole world and an anxious prayer forced itself from my heart asking whether heaven would not grant us a favouring sign and whether we were destined to see the day of joy the ship entered the lock and passed through on the other side where the canal began two enormous wooden towers had been erected such as the crusaders in olden times constructed in order to make a breach in the walls of fortresses and towns from both towers hung down german flags and a great rope was stretched across thecanal slowly surrounded by deep silence as of the grave the mighty shinp moved forwards behind us rumbled the last thunder laps and the last lightning flashes played across the sky while in front of us lay a sullen and dusky bank of clouds out of which already a golden sheen boetan to radiate the vessel reached the line he tension increased but the resistance seemed in superable the towers groaned and creakedbut the cable parted at last and the ship glided into the waters of the canal at the same moment the first rays of the gleaming sun burst up through the banks of clouds dispersing them asunder and in one short hour the sun shone out in itsull majesty tinder such fair auspices was the canal opened and when the vessel appeared flying the banner of the new united ebmpire it wasgreeted by the thunder of cannon from the ships of the whole worldthat is the picture which the past  years leave on our mind but now arises our duty forthe future that which we have witnessed that which has been accomplished we owe solely to the great emperor william and to his trust in god the whole commemoration of last year culminated in the glorification of his personality lvhich has become nothing less than holy to us it incorporates for us the unification of our long desired new german fatherland it is our sacred duty to preserve this personality the hallowed memory of this noble man puire and sublime against all coraers i am firmly convinced that as you have today so warmly answered the appeal i once made to you to gather round me and to help me in my work so with other help we shall make still further progress iam think ing of the germanwomen and maidens ithought of them on the field of vionville and how they joyfully gave up their sons their husbands and their brideorooms in order to gain for us our fatherland once more with them it lies to enlist new and able men for our ranlks in our mnothers in our good german women there is a mighty power which no one can overcome may they in their callings ever be mindful of what peculiar importance they are and may above all the women of the mfark remember to help us in training up an honest and sturdy generation of young markers full of trust in godand hopeful confidenceig but upon you who are assembled here with beating and throbbing hearts and with buoyant spirits i call to renew your vow to work in re membrance of the emperor william and for the prosperity of our fatherland every one in his ovnsphere whatever he may bewhether deputy official or simple peasant in this sense i raise my glass and cry the mark and the people of the fark  hurrah hieurrnhhurrah ithe german emperor was present at wil helmshaven today at the swearingin of the recruits for the navy and after the ceremony he delivered the following address in the sight of god and of his ministers you have sworn me the oath of loyalty and i expect you to become good and smart sailors lold fast to that which you have promised as the proverb says ione man one word the soldiers of the army have more frequent opportunities of showing before the eyes of their superiors what they have learnt and what they can per term this is not the case wvith the navy because many of you will have to sojourn for years in foreign parts but you must not think that you are beyond the reach of my eyes our navy is small in comparison with those of other nations and is still in the process of growing up but we must be strong bymeans of our discipline and seek to counterbalance therebythe inferiority in material power what is discipline pnothing but unconditional subordination to the will of one above you if every one intends to do good he must subordinate his will to the welfare of the whole only by holding together is it pos sible to do anything thoroughly to perform great deeds and to create a solid phalanxi the emperor concluded by exhorting the recruits to distinguish themselves abroadbygood behaviour and disciplineour gorrcrporndemtthe german coloniesberlin fem during the discussion of the estimates for togo land yesterday in the budget committee of the imperial diet the representatives of the govern ment were asked what steps they intended to take in view of the negotiations between eng land and france for the delimitation of their spheres of influence in west africa dr kayser the director of the colonial department answered that the claims of germany rested not only on the treaties concluded by dr grunar and his companions but also on the acquisitions of captain kling dr wolf and lieutenant von francois england and france wished to come to an understanding as to the regions in the neighbourhood of the lower niger but this could only be done so far as german rights were not concerned if on the other hand they were affected the other powers would have to recog nize them in order to avoid misunderstandings and unnecessary negotiations the imperial government had communicated both to the eng lish and the french governments the most im portant treaties on which it based its claimsin connexion with the estimates for south west africa dr kayser referred to the damara land guano company and stated that the governor had proposed an export duty of  marks per register ton for the guano the colonial department would have to investirate the matter more fully than had yet beenpossibe and especially as to whether the duty was not too low in consequence of this statement prince arenberg suggested that the estimated revenue should be increased by at least go marks to which the government made no objection as was to be expected the english character of this company afforded an occasion for some deputies to complain of the practice of granting concessions to english companies in the german colonies these companies it was argued had been given extensive rights but had done very little the whole of german southwest africa would soon be swallowed up by them to this dr kayser replied that the south africa company alone was concerned and germany had reserved to herself important rights in treating with it the company had hitherto fulfilled its obligations loyally and there was no ground for complaintdr peters has now assumed the role of injured innocence at a meeting of the colonial association held yesterday ho expressed his astonishment at the excitement aroused by his nomination and the nonelection of prince arenberg as to the naval question he had not taken the initiative and had been unwilling to promote tho movement but the president of the association duke john of mlecklenburcr pointed oat to him that as the berlin branclhad adopted such an energetic attitude towards the transvaal question it would only be con sistent if it supported the emperor in his efforts to prepare the mind of germany for the solution of transmarine problems ee had further re cived requmests from various towns to come and read papers in public on the subject which after all was part and parcel of the internal affairs of the association this latter argument put forward by dr peters will not hold good for an instant the question is a politica one and judgng from his conversation with duke john of iecklenburgone is almost inclined to believe that dr peterss agitation is not looked on
