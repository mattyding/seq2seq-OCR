i jjrancatelis cooks guidey nen au illustrious french statesman still in the flesh was invitedto abanquet speciallyntended for his honour at ono of our most pretentious london clubs his cook with a reasonable mis giving as to the consequences of the english cuisine exclaimed  ahmon paurre maitre je ne le reverrai plus in the particular club under the cook who then ruled its r ctis there may or may not have been grounds for the apprehensions so tenderly ex pressed by the devoted chef we carefully guard ourselves against endorsing his alarm for the reason that we knbw nothing whatever of tlhe cuisine to the presumed perils of which his master was exppsed but we can add as conscientiously that it was not and could not possibly have been the club whose health and enjoy ment combined were once under the care of the accomplished francatelli we have dined at that club under his culinary rgmne and can gratefully testify to the superlative virtules of his stupreme de volinlce to the serre of his salad a lc casanova and the touching grace of his incomparable peach fritters such opportunities alas are to be numbered wth the past  but we console ourselves for the loss of his savoury exemplifications by the welcome reception of his artistic masims and by the knowledge that if he is lost to his contemporaries he is at least devoting himself to the instruction of posterityif consoledby this reflection we turnto the cooks uide we find that this is not however the meag musm opues on which the author rests his reputation in asczd scecuorum another book has preceded this entitled the  modem ook which reveals the complicated mysteries of the more recondite opsonia for that work some previous study is required or at least an advanced degree of intelli gence a predisposition to the culinary art or a liberal measure of the light of nature at all events an intellectual superiority of some kind combined with an ample share of the resources which are indispensable to produce complicated culinary products renders that work comparatively difficuilt for mere proselytes of the gate the book before us is more humble but more generally use ful we observe that here the author is doing a wider service to his kind in giving us the simpler and more economical results of his researches and we hail this sacrifice of an artists choicer predilec tions to the modem principle of the greatest hap piness of the greatest numbera book which is specially intended for ordi nary households may benefit all who are depend ent on the ordinary british cookmaid by pro viding that benighted person with niaxirs for her better guidance it is a fact too wellknown and too painfully appreciated that the creatures know ledge of her craft is in most cases rudimnentary it is cloubtless because the public could not bear the proofs of its aggregate helplessness that no com mission has yet issued to inquire and report on her general incompetence it is perhaps the saddest fact of the nineteenth century that our english viscera are so sorely tried without compen sation to our palates or any sense of a healthy atonement if we want an explanation of the pangs we suffer we shall find it in the ignorant empiricism of the culinary regions where the red handed phillis does violence to our victuals we are deserving of better treatment we are naturally a race of strong digestion and our carlyles can vaunt our prowvess at the flesh pots we are supplied literally witlh the best of everything from all contiguous seas and shores and yet dinner is a recurrent discom fort and the source of permanent dyspepsia seri ously speaking the cause is that our cooks being ignorant of the capacities of saucepans and stew pans and all the batterie de cuisine cast their func tions on the more delicate machinery of our in teriors every man his own cook and kitchen fire it is a melancholy reflection seeing what he pays for coals and wages that he should have to consume so much vital heat and to earn the wages in his own diaphragmfor an illustration of the source of the evils we suffer let us cau up for example and ex amine martlha or mary anne martha how do you boil a leg of mutton   sir i puts it into hot water if c wat a piece of salt beef i should put it into coldto simmer the salt out ask this question in a series of households and you will find that this is generally the answer and yet some of the best cookery books tell her to employ cold water and francatelli is no less emphatic this is not one of the proofs of his special skill in his mi tier but simply a passing and obvious illustration of the ignorance to which his skill may be regarded as a revelation to estimate the work of st augus tine and his service to our isle we must first of all take a survey of the state of the barbarianson the other hand if we examine francatellis book even superficially we shall soonfindenoughto satisfy us that lhe is fully equal to the task of their con version we have not done him the justice to test every recipe for this is a feat beyond our power and even oulr deep reverence for his art it is only not impossible because we knowv of a case in which a cookery book was reviewed thus conscientiously and we mention it to the eternal credit of the review ers craft the critic was an accomplished scholar a lover of creature comforts but stiu more dis tinguished as an amateur in the culinary art and higher stiul as an orthodox churchlman of a most scrupuxlous conscience when it was cast upon him in the course of his sublunary duties to review a newv cookery book he did it as we have said by testing every reoipe seiatim and pronouncing on the results as determined by his own hands such zeal might well be taken to imply that providence had a special destiny in reserve for him and he ulti imately realized this in a way which nobody ex pected the story is so old that it is almost new proceeding to australia he with upwards of some  others was shipwrecked and cast ashore on an island in the south pacific and there in virtue of his culinary knowledge as applied to the herbs and ahell fish procured by his companions he contrived to nourisl and keep alive the whole of that forlorn ships company it is a pity he is not here to re view francatelli but it would be a greater pity stiu if francatelli should bear no like fruitif now that lie proffers such a missal for our conversion when in relation to the urgent wvants of the age cookery has the elevation of a home mission to the domestic heathen he should want humble dis ciples to practise his maxims or a discerning public to insist on their observanceif any one wishes for a speedy conviction as to his missionary pretensions let then try the supreme the salad and the fritters already mentioned or let them indulge in his curried ox palates i la florentine or the more subdued savour of his veal cutlets a la maintenon in the recipe for the last named no  we get a good illustration of the practical value of his book it is a common incident to cotelettes i la aiaintenon to find the protecting envelope unpleasantly burnt now this comes from the practice often pursued even at our best hotels of attempting to perfect this fa miliar favouirite upon the gridiron even soyer we regret to say countenances this culinary heresy while francatelli more discriminative says  put them in a sharp oven francatelli is atissue with his predecessors on many points on which if we reserve our judgment we have still an instinctive conviction that he is right he says you should not put milk in greenpea soup you should not flavour grzavy soup with walnut catsup chili vinegar and brandy you should not season turtlesoup wlth currypowder or again put sor rel in greenpea soup for it will make it both yellow and sour somo of these are comparatively new doctrines and if the educated palate is pre pared for their reception they wll be found difficult at first to the barbarian unbelieversmoreover francatelli has promultated to the world a secret which we fancied was confined to ourselves and an eminent mahoomedan tiiieologian who had it by prebrahminical tradition from our first parentsthat a little apple is essential to a per fect curry we believe this was the destination of the original apple according to the talmudists though the ulemas differ and francatelli is thusthe restorer of the culinary ritual his own incon testible superiority in all the lighter products which a profane friend of ours terms the parfumerie of the didner table compels an implicit assent to his doctrines upon these points happily his injunc tions and precepts are stated with an explicitness which leaves nothing to be questioned or desired the cooks guicea and

francatellis is founded on an earlier dispensation which he does not altogether and in every instance supersede he is silent on the serious theme of irish stew if you want a rulmp steak pudding compounded on the right ideal you must stil resort to the modn domestic cookery or if you have a patriotic love for christ mas pudding strangely enough you must refer to the m hoder ottsewife of the

controversy with signor franeatelli on the constituents of his vealandham pie which as enjoined in his commancdments must preduce a result too pungent for our english palates but havmgmade these sacrifices to our desire to find critical fault we have no comment left but words ofi praiseand gratitude his cooks guide is an admi rable manual for every household where pleasure health andeeonomy are consulted hehas imparted all that can be imparted of his personal excellence we are aware that much of a chefs manipulation of his sense of flavour as a corrective to the varying quality of his inoredients of his coup dril and capacity to deal wah the unforeseenin short of the personal skill of the performer can never be im parted inbooks or indeed in any form of instruc tion the idiosyncrasy of a cook is impressed on his most volatile materials and as no two persons seo precisely the same rainbow so no two hands compound identically the same dish in the most homely forms of cookery in the west of eng land for example where the abigails generally excel in the frying of pancakes we never met with any two who produced them of exactly the same consistency and one pancake differed from another pancake in savour as one star differs from another star in brilliancy a fortiori in the preparation of a salmi or a mayontzaise there is a greater latitude for this variety of results and no one must suppose that with the very best instruc tions he will precisely imitate the manner of the author subject to this qualification however a book such as this is the best service which an ac i complished cook can render for it really does popularize some of his best combinations and subject to refined distinctions renders them possible to the meanest capacity
