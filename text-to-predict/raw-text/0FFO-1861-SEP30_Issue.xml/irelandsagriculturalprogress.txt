occupier of  acres tells us that he holds  acres in tillage wishing that he had less the grass paying best without so much labour and troublein this county where grazing and arable hus bandry are both well done the question wiich closed our last paper should be understood and ac cordingly we find here a confirmation of our already published inferences as to the forms of agriculture best adapted to ireland mtr william levinge of mullingar a leading agriculturist formerly assistantcommissioner at the board of public works conducting the lands improvement act and now breeding sheep cattle and horses on a farm two tlirds in tillage is our authority for the following statements the best grazing lands canbe stocked in autumn with fatting cattle which are kept out all winter with a little hay and are sold off fat in june when another lot is put on and sold fat in novem ber such landspayhigherrents andyieldmore animal produce than if tilled often presenting also natural mpediments to regular tilage eo that they wiu always be most prolitably left in permanent pasture but the case is different with medium and light lands a farm of  statute acres of fair pasture land annually produces  to  worth of meat and wool but the same land with say onethird of the farm in tillage by growing green crops c on a good four or five course rotation wil produce l worth of beef mutton and wool besides a large amount of bacon pork and poultry the dairy produce being alike in both cases while there will further be  to  value of corn and seeds on the very light soils the dlference is even greaterin favour of tillage husbandry and after allowing for the difference in amount of labour expended it is estimated that the medium and light lands of ireland would be twothirds more productive and remunerative undlor a good system of mixed husbandry than if lkept in pasture only a century ago there was so little tillage in ireland thrt the royal dublin so ciety offered premiums to persons who should break up lea ground at present the ex tent is below g acres but the agrono nmical maps show that land coming under the denomination of medium and light soil which it is considered would be much more productive under alternate husbandry than under grass covers  acres or twvotlirds of the entire area in cultivation hence a vast field exists for the increased production not of wheatbut of livestock and the roots grasses and oatswhiclh are the food of live stock by the conversion of middling and in ferior grazing lands into tillage and capital for in vestment and hands to labour now

at lhomein westmeath as in so many other districts we found a lack of good workmen as well as a rate of wrages that in englandwould be very low labour is not chleap owing to the inefiliciency of the labourers  but undoubtedly a little training under a highler standard of mtliment and housing would secure a more valuable class of men the rail vay contractors finding many of the irish labourers at s aweek equal to englishmen the labourers cottage question stands greatly in need of attention hero better houses are needed by the small farmers but as building is generally declined by the landowners as yearly tenancy prevails and as no compensation for improvement and no tenant right exist men who live in thatched enbins dare not invest their eaunhigs in a confortable slated

though the potato blight has not been so excessive since  a season of famine and suffering will be prevented by the better circum stances of those who will have to endure privations there are now fewer of the most destitute persons and most of the little cultivators have a reserve fund in hand that they did not possess in that time of calamitythe beautiful hill country of tyrone exhibits very different features to the great grass districts we have left here all is plough land and lea under grazing or hay but in aspect present ing a complete contrast to the tattered out at elbow fanning of
