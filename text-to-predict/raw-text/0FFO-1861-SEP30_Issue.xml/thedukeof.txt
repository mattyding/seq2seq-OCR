assistance in his power cheers he couldgnot say tat the duties of lordlieutenant were inthese peaceful times of an arduous nature it was tnre that the volunteer movementhad thrown some additional duty

which may justly be regarded as the principal toast of the evening and i trust you will accord it a recep tion worthy of its importancecit is prosperity to the newly established derbyshire agricultural society loud cheers you are all aware that this society has been esta blished within the last  months and it is therefore not in my power to take any retrospect of its operations you have seen today the first fruits of this newlyestablished association which appear to me to be very creditable but althoiugh tns is the first show of the society you are too familiarwithagricultural associations to renderanyobserva tions of mine on that subject necessary agricultural associations may now in fact be considered as forming part of the permanent institations of the country we have them on every scale we have the royal agriculturalasso ciation we have numerous county associations we have agrlcultural associations upon every scale descending to the most limited extent of country you are therefore faniliar with agrieultural associations and the benefits whlich in recent years they have conferred on agiculture  believe that the counties that are without agricultural as sociations form the exception we cannot for derby claim any forwardness in this matter indeed if any one were disposed to be illnatured they might say that derbyshire as a county has shown an amount of apathy in forming agricultural associations i am afraid the matter might be considered in a stillworse light for if i am not mistaken this is not the first attempt that has been made to establish an agicultural association in this county unless my memory fails me i recollect some  years ago attending a meeting of an agricultural societv in derbyshire at chesterfield and at bakewvell i do not recollect the exact progress of that society but i know that unfortunately after the lapse of some time it ceased to exist it cannot be denied that what has once happened may hapen again but i trnst hat the unfortunate fate which befel the original derbyshire agricultural society will not befal the new one hear mr meet i believe under very different circumstances agricultiure has certainly not stood still in the interval that interval has been a period of unexampled progress in every department of national in dustry an agriculture has not been behind its sister em ploysnents of commerce and manufactures cheers ieheve there never swas a period in wlicll greater improve ments have been made in agriculture both by scientific and practical men and at present we do not seethe slightest cessation in that advance for it is goine on with as much zeal and energy as ever cheerso  may be per mitted to say that i have joined this society with no unfriendly feeling towards other societics of a more partial character already existing in this county i wish them all every possible success and i may even say that i hope to see them increased in number cheers i have been familiar with agricultural societies in other parts of the country and i can say from experience that there is nothing inconsistent in the prosperity of a county associa tion and the prosperity of thlose associations which occupy more limited distrcts in fact i believe they materiallcontribute to the suceess of each other rear hear in those paarts of the country where you find a large number of smau holdlers it can hardly be expected that they will take an interest in the success of a society which does not come tolerably near to their own doors they can hardly be ex pected to aspire to excel except in their own immediate neighbourhoods i feel sure that to absorb these small societies into a general county associaton would be to deprive them of great advantages of advautapes connected with the local societies without nrcsentsthem any adequate return rear many of these loca societies have besides their annual exhibitions discussions on agrcultural matters which though they excite little in terest beyond their owsn neighbourhood are very useful in stimulating the attention of the farmers who attend them and i should be sorry to see such discusions put an end to by the absorption of the local societies into a general society for the wvhole county hear hear societies such as this adequately supported by landlords and tenants ought to be able to offer prizes on such a scale as to excite the emulation of the most enterprising faier of the united kingdom cheers it oughttobe themeans of bringing before the agrcultural public examples of the utmost excellence in every descripton of stock and of setting before them models of what the stock of eveiy farmer ought to he such a society ought to be able to draw to the trial field and the show yard al those instruments whieh the skiu and ingenuity of the nmanufac tiuers have brought tosulch perfection and wlhich have done so much towards placing the agriculture of england in the position in which it now stands cheers we have seen on the present occasionaconsiderable number of agricultural im plements but i trust they will be far exceeded next year for the inspection approval and adoption of the farmers cheers i believe thelist of preminms has been formed on the model of other societies and i think in this respect the comr iltee has acted most jusdiciously but i hope as years roll on and the society continues to progress the committee wvillnot be unwilnlig to adopt any improvements which they may consider advantageous to the society cheers i trust that additional funds will be placed at their dis posal and that the premiums will far surpass those which have now been awarded cheers as to the general utility of these societies it is unnecessarv for me to trouble you with a single word it has been a matter of constant remark that there are many incidental advantages attending such meetings as the present every one must see that it affords a most excellent opportunity for landlords and tenants to meet on the show fieldand at the dinner which according to the good old english custom is the invariable accompaniment of such proceedings hear hear i have always considered it a great practical advan tage for men to explain their experiences to eaeh other on such occasions and i trust that in future still greater benefits will be derived from such meetings but beyond these meetings affording opportunities for the meeting of laudlords and tenants they afford facilities for the meeting together of agriculturista and of persons engaged in com merce and maaufactures some of the most suceessful meetings this year hiave been held in manufacturing towns and im no case have arlcultural associa tors met with a more cordial receptioa than in soene of the great centres of our manufactures hear hear this may be regarded in part as a proof of the established conviction that theprosperity of all classes is intimately con nected rear i erhaps it may also in some degree be owing to the faetthat the points of contact betwveen agricul ture and commerce are becoming closer and closer and that machinery which has played such an astonishingpart in our manufacturing towns is becomingovery day more and niore important in the aqricultural districts eear hear we have long been familiar with the steam engine as agplied to thrashing but duriog the last two or three years those vho take an interest in agriculture must be aware that steam has been most successfully applied to the actual cultivation of the land i would not venture to say how many farmers possess machinery for the cultivation of their land by stcam but there can be no doubt that it has made an immense progress within the last few years and there can be no doubt that steam is destined to play a most important p art in the improvement of agriculure hear habesides the incidental advantages of agricultural societieswe must recollect that their main object is to improve agri cultuxe the farmers of the presnt day have before them a fine field of industry of which their forefathers bad not the slightest idea i believe that the tillage farmer of the present day has before him as wide a field for the exercise of his industry and ability as any man in this country but improvements ought not to be confined to farmers on a large scae no farmer however small his holding ought to consider himself in too hurmble a position to avail himself of the advantageswhichimprovements have placedwithinhis  reachthereisnodesoiiptieonffarminginwhidhimprovenent imay not go forward if tillage farmiodg is

support in my powver and i trust on future occasions we shall see the showv yard better filled and an increasing interest manifested in the wfelfare of the society loud cheersseveral other t oass
