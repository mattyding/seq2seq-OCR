blectionr of lord ma yora common hau of the livelrymen of the city of london was held on saturday in the guildhall for the purpose ol electing a lord lxayor for the ensuing yearusualy the proceedings are of a merely formal character as it has been the practice for many years past to return to the court of aldermen for their selection the names of the alderman next in rotation and someother alderman belowv the chair but on this occasion the function of theliverymen became a reality from the proposalto elect the present lord mayor alderman cubitt for a second year of office postponing the claims of sir i muggeridgewho stands first in the list of aldermen below the chair on the one side it is proposed to return the names of the lord mayor and sir peter laurie whereby the choice of the court of alder men would be restricted to alderman cnbitt as sir peter having once served the office is not compelable to serve awgain and has intimated that he will not serve if elected on the other the names of sir h muggeridge and alder man hale are put forward the hall was filuled with the partisans of the respective candidates and to judge from the strength of the cheering popular feeling among the livery was decidedly in favour of sir h muggeridge at  oclock the lord mayor attended by the aldermen sheriffs coekerell and twentyman the recorder common serjeant and the other officials of the corporation entereci the hail and the usual proclamation having been madethe recorder explained the object for which the com mon hlau had met and announced that to insure the free exercise of the privileges of the liverymen the aldermen would leave the hallthe lord mayor andaldermen then withdrew the sheriff remaining to preside over the hauthe common serjeant on behalf of the sheriffs read out the names of the aldermen who having served the office of sheriff and not of lord mayor were eligible for nomination commencing with that of sir h muggerridgemr jones then came forward to propose the reelection of the lord mayor he could have vwished he said that some man of greater social eminencel had been chosen for the duty but he would not allow himself to be superseded by any uan however high his rank if he werenot equauy zealous with himself iu defending the rights which they were assembled to exercise it was to tlaeir body that the people of england looked for the defenn of their constitu tional rights against the prerogative of the crown before the press of this country existed the uverymen of london fought the battle ei personal liberty and re ligious freedom and shorid the press again be ex posed to the domination of annarbitrary sovereign it was to them that the people vwould have recourse cheers and uproar three times had lord palmerstons govern ment introduced a bil which would have taken from the livery the rights they were nowv assembled to exercise and would have utterly destroyed the political and social in fluence nos attached to the office of lord mayor no ex tension ef political suffrage would have been equivalent to the peeple of england to the loss which they would have sufferedif that bill had come into operation qaestion question time time  the livery appointed a defence comnnittee to watch over their threatened privileges of which he had been a member stjat committee re ceived very little assistance from the cortb of aldermen but one member of the court was in defatigable in giving them all the aid in his power  name nauie it was aldermnan cutbitt cheers and uproar and it was chiefly on account of the zeal which he had shown in defending the rights of the liveryinen that he had come forward to propose his reelection in all pro bability sir eorge grey would bring in another bill next session and whiletheir rights were still in danger
