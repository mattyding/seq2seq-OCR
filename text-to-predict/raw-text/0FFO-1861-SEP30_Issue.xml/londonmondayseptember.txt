zordon monday september  no one can wonder that the danes should resent any encroachments on their independence more warmly than bystanders however friendly to their interests when therefore we hear that the popu larity of the present ministry at copenhagen is endangered by their compliance with the mode rate counsels of england we have not the least reason to feel irritated or to blame the spirited nation which without pretending to be a great power refuses to be treated as a mere pawn on the great chessboard of european politics the doctrine of selfreliance which we have ourselves preached to oppressed nationalities applies equally to a state which is perpetually being bullied by a stronger nation or rather by a whole confederation of states some strong somo weak and puny be cause it is unhappy enough to contain within itself a duchy with a population related to them by blood denmark has a right to her na tional pride and tenacity of national life the peasants who til those hungry clays and those thirsty sands which nothing but danish industry aided by a humid atmosphere would make pro ductive have a good deal of the stuff of eng lishrnen in them perhaps we ought rather to say that we have much of their blood in us that piece of broken land half promontory half islands which almost shuts in the baltic seems to have been formed to create hardwork ing seagoing people with strong natural tenden cies of a piratical kind kept in salutary check by civilization religion and the presence of very powerful neighbours we know what the danes used to be we have their kings in our history bits of their skin on some of our church doors their fea tures and complexion in many distrcts of england and their seagoing instincts throughout our own population the sons of the strong fellows with blue eyes and fair hair the sea kings of former days are now tillers of ungrateful soils and fishers in stormy waters they still hold some dominion in the north and iceland and greenland add to the importance of the danish state they are not quite what they were relatively to other nations but they hold pos session of a most important piece of land if we look at the map of europe it seems plain that in a remote age some provident convulsion broke into pieces the land which shut out the baltic from the north sea and allowed the great lake to flow in through several narrow channels these fragments the danes still hold they keep the gates through which prussia must pass to the outer world the little com merce which pmssia has oatside the baltic must all filter through channels which are danish waters prussia is naturally jealous of apeople so placed if zealand and fuhnen would go down in the sea and jutland would follow after such a catastrophe would open the mouth of the baltic and make a position upon its shores msuch more valuable to a powerful and ambitious nation like prussia but as this is not likely to happen other means have been thought of and the danes are deeply convinced that prussia entertains de signs of annihilating them as an european powerwith this conviction the danes are just now impatient of further negotiation and even desirous of settling the schleswig and holstein question by a standup fight with prussia it may seem a little amusing that a nation which with all its dependen cies can scarcely make up two and a quarter mil lions which has an army under  men and a revenue of about a million and a quarter should be anxious to enter into mortal combat with prussia prussia boasts that she can with an effort bring  men into the field and that she has a population now advancing to twenty millions yet denmark is quite in earnest in desiring to go to war with her it looks like davm chal lenging golru the match however is not quite so unequal as it appears if denmark has only  men to oppose to fifty times as many denmark has a fleet and prussia has none prussia could easily pour her armies through the dtichies of lauenburg and holstein ancd schleswig which with jutland make up the peninsula which is all that the danes have of mainland but then the danes would retire to their islands where now they have their principal cities and would thence in their turn by means of their superior fleet blockade prussia shut her up in the baltic and perhaps destroy her seaports there the  prussians could not get over to zealaud in face of a danish bleet and whilo prussia was devouring the poor prey of jutland the danes might continue at their leisure to burn take and destroy as in the olden time this is the danish view foumded upon the chances of war and upon tho assump tion that prussia sooner or later will certainly attaek them england comes between these two pugnacious powers and reeommends for bearance to both but the danes complain that the advice to themselves is always of the same kind namely to make more concessions to prnssia and to stave off the evil day they feel that thepeace of europe is naturally dearer to england than the integrity of deomark and that any mediation however impartial is apt to do less than justice to the more yiqlding of the twolitigants ac cording to letters froma copenhagen more of this prudent advice has lately been given by earl rus sell and has been followed by the danish ministry some revisions with regard tothe incidence of taxa tion which had been demanded by prussia have been yielded and tho legislation of the whole monarchy is again suspended till next january the conlequence is that the danish mlinisters who have followed earl russels advice have so lost the confidence of denmark that it is thought they will not be ablo to keep their places if they should bo driven out they must be succeeded by others who certainly will not carry conciliation any further but who will think it the interest of their country to precipitate a warthere is no doubt that prussia as the repre sentative of germany is the aggressor in this matter thermost despotic of german princes pro tend to be scandalized by the constitutional grie vances of holstein  every concession on the part of denmark is treated as an admission that she was always in the wrong the frankfort diet which at the request of england was charged with the negotiation has separated for the vacation with out making any provision for it dmeanwhile the orators whose eloquence is not tolerated upon any domestic subjects aro boasting of the efforts now making by the prussians to raise a fleet and they are also boasting that tho object of the fleet is to coerce denmark it is this which makes the danes so impatient to settle the quarrel at once if the prussians should be able to get togethok a fleet powerful enough to beat the danes at sea the fate of denark is sealed the present possessions of that country aro by no means more than sufficient to enable her to maintain ler independence among the powers of the north and if prussia strips her of the dependencies she holds by treaty and some of which indeed prussia sold and received an equivalent for this power which can so il be spared must fall to nothingwe do not think that any ono in this country will consider this to be desirable the influence of prussia in the councils of germany may be very wholesome and theunited action of germany as a great conservative power may be and indeed must be very useful in europe but that cannot dis guise or palliate this attempt to destroy denmark whatever may be the pretence no one can mistake the real object and it seems to us that if our government interposes advice in such a crisis it should be that all matters in dispute be at once brought to diplomatic issue and settled definitively if prussia is really arming herself to fight denmark at sea she is doing a most short sighted thing there is no country in europe more interested in keeping the peace than prussia her existence depends upon tho general con servative feeling of europe in favour of things as they are surely it is not for her to agitate against the danes in defence of the cause of nationalities eer polish subjects might come forward in answer to such a summons and push the principle to inconvenient consequences the danes are indignant and quite ready to fight but it is not from them that danger is to bo dreaded to the peace of europe of course they are only desirous to be let alone we hope however that prussia herself will think twice before she attacks them we have no wish to be put to our election of supporting her with all our power or of seeing her become a prey to a strong neighbour yet this is likely to be the end of any war which prussia may bedin she had much better extend the blessings of a real constita tion to her own people than remodel the holstein budget by force of arms she is not too strong either at home or abroad she is too cold and pedantic to feel or inspire any such warmth of friend ship as would incline us to stand by her even in her follies and her errors when we wvish her well and desire her to be strong it is rather from policy than from any special sympathy between our nature and hers in the iaterest of eng land and in her own wo are anxious that she should commit herself to no war of aggression upon a smaller but not powerless or friendless neighbour denmark may not be able to vanquish prussia but she would certainly be able to weaken her and prussia needs all her strength for more serious emergencies
