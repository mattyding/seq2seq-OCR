i fall olif an iron bridge at york ifono of thc most frightful acddents s regards the loss of life personal injury and destruction id ty m hich cale remembered in york look place on friday afternoon last in conuexion with the new bridge which for some timo past has bcen in the course of constrnction at lendalsome explanation of the construction of the bridge in ques tionand theworks connected therewithmayserveto simplify our subsequent description of the lamentable circumstance to which we are about to refer about two years ago the city couneil and the inhabitants assembled in vestry meetinwhich wvere held in the various parishes came to the reso lution that for the benefit of the city gencrauy and for the purpose of carrying out an improvement which it was su gested should be made by the constiruetion of a street wlich should run direetfromtherailway station to the cathedralan additional bridge shouldbethrown across the ouse at leudal ferry at that time the plan of a lattice girder brig the desin of mr dredge an engineer of eminence resi dent in condon was submitted for consideration and was ultimately adopted as the most suitable the sanction of parliament for its construction and the carrying out of the street improvements was subsequently obtained and the works were commenced and the stone buttresses on either side were completed the piles consisted of four rows of timber of massive dimensions the object of which was to sustain the weight of the ironwork of the bridgebefore it was deposited upon the buttresses then commenced the con struction of the girders a process which inasmuch as tho present is the first example of a girder bridgo which has deen thrown across any river in england excited tho largest amount of interest and curiosity this consisted simply in tho riveting together a number of narrow wroughtiron plates with a vast number of bolts into a sort of lattice work some two or three yards in width and of sufficient length to extend across the river and these were bound roundbywlatmaybetnmdbucklingplatestleconstruction of the girders was carried on so tlhat when completed they might stand like waus of iron trelliswork across the water and as each was completed it was by the means of hy draulic power raised from its supports which were then taken away and the iron gradually lowered to its placo unon steel rollers let into the buttresses this description of bed being adopted for the purpose of allowing of the contraction expansion or depression of the iron when under the in fluence of heat or cold or execssive pressure only a short time ago two of the fonr girders of which the bridge was to consist were completed and successfully wered to their places and as these were the lieavier portionsof the lattice work which were to divide each side of the road from the footpath it was naturally anticipated that the main diflieul ties in connexion with the structure were over there however remained two lighter girders to complete and one of these was ready and was in the course of being lowered at the time when the accident which we will now describo took placeshortly before  ocloclk on friday afternoon the bridge seemed all safe boys ran to and fro with the heated rivets from temporary furnaces on the bridge and the clash of hammers at the various portions of the structure bespoke the active progression of the works the outer or footway girders asofore mentioned still remained on  chocks about this time it was agreed to remove the  chocks or wedges connected with one of the lattice girders so as to place it in its final position prior to the completion of this operation mr pieersgill the city surveyor and xr ackroyd his assistant had passed over the bridge and just departed when mr moore the clerk of the works in the employ of liessrscalvert tho contractors for the con struction and the erection of the ironwork and who was superintending the workmen directed that the remaining chocks should he taken away on the west side of the river for this purpose the hydraulic engine o the spot had to be brought into requisition the girder was raised a few wedges or packings alone remained to be removed when a low rurnblin sound was heard to emerge from the structurc succeeded by a tremulous motion of the moving girder which directly after careened over on to the other adjoining one although stayed by inch beams which in its turn carried away the next andthisgiviing vayalso theouter girder was forced over and fell bodily with aterrific force into the water carrying every thing before it huge beams cracked and snapped like dried twigs andall the massive scaffolding with its iron supports and the side of the ponderous gantry were brought dowvn with a tremendous crash as was also direotlv afterwards one of the immense travelling cranes thus in afew moments the lattice girder bridge which for so many months has been in course of construction and the completion of which was shortly to have been fulfilled disappeared leaving only a bare wreck behind the scene that followed passes de scription there lay the three massive girders on their sides groans and shrieks issuing from the wreck of iron and wood while below were heard the most pitiful cries for help the river around tie scene was covered with fragments of piles and planks and to many of these the unfortunate workmen were clnging one poor fellow who was working on the bridge sprang clear away from the falling mass into the cuitent and was picked up uninjured sonic hairbreadth escapes took place and fortunately many were rescued fromi death one man was brought down with the falling mass and was seen to gain terra ffrma but in a most frightful condition dreadfully bruised and bleeding he lay down audi cried for help whiclh of course was promptly rendered him another poor fellow lay at the bottom of a boat in a deathlike state he apparently had been at the bottom of the river and ith his bloodstatined face ho presented a dreadful spectacle a stretcher was quickly obtained on which he wvas placed and after some kind woman had pushed forvard and covered the face of tho sufferer from the publc gae he was carried to the hospital a place to which he had been preceded by tvo others in a similar condition mr moore fortunately escaped without injury as did also mr lee the resident engineer mr moore and a number of worlkmnen were engaged wvith hammers cutting anway the ironworlc to extricate a poor fellow who had become firmly im bedded between the girders after half an hours exertion the sufferer was extricated the poor mans life had un fortunately for some time been extinct a young lad un happily shared a similar fate being crushed to death and his body vwas conveyed to an adjacent publichouse ilonened exertions were continued in the hope of finding other men and at the close of the evening it was aseer tained that three persons were still missing the whole of whom it is pret confidently antieipated are at present in the river oonsieriug the sudden character of the acci dent it would seem strange that a greater sacrifice of life has not taken place when we state that no less than  workuien were engaged onu the bridge at the time of the occurrence this however may be accounted for by the fact that as soon as it was seen that the falling of the first girder was imminent a cry of danger was raised and a simultaneous rush for life ensued snbioined is alist of kiled and wouidedrichard inasser  years of age engaged as a heater of rivets deadjohn manuel aged abut
