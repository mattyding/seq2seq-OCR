to the choice viands the toast of  the queen was drmk with great enthusiasmlord wodeotiose then said ho had grcatpleasire inp roityto the wymonilbam olunteersa eno lord ara few complimaentary observations on the efficiency which the norfolk corps had attained as evidenced by the recent review in wlolkampark said  i dare say most of you who take suflicient interest in volunteer topies to have read the various speeebes which are made at reviews in different parts of the coiintry have probably noticed a recent speech reported in the times and delivered by no less a person than lord ellenborough no person id the kingdom speaks with greater eloquence than lord ellenborough and no man i am convinced is animated by a more earnest patriotic spirit and although i do not agree in all he said still i think his re marks ought to be taken seriously to heart bv the volun teer body i dont go quite so far as lord edenborough when he says that the military profession is the first profes sion and that the first reward is military honour for my part i havo still some affection for the arts of peace and therefore i am not sure i could go with lord ellenborough in that part of his remarks still i will say that the arts of peace unless you also cultivate the arts of war are of no use ruhehistory of the world denend upon it shows that no nation ever prospered which had not the military spiit unless you as a nation show that you possess the military spirit au that yoe are ready to defend yourselves the arts of peace whioh grow as it were under the shadlow of such a protection can never flourish but that public spirit has never been wanting in england if any supposedalthough for my part i never entertained such an opinionthat a lon peace had in any degree di minished the public spirit of this country they must have been entirely undeceeved by what has taken place durin the last few years we have not wished for wvar god forbid it but we have entertained the feeling that it is one of the first duties of every citisen of a free countrv to be prepared to nake any necessary personal sacrifice to de fend that country in which all that is dear to them is sur rounded by all that makes a nation grand in its historical recollections and all that makes an empire worth livin for i will not say that bonsing well becomes us i will not say that we excel the other nations of the world in patriotism  but of this i am quite certain that we make no idle boast when we say that we come behind no nation in the world in patriotic spirit  and this is the case because we are and have been for ages a free people hear hear bein a free people we know how to take care of ourselves ve respect thc laws we look up to our queen and our goverdment but we rely on ourselvesand that self supporting spirit which has alwvays distinguished the inba bitants of this country and brought us through every difil culty whetber itbe in peace or war thevolunteer force has especialy illustrated the existence of tlis spirit lord ellen horough said that military honour was the highest reward butl think the greatest rewvard of all is the consciousness of having done our duty and we may be certain that wein this district in common with gentlemen in other parts of enland wtto are making considerable sacrifices of tine and taklkg much trouble for the purpose of promoting this de fensive movementare doing our duty in the most effectual andeonspicuous manner but gentlemen while we take credit to ourselves for what we have done let us not forget to look forward to what stiu remains to be done we have seen in another and very oreat country how signally volun teers may fail i shoulde the lat person to say one word in disparagement of the courage or public spirit of the north american natioi but this i must sayi think they have boasted too much and the old saying that pride comes before a fall was well exemplified in what took plaee at the battle of manassas what has occinred will no however prevent the volunteers of north america possessing as they do a pluck and public spirit derived froift this cointry from recovering their high position whichs has certainly been somewhat diminished by recent events as reards the fatal wr in whichthe americans are cngagved i su only say that while we should grieve to see any dimsinu tion of their military spirit for no man ean look with satisfactiou on the decline of a greatstill less a kindrednation yet we must all wish that this fratricidal war may end as soon a possible gentlemen we in this country are not likely to be called upon to take part in such an unhappy contest and i think we may also congratulate ourselves that we have at the present time at all events a good prospect that this country will remain at peace the feeling of every man in this country although he wishes that wyc should be ready to defend ourselves is for peace we echo the old french saying gzre d qreetowfole but ve desire that whileations should respect each other and be prepared to de fend their independence and position in the world they should remain in a state of repose to cultivate those great arts of pseace which distinguish this centurythxat the shield and spear or rather in these days the rifle the great weapon of our volunters and of modern warfare should remao n hun up in sight and ready but stil not be used unless in selfdefence loud cheerscaptain gusnoor responded to the toast and proposed the health of the noble host the mention of whose name was very warmly receivedlord woduedouse in acknowledging the compliment reviewed the difficulties which the corps had encotutered complimented its members on the energy with xwhich thev had overcome all obstacles and proposea the healths of the officerscaptain gutdox and captain beauxns replied the iatter gallant officer humorously remarked that he was a sort of t g adjutant a kind of travelling packman staff officer going abbout with orders to firms wcaring gray cloth in none of his commercial visits had he seen a better quality of gray cloth than he had noticed that day laughter and cheers he had bean tbinking of the days when the fifth henry gave the motto  frappe fort to one of the ancestors of their host when probably parties of men clad in armour were mrustered near the same spot before starting to engage iu the great fight of agincourt coming down to the days of the great marlborough no doubt a similar contingent was then collected and later stil in times of the peninsula and waterloo the same scene would be agaiu enacted at all these pageants the men were differently dressed but the stuff was the same thse men had in old times more false hair on their heads and less on their jowls than was worn now laughter but they wvere lnglishmen to the backbone and acted fuuy upon the motto  freppcfort cheers as regarded the volun teers he believed that in the eastern district they would form the first line of defence as far as colehester in the event of the french landing on the eastern coast the plan of defence in fact in such a case would be for thevolunteers to contest every inch of ground from behind hedges and every available point of shelter falling baek to colhlester where and at warley a considerable force of infantry cavalry and artillery would be collectedhonorary surgeon tunaliuy proposed the healths of the visitors associating with the toast the name of majorgeneral sir archdale wilson of delhi who is an honorary member of the wymondham corps cheerssir aschdale wilson in responding said the pro eeedings of the day must have afforded much pleasure to all who witnessed them as a military man he did not say that thewymondham corps was perfect far from it buthe trusted that its members would continue what they had commenced so well and that by zealous and patient atten tion to their drill they would make themselves as effective as any line regiment in the countrythe toast of  the ladies having been given thc part brokre nsp highly gratified with the interesting proceeding of the day
