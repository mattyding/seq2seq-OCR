ibbla nderoit ob own correspondrwt ndubian saturdaythe poor law commissioners have addressed oir culars to the unions of ireland requesting retuins respecting the quantity and quality of the potato crop these returns will give a tolerably correct idea of the extent of the failure some jnions have alreacly given returns announcing that one half or even twothirds of the crop are destroyed reports to nearly the same effect are contained in the newvspapers fiom various parts of the country but it is difflcult to reconcile tlhs fact with the high price of potatoes d a stone in dabln if the disease prevailed to the extent alleged the crops would be hurried into the market and agreat reduction of price would be the natural consequence even if exportations to england and scotland wvere unusually large there must still be a considerable reduction in price from the glutting of the home market by persons eager to get rid of the crop before the progress of the disease made it utterly worth less it appears from thetables published annually by the registrargeneral that the yield of the po tato crop last year wvas smaller than in any year since the famine though with the exception of  the quantity of land devoted to the crop was the greatest of all in  it was in round numbers  acres in  it was  yet strange to say the produce was nearly as great in the former year as in the latter it being per statute acre  barrels fi  and only  barrels in  this shows that the im pression that the potato was gradually recovering its former healthy condition is a mistaken one in fact it has been rather degenerating since  the year after the general failure this does not prove that the crop cannot be restored it only proves that the means employedtorestoreitwhilethe paniclasted have been iuaccountably neglected potatoes get into a state of decay from causes that produce the decay of any other crop and these causes are pre ventible the farmers reverted to the use of worn out degenerate seed which they committed to worn out soil a proper selection of foreign seed and of fresh ground for the crop due care in draining cul tivation and weeding all of which were anxiously attended to witlh the best results in  would have produced similar resuilts ever since had not the farmers relapsed into their old lazy feel ing of security for which they are now again likely to be severely punished in the linen trade business has been dull shipments to america rare but orders for the french markets pretty large the finer branches of the damask trade are kept in full operation

ceontinue in a very favourable position in the circulation of notes there is some decrease owing chiefly to the small amount of business doing in the country and the lessened activity of enterprise in nearly all branches of manufacture harvest operations still lag be hind the wet weather is much against the finish of cuttiug down and carrying home but much of the grain still lying out might have been safely housed had more exertion een used to take full advantage of the occasional periods of dry veather in several of the mountainous districts of dovn antrim tyrone and derry there is a good

commercethe committee of the defunct royal associa tion for irish rifle volunteers held a meeting last night at no  beresfordplace mwith a view to its revival captain rathbone in the chair m richardson the hon secretary struck a note of discord at starting by referring indiscreetly to the union with great britain ale said if he were to propose a resolution it would be to this effect  that whatever minister would take upon him to exclude ireland from the volunteer movement is a traitor to the constitution and will prove himself a more successful repealer than daniel oconnell he spoke rashly on other subjects also accusing the prime minister of duplicity and saying he only wished to be an irishwoman in order to horsewhip all the irish members of parliament mr j j butler was cissatisfied withl mr richardsons statement and could not see his way to a volunteer movement in this country till protestants and roman catholics had a better understanding as to its objects mr duffy regretted that the union was introduced and wished all differences merged to promote the cause after a short discussion about funds of wrhich the secretary said he had been minus  since last year the
