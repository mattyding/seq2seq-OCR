of national independence the friends of freetrade organized a meeting on the occasion in the great hall of the mansionhouse thero were some opponents at the meeting who madeoan attempt to applaud an orator who said that tho meeting ought previous to entering on the question of freotrade to oppose the at tempts of the english manufacturers to oppress the belgians by means of a treaty of commerce this oppositionx was quite unexpected and the arguments used were stil moro extraordinary it was alleged that in the year  an unjust treaty was imposed on belgium by england at a later period the ostend company was suppressed through the combined influence of england and rlolland in  after tho reestablishment of peace the belgian markets were invaded by english merchants and belgian industry destroyed in  belgium lost  of her feow citizens of whom she was deprived by english influencie these statements were vehemently applauded by the pro tectionist party and cries of  bas lae anglnis i

the jountal des dbats on prussian affairs coupled with a letter from cologne giving details of the ministerial conferences there has excited a good deal of attention here the reason of this wps the impression that the information was based on semiofficial intelligence from prussiathe letter states that the ministerial conference has for its object not merely the arrangementse re lating to the coronation but a number of important questions such as the visit of the eing to comn piefine a possible visit to vienna the recognition of italy the position of prussia with regard to the ihutarian agitation in germany the coming election for the new chambers the army and financesfor the impression still lasts that war may arise from the present complicated situation of europeas for the visit of the king to compibgne the letter says that it is merely a visit of reciprocity for that made by the emperor to the king when staying with his daughter the grand duchess of baden m de bernstorff will however accom pany the kingas for the immediate recognition of the kingdom of italy opinions the letter says are divided in the conference a month ago there was every pro bability for it both prince hohenzollern thedinister president and sclhlenitz were for it and the first announced it to his brotherinlaw pepoli while the prussian minister at turin likewise informed the italian government of thegood dis position of his own government the attitude of the chambers favourable to italy is supposed to have had to do with these good resolution but these the letter says have changed now and both the king and his new minister of foreign affairs are for an indefinite adjournment of the reconition the reasons which induced them to taie this view are supposed to be that the kingdom of italy is not constituted there is the civil war in the south rome is not yet the capital and there is no italy without this venice is ecuallyindis pensable when all this shall have bcen done then it wil be time to deliberate to re cognize the kingdom now would be to recognize thoe unity of italy and encourage the secret societies in germany if there was a war it would be on the rhine as well as in italy by recognizing the state of things in italy prilssid might com promise the german inteiests and austria might complainthe arguments as you see indicate sufficientlyerom what source the letter comes but we will hope that it expresses rather the wishes of tiue reactionary party than the resolutions of the king the passage which says that it will be time to deliberate when italy has got rome and venice is so completely in harmony with the pollyi of nufllity which prussia has pursued since the last fright in  that one can scarcely believe in its continuation at a moment when even the blindest must see that the time of action cannot be much longer deferredthe refleotions of the journal des dibats on this letter sr ao uevoid of interest either according to theun there have been frequent and intimate in terviews betveen the king and his new minister at ostend in wiieh the latter showed himself free of any party feeling and predilection ho sawtho isolation of prussia and the necessity of an alliance he would perhaps have given the preference to england but he makes himself no illusions about the difficulties created in england by an arrogant and intractable public opinion he would not there fore rely on such an alliance exclusively he ex cludes no alliance but would incline himself to a french alliance it would have all the advantages and none of the disadvantages of an english alli ance while it would be the surest means to quiet all approhensions iu germany and allow the govern ments to make the necessary reformsbut in spite of this leaning towards france m do bernstorff has no parti pris he refuses nothing and is ready to accept everythingit is difficult to say whether this readiness for everything and absence of predilection for anything is meant as a compliment or as a satire it is just this political nothingness as germans would call it which has placed prussia in an isolated position so that if the necessity for getting out of it is felt the new minister had better make up his mindthe raising of the rate of discount by tho bank of france to  per eont at the moment that the bank of england has diminished its discount to  per cent has created a considerable outcry in tho commercial world and the funds have felt tho effects of it the coasttionnel takes upon itself to demonstrate the necessity of itit states that the bank had  millions of bul lion on the th of september and has now only  or  millions less in a fortnight the cause of this drain is sought in the purchases of grain and bills of exchangte between marseilles lyons and italyto buy bullion would have been only enriching speculators so nothing remained but toraise the rate of discount the objection that the bullion still in hand is more than onehalf of the notes in circu lation is met by the objection that the greatest part of the bullion is in the  branch banks while only from  to  millions remain for paris which are scarcely too much for  millions of bills which are in the portefeuiellethe circumstance that english capital takes no advantage of this state of thiniggs is explained by the american crisis which has paralyzed everything  and by the importation of grain from england which balances the exportation of other articles from francethe patrie publishes in its private correspondence from filorence details of a mazzinian expedition into theo roman states they started from genoa in the tastane madona di buon  soccorso to the number of  and were captured by the customse guard the moment they disembarked at portigliora opposite the island of elba papers found on board and arms and ammunition show that a descent was meditated on the papal territoryi give this piece of information which coincides with mazzinis orders to the workmens committees not from any areat reliance on its accuraoy but to point out to you a certain state of mind rather prevalent here and not without danger for the solu tion of pending questions mazzinism with which there is a tendencyto identify garibaldism is by no means popular here even among those who are generally well disposed towards the italian cause this unpopularity arises less from any real fear of its power than from a certain national susceptibility which has a tendency to resist pressure wherever it comes from more than once it is truie the italian question profited considerably by the ju dicious application of the pressuro but it was under totally different circumstances the pressure namely was only applied indirectly to france but in the remaining roman territory it affects the french army and the french government directly and might easily lead to resistance surely even mazzini cannot wrish for such a resuit o it may be hoped that there is some mistake about this descentthe directors of the chemin de fer du nord publish a report on the accident on thursday evening in a few lines and a judicial inquiry has begun to investigate the whole affair tho most contradictory accounts both abdut the cause of the accidenit and the number of casualties are current and the confusion is not decreased by the silence of the papers the accident occurred at pm on thursday and not one of tho papers on friday morning had a word about it although it was the subject of general conversation the reason of course must be that they have orders not to speak in order not to frighten tho public and possibly to hurt the  companywvhat is the result rumours probablyfarworse than reality are bruited about and the measure defeats itself if the tliing had happened with you there would have been  letters from eye witnesses and by this time the public would have known tolerably the nature and extent of the calamitythe pati is this morning the only one which gives some scanty datails accordinlg

prince primate i am positively informed from pesth that he has no authority whatever to make propositions to the austrian govermment or to enter into any arrangement with it it appears that in eases of difference between the hungarian nation and tho sovereign it has been long customary for the primate to intervene and endeavour to remove difficulties and restore a good understanding but the propositions they made were i never binding on either party until subsequently sanctioned according toi my letters from pesth little hope is there entertained of a satisfactory result being arrived at in that manner as re gards the rumoured conference to have taken place this week atpresburg between four members of the reicharath and four leading deputies of the late hungarian diet the lloyd declares it a fiction and gives its reasons why dr wieser it believes has not lately been in peath but it can positively affirm that deak is away in tho country that eotvs is confined to his room by illness and that szalay is toiling at some historical work and knows nothing of tho conference beyond what he has seen in the papers the forebodings in hungary seem gloomy enough it is there apprehended bymany thatthis govermentmwill restore defacto absolutism towards wvhich it certainlyhas lately been taking steps in that country and that gradually the old system will re place that in force since last october but although pained by such a prospect the people so far as can yet be discerned show a spirit as undaumted as ever and no symptoms of giving way indeed the resolution and unanimity of all classes are spoken of in letters from hungary as almost surpass ing the expectations of the most sanguine there have been since the dissolution of the diet plentiful opportunities for the population both urban and rural to testify its feeings and decision the members of the diet have been visiting their constituents andrendering an ac count of their stewardship they havo everywhere been excellently received and almost without ex cdption the electors have declaredtheir satisfaction withtho conduct of thor delegates and havopledged themselves to reelect them i could give you

from which individuals and jurisdictions could be mado to depart only by force and would never lend itself to the carrying out of illegal mandates it was fuwther resolved that podmanitzkys portrait should be painted in oil and hung up in the principal chamber of tho townwhall at night there was a serenade by torchlight in honour of the baron all this occurred no longer ago than on the th inst
