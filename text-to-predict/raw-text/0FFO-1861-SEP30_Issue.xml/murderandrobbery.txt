plundered and set on fire mr bagott carried on business as a tailor and clothier at the corner of stafford street at about  in the morning the family of mr beard of that street were disturbed by hearing voices in the side passage of their house and miss beard thinking it was her brother returning home went down with a light in the passage she stumbled upon some bundles of cloth and newlymade mens clothes she saw three men carrying a bundle or two and running away from the house her brother at the same time came down the street information was at once conveyed to tho police station and the constables soon discovered that mr bagotts house situate opposite to that of mr beard had been entered the offlcers found a little gas burning in the small sittingroom on the groundfloornumaerous bottles and drinking glasses on the table and the body of a man lying with his head on the fender in front of the fire with a poker lying across his throat his face was discolourcd with soot and the features wexe not at fiust recognized on turning the body to tho lght it was found to bo that of the proprietor of the house he had been dragged to the ground and forcibly held down in tho positiou in which he was found til lfo was extinct it had probably been found by tho burglars that it was only by holding mr bagott down in this way that they could secure all the booty they desired and at the same time avoid the risk of identification mr bagott was a bachelor  years of ae though pos sessed of considerable property he lived alone and his habits were somewhat eccentric all his rooms npstairs ho locked keeping the keys about his person in his pockets he was also accustomed to carry the days receipts of his shop he hovwever kept banking accounts both in dudley and in bilston but he did not invest all his cash he has been known to produce as large a sum as  from his upstairs rooms this sum there was reason to believe had been secreted in outoftheway places such as the sack ing of his bed or a hole beneath a stone of the floor of all this the murderers seem to have bcen aware for the pockets of his trousers had been torn open with much vio lence evidently while he was alive and while one of his as sailants was engaed in a deadly struggle with htim the keys his pockets ead contained were all laid upon the table the money was taken awaythe burglars have left behind evidence that they were conversant with mr bagotts habits the doors of the up stairs rooms they appear to have forced open one with a blow from a heavy coalammer which they obtained on en tering the house through the cellar the other with instruments brought with them adapted for such a pur pose in a similar manner access was had to the drawers and the cashbox the bed nad been tossed over evidently in the search for secreted money one of tho upstairs rooms is mr bagotts bedroom and the other on the same floor his storeroom in the former ho is supposed to have kept most of his secreted and his un banked or uninvested money aud in the other the goods in which he traded of the former room the bu slars seem to havo made the most searching examination the chest of dramwers was found to have been ransacked and every articlo in it that might seem likely to form an envelope for money was unrolled the chasbox one of the common in secure articles of japanned tin had been wrenched open by the burglars with one of their implements evidently with much force and in greet haste the divisions of the eash box customarily used for holding coin were empty but among a large number of papers iu the bill compartment the murderers had overlooked a  note which the police subsequently found in a drawer kept unlocked and filled with old braces and handkerchiefs the police also found a gold watch and chain and sd in silver and coppers no other property of value was found in the room a fire of paper and linen had been made in the grate and the embers had either been stirred or had fallen out upon the carpet which stretched from the side of the bed nearly to the fireplace this carpet was on fire and if the flames had not been discovered when they were the house would doubtless have been burnt to tho ground the police at bilston are likely to prevent this fearful offenco from falling into the list of those recent murders of which the perpetrators have not been detected recently several burglaries have been committed in this district last night superintendent hicrea knowing that one of thesag was out had taken steps to arrest himn if his con tuct should afforda sufficient plea
