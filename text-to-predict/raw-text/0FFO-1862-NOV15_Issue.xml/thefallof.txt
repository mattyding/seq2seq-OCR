already described in le times six men lost their lives on the oc casion and the inquest touching their death was adjourned till yesterday evening in order that professional evidence might be obtained with reference to the fouudation on which the viaduct was constructed and the quality of the brickwork in the  arches which gave way on the night of the accident witnesseshaving been examined who proved that the deceased men were killed by the arches falling while they were engaged in shoring them up mfr j fowler ce made a statemient he said he was engineer of the hammersmith and city bailway he had examiined the pier the settling of which had caused the faling of the arches it had  settled q inches and moved forward in a westerly direction towards hiammer smith  inches that was the real cause of the accident the ground on which the arches were erected consisted of strong london clay the upper surface not being so strong as the lower hut the latter being of the same character as that on which many of the metropolitan structures including the victoriabridge were erected he had fomnadon a recent examination of the ground that at a particularplace the susr face was different from what it was at the uther parts of the site of the line at the place to which he referred there was an old ditch which in summerand these arches were com menced in augustpresented no peculiar appearance except a slight discolouration of the ground but in winter it was full of water he had causeditto be cut andmaxed coni tion of the ground was exhibited it was more or less mixed with a softer and comparatively yielding matter vhich had found admission through fissures made by the cracking of the clay in summer this altered and uruepected condition of the ground on the west of the ditch had caused the clay on which the foundation was laid to move and the sinking and sliding of the pier followed though the pier itself was sfb from the ditch the material used in the piers and arches was good and the work was well executed iu building the viaduct no arbitrary rle was laid down as to the depth of the foundation this was deternmined by the quality of the ground mr w wilson resident engineer of the eampany was then examined he concurred with mr fowler as to the cause of the aciddent when the line was being marked out for the archeshe examined thefounda tion of the frst six piers and gave a general direction that if the quality of the soil was thesame au througb the same depth as he had flxed on for the foundation of these six was to be adopted the materials used and the work itself were excellent mr joseph cubitt ce and imr robert kerr architect and district surveyor of st jamess ex oressed their concurrence with the evidence given by the other professional gentlemen lr kerr who is professor of constrmction at kings collegc had been appointed by the coroner to view the spot and make an examuination of the sel hie save it as his opinion thatneither the en gineer nor the mnspector appointed by the contractor could be held responsible for not observing the presence of the old ditch at the time they were ainsing the foundations as it was at a sufficient distance from esther of the piers of the arch it passed under to prevent any appearance differ ent from that of the soil all about being communicated to the clay on which these piers were to stand mr oldham inspector over the works gave leidence to the effect that at the time tha arches were commenced the clay at the place where the pier that subsequently settled was placed presented no different appearance from the rest of the soil it was with the recent rains the water came in the ditch and it became necessary to drain it several of the jury found fault with the quality of the concrete used in setting the pier a specimen of which had been brought from the spot by one o them but mr fowler and mr wilson said it had been disintegrated by the lateral move ment of the pier and au the professionalwitnesses concurred in stating that the concrete had nothing to do with the acci dent at the desire of the jury the inquiry was adjourned in order to give them an opportunity of seeing the founda tion of the particular pier after all the brickwork shall have been removed mr cottam firom the office of elsdall and bvrne solicitors to the hammersmith and city ihilway company and mr c v
