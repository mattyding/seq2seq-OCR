bxppebmï¿½ents at shoeburynessit was intended yesterday to make a series of inte resting experiments both with different descriptions of artilery and various targets and kinds of backing for the armourplates but the trials elicited very little interest on the two great points really now at issuewhat forn or kind of projectiles will best destroy iron plates and what combination of iron plates will best resist projectiles the object with which all these shoeburyness trials are made is on the part of the waroffice to bring fowvard irre sistible guns and of the admiralty lo produce in destructible armour just now the guns those of whitworth are decidedly in the ascendant so yes terday was mainly devoted to trying targets in order if possible to restore to them some of the pres tige which has been so rudely andcompletely shaken as we have said however nothing of great public importance came of the attempts it frequently happens at shoeburyness that a days programme of apparent insignificance may suddenly elicit re suilts of the last importance and requiring weeks of daily labour to trace them fully out on the other hand a programme of trials for new targets which are looked upon as certain to yield interesting if not valuable conclusions melts away at a few shots leaving no memento of its having been made save the splintered wreck of an invention loudly asserted to be invulnerable to everything till the first shot knocks it to pieces this was pretty much the case yesterday in the experiments conducted by sir john hlay ip and the members of the iron plate committee and the experienced artillery officers specially charged with aul thcse trials the first attempts were made with the armstrong  pounder in order to obtain some results which sir william desired for purposes with which the public will soon becoine acquainted the gun was loaded with charges of powvder varyino at different times fromi b to b but always with the same kind of projectilea conical llolb shot cut short at the base so as to reduce it to the weight of b this at a range of  yards was fired at the target which mr whitworth had so riddled the day previouis the shots were always directed upon uniinjured portions of the inch plates and contrary to general expectation they in flicted not only a much deeper inldentation than the commnon sdherical b shot but effected nearly double the amount of penetration usually made by the same kind of missile when fired at its full weight of b in no case however did they penetrate the plate or crack it or in dent it deeper than four inches and in every instance the point of the cone was broken off and the main body of metal behind the cone was shattered to fragments beyond the addi tional proof which this afforded that castiron pro jectiles of any form are worthless against armour plates the trials scemed to possess little interest except to sir villiam who was of course aware of theobject with which he made them and ap peared satisfied with their results the next trials were made against two targets each about four feet square placed side by sideadcoveredwithawroight iron armour plate one inch thickz one however had its plate backed with  inches of solid teaic the other wvith  inches of thin cardboard or rather very thick brown paper leaves bound ard pressed together as closely as possible it seems rather a strange fancy to resort to the paper makers for materials of which to build invulner able frigates but it is hard to say in the face of these daily experimnents of what our vessels may or may not be made before the year is out besides the iron plate commuittee have no choice but to try fairly whatever targets the admiralty in their present despair of strong malerials may order to be tested and in the discharge of this duty they have in fact tested an infinity of substances as backing from iron to canvas from cotton wool to gotta percha some time since a trial was made of armour plates backed with papier mache which as a very stiffaand perfectly homogeneous material gave good resuilts though like everything else yet tried it was not equal to teak the mass erf sheets of paper tested yesterdlay wereas it was almost to a cer tainty known they would bestill less capable of resistance two separate plates of wrought iron an inch thick no matter howv tightly pressed together are by no means equal in power of resistance to a single plate of two inchies in fact the single plate though of the same thickness has nearly double the strength of the two and so the many sheets of paper pressed together did not give much more than half the re sistance of a paper backing of the same thickness though in one mass the first shots fired were with the small armstrong pounder with the usual light service charge at  yardsrange each of thesewent through the iron plates and that directed against the target witb the wooden backing buried its whole length in the teak and there remained into the paper baclking howvever the shot barely entered two inches aud then stopped dead the pounder was then fired with very different results it penetrated the armour plates and in turn passed en tirely through the thickness of both targets through the paper one it niade a loose ragged hole through which it was easy to pass the hand for some little distance but the teak backing fiom the elasticity of the wood closed so instantaneously after the passage of the shot as to leave no mark be yond the first dint to show that a shot had struck it at all the whitwortli pounder was then tried against a target of ironi plates  inches thick and incliningbackwards at an angle of  deg an angle at which no gun yet known but whit worths will send its shotthrough the plates this trial afforded a cuirious btht accidental proof of the value of mr whitvorths hardened steel as compared with cast iron projectiles two fbatheaded shot which it was supposed at the time were steel were fired at the inclined target bitt to the utter astonishment of every one they shattered on it and glancin upwards sent their fragments humming through the air a result thus utterly at variance with all previous experiments with the same gun against similar targets was so inexplicable that an immediate inquiry was mtade when it was foind the artillery sergeant lied by mistake taken the eastiron projectites which mr whitwtorth only iuses to exemplify their worthless ness against plates twvo of the proper hardened steel shells were then fired and didl what they have never failed to dowent through the plate though inclined upwards and backwards at such an acute angle and giving a thickness of gin at the point of penetration the last of these two shots though it brke through the plates was broken to pieces itself and its fragments strange to say fell all inffront of the target the charge used with these shot was only tlb of powderin our account of time previous da ys experiments we were accidentally nisled into giving the dock yard authorities more credit than they deserve when we ascribedto them the manufacture of the very excellent inch iron plates of the large targe these plates came from mr browns works at sheffield those who know how long the dock yard authoritie have tried to nmake plates and how signally they have always failed will appreciate the value of this correction aimple time w as oafforded yesterday for all interested to mwake a deliberate exa mination of the interior of this target vhich mr wbitwvorth had pierced on the previous day and of which of course whilethe experimentswere gowig on only a hasty inspection could be granted tee insido now showvs that in some places the fragments of shell have struck with moro force than was at first supposed though in no place with anythinig like the violence with which pieces of a projectilo of such weight exploded by such a bursting charge ought to strike all artillerists naval and scientific menseem agreed that the shell either wants a greater explosive force or else that it explodes too soon and so while still in the side loses so much of its power as to do less harm than it shouild within the ship with a larger bursting charge no one lknows better how to give this power than mr wvhit worth and if this is done both the shell atid the gun wlill according to our present standard of excellence be considered perfect a few nmore months will show whether sir william armstroila or other inventors can beat it if not then in the matter of piercing armoured frigates it must remain in indisputed
