the civil war in americafrom our own coreondentnew york ocr lthe approaching elections engross public atten tion to the exclusion of almost every other topic people no longer ask wliat moclellan is doingf but vhat are the clhances of mir seymour betting men are offering three to one that the democratic ticket will be clected in new york city and two to one that it will be triuimphant in new york state  mass meetings  ratification meetings and  rallies of both parties are daily and nightly held and if any inference may be drawn from the fact that the republicanis are losing temper while the democrats preserve their equanimity it is that the abolitionists and ultiawar party have made up their minds to be defeated first mnud revenged afterwards the republican joar nals invariably asert that the democratic meet ings are fizzles and failures while the demo cratic journals as invariably pass over the repub lican demonstrations with slight or no mention or theassertion that they are held in holes and corner by  nigger worshippers and war contractors tne truth is hoyaer that the meetings of both parties are largely atthnded and that the democrats having the bxest the boldest the most logical and the most popular speakers ot their side draw by far the most numerous audiences one of the treatest gatherings of the political campaign was the torchlight  rally which took place on tuesday night last in the city hall park to ratify the miomination of lir horatio seymouir aud the de mocratic tickcet and to hear in their support the hon mr cox who has juit been returned to the necv congress by tne democrats of ohio as soon s it wvas dark processions with bands of music began to pass up and downi broadway to the place of meeting with banners torches chinese lanterns and a large anid very suestive variety of illuni mated devices fior two hours the stream flowed on till it filled the park to overflowing the crowd presented a highly picturesque and imposing spec taele the

negro with wvhich that gentlemans name is popu larly identified the speeches were characterized soy a degree of boldness that the democratic party has not recently shown and which proves it to be conscious of its growing power and determined to useitin favourof legalityand pence though al the speakers manifested a desire to carry on the war with the utmost vigour there was a palpable undercurrent of sympathy with the south which the meeting appreciated and applauded the denii ciations of abolitionism and of the notable schemcof the president for the deportation of the negro race were loud and frequent and euthusias ticdlly received it was declared that the pre sent congress wvas nothing but a negro debating society that the white labourers of the north would never consent tobe taxed eitherforthe manu mission or tlie expatriation of the black labourers of the south that the abolition of slavery wfithout the consent of the slaveholding states was uencon stitutional and a breach of the presidents oath on assuming office that the election of the democra i tic leaders in the state of new york vould throw mpon the south a gleam of hope that the people of austria and russia enjoyed greater liberty than the people of nwcv york that the amelican flag was disgraced in the eyes of the world by the imbe cility of the lincoln administration that the ship of state was under the control of drunken muinerswho were driving it to destruction that the aboli tionists would continue to vilify general tvrclellan zntiltthey made him president and that if mlr lincoln persisted in overriding the constitution the day of reckoning would come when he wvould be arraigned before the supreme court tried con victed and disgraced it is evident that fort lafayette and the other astilles must have temporarily lost their terrors for hundreds of persons have been incarcerated within the las four mnonths for infinitely milder  trea son than this or on mere suspicion of entertaining the opinions thus openly expressed the republicas assert however that their day is coming that the leaders of the democratic party cannot and shall not be permitted to talk in this manner wlhether successful or imsuccessful at the pous and that not even their election as gover nors and members of congress on tuesday next vill shield them from the operation of martial law and if the government be as mad as the party that supportsjt it will carry out these threats and pre cipitate arevolutionlast night the republicans held their great rati fication meeting at the cooper institute  and as general wadsworth was announced to make his first appearance before a new york audience a very large assemblae vwas the result not one half the number anlxious to be present could be accom modated in the great hall and outside meetingswere consequently organized at which some of the less important speakers endeaoured to keep the disappointed crowd in good humour mr seward was invited but could not attend in his letter of apologyfull of nautical metaphors and similes which was read to the meeting he said the noble fship of state was driven on alee shore  months ago thathe took ahand atthe helm in obedienceto the captains call and that he intendedtoremain at his post promptly and strictly obeying orders he also spoke of expelled iutineers who were coming back from abroad  to board and sink her and ex pressed his conviction that with activity vigilane and perseverence on the part of the crew the pre cious vessel would be carried through all her perils oad greet the waiting nations with the cryof  alls well this little birth of rhetorical fancy having fallen dead upon the meeting the business of the evening was comienced by mr tremayne the candidate for the oice of lieutenantgovernor whoconfined himself to persnaities against mir seymour ir johrvanburen and thetwvo lmessr wood and was biting and epigrammnatic enoughin his strictures to administer largely to the intellectual if not to the ioial gratification of hishearers gencral wadsworth a tall elderlyquietlookingman followcd in a strain of more itnity be spole of the deadly peri in which the country was placrd and declared his deliberate and solemn conviction that it was in the stat and city of new york more than in the valley of shenan doah or the hils of kentucky that the battie of the union had to be fought in all his remarks the patronizing tone assumed towards the president was conspiuous he spoke of ihim as an honesttut inexperieniced man whohad made mistakes but who was faithful and earnest he declared that the duty of the repuiblican party and of all loyal men was to sustain and strengthen mlr lin coln in his arduous task to admonish him when necessary and lead him back to the right patli if he went astray but never to abandon him he also took occasion to express his illwill againstthe british aristocray whom he acused with an ignorance and malevolence characterjstic of ameri cans in all that relates to english affairs of fitting out armed vessels to prey upon american com merce and take captive american seamen while they were all the time pratina of neutrality and of their peaceful sentiments he finally wound up by advocating the  subjugatiore of the south by fire and sword and the manumission of its slaves as preferable to submission or to any recognition of southern nationality or independence but refrained from imitating the example of some of the most zea lous and indiscreet of his supporters and calling his opponents traitors and public enemies upon whose heads were to be invoked the penalties of martial lawthe cells of fort lafayette the gallows and the guillotinethe canvass goes briskly forward on both sides and the excitement increases as the day of polling draws near the republicans in their placards call upon the people to vote for vwadsworth and the life of the nation or for  seymotur treason and dismemberment  while the democratic hand bills and posters invite all true americans to stand by  soymour and the constitution and to over throw w wadsworth tyranny niggerism and swindling contractors they have also exten sively circulated a little card with a wood en graving representing a stalwart southern negro holding at arms length by the leg the naked body of a white infant into whose heart he has just plunged a dagger while the white mother lies dead at his feet uipon a bale of cotton the card bears the inscription  general wadsworths docile pea santry and is intended to prefigure the results of mir lincolns proclamation of freedom to the slaver should that illstarred document ever provoke the servile war which the abolitionists expect the issues to be decided are indeed momentons not only new yorl but eight other statesthose of new jersey massachusetts michigan ill nois wvisconsin miissouri minnesota and dela ware hold their annual elections on that day the democrats reckon upon success in five of the nine and even in abolitionist massachusetts are not without hopes of defeating both governor andrews and mr charles sumnetwo gentlemen who share with mlr wendell phillips mlr horace greeley and the late john brown of ossowattamie the most cordial hatred of the party but by far the most important of all the elections are those forthe state of new york if the democratic victorybe achieved mlr lincoln must either recall his proclamation of emancipation dismiss his present advisers and walkl strictly in the paths of the constitution or brave an organized and powerful oppo sition in congress and in the states which vill sooner or later produce a revolutionary crisis the example set by the abolitionist governors in re fusing to forward troops to the support of the pre sident until they coerced him into the adoption of measmres in accordance with their own views vill indubitably be followed by the democrats if the president should call upon them hereafter for addi tional men to carry on hostilities and public aflairs will either come to a dead lock or a civil war between the rival factions of thenorth a journal which claims to be the organ of american gentlemen and which every week indulges in fierce personal invectives against general vclellan is so violently in favour of the republican ticlket that it declares  if horatio seymour is elected there are but two desperate remedies left to reunite the north and save the country one is an immediate war with england the other the quick displacement of mclellrui and the seizure of authority by some bold military chieftain whom the soldiers truly love and who will return the republic to the people a dangerous chance after he has snatched it from its present perils but as there happens to be no militazr chieftain whom the soldiers love or in whom they have any confidence except miclel an and as the north has more than enough on its hands in figlhting the south without rushing into an unprovoked war with england the despair of this representative of american  gentlemen is not likely to be converted into hope by the adoption of either of his aiternatives were micleflan a manlike napoleon jilable ambitious and daringhe and he alone of all the public men in america might with the assistance of the triumphant demo crats if they are to be triumphant effect a success ful coup detat and if something of the kind be not attempted it will be for lack of a man and not for lack of provocatives or of latent sympathy on the part of large masses of the peoplethe premium on gold notwithstanding the efforts which are made to keep it down by the financial secretary and his friends the  loyal bankers who look upon the commodity as a traitor to the union refuses to go lower than  and  per cent and obstinately and feloniously shows adeterminationto follow its own laws in reference to a superabundance of paper issues the working men of nlew york have begun to discover what they did not previously know that a premium on gold is but another namie for a depreciation of paper currency not convertible into gold and that their ordinary wages of a doliar andahalf perdiemin paperrepresent at the present rates no more than a dollar and that a dollar no longer purchases more than twothnids of the food fuel and raiment into which it was exchangeable in the halcyon days of peace the consequencea has been a new feature in the social history of this countrya succession of  strikes long believed to be peculiar to england for higher wages among the labourers who have recently struck for an advance on the plea of the increased and increasing price of tho necessaries of life are the ship caulkers the gas workers the stevedores and ships porters and the ostlers and drivers of the horse railway cars in all these cases che men have been successful in their de mands and in some instances the mere tnreat of a strile was sufficient to procure a consideration of and an acquiescence in their claimsthe readers of tie times will perhaps remember the case of mr w h winder a gentleman of philadelphia who has been imprisoned for more than a year in forts lafayette and warren with out cause assigned in pursuance of a telegraphic order from mlr simon camern then secretary of war which that gentleman denies he ever autho rized or lhad any knowledge of the case was first made known to the world in my letter to tetimes of the th of august but was not repro duced or commented upon in any of the jour nals of this country last week an application was made on mir nvinders behalf to judge clif ford of the united states circuit court of massa chusetts for a writ of habeas coepis directed to the military commandant of fort warren to show cause why he detained that gentleman in custody the court granted the writ the day before yes terday the deputysheriff on being refused a pass to go in the regular steamer to the fort proceeded in a sloop but found a company of soldiers drawn up on the esplanade and was not allowed to land finding it impossible to serve the writ he returned and reported proceedings to the judge the court heard his statement and replied that it had no means with which to enforce the writ and ordered the papers to be filed and so the case ends for the present mtr winder however is not likely to let the case drop and perhaps the sherif or one of his assistants may yet succeed in finding the means of reaching the commandantif he ever leaves his grim fortress to take an airing in the pleasant purlieus of boston common goes to churelh or accepts the elegant hospitalities of thatlearned city at present he remans as close a prisoner as mr winderthe draught continues to be so unpopular and tho consequences of a possible or threatened re sistance continue to be so distasteful to the go vernment that a demand has been made for its adjournment in the state of new york and gene rally throughout the north to the st of january it is not yet known whether the demand wil be acceded to in the meantime the number of per sons claiming exemption as aliens increases from day to day and affords employment to a large staff of clerks in au the districts of the city under the expectation that many irish and germans io are unwilling to fight for the union but willing enough to vote at elec tions will present themselves at the pollingbooths on tuesday next the war department has issued an order to provostmlarshal general draper to watch all such cases and submit any offenders they may detect to the summary operation of martial law this threat is aimed at the democratic party who are strong in irish support they on their part wil take what measures they can to prevent fraud on the republican side and should an cmi grant ship from bremen or liverpool happen to arrive on monday the emigrants will not be allowed to pass themselves off as citizens and vote for gene ral wadsworth though such things have happened before now in hot political contests considerable anxiety is felt for the peace of the city on tuesday night as both parties are highly excited
