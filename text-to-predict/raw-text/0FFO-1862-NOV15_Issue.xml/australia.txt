a ustbaliafro our own ocorabspowdentmelbourne sr the grest britain sailed or steamed out of port at day light on thursday the th inst under tho impression that she might possibly anticipate this mail by a few days i addresssed to you a short letter and sent the newspapers of the three previous days but as she may not arrivo until after the mail i shall repeat somewhat more fully the con tents of that brief letter no poetical argosy has conveyed over half the world so rich a freight as the great britain wil carry to england she had on board  oz of gold valued at about  she has also  sovereigns and  bales of wool with other colonial pro duce and upwards of  passengers of the gold she has on board oz are the produce of new zealand the great britain has always been a favourite with passengers her first captain mathews bad spent a long life in managing passengers of every degree in such a way as to contribute to their comfort and to the general good order of the ship it vwas he who established the ships character when from her rig and steampower she was by no means so efdicient acraft as sbe now his her present commander gray was then a junior officer he is a good seaman of frank and obliging manners and devoted to his work another cir cumstance in favour of the ship is that since she was changed from a sort of nondescript dandyrig to a regular ship with an auxiliary screw her passage have been re duced to almost a certainty of  daysone day more or less we are not so fabulously rich as we used to be so that a certain passage of  days at a cost of less than onehalf of the charge by the overland route with infinitely more comfort room ease and kind atten tion have conspired to secure to the great britain the very first rank in popular estimation men trust their dearest treasures to her master with foil confidence that the trust will be faithfully performed this is also the case wvith the masters of many of the ships in greens and wigrams lines formerly the london ships enjoyed some preeminence on the ground of superior fare but the charge was then higher by some  or  competition has however equalized the charge and the fare on board has been equalized also the advantage wvhich the liverpool ships still retain is that after the american plan they pro vide bedding and cabin furniture which the london ships as a rule do not to say nothing of some saving of expense which is after all trifing there is a great saving of trouble and i have often wondered that the blackwall liners have not long since thrown overboard the oldindian custom of letting to the passenger the naked tmfurnishied cabin leaving him to put on board his own furniture for the voyage which becomes comparatively useless the moment the slhip drops anchor virhi sipientibius the black wall folk ought to reformn it altogetherthe bombay with the european mails of july made a fine run this time she reached hobsons bay on lmonday the th inst early enough to enable the bulk of the mail to be sorted and delivered on the same dav and even the suburban letters were delivered early on the morning of the th brief telegraphic news was up to the d of august only  days old and by the same mail mr gisborne makes certain communications to this government holding ont a prospect of telegraphic communication between elbourne and london at no very distant day the words which shakspeare put into poeks mouth were probably a mere freak of fancy intended as a fairy boast the poet would probably be as much astonished at the results of the electric wires in  as  the tlivine julius would be at seeing the tenth legion  marching at the rate of  miles an hour by a modern railway i doubt whether an armstrong gun or an enfield rifle would set him thinking so effectually on the necessity for reviewing his old concep tions on the art of warthe event of the month has been a new rush to otago a new goldfield has beeu discovered there some short time since two men named hartley and riley walked into dan edin laden with b of gold which they deposited in one of the banks this naturally produced a good deal of ex citement and curiosity as to the locality of so rich a  find but in colonial phrase the men  kept it dark they had before been suspected of luck and were accord ingly shepherded according to the approved station sinikers fashion but they managed to baffle those who watched their movements subsequently the government toolk the matter in hand and agreed to give them a reward of  provided they would point out a goldfield which should yield  ounces within three months upon this guarantee they disclosed the upper branches of the clutba cr molineux river about  miles from dunedin but almost inaccessible from want of roads crowds hate however gone from dunedin but as cart age thither is  per ton it is difficult to conjecture how the population will be fed as this price vould mnake potatoes about s per lb and everything else except meat in proportion carpenters and mechanics wages had got up in dunedin to s aday and if the new field should answer expectation there will probably be as great a dis turbance of prices as therewas invictoriasometenyears ago as soon as the news was known here there was a renewal of the excitement of last year but rather more moderate in degree several large ships were immediately put on tho berth including the lightning and other firstclass vessels the lightning has since sailed with  passengers the melbourne and the result sailed a few days after with about  more in all some  have gone and there are now about a dozen vessels advertisednamely the wave the japanese the viceroy the mountalexander the prince al bert the warner the golden age the elizagoddardthe sea nymph themstress of the seas theorient thenorwester besidestheperiodicalsteamersaldingaomeogottenburgand city of hobart that several parts of new zealand remote from each other are rich in gold cannot be doubted  but at otago it will be obtained under difficalties far greater than any which the miners ever experienced here the otago goldfields generaly are far less accessible to daunedin than the victoria goldfields ever were to melbourne the climate is very severe in winter and wet until about the turn of the year eveu if large numbers be successful there must be great suffering disease and death to many it was so here the obelisk in the great exhibition does not indicate the cost the sufferings and the disasters incidental to its pro ductiou in spite of al this large numbers of our mining population are preparing to depart they have been ac customed to look the hardships incidental to a new rush in the face and the warnings and sugestions of difficulties put forward in perfect good faith by the press are regarded as jealous efforts to keep our people at home the uews from coromandel auckldand is also rather encouragiugbut as nolighprize of h of gold is held out theotago ushabsorbseverythought at

that about  ounces of gold and quartz were valued at i where similar rich specimens are found here the diffused gold in the reefs usually bears a large propor tion to the ton there are other accounts of large finds but such accounts are often fallacious the only true test being the quantity produced per week in proportion to people and this test is not yet furnished as before a great number of persons unconnected with miningpro fessional men mercbants clerks and others ae turning their eyes towards the islands of new zealand in spite of the constant return of many of the disappointedon e result of the new zealand rush has been the failure ofthe provident institute an association of a peculiarkind established here about seven years ago by mr joseph ma cardy and carried on for some time under his management the original plan was to take deposits from it upwards and to lend the money on the security of real property only the profit and expenses being made out of the difference between the interest received from the mortgagors and that paid to the depositors it had no proprietary capital carefully managed euch an institution might succeed but it hba itginherent defects the depositors being persons of the humbler classes are peculiarly liable to panics and in the event of a ran real property is not imme diately available hence the utility of a proprietary capital about four yers ago one of their auditors cast doubts on tho soundness of their plan and the value of their securities their affairs were then investigated bya commit tee uncounected with the establishment and the result was a favoumble report as to the value of the securities with a recommendation that there hould be a bdy of shareholderswithb asnbscribed capital this was to some extent carried into effect but in such a way as to afford no sulfficient fund to meet a ron several persons who were formerlv cn nected with the institute withdrew from it and for some reason which has not transpired mr macardy ceased to be the manager and was succeeded by mr poiter the present manager who hs been in offic for about four yearxand who is naturally charged with the mismanage ment which has led to the present falure at the period of the new zealand rush of hat year there was a run on the institute which it staed well and tbis in the end improved itb credit onthursday theo th inst in consequence of a similar rud which commenced by per sons requiring their money for new zealand but soon spread to persons who took alarm the institute stopped pay ment for the present but really without any hope of resuming there have since been meetings of shareholders and meetings of depositorsm these have been stormy of course and it is quite clear that the institute is hopelessly insolvent and hs certainly been so within the knowledge of the directors since the last audit and probably since june l many of the properties on which the directors havelentmoneyaro supposed tobe not worth thermortgaged debts secured they have lent money on bad securities of other kinds and the most favourable report drawn up bya gentle man from information furnished by the directors shovs a probable dividend of s in the pound with good manage ment the institute may pay s but some of the share holders have rushed into law or equity or both which does not look very much like a disposition to make the best of a badbargain theliabilities are set down at  thessets at l deficiency  tho nature of some of the assets mining shares mining advances land and enginesand goods adventures show that the directoss have departed from the ordinary business of the institute and it is alleged from the terms of the deed of settlement the consequences to a large body of depositors belonging to the industrious classes are very disastrous sweeping away a larg portion of the hardearned savings of years it may be considered fortunate that the career of the directors has been brought to an end before they bad an oppor tunity of doing more mischief the alarm occa sioned by this disastrous failure has created in the popular mind misgivings as to the stability of other moneyed institutions but without foundation during the otago rush of last year there was a demand upon the banks almost amounting to a rusb but the confidence of the depositors mercantile and othcrs was never shaken so that the moneys drawn out by the crowds going to new zealand soon found their way back to the banks in the shape of deposits by ahipowners and shipping agents to whom much of the money was paid but in tho case of such an association as the provident institute which is not a bank in the proper sense bat is rather analo gous to a savings bank there is no such compensation the deposits withdrawn from it never return to it butto tho regular banks except of course that small proportion which the passengers carry with them to new zealandenglish merchants connected with now zealand will have been disappointed by the nonarrival of the last mail before the th of august the aldinga was delayed and could not have brought the mail which was retarded by bad weather the aldinga too has met with an accident which will take her from that service which she so well per formed for some little time she left hobsons bay for dunedin on the th of august and arrivel on the st on tho d she left otago for melbourne and on the following day sunday struck on a reef about five miles off the bluff it did not then appear that she had sus taded any serious injury and after daylight on monday morning she steamea on but when about  miles clear of the land on a gale coming on she commenced maling water and her commanider deemed it prudent to put back and run into bluff harbour there it was ascertained that one of berplates nearthe screw had been torn off shewas then taken up to danedin and the injured plate was secured or replaced by a new one she has since arrived in hobsons bay and wil be thoroughly overhauled an examination has led to the assurance that the injury is not extensive and she will probably be in a condition to recommence her useful ser vice in a few daysa frightful collision between two vessels the constance ard the tubal cain took place on the th of august about  miles off cape otway which resulted in the immediate foundering of the latter and the loss of all her cresv except one man the constance of swansea was bound for this port with a cargo of coals for the great britain the tabal cain had put into melbourne in the early part of august on her voyage to wallaroo and had sailed again with a cargo of coals for tlo wallaroo mining company of south australia her registered burden was  tons she leftmelbourne on the th with a crew of  men including her captain clarke of these browne hercarpenter is the only survivor the constance is of theburden of ltons she had sighted cape otway on the th after a voyage of s days and the captains account of the collision is as fol lows  on the th of august at  in the eveningwithin  miles wsw of cape otway just when the crew of the constance were about to have tbeir tea he came in con tact with the ship tabal caiu it was just between dark and daylight and the weather was very hazy the con stance was on the port tack at the time one point free and going eight knots the tubal cain was on the starboard tack the constance struck just about the eatheads before the fore rigging causing the tubal cain to drag along her port side where she sunk almost immediately the man browne who is a foreigner was engaged in squaring the crossjack yard at the time and escaped by leaping on board the constance both vessels were engaged squaring the crossjack yards at the time cap tain hewitt immediately lowered two boats in the hope of picking up souie of the crew of the tubal cain butwithout success there must have been a very bad lookout on board the constance as although at  pm it is stiul light the tubal cain so it is stated was not seen until collision was inevitablea collision but of quite another kind aud of a less dis astrous character took place towards the latter end of august between two members of the new south wales assembly in the refreshment room four members of the assembly when the honse adjourned for refreshment which with those who usualy dine at that hour means di� ner but which with others wvho dine early sometimes means taking  nobblers at the barwere seated at one table namely mr terry mir morrice mr hennell and mr peddington when mr buchanan came up to the end of the table and addressed mr terry words ensued and buchanan struck terry and terry retnrned it buchanan had been drinking and was excited about some real or fancied cause of complaint against terry who as far as the report is concerned does not appear to have been to blame for i know of no law which even in the precincts of a legisla tive assembly requires a man who is assaulted by a half drunken rufflan to submit quietly to be beaten the matter was brought before the house by mr peddington and buchananu was commnitted to the custody of the sergeantat arms for a subsequent coutempt of the house the speaker deciding very rightly that his jurisdictirn to notice con tempts by members did not extend to the refreshment room buchanau was afterwards released and has since resigned we have oceasionally had some keen encounters of the wits  and much disorder in our assembly but nothing of this disgraceful character and such a person as the sydney papers deseribe mr buchanan to be does not exist in our parliamentthere is au agitation going on for a fortnightly mail to europe one man also proposes a railway to the gulf of carpentaria some think him mad but there is method in his madness and in less than ten years it would not surprise me if wo were really to have some sort of rail ortram across the continent the whole country to the east of lands boroughs track will very soon be taken up and some means of facilitating transport is sure to follow a cheap tram way to carpentaria and an electric teegraph to europe will come ispon us before many soberminded people have re covered from the

few will be passed the fencing bill which was to correct the damage done to squatters byfree selection is hopelessly abandoned the church and school lands bill is in the hands of the council but they show them selves disposed to make some very stringent amendments in it and if they do the assembly will probaby take the oppor tunity to burke the bill the bill for abolishing state aid to religion is stil awaiting its second reading in the council and its fate is uncertain the division will probably be close but tho probabieties incline to the supposi tion that the bill will be thrown over the four great demoninations which at present receive the money furnish a strong party in support of continuing the grant againstit are all thoeunendowed sects stiength ened by a section from each of the favoured bodies the total amount of the annual grant is only  and there are not a few who while far from being voluntariesin principle do not think this amount worth quarrelling about and who would rather have religions peace without it than reegious discord with it the bil proposes to con tinue to all existing recipients their life interests so that there wil be no violent change no sudden
