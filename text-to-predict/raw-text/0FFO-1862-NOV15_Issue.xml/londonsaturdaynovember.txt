london satupday ntovyeber  it is a conclusive proof of the importance of american affa rs in the eyes of our ministry that they have caused a signal departure from the tra ditions of tho foreignoffice the answer of lord russl to the depatch of il dnouys dz lnuys ha been published iu the azette witliin three days after it was written and the world is now ac qjuainted with the motives which have prompted one government to propose and the other to decline an intervention in the american qnarrel the argu ments of lord russsll note have been antici pated by the public and this is the best proof of their soundness he british government recog nizes tle humane intention of the emperor md would gladly oiu him in any couxseby which the war might be brought to an cnd to act in concurrence with france on international questions and particularly in matters relating to america is we are told the desire of the government since neither her miajesty thequets nor the british nation will ever forget the noble and emphatic manner in which the emperor of the faenci vindicated the law of nations and assisted the cause of peace in the instance of the seizure of the confederate com missioners on board the trent but after due consideration the conclusion of the cabinet is that interference to be successful must be postponed at present neither the temper of the bellige rents nor the opinions of the european powers are such as to encourage the further prosecution of the scheme it appears beyond a doubt that russia of whose concurrence we had been assured at the beginning has received the french over tures coldly and will not at present join in any formal offer of mediation although it would seem from an expression in lord rjusseus despateb that the cxr would perhaps unofficially support the endeavours of england and france to obtain a peaceful termination of the dispute this being the case the intervention would be made by the two western powers alone and the first communi cation of their proposals to the federal govern ment would be coupled with the acknowledgment that the third european power which it was intended to include in the common action had refused to take part in these representations the danger to the cause of peace which would be involved in this nonsuccess is alone enough to make our government desirous of waiting until the assent of the czan can be attained or dispensed withthe general purtort of lord russrs answver is that though a time may come when an offer of mediation may serve the cause of humanity that time has not yet come that this is true no one in this country wi doubt our relationship with the americans and the use of a common lan guage make us more conversant with their opinions and condition than a frenchman can be and we all of us feel that the proposal of an armistice by fegland would just now be used by the war party in america to excite the passions of the people and to regain the power which is rapidly passing from them there is probably nothing that would please the republicans and aboli tionists at this crisis more than a good anti british cry the idea that england had stepped in at the moment when after many defeats they were about to begin a new campaign and had desired them to bold their hands would be quite sufficient to turn all the waver ing population into partisans of war at any price w with the south war with england war with the uniwerse wotild be shouted by the orators at republican meetings and amid the triumphant applanse of one party and the forced acquiescence of the other the peaceful pro posals of the twopowers would be rejected in an insolent despatch from washington probably speculating on our unwillingness to quarrel with him the federal secberyan of stats would accom pany his refusal with such language as would make it impossible for us again to approach the american government with a friendly offer of any kind nothing then would be left but either to abstain completely whatever might be the miseries brought on america or ourselves by tho war or else to adopt a tone and a conduct in our next interference which might compromise us scriouslythe course which the ques iinisters have chosen will we think satisfy not only the english public but even the reflecting men in france and the emperor himself he may have been desirous to let the federals see that the disappro bation of the war which is so general on this side the ocean was not without its effect on the chief governments of europe reports have been so many and so various on this subject that the emperor has done well to let the opinion of his government be fully known it was said by speakers like mr cassius cy that eng landbase englandwas the only enemy which the federals had in euirope and that the coati nental sovereigns sympathized deeply with the efforts of the americans to preserve their union to abuse the britisher and to express unbounded confidence in france and russia has been the universal practice of the republican orators some of them no doubt believing what they said but the greater number impelled only by a splenetic hatred of ourselves and a hope that they would sunder us from our allies on american questions all this is at an end nowl in every household in every soldiers tent both north and south it willbe known in a fortnights timenot only that the french eairaaon wishes to end the war bat that he thinks it cannot end in the subjugation of the south the moral effect of this european discussion is indeed as great as if tho three powers had actually tendered tlleir mediation if a joint note were read to mr sewvard at washington it could add little to the warning he receives from the despatches of m drouywd de leuss and lord russeex and even from the temper of the russian government what the judgment of the british ministry is may be learnt from the passage in lord russeivs note in which he speaks of watching carefuuy the progress of  opinion in america and of his hope that it may be found to have undergone or may here after undergo a change so that the three courts may then avail themselves of such change to offer their friendly counsel with a greater pros pect than now exists of it being accepted by the tvo contending parties we cannot there fore look upon the proposal of the french em perror as having been wholly useless inasmuch as it has called forth such clear opinions from the two leading nations of europe and gives also reason to believe that the russia which the repub licans affect so much to admire is equally opposed to the policy of washingtonlong however before these despatches reach the new world one great question vwll have been fully decided the fate of the constitu tional party in the united states hung on the elections which were held in the first week of the present month for a most interesting account of the preparations for this contest we refer our readers to the letter of our american correspondent it will be seen that in new york city everything was forgotten but the approachingr struggle between mir sxsnrou and general wadsworth and that not only the eyes of the federal government were fixed upon that great event but that all through the north it was accepted as the decsive constitutional battle of the day of the chances of the two parties we of course know nothing except what comes to us by rumour but it seems that the democrats are extremely sanguine of success if these hopes be realized it wiu be indeed a severe blow to the republican party since the country districts of new york have been almost as much opposed to the south as are the new england states them selves and it could only be the disgust in spired by the proceedings of the government which could have so changed the opinions of this large population in a few hours perhaps we shall learn how the battle has gone notj only in new york but in several other states which hold theirelections at the same time itisa momentous contest since the dominant party appear to have abandoned all respect for law and openly threaten their opponents with their vengeance in case of arepublican defeat it may be that the elections will be merelythepreludetosome sharper andmore deadly struggle
