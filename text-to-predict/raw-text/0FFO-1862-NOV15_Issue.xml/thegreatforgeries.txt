tee great forgerres on t banof erglandyesterday again for the thirdtunc the investigtion into the extraordinary circumstances connected with the robbery of banknote paper and the forgery of notes of the bank of england was resunmed before mr alderman cubitt at the justiceroom of the mansionhouse at one oclock the si prisonersbuncher cummings burnett brewer grif fiths and willimswere placed at the bar ia the custody of inspector hamilton the chief officerof the city of london detective police and the examination proceededreirkmahodsonxpdeputygovernoroftbebank ofenglandoccupiedaseat on the bench during the examina tion and many of the principal officers of the bank were also present mr portal one of the firm of contractors for the manufacture of banknote paper at laverstoke was also in attendance as was likewise captain hodgson superin tendent of the city of london police wvho has from the first been largely concerned in the preliminary inquiries ason the previous examinations the court was again crowded with strangersmessrs freshfield solicitors to thebanu again conducted the prosecationmr pater was counsel for the prisoner buncher and mr lewis of elyplace defended brewerfrom the first none of the other prisoners have been defended by either counsel or attorneys of all the six burnett appears to be the most depressed at first as will be recollected he made an earnest appeal both to the bench and to the solicitors for the prosecution to reiease the young woman with whom he had coha bited and who had borne his name urging that she if not wholly gailtless was hardly a free agent in the matters in which he is alleged to be implicated the court adopting that view and on the recommendation of the agents for the prosecution discharged her and thatobject attained the prisoner burnett has never once opened his lips at any of the subsequent examinations cummings has occasionally in his own interest crossexa mined switness whose evidence tended to inculpate himn but with little or no result in his own favour failing in that respect it will be remembered he assailed the witness aubrey in a spirit of fierce recrimination the prisoner brewer who is said to be one of a highly respectable family behaea swith all proper decorum and confides his defence to his attorney with whom he sometimes communicates during the investigation griffiths the man who was ar rested while in the very act of printing forged banknotes in his house on the outskirts of birmingham seemas the most nnconcerned of all and now and then betrays some little levity buncher the butcher a man of great phy sical strength puts implicit faith in mr patei his counsel taking a vague sort of interest in the proceedings and the prisoner williams an engraver affects to treat the matter so far as it is supposed to concern him somewhat lightly all the six prisoners are men between s and  years of age except cummings who is far advanced in life and who is in fact and on his own confession a returned convictfirst of all yesterday the lad henry brown was re caled and reexamined by mr freshfield he saidmith respect to the key mentioned in my former evidence i said i returned it to the prisoner brewer i have since seen it in the possession of sergeant webb the sergeant produced a key that is the key i gave to the pri soner burnett at the request of brewer burnett after vwards handed it to me and i returned it to brewer i said in my previous examination i took all the bank paper from the izedrying machine and while the ma chine was in motion and that i stood while i did so on the side of the machine on which the notes were delivered out i said also i was thea at work repairing the machine it was under repair for a considerable time my father and i did the woodwork and r soper the iron work that machine is attended by two girls who sit one at each end i said i had slept at brewers house one night that was the last time i received bankpaper from him  and about five or six

weeks before the reward came outthis vitness a la about is who appears in the charac ter of an approver has now been under examination everal timeson the first occasion for some hours at a time but fron the first he appeara to have made up his mind to tell all he knew without evasion or nental reservation if one may judge from his mranner in the box he has an swered every guestiou promptly by whomsoever put and how ever much it or the answer might tell against himself as it often did he has declared moreover that he did not expect to receive any of the reward and would refuse if it were offered to him and his whole bearng is that of a per son speaking the truth and the whole trutharthur hutchence examined by mr freshfieldi am an engineer at the taverstke paper mills belonging to

was finished he would quit the mills at that moment the elder brown father of the witness henry brown came to the opposite side of the tank brewer seeing him said george brown is a curious old man and i believe him to be a very dangerous one i said i did not think so as i had always found him attentive to his work and willing tobligefr lewlsif a fewv notes were taken off while the machine was at work a blank would be left but the women in attendance would not discover it as they dont count the notes the counting is done by others banknote paper could not be snatched off the midl without being damaged but the damage would only be by creasing not tearing the notes the notes could only be snatched from the point i have indicated while the machine was in motion the machine does not work with great rapidity  minutes elapse between the time of pet ting the paper in and talsing it out i dont know how many notes would traverse the machine in that inter val thepaperpassesoverin twonotes attachedtogether at one end at a time and fastened to the machine by felts the creasing of the notes would not be a great damage because that could afterward be pressed out the machine is five feet wide and therefore the attendants sitting in the centre of each end would be tvo and ahalf feet from eacb side of the mill the point at which paper could be abstracted would be as near as possible  feet from one end while the ma chine was in motion the witness brown would be at work on it idont know whetherhe hadany workto doat that particular point brown did all the woodwork in the ma chine and the woodwork commences at the point of pos sible abstraction it was in may last i think i wored at that machine and if i was there the witness brown would be there also it was not ny duty to remain at that vulnerable point of the machire while the men were at work george brown the father usually did that and after him mr shenton this is the only machine in that particular room women would be attend ing machines in other rooms but partitioned off from that one onthe sunday visit towhich i havereferred brewerdid not say he conld not stay to tea because his friend mr gager was with him he said he
