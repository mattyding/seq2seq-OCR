it wmas a special case in which the question in substance was nhether certain lauds in bin stead parish hants formerly waste and allotted to the plaintsffunder au enclosure actafter a commutation of the tithes of the parishhavinz been since cultivated as hop grounds was liable to the extraordinary rentcharge awarded in respect of hop grounds in effect indeed the question was broader stillviz whether waste lands en closed and cultivated after a comnustation of tithes are liable to tithe or tithe rentchargethis question it will be seen was one of very great and geueral interest to owners and occnpiers of land the plaintiff was the owvner and occupier of common or vaste laud in thearish of binstead in haampshire of which the defendant lsh is vicar in  tho tithes of the parish were com mutedthe land in question theu lying waste the com missioners found that tho estimated quantity in statuto measure of the lands in the parish subject to tithes was ssg acresie  acres of cultihated

valuers appointed tocarr out the valuationestimated the rentcharge payableto the vicar at that is  ordi nary rentcharge and  extraordinary for hop grounds the award did not apportion any ordinary ren

plaintiff of the land in question about s the plaintiff began to cultirvte the land as hop pround and had since then continued to do so the defen dant tme vicar had claimed to be entitled to the extraor dinary rentcharge of  an acre on the land so cul tivauted as hop ground but had not attempted to enforce its payment until  wvhen he distrained for l in respect to two yearsrentchargethereon the question wvas as to the validity of the distress or in othes vords as to the liabi lity of the enclosed and newly cultivated land to tithe or tithe rentcharge a nd it will be seen the question soon re solved itself into the still larger question whether svasto lands enclosed and cultivated since a tithe commutation are lihn tn tthlr arn tithe vnetaspmr coleridge qc with hdm mir garth argued on tb part of the plaintiff the caltivator that he was iot limble thereto his argument was that the land could not be liable to extraordinarv tithe renteharne becaiuse it coldnever have been liable to ordimary tithe rentcharge or in other words that the land was land of wbich the titho had not been commuted and which was not liable to tithemr justioe wigtnnsyou say in effec that the land having been enclosed and cultivated after the comma tation is to be held ever afterwards tithe freemir colramaeundoubtedly it is to be taken asquite clear that the land never could nor can be liable to ordinary tithe rentcharge so that if it had been cultivated as wheat land there woula really have been no nuestion at a that it ould not have been liable it vwould be too clear for argument and my argument is that land which never could be liable to ordinary rentcharge can never be liable to extraordinary rentcharge by the gth section of the tithe commutation act the old tithe is zoneextin guished for ever and the sole question is whether anv pro vidon in tho act imposes the liabiligy on this land bow the commutation deals with thelands then liable and these lands having been from all time barren and producing nothing titheable were not liable hence they were not and conld not be on the commatationthe lord chief justice pointed oat an express pro vision in the act for cases where hop ground was tured into garden ground or garlen groundi into hon groundmr colerrdge atlmdtted that was so anid urged that it made his argument all the stronger since there was a special provision to meet that class of cases and there was no pro vision to meet the present casemr justice blacanburpnxo doubt it was not contem platedmr colemidgethis it is believed is the first casc ia which it has occurred it is clear it is not provided for bhe act the only words in the act which it can be pre tended meet thc case are these that all lands the tithes whereof have been commuted and which shau be cultivated as hop ground or garden ground after the commutation shall be charged avith an ad ditional rentcharu cow additionad ment something to be added to an e isting charge and therefore this enactment clearly only applied to land already liable and to land newly cultivated as hop or garden groung respectivelyr llish qca wiith whomt were mrr j aston and r bm xwhite argued on behalf of the vicar and said the ease was one of extreme importance to the clergy and to cultivaters of land especialy considering the great value of hop ground and hoptithe if this claim conld be resisted there would be a direct inducement to hop growers tothrow ont of cultivation the old hop ground and grow hops on the enclosed waste lands if they were to be free of tithe the result woulnd be a toast serious diminution of the fixed titheincomes of the clergy in this very case the old hop ground was only i acres and it was now set up that be tween  and yj acres could bo grown with hops tithe free such a claim from exemption was most alarming it was vicious in principle and would lead to the most per nicous consequences throughout the country the learned counsl argued that these lands were included in the com mutationbecause though not actally liable they were pro spectively so his learned friends argument on the word additional used in the act was that you could not add anythung to nothin laughter that he disputed  plr slwas l plus  was twomr justice viglirmyon admnit that if this land hadbeen turnedinto wheat luddthe tithe rentcharge would nsot attachmr melltsh admitted that but argued that the case of wheat was quite different for ladd which was wheat land at the time of the commutation would remain liable as such although afterwards turned into posture the question turned ou the meaning of the word commnnta tvon which meant commutation for tithes as to land tithe able before this land was before liable to tithe  ic if it had been cultivated before the commutation it would have been titheable aud indeed it was tiheable even as it was thoughl to so small an amount that it was not worth while to allot any rentcharge in respect of it for it was common orpsture laud the expression  common or waste land did not import that at was mere wvaste land utterly unpro ductive and untitheable it wvas part of the waste land on hich thelordand his tenants had common of pature that is it was pasture lnd and titheable but the alue of the tithe would have been so small as such that it was notworth while makin any separate rentchlrge for it the mere fact that tithe sad not been actually paid in re spect of it did not show that it was titheable or wastethe lord cazrx jesvxce said the argument on the part of the cultivator came to this that because nothinghadbeen actually awarded in respect of this land therefore it was not titheable and so not commutable whereas it might be that commutation meant commutation not of a payment but a liabiltyr mellsiust go that is the effect of the argu ment but this land was clearly titheable though not tithed and being titheable was included in the commuta tion and being so the rentcharge on hop ground attached when it was brougt into ho ground and not titheable meant not merely land not cuitivated but land in its own nature barren and not tillable or capable of cultivation or producemr coasntmoe replied on behalf of the cultivator the plaintiff thevery objectofthe tithe commutation act ws to effect a final settlement and the sense of commuta tionwasa commutation of an existing right or payment not a mere possible or prospedive liabili tithe too in the act meant an existing payment tn this case there were as respects this land no tithes to be commuted and so it was not and could not be included in the commutation the tithe on this land had not been commuted simply because there was nothing to oommute and therefore there was no charge in respect thereof an additionlchargesurely meant in common parlance an addition to some charge already elistingmr justice bla cksurasuppose her hlajesty were to grant her counsel an additional salary of  ayear they now receiving no such salary

doubt he should not he disposed to be critical on the description alaughat the close of the argument the court consulted for some timethe loan oms jusvscx delivered his judgment in favour of the vicar the tithe owner on the ground that this land before the commutation had been liable to tithes and that this liability had been extinguished by the commuta tion so that therefore it wras embraced by the commutation and the commutation attached under the act to the land newly cultivated with hopsmr justice wigeeratns delivered judgment in favour of the plaintiff the cultivator of the land on the ground that as he had never paid tithe or rentcharge in respect of ititvwouldnot come within the enactment in question which imposed an additional chargeon land already charge ablemr justice blickbml gave judgment in favour of the vicar on the same grounds as the lord chief justice viz that the landwas liabletotithethou htitho had not actualy been paid in respect of it the legislature must have been taken to use the word commutation in its common meaning and as used in common parlance in which it certainly would have seemed toinclude this land and therecouldbe no doubt that the legislature if it had contemplated sach a caue would have intended to include itmrjusticemellor also concurred in this view and observed that the contrary view led to remarkable results one of which would he that the tithe on the land was extin gushed though not commuted and another result equally strange would be that though it wsas p lain that if the laud had beengardengroundturned into hop ground it would be liabie yetz havng been before common or waste groundtho majority of the court being in favour of the vicar the judgment of the the courl was for himyousg and otaere v xacpsaxthis was a case of
