leading politicians in rungary but i have positive information that hitherto there has been no rapprochement between the imperial cabinet and theaddress party at the head of which are some of the most able and influential men in theingdom an fewr weeks ago the founders of the pungarian crddit fboncier had an audience of the emperor and very soon after it was rumoured that the basis on which a compromise might be effected haa been established the founders of the above mentioned establishment sincerely wish to come to an understanding wvith austria and will do all in their power to bring it abotut but their influence is less great thtn their goodwill they have recently drawn up a plan of action but they will hardly be able to carry it out unless it meet with the approval of such men as messrs deak and von etvos two or three days ago count barkoezy and dr george von mbailath had an interview with count forgach the hungarian chancellor and soon after they had left him the latter conferred with f von schmerling wvhat passed between the two states men is not positively known to the public but it is related that count forgach told the mlinister of state that the newlyestablished mlortgage bank must be for transylvania as well as for hun gary proper if this be correct and probably it is so wi von schmerling must have been greatly disconcerted as it is a part of his system com pletely to separate the interests of transylvania frmm those of hungary a short time ago dr rpieger who is one of the most formidable adver saries of the rechbergschmerling ministry was staying at pesth and there is reason to believe that he is now on good terms with the leaders of theungatrian address party to which he was for merly strongly opposed some of the vienna papers express their surprse that such a proud man as  von schmerling should have made the amende honorable to the lowver chamber of the reichsrath but to me his conduct appears perfectly natnral the minister of state has no supporters but the german members of the reiclsrath and had he not made his peace wvith them the chances are thattey on their return to their home would have joined the federaists who are in great force in the provincial diets the agitation against the consti tution of february still continues mn bohemia andit is to be foreseen that it will greatly increase whenthe sittings of the diet begin it is possible that the minister of state who has great moral courage and energy may for a time be able to make headagainst his opponents but the impression on my mind is that eventuauy he will succumb to the federalists who in the provinces are in a great majiority in the patent by which the diets of ohemia dalmatia galicia upper and lower liustria salzbnrg styria carinthia carniola the bukonina mlorasvia silesia the tyrol vorarlbergg istria gorice and gradiska are convoked slajesty the emperor is styled king of lom bardy and venice crandduke of tuscany andtwo of the founders of the hungarian

though the subjects discussed were of interest the etouse voted fl for the naval department ancd at the same time censured the govern ment for having expended fl more dring the year g than bad been granted in fact the conduct of the cabinet was declared to be unconstitutional by the report of the com mittee of finance it is to be seen that the proposed outlay for the foreign deparhtent is  which is fl less than in  the sum demanded for the hungarian chancellerie is lothat forthetransylvanian chancellerie sioooq and that for he croatoslavonian chancellerie  the police department will cost the country so jfl and the miinistry of commerce and agricultujelfil ten persons will form a committee for the manlage ment and control of the national debt and it is agreed that five of them shal be chosen by the lower and five by the upper house in as far as the lower chamber of the reichsrath is con cerned the question relative to the bank is settled but it is morally certain that some of the conditions proposed wiu be rejected by the representatives of the shareholdersthe porte fears that the greeks will attempt to insurrectionize the turkiish provinces which are conterminous to greece and i have occasion to re mark that the austrian govenmauent also has appre lhensions on the subject prince ypsilanti who is said to aspire to the vacant tlhrone of greece wil probably espoxise the daughter of baron sina on the d inst the prince appears to be a goodnatured young man but persons who know him say that he is remarkable neither for natural talent nor for acquired knowledge he will however have numerous supporters in greece as soon as he becomes the soninlaw of the austrian crcesus who has richly endowed several of the public institutions of that kingdom baron sina the greek mlinister at this court was too unwvll to meet king otho when he landed at trieste and he has not yet received permission from his medical attendant to travel to the bavarian capital a bout a month ago the baron put up on the portal of his house the greek arms which are twvo lions couchant supporting a crowin gcrman families continue to arrive attrieste from greece there is no truth in the report that the archduke ferdinand bmaxi milian is a candidate for the vacant greek throne in fact he could not be so if he wvould as his near relatives in the bavarian capital do not intend to renounce their claims the russian government has sent a consul to reside at tirnowa in the turkish province of bulgaria and it is supposed that his mission is in the strictest sense of the word a political one the political agitation is increasing in servia and the militia is again as regularly drllded as it was a few weeks ago fromi time to time arms are smuggled into servia and it is now reported that a vessel containinr muskets has been seized by the turkish authorities in the st georges mouth of the danubeon sunday last the messia of handel was given here and for the first time the viennese had the pleasure of hearing the whole of the oratorio my meaning is that formerly seven of the numbers were invariably omitted the empress heard a part of handels great masterpiec e but the
