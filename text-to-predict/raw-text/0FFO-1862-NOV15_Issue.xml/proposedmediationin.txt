lordthe count de flahault came to the foreigoffice by appointment on monday the th instant and read to me a despatch from al drouyn de lhuys relating to the civil war in north americain this despatch the hinisterfor foreignaffairs states that europe has followed with paineul inter est the struggle which has now been going on for more than a year on the american continent he does justice to the energy aud perseverance which have been displayed by both sides but he observes that these proofs of their courage have been given at the expense of innumeralble calamities and immense bloodshed to these accompaniments of civil conffict is to be added the apprehension of a servile war which would be the climax of so mauy irreparable mis fortunes if these calamities affected america only these sufferings of a friendly nation would be enough to excite the anxiety and sympatly of the emperorbut europe also has suffered in one of the principal branches of her industry and her artisaus have been subjected to the most cruel trialsfrance and the maritime powers have during this struggle maintained the strictest neutrality but the sentiments by which they are animated far from imposing on them anything like indiffer ence seem on the contrary to require that they should assist the two belligerent parties in an en deavour to escape from a position which appears to have no issue theforces of the two sides have hitherto fought with balanced success and the latest accounts do not show any prospect of a speedy termination of the warthese circumstanlces taken together would seem to favour the adoption of measures which might bring about a truce the emperor of the french therefore is of opinion that there is now an opportunitv of offering to the belligerents the good offices of the maritime powers he therefore proposes to her majesty as well as to the emperor of russia that the three courts should endeavour both at washington and in communication with the confederate states to bring about a suspension of arms for six months during whlicl every act of hostility direct or in direct should cease at sea as well as on land this armistice might if necessary be renewved for a further period this proposal m drcuyn de lhuys proceeds to say would not imply on the part of the three tpoweis any judgment on the origin of the war or any pressure on the negotiations for peace which it is hoped would take place during the armistice the three powers would only interfere to smooth obstacles and only within limits which the two in terested parties would prescribe the frencn gtovernment is of opinion that even in the event of failure of immediate success these overtures might be useful in turning the minds of men now heated by passion to consider the advantages of conciliation and of peace such is in substance the proposal of the go vernment of the emperor of the french and i need hardly say it has attracted the serious attention of her majestys governmenther majesty is desirous of acting in concur rence with france upon the great questions nowv agitating the world and upon none mnore than on the contingencies connected with the great struggle now going on innorth america neither her majesty the qneen nor the british nation wvill ever forget the noble and emphatic manner in mwhiclh the emperor of the french vindicated the law of nations and assisted the cause of peace in the instance of the seizure of the confederate commis sioners onboardthe trent her mrajestys government recognize with plea sure in the design of arresting the progress of wvar by friendly measures the benevolent views and humane intentions of the emperor they are also of opinion that if the steps pro posed were to be taken the concuirrence of russia would be extremely desirableher majestys government have however not been informed up to the present timle that the russian government have agreed to cooperate with england and france on this occasion although that government may support tho eudeavours of eng land and france to attain the end proposed but is the end proposed attainable at the pre sent moment by the course suggested by the go vernment of france  such is tho question which has been anxiously and carefully examined by her majestys governmentafter weighing all the information whlich has been received from america her majestys govern ment are led to the conclusion that there is no ground at the present moment to hope that tho federal government would accept the proposal suggested and a refusal from wvashington at prtsent would prevent any speedy renewral of the offer her majestys government think therefore that it would be better to vwatch carefully the pro gress of opinion in america and if as there appears reason to hope it may be found to have undergone or may undergo hereafter any change the three courts might then avail themselves of such change to offer thleir friendly counsel with a greater pros pect than now exists of its being accepted by the two contending parties her majestys government will communicate to that of france any intelligence they may receive from washington or richmond bearing on thlis im portant
