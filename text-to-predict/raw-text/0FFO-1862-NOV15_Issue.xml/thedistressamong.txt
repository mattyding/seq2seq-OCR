the distress among the lancashreoperativesthe members of the university of oxford held a public meeting in the union debating room by the permision of the society on tuesday evening at  oclock for thepur pose of expressing sympathy with the distresed population of the cotton manufacturing districts and promoting con certed action of the committees already formed to collect subscriptions in the several colleges there was a very arge attendance of membersthe regus paorssou of divnsny who presided said that although the meeting lacked certain university attrl butes it had the cognizance and hearty approval of the vicechancellor they were not assembled there to initiate auything neither had they any desire to inter fere in any way whatever with arrangements already adopted what theydidventure tohope was thatbycoming together on that occasion they might do something towards sestaining the efforts which were being made to mitigate the unparalleled distress which now existed in the cotton mianu facturing districts sustained efforts would be absolutely necessary and a long pull was as essential as improved or ganization they might do something to accomplish that for union was strength and a general meeting like that couldnotfailto strengthen all hands engaged in this good work applause one result of that meeting would be that they would have information from some who had becn on the spot and would speak from practical knowledge as to the prevailing distress and the details of which they would hear detailed by them such accounts as those in addition to the elaborate articles which daily appeared in the public journals could not fail to supply them with the information whichtheymostdesiredandshowthemmore fully whatcould be effected amodg themselves bydeternining thebest mode of proceeding to complete what remained to be done byecur ing the thorough cooperation of the coleges in the unl versity they need not despair of there being in oxford any want of hearty sympathy towards the guffering oertives in the cotton manufacturing districts for he felt as sured thatthey would not withhold that hearty sympathy which had its value as well as money for looking at what hai transpired in lancashire cheshire and part of york shire they must appreciate the truly noble temper with which those sufferings had been met aud borne cheers well would it be for their felowcountrymen generally if theyemulated theireexample and were innoculated with that antipathy to pauperism which they had shown he wished toremind themtlsattheir effort to mitigate the distressmust be a sustained one the distress was not of a local but of a national character because it was the result of a national policydeliberatewy adopted and firmly maintaind let them remember too that it was sure to he worse before it would hbebetter for asthedays shortenedandthecoldof winter made itself felt the want of fuel and of clothing wvon d ha added to theirpresent privations akpplausi professor staxy movedi the first resolution that the conduct of the working classes under the present dis tress in the cotton districts is worthy of our warmest sym pathy and admiration re was glad that that reso lution had been confided to him because he felt it was casier to represent to their minds the great moral qualities shown during the distress by the sufferers than to represent the actual distress which he had not seen there were minds capable of bringing before them detils of sufferings which they had never seen it was a remarkable feature in the character of arnold that he said the sufferings of the working classes pierced the great cover ing of his own domestic happiness and haunted him day and night there were such characters among themselves but he could not lay claim to being one for to give an idea of the existing suffering and distress he must have seen and heard more than he bad done but with regard to the moral qualities which had been exhibitedthey coudc b e appreciated without being seen it was described in past and present history that such qualities as these made themselves felt and appreciated hoyever great the distance of time or place he did not know enough of the details to enter upon them and would therefore only select one ortwopoints which had struck him most forcibly one wsas the extraordinary patience and submission which their suffering fellow country men had shown under this great and unparalleled calamity there were no traces of discontent no complaints against the government nor the millowners nor against america nor the particular agency by which reief unas administered with respect to the latter the readiness and thankfulness with which they received the little relief which was afforded to themwas in every way worthy of our commendation this was the more relmarkable when they reflected on the extremely independent character of artisans in the north compared with the more quiet and subtle natives of the senth of england it was still more remarkable that they exhibited such patience and submission and contrasted strongly with whsat had been exhibited in former years wahen meet of these present remembered the irrita tion and chronic rebelion which characterized anv distress in the north he had a dim recollection of what was apprehended in cheshire and lancashire by the opening of the manchester and liverpool railway when he was residingwithinl miles of manchester he recolected also the disturbances which radicalism and chartism had occasioned when distress came upon the north and when they appeared to be approaching a volcano and on the eve of a great eruption the exact reverse of au this was pre sented now and although that was not the time to inquire into the cause of that improved state of things there was not less satisfaction in dwelling upon it through the gloomy clouds that dimmed the horizon in lancashire and cheshire they saw that the people behaved themselves in a noble manner and that was their great redeeming fea tre aother point not so obvious was the way in which auch an immense faimishing popllation had abstained from debauchery and crimes against nro perty to which it might have been feared t eir desttution would have driven them it was said that what wa ordinary morality in persons like himself and themselves would be heroic virtue in princes expoaea to more and greater temptations what would be with us a negation of crime would be virtue in those suffering clases who were weakened by distrems and whose appetites were sharpend by hunger and therefore under those circum stances their patience submission and orderly conduct were worthy of the highest commendation applause on all such occasions of great national distress there were caued out national unity and national friendly feeling he remembered that of sir robert peel it was said that  this day all london is as one family and mir gladstone had made the same remark on the death of the prince consort but in thatinstance the whole of england felt as one familv on the occasion of the crimean war the whole multitu e seemed to have but one heart and one soul it was the one commontopicin every ones mouthandeveryoue seemedbent on the prosecution of the war even at a lavish expendituthere vws a remarkable unanimity at the present moment as exhibited in the fellowfeelng aroused by the high moral qualities of those whom they must regard as brothers in race andblood whateverthey did for them would not be thrown away but would be appreciated by these who added

thattthe distress in the cotton dis tricbt is a national calamity and must be met by national effs though they all admitted in wordsthe extent of the present distress yet perhaps they did not sufficiently represent to themselves what it reaywas they should tr and form the dry statisties which they read into someitre of the stabe of things they received from america before the blockade fivesixths of their cotton five days of the week theyworked on what came from america only one day on what came from other countries that sup ply was now practically at an end the few ships that ran the blockade made no noticeable difference and even if other countries should double their production we should be only supplied with material for onethird of our usual work the country then was losing twothirds of the industry engaged in this trade twothirds of the capital were making no return acnd this trade was such a main part of the industry of the nation that what affected it must affect them all a parlismentary return gave the persona act ally engaged in the mills at near q if they econed their families the traders who supplied them iha colliers mchinists builders and ahi pin in terest engaged in supplying cotton they would probably not overstate the number dependent on cotton only at odo those people were now deprived of fully two thirds of their subsistence the distress might be worse in some towns lighter in others but the average would not be lower than that in the cot ton districts of cheshire the employment was less than an average of two days a week in preston the em ployment was a trifle over two days a week at wigan even a month ago of  person usuauy employed in the mills  were out of work their wages instead of over oool a week were about  which was supplemented byrelief fromn a committee of  a week it waf stated the other day at lord derbys committee thatalready the loss of wages in these districts amounted to the rate of  yearly and that we might expect it soon to amount up to the rate of  yearly jland this loss fell first and most heavilyon the poor whoe could least bearit andthedistrictitself wvhichshouldrelieve them was also cut off from all its gains its mills machinery c were for the present as valueless asif the labour spent on them had been expended in buildings agreat pyrammid but when in theface of that great distress they asked the country at largeto come andhedp them they were metby two objections first that this calamity should be met first from the rates he might answer that much had been done from the rates but lancashire generally was net like a p ace where there were sbeveral indulstriesw andif one sufffered the prosperity of the others could meetthe want lancashire lived by cotton alone and thatbeing

who hoped rather to give a helping hand to others than find themselves in this distress had beeu struck off the votin lists for nonpayment of rates mr cobden mentioned the other day a pitiable case of

that the nillowners had not done their duty and had called on them too soon we might at once say to this that even had they been to blame their churlish ness could not be a reason for our holding back the good samaritan did not leave the wounded man because the levite turned aside cheers but reauv the miuowners had to a great extent been unjustly accused they had done much both by subscription and by working at a loss and the meeting must recollect that their capital was not only idle but much of it actualy losing value at present that many of them were poor mnca trading on borrowed capital in wbom generosity would be a fraud on their creditors and that many of them owned much cottage property from which they received no rents at present they need not however defend these people any further the mere ques tion before us is not their duty but our duty applause they had before them a great population who had hitherto mobly borne their suffering and they must haste to their re lief before want brought desperation and crime ezar they mnst remember how lancashire was not only now a large part of the country but how it was increasina far beyon the average increse any morl deterioration ere therefore was the more dreadful as it affected more inti mately the future of eingland think of the temptations to which the factory girls would be exposedthrown idle on the streets and driven to be bold in beggary the number now relieved in the unionsmost distressed was  by prochial relief besides those whom local committees aid tuhe nmber of paupers increased at the rate of  weekly fever was breaking out in many places which they could easier prevent than stop such was the urgency of the need which they were caued on to aid hear hear it might be urged that lancashire vas suffering because the nation refused at the treaty of paiisto give up commercial blockades but waiving that argument let him urge one in conclusion which he hoped all would agree in why that distress concerned the nation and shoula be re lievea by the nation much applause they were now as a nation displaying a noble example to the world of sted fast adherence to duty though they did not go to war for an idea what was far nobler they were starv ing for an idea not in the intoxication of battle and carried away by martial excitement but slowly quietly and without complaint their countrymen were starvingin obedienceto the principle of neutralitvwhich the country had proclaimed they might say of each lau cashire man who died as truly as ever was said of the spartans at thermopyla that he died in obedience to the laws of his country applause but they must not enjoy the easy virtue of seeing others suffer let them consider them the vanard thrown into the pest of danger and of honour but themnselves egually pledged to support thema in theirtrial andto bear with them the hardships which a national resolution required and which tended to their national bonour appause dr ronleston seconded the resolution which was sup ported by professor besnarnd of trinity and mlr hmedd of university collegethe treasuner of the unyox mr robinson of uni versiy college moved the third resolution that it is desirable that besides the subscriptions already made in the colleges assurances should begiven of continuous assistance during the urgedcy of the distress this resolution it would at once be seen brought the meeting ta the practical objects for which it had been caled one question must have occurred to every one who had heard the statements made during the eveningviz what can we here in oxford do  before any attempt to answer the question should be made it was only right to state that m uch had already been done from different sources in the university a sum amounting in round numbers to nearly  had already been raised and no one who knew oxford could doubt that such a sum pointed to great efforts on the part of the various collegfes and that a practical proof had been givren that the trnths expressed by the two previous resolutions had already been deeplyfelt applause still somethingmore was wanted charity of the ordinary kind would in this case quite break down it was true that charity of no ordinary kind had been already shown but as the chairman had stated there was needed a long pull and a sustained effort to procure that continued assistance by which alone the dis tress could be met and which was needed both to provide for the coming winter and to release the money already in the bands of the committee so that it could be applied more liberally to the p resent urgent want such continued assistance so far as oxford was concerned could only be forthcoming if something were done in the way of saving he would not venture to suggest in what way this savin might be carried out and he knewthat a hope of anygener savnng for one of the common charitable purposes would be visionary he thought that that hope was not visionary now this was not one of those cases where speeches are made on behalf of some good object and certain feelings excited and then the feelngs were over almost as soon as the speeches in the coming month the distress would speak more loudly than any speeches and would he tlought supply a motive for that manly saving which if contiuted help were tcome from oxford would be required loudmr eanoi of new college seconded the resolutionprofessor borxa in supporting the resolution said he fuly agreed with preceding speakers as to the manner in which the lancashire operatives had borne their unexampled sufferings if thejlocal rates were raised it was difficult to estimate what projportion would be paid the growth of pau perism was so rapid he had been informed that the rate at blackburn was s in the pound whereas it was for merly s or s and moreover that the loss in labour was l  that  persons were out of employ in the distressed counties that of those iu employ onesixth part only worked full time onethird short timc andthere wasno reason to believe that the calamity affecting them would be speedilyrelieved there was no nterference owith the ho kae and if it were relaxed it would not in the space of four montha affect the cotton manufacturing population ijnder existing circeumstances any relaxation would not release the stocks of cotton which had accumulated at liver pool and the mllowners would be deterred from making scanty investments in the raw material there was then great necessity for great aid and that of a continuous character it was not a good thing to put down a large sum at once but it was preferable to make continual sacri fices and so hopeful was he of his country that he be lieved the emergency would be shovwn by the sacrifices of lfdenying persons the difficulty might bh met by three processesthe first by the opertion of the poor law of which they could availfthemselves by a recent act of par liamert which made unions generaly liable to an assess ment in respect of the distress affecting any particular locality at the present moment it would be impossible for blackburn to supply the necessary poor law relief for as it was the uinon of blakburn w called upon to pay twothirds of the rate while some parishes were not cauled upon at all another means of meeting the distress was voluntary subecriptionsto the ommon fund eitherin a large sum or what was better still by continuous aid another process wa one which he had ventured to ad vocate in tke limes of that day not from any selfglorific tioubutto induce others to folow his example he wrote to mr williams a clergyman at ashtonunderlyne to select aperson with a family who deserved assistance and mr williams had laid beforehim the case of a man with a wife and seven children who had been earning a per week but were now reduced to absolute poverty and were on the verge of starvation after doing all they could to avoid falling bak upon the poorrate lhe mr rogers had undertaken to provide s per week for that family together with some blankets and old clothing for four months and his correspondence with the man was among the most gratifying things he had ever expe rienced and proved that he was an honest sincere and uright fellow it might be possible bv acts of thatkind simultaneously with the funds provided by local committees from the country at large and by individuals to mee the calamity ee would read them an extract from a letter which he had received from his friend air cobden the distress is becoming too vast indeed it is becoming almost unmanageable from its magnitude a

lord derby is the chairman of the executive will your people give their names as members of the committee the beggingbox must go throughthe land itis onlya question whetherthe cotton districts are to

satisfaction they would be called upon to make great sacrifices and if they set to work to do what they could they would earn the lasting gratitude of those they relieved and set the best example tot their fellow countrymen in doing that which they knew to he right and helping those whom they knewv to be deserving apmr dvcxzao of trinity spokce in favour of the resolution mr digby of corpus chrsti college moved the fourth resolution as follows that a committee be formed consisting of one graduate and one undergraduate member of each college with a view to promote cooperation among the members of the university for the relief of the distress in the northlin moving thatresolution he should after the full treatment which the subject bad received both in principle and detal confine himself to explaining the obect whichit was intend to serve it wold bh seen that the resolution followed naturally on the one preceding it that spoke of the desirability of continued aid to the distressed population of the north by this it is proposed to take steps to secure that continued aid by the appointment of a general committee consisting of mem bers of the various colleges now at first sight the objection might appear to lie ngainst this resolution that most of the colleges had already taken action in the matter much had indeed already been done in oxford he thought the sum already subscribed had been a little overstated by a revions speaker he should incline from inquirieshe had made to put it at between  and  rather than between  and z that was a good deal but he thought it was evident from the state ments they had heard that evening that the distiss was still on the increase and that if it was at all to be ade quately met they mniust increase their efforts for its

movement that thev were asked to aset to that resolution that evening lie air digy had said that though they had donemuch lready they ought to talke measures for doing still more and he most cordially assented to what had been already said that evening as to the necessity of abating somewhat of their own expenditure in order to be able the more effee tually to contribute to the relief of the cotton districts it was difficult to think of lancashire distress without the thought suggesting by way of contrast oxford comforthear hear was not that a time for abating somewhat of that luxurious comfort which was characteristic of their life there not in any xpirit of quisotic asceticism but for the rimple parose of having more to give to lose who neededl iti hedid not think it was expedient to specify any one item of ordinary expenditure which tight be re trenched each man must decide thatiforhimself they had at present an opportunity of settiug a good example they still held such a
