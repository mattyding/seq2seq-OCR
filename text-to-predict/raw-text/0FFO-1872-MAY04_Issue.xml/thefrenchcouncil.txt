 o oe nce council ofi etfrom oi special caorespondpetparis my the debate on the conseil detat wbicl during the last two days has occupied the attention of the chamber haa been one of the most creditable from a parliamentary point of view in which that body has been engaged and although it is quite impos sible to predict how the remarkable constitution which is growing up under the auspices of this assembly which is supposed not vithout reason to be incompetent to make one is going to work one cannot but congratulate the chamber on doing ac tually something and on possibly giving to countries in search of constitutions a few valuable hints it is really very difficult for us accustomed to institu tions based on such very opposite princidles and aiming as we do in our legislation at such very different results to offer any very decided opinion upon the merits of the measure to which the assem bly is now giving its consent or even to understand the reasoning upon which the arguments of the speakers on either side were based it having been decided by a large majority in accordance with the wish of the government that the time was come when it would be opportune to reconstitute this piece of absolutist machinery and the commission having decided strongly in its favour it only re mained to discuss details and about these no diffi culty arose until the third article came up for con sideration by this article it was proposed by the commission that the councillors of state should be elected by the national assembly in public session by scrutin v liste and that a commission of  members should be named to propose the list of candidates this article was the only one upon which the government found itself in direct anta gonism with the commission and as it afterwards turned out with the majority of the chamber it is evident that whether the chamber or the read of the state sbhall nominate a council of  men whose functions will in many respects resemble those of a second chamber is a point of cardinal and most vital importance it is true that when the council are not exercising their judicial functions the mï¿½inisters who are at the head of the depaart ments of state have seats at their board and take part in their deliberations but this would seem to be likely to give rise to discord if the rest of the members were named by the majority of the chamber jwho might be as they are at this moment in chronic opposition to the government on the other hand if this council were nomi nated by the head of the government himself it would put into the hands of that high functionary an instrument of despotism unsnupassed in any other form of government though such as in fact seems necessary to the proper administration of this country this was evidently the impression of the left centre and left who all voted against grant ing to the sovereign national assembly the privi lege of naming their own councdllors of state as i ventured some days a to to predict the radicals and democrats with gambetta voted in favour of dlacingc in the hands of the chief authority this absolute power and they are stihl under the perfectly sincere and honest delusion that in so doing they have been acting upon pure republican principles perhaps they have and we are for the first time beginning to learn what republicanism logically expressed and the french mind is very logical really means if so we owe a deep debt of gratitude to the repub licans of france generally and especially to those among them who represent liberty equality and fraternity in the chamber howsever it was of no use in vain did m dufaure the garde des sceaux expend his choicest eloqnence to extenuate the constitutional importance of the act he was urging the chamber to perform and to explain away its smcidal character the conservative iglht was stubborm and united they vehemently resisted this attempt to encroach upon the sovereign rights of tho chamber not knowing in fact to what terrible cousequences to themselves it might lead ll batbie pointed out the disadvantagges wvhich would accrue if this important body were nominated by the government and found themselves in direct opposi tion to the chamber regard being had to the func tions of the council in the manufacture of laws and so forth while the ministerialists might very well retort by pointing out the inconveuience it wyouid be to the state if this council which was sup posed to be composed of thepresidents confidential advisers were named by the chamber indeed the inconveniences seem about equally great either way if thegovernmeutschemehad been carriedhowever the annoyance to the chamber would be a matter of little consequence it would have formed part of a good healthy absolute despotism whereas now that the chamber has carried the day it seems to me to form part of a very unhealthy unworkabl attempt at constitutionalismunderthese circumstances i think it notimpossible that somehow or other the whole affair not having resulted exactly in accordance with the wishes of the powers that be will be allowed to drop the majo rity against the government was very small against and the balance of power in the cham ber seems to be slowlv undergoing a changethere are meltings and fusions and convolutions going on lefts and left centres and rights twisting i and out of one another under influences too tortuous for me to attempt to follow i only see results and those dimly and vaguely shadowed forth for it does seen as though the left were uniting upon a policy of firm support of the government of mode ration in language and conduct and are thereby now and then winning stray sheep from the right of course there will always be extreme partisans among them to whom this trimming policy will not be palatable but i should not be surprised if by the assistance of this section of the chamber the president should ultimately succeed in obtaining all the uncon trolled power he requires placed at his disposal if he will only pledge himself to use it to found a republic on principles of absolute and personal governmentcount arnim has returned from berlin far from being the bearer of any ultimatum or from ever even having nearly borne one he has had an interview with al thiers the nature of which several of the parisnewspapers described before it was held the evacuation of the territory and the payment of the remamining three milliards are of course the topics uppermost in most mens minds and they are not likely to be subjects to which either count arnim orm thiers is altogether indifferent but it is evident that all overtures for the speedy and premature payment of a debt should vcome rather from the debtor than the creditor the money iz not really due till the st of mvay  and it is not likely that germany will de mand it before that date having in fact no rigaht to do so whether the french govern ment will dropose an earlier payment is a matter entirely ffr them to consider there is no doubt as soon as they have paid the money how soon soever that may be that the germans will leave the country but it is not so sure that they mill re tire upon partial instalments or upon quite such easy terms as tl pouyerquertier succeeded in obtain ing some months ago so far as the interests of france of peace and of europe are concerned the sooner the payment is made and the territory evacu ated the better every days delay increases the possibilities of risks and dangers arising from un foreseen and unknown sources but which may render payment and evacuation both alike impos sible nor can ml thiers with his own farsightedsagacity fail to perceive that the interests of the government of which he is the head are especially bound up with the speedy solution of this question
