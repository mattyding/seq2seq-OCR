change in the face hut not more than i should have expected to find after a lapse of three years the upper part of the face is unchanged but the lower part is altered principally in consequence of his having grown a heard her ladyship then identifed the handwriting in various books and papers forwarded fromamerica as being thatof her eldest son and recognized several articles found in the sea chest of george osborne as bearing the name of tradesmen with whom her son for merly dealt her ladyship then proceeded to sayily son george was a tall young man he was ft lin before he left england andheinformedmesome time afterwards in his letters that he had grown another half inch his complexion was fair his eyelashes were dark he stooped a little he was very fonm of athletic exercises from his boyhood and he was of an enthusiastic turn in everything he undertook he was apt to persevere and not to give anything up when he had once commenced it he was a very good shot from his earliest life he was fond of the sea aud he wished to make it his profession his father once applied to get him ad mitted into the navy but being over  he was too old to be admitted he afterwards engaged in a remarkable ad venture that of going over to france in a small skiff it was a most dangerous feat he started from st leonards and went over to boulogne and afterwvards returned from that place to folkestone in the same manner hfe was ac customed to carpenters work and once made himnself a sea chest he was very fond of children and was in the habit of talking to them and of telling them stories he was a proficient in music and was fond of drawingthe arroxxeygenieral having intimated that he had no questions to put in the way of crossexamination her ladyship vithdrewsir roulndell palmier proceeded to argue in favour of the admission de bene esse of the evidence taken in america and elsewhere under the commission appointed by the sheriffdepute in the court of session he adverted to the difficulty if not impossibility of collecting again such a body of evidence as ad been given before that commission owing to the fact that the witnesses then examined being principally seafaring men were now dispersed over the four quarters of the globe the inconvenience and expense to which the claimant would be put in sending out fresh commissioners to america china japan and other parts of the world would be enormous he submitted that the evidence should be received on three grounds in the firat place it would be impossible for their lordships to require the personal attendance of witnesses who were american subjects and who resided out of their jurisdiction secondly the retour service of heir general or special in the courts of scotland was constantly received by their lord ships as conclusive evilence thirdly the course of pro ceeding prescribed by  and  victoria chap  directing the procedure for the service of heir had been strictly followed in this case in issuing the commission the sheriff had discharged a julicial duty under an act of parliament which reouired him to take every care that the evidence received should be properly sifted their lord ships had admitted evidence taken by commission in the borthwick peerage claim aud it was a common practice to admit such evidence in the courts of law at all events this was good hearsay evidence to show when the party was last heard of under these circumstances he respectfully submitted that their lordships would receive the evidence db ocne emethe attorneygeneral in offering his opinion to their lordships said this was not a question of the weight but of the admissibility of evidence thleir lordships ivere the sole jndges what evidence they should admit or re ject althoughl they had frequently stated that they desired to be guided in the matter by the usual principles of legal practice their lordships were asked to receive in a peer age claim evidence taken for another purpose by a commis sion of the appointment of which the crown had had no notice and to which it was not a party the admission of such evidence would in his opinion be contrary to prin ciple however great the inconveniences of requiring a fresh commission to be issued inight be to the claimanttheir lordships could not be expected to set aside their usual practice in order to suit the convenience of those who preferred claims of this charalter which if held to he established would bind all the world for all future time the learned counsel on the other side was wrong in asserting that their lordships were in the habit of receiving the sheriffs retour as conclusive eviderce it beiug received only for what it was worth and even in the court of ses sion it might be subsequently challenged the question of hearsay evidence as to when the late earl was last heard of lid not arise inasmuch as the presumption of death hav ing been put forward evidence of death must be given in the usual manner if their lordships received this sort of evidence althoughin the present case they would perhaps be advancing the interests of justice they would be esta blishing a most inconvenient precedent which it would be most injudicous to follow in other cases under these circumstances he submitted that their lordships wouldl not receive the evidence now tendered on behalf of the claimantafter some consultationthe lord cilancellor in advising their lordships to receive the evidence said that they were sitting as a sort of grand inquest to determine whether the late earl was dead and whether the present claimant had showni that he was entitled to a seat in their lordships honse tho evidence in question had been taken in a judicial procceding insti tuted with the view of ascertaining the same facts that their lordships had to ascertain and if they were to reject it they would deprive the claimant of the means of esta blishing his right and themselves of the most valuable evidence that could be procured in relation to the claim he trusted that it was not a part of their duty to shut theieyes to evidence of this character and therefore ho should advise their lordsips to admit the evidence leaving it to a subsequent stage to determine whether any and what further evidence might be required to support and corro borate itlord chelmsford thought it would be a denial of jus tice for their lordships to reject this evidencelord colonsay concurredthe evidence was then received some further evidence having been givenon the motion of the lord chancellor it was re solved that the claim had been establishedclaim allowed accordinrlv
