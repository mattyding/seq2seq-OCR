the indirect coaimsinom our amic conesoxdmtjrkajj a aalpbia arpial uponthe alabama question the atttude of the american government has heretofore been firm that the  indirect claimsn should go to the arbitrators at geneva the united states pledging themselves to obey the decision even though jurisdiction should be repudiated bar the arbitrators in every part of this position the government was supported by the american people who had however graduauy come to the conclusion that the indirect claims would be thrown out and fully expecting this such a re sult at geneva would not have surprised them it was also expected that the dissemination in eng land of information respecting this feeling in ane rica would have resulted in englands permitting the indirect claims to go to geneva with the implied understanding that jurisdiction would be repudiated and the troublesome subject be thus got rid of but this does not seem to be the case although america fully recognizes a slight concession on the part of england when the english representatives at geneva on april  while filing the protest against the indirect claims announced the willingness of her ffajestys government that the arbitration on the case so far as the direct claims are concerned might proceed without prejudice to englands sub zequent course to ascertain exactly what might transpire at geneva the united states government delayed the forwarding of any answer to lord granvilles last note until after april th as the united states now expect to get no money payment for the indirect claims and as the differences appear on the american side to be mnainly on what may be styled a point of tech nical etiquette the american public in the last few days have been changing their opinion on the subject and shov an evident disposition at present to acquiesce in some compromise if such a thing can be arranged which will relieve the british mlinistry but at the same time not be regarded by the world as a sacrifice of american honour the washington cabinet are peculiarly sensitive because thisbeing the year of the presidential elec hion theycannot afford to risk grants prospects byanyexhibition of a weak foreign policy at the same time however there are intimations from wvashington that the abmerican government is not wnmindful of the change of public sentiment on the indirect claims and that this feeling may in the course of the diplomatic correspondence now goin on produce something that will relieve the govern ments of both countries and allow the arbitration to proceed to a successful terminationthe resolution introduced into the house of re presentatives by mr peters of maine declaring the americanuposition on the indirect claims to be nntenaole was referred to the house committee of foreign aflfirsof which general banks is chairman that committee held a meeting yesterday discussed the resolution at some length and in this discus sion demonstrated that at least a majority of the committee hold the opinion that the claims ought not to have been incornorated in the ameri can case and that a serious mistake had been made in doing this the committee decided to take no action on the resolution at this time as they did not want to appear to be in conflict with the recent atti tude of the government but intimations being given from the executive mansion of the more con ciliatory feeling prevailing in admainistration circles general banks was authorized to consult with the secretary of state to ascertain his views of the situation so that the committee and the adminis tration

it is classed as a star of the th or th magnitudethe following was the resolution introduced by mlr petersw whereas in the case presented on the part of the go vernment of the united states to the tribunal of arbitra tion constituted under article  of the treaty concluded at washington on the th of lay  between the united states and great britain the tribunal of arbitration is asked on behalf of the united states to award to them the payment by great britain of the claims therein speci fied vizist for direct losses growing out of the destruc tion of vessels and their cargoes by the insurgent cruisers therein referred to and by the national expenditures in the pursuit of those cruisers d for the indirect injury in the transfer of a large part of the american commercial marine to the british flag in the enhanced payments of in surance in the prolongation of the war and in the addition of a large sum to the cost of the war and the suppression of the rebellion and whereas it appear from the protocol of may   that in the conference of the joint hieh commission relating to the alabama claims on the th of march t the american commissioners stated the nature of the demands of the united states as above specified and after giving an approximate estimate of the amount of the said direct losses added that  in the hope of an amicable setlement no estimate was made of the indirect losses without prejudice however to the right of indemnification on their account in the event of no such settlement being made and whereas the american commissioners at the same time proposed that the joint high commission should agree upon a sum which should be paid by great britain to the united states in satisfaction of all the claims and the in terest thereon which proposition the british commis sioners declined denying all liability but proposing to leave the question to arbitration which proposition was ac cepteda and whereas the said treatv providing for such arbitration contains the following declaration the united states of america and her britannic majesty being de siroes to proride for an amicable settlement of all causes of difference between the two countries have for that pur pose appointed their respective plenipotentiaries who agreed to and concluded the articles of the said treaty and whereas by the said treaty after reciting that differences had arisen between the government of the united stites and the government of her britannic lajesty and still existed growing oat of the acts com mitted by the severat vessels which have given rise to the cainms genericauy known as the alabama claims it is areed that the said claims shall be referred to the ded sion of arbitrators as therein mentioned and certain rules were laid down in the said treaty defining the obligations of neutral governments and by article  it isprovided as followvthe said tribunal shall first determine as to each vessel separately whether great britain has by any act or omission failed to faufi any of the duties set forth in the foregoing three rales or recognized by the principles of internaxtional law not inconsistent with such rules ana shau certify such fact as to each of the eaid vessels in case the tribunal find that great lbritain has failed to fulfil any duty or duties as aforesaid it may if it think proper pro ceed to award a sum in gross to be paid by great britain to the united sthtes for all the claims referred to it and it is further provided by article  as follows  in case the tribunal find that great britain has failed to fulfil any duty or daties as aforesaid and does not award a sum ingross the high contracting parties agree that a board of assessors shall be appointed to ascertain and determine what claims are valid and what amount or amounts shall be paid by gteat britain to the united states on account of the liability arising from such failure as to each vessel according to theextent of such liability as decided by the arbitrators and whereas it appears that the damages to be ascer tained either by the arbitrators under article  or by the assessors under article  are the same in their nature and character in both cases it being provided that the arbi trators may award a sum in gross for the claims for or on account of all the vessels and in case of their failure to do so that the assessors shall make out an account of the liability as to each vessel according to the extent of such liability as decided by the arbitrators and whereas it is evident that the parties to the treaty did not intend that the assessors should determine the question of indirect damages ascertain the amount aud attempt to apportion it among the several vessels charging on account of the liability as to each a proportion of the damages for the transfer of a large part of theamerican commercial marine to the british flag the prolongation of the war c as such an apportionment would be unrea sonable and impracticable and whereas in the said case prepared an the part of the government of the ujnited states the proposition is advanced that a neutral is bound to use active vigilance and  the other means in its power to prevent its citizens from doing any of the arts referred to in the rules laid down in article  of the said treaty that by due diligence is meant a diligence which prompts the ueutral to the most energetic measures to discover any purpose of doing the acts forbidden and that the neutral in case of negligence in this respect is liable for all the direeb and indirect losses and injuries which may be sustained by a belligerent by reason or in consequence thereof and whereas the said doctrines which the united states are thus made to assume by the action of their legal representatives would impose upon this country new and onerous obligations in respect to the action of american citizens cympathizins with oppressed races grappling with tyranny and with nations fighting for independence and such doctrines are repugnant to the institutions and tratli tions of the american peoplewho have always sympathized even for the humublest of the human family when struggling for liberty and whereas instead of increasing the stringency of the obligations of neutrals recognized by the existing law of nations the highest interests of civilization demiand that the liberties and rights of neutrals shall be extended and the privileges and powers of states at war diminished resolvedthat it is the opinion of this house that the said claims for indirect damages should be held and considered to be waived by the said recited intimation of the american commissioners that they would be waived in case of an amicable settlement of the matters in dispute it being clear that a settlement of those matters by and under the award of the said tribunal of arbitration will be an amicable settlement thereof  and that the said claims for indirect damages are incompatible with the terms and provisions of the said treaty and that the propositions contendei for in the said case in respect to the oblifations of neutrals as above recited are unsound and incompatible with american precedents and the genius of our institu tions
