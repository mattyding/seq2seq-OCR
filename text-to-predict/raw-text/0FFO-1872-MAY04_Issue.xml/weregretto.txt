we regret to hear that the prospect of a very prouiising field day on whitmlon day in which the volunteers the windsor garrison and the troops fromn adershatt were to take part anid the battie of chobhain one of the most remarkable incidents of the autumn manceuvres to be fought over again has been marred by the declared inability of the southwestern railway to convey more than  voluinteers friom london to chobham aind back the plea of the aiuilway company is we lunderstand that it would interfere with the ordiuary whit monday traffic but it is surelv ot creditable to the administration of one of our principal railways and the one moreover which has most benefited by military traffic to be un able on occasion to rnake so small an effort as is implied in the conveyance of men without horses or artillery a distance of  usiles to a spot approachable by two of its lines we hope that upon recornsideration the directors will see that the interest us well as the credit of the comupany

one remarkable circumstance in comleriou vvith the duties of whitewashers which he says is worth re cording they visit iufected houses after the clisinfec tors have left them aud strip off the papers from the walls subsequenitly wash the walls with solu tion of caustic soda and clean the plaiut a therewith they state that the number of coats of paper vhich they oind covering the valls of cottage houses varies from three coats to  coats the latter being the maxinat number found and that the paper has usually a disagreeable fustse mnell and itis remarkable that these mnen have nearly all had fever or other infectious disease contractedl in the performance of their duty aithough the houses previous to their visits had already been disinfected by chlorine carbolic acid c it would seemi therefore that the absorbent power of the paper covering the walls is such als to enable it to retain the germs of infec tion if such there be or at all events the infectious matters and to protect them to a considerable degree froni the action of disinfectants so that on the paaper being re moved and torn up these become liberated atnd infect the men on the other hanud it is a very rare
