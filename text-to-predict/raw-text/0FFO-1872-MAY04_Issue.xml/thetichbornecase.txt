the tichborye casecourt of comxmeon lax wim may  ng in banco raster tcrm before lord chief jilstiebovsll and ijsssai bs brtt and grovtichbob v mostyï¿½in thi case rr hawkins qo with whom were mr matthews qc and ir purcell at the sitting of the court on behalf of the defendants moved for an order calling on l the plaintiff to pay the costs of the action  tichborne vlnshington  before being allowed to proceed to trial in this action mr giffard q c showed cause in the first in stanceit appeared from the statement of the learned consel and of the affidavits on which he moved that the plaintiff in the present action was the same as in the action tich borne v lushington  that the defendants were substan tialy the sarnethey were the trustees of the doughty l estate for the infant heir yho was the heir to the tichborne estates in the former action the title to both estates was the same and the issue in both cases was the skae whether the plaintiff was sir rogercharles tichborne the defendants in the last case had succeededand had been put to great expense in defending the former action the taxed costs being stated in one of the affidavits to be over l and that would probably mean costs altogether amounting to  he now nmoved in accordance with the autho rities that before the plaintiff be permitted to try the same question over again he be ordered to pay the taxed costs of the former trial utnder the d section of the common law procedure actthe defendants had given the olaimant  days notice to proceed to trial at the next sittings after termmr giffn d showed cause on the groundfirstthat the parties in this action were not the same as in the last ac tion the defendants as trustees were trustees for other interests as well as for the infant heir he also contended that the circamstances under which the verdict was found on evidence that roger c tichborne had been tattooed and that the claimant was not were a surprise on the claimant no notice of such a defencehaving been giventhe claimant had never been asked if lord bellew had not tatooed him and the evidence on the matter given by dr lipscombe andthe questions asked of him were forthe purpose of corroborating the claimant that he had not been tatooed and not for the parpose of contradicting him and the questions put to the claimant himself in cross examination whetber he had ever been tattooed rather pointed to him as arthur orton who it was said had been tattooed the defence on which the verdmit had been obtained had been kept dark and had been unfairly sprung upon the claimant as a surprise and the circumstances were such that the learned coansel con tended he would have been entitled to have moved for a uew trial on the grond of surprise seven or eight wit nesses were calle to rove tattoo marks on roger c tich borne the fact of hishaving been tattooed not having been previously raised so as to give the claimant notice that this was a material question to be tried and in this way the minds of the iury had been brought to a conclusion against him if in the course of the trial this question had been raised it might have been asked of some of the o witnessea called for the plaintiff who knew him well whether they had ever seen any tattoo marks on roger c tichbornes arm that being denied by the plaintiff their evidence if recalled as to that one fact would have lost most of its weight and it would nearly have doubled the claimants costs the claimant bad therefore elected to be nonsuited and to try his case in another action the defendants could not complain now if the question of the tattoo marks was to be tried they had got the verdict by this course of procedure on a point which had never been put to the plaintiffs witnessesmr hawkins in reply vwas surprised to hear his friend resist this rule on the ground of surprise why did be not produce some affidavit of some one who had seen the arm of roger charles tichborne and who could swear that there were no tattoo marks on it there was abundant notice to the claimant of the questions to be raised and dr lips combe hadl been asked by mr serjeant ballantine whetler he was not under an iinpresion that there was some sort of mark on his arm and he was asked what sort of a mark he said  the mark was an initial as impressed on my mind particularly of its being vcry bally done i got it into my head from one of the faiilv mentioning it on cross examination he said he had toll mr bowker that the mark was r c t with a cable or some device over ita de vice of a sbip and a mermaidlr giffardl thought the device spoken of was faith elope and charitymr hawkinsa very fishy representation of faith hope and charity for the wituess remarked he thought it must have been done by a man a very bad hand at it or drunk how could it be said after this evilence that there was no intimation of the defence and that the claimant was altogether ignorant of it besides moore and boyle might have been recalled and asked the question whether roger charles tichborne was tattooed there was also ample grounl to justify the jury in arriving at the conclu sion they had done without the tattoo marks his learned friend had been instructed to make this statement of sur nrise with a view of aiding the moneybox a laugh the aefendants had here been put to  or probably  expense and were they again to be put to similar expense to try the same actionmr giffard said there was nothing about l in the affidavits lis friend must have been instructed to make that statement for the newspapers a laughmr hawkins proceeded to contend that on the notes of evidence mr serjeant ballantine gave up the case on the understanding that the jury bad made up their minds on the whole case and not on the tattoo marksmr justice grovesnppose that when the questions were asked about the tattoo marks duringthe plaintiffs case that it had been in the mind of serjeant ballantine that orton had got a tattoo mark on his arn then the question put to the claimant and other witnesses about tattoo marks would appear to have reference rather to orton than to tichborne and would not be notice of the defence to himmr hawkins said he could not assame thatmr justice grooveyou have given the claimant oice to proceed with his action and he obeys the notice and now you ask for an order that he be not allowed to pro ceed until he has paid the costs of the former action  and if the order should be granted do you say that under the d section of the common law procedure act you bave a rigbt to sign judlgmnent when the cause is called on in a few days if he has not paid the costs ordered  if vou maintain that i should hesitate before agreeing to make the ordermr havkirs conitended that he was entitled to give the claimant notice to proceed to trial and also to insist on the costs of the former trial being paidmr mathews was heard on the same sidethe ciref justrce in giving judgment said it was per fectly plain upon the affidavits and on the statements of counsel that the actions at issue were the same the plain tiff was the same in both cases  the question to be tried was the same in bothnamely whether the plaintiff was or was not sir roger charles ticbborne both actions were brought against the tenant in possession to try the title to the estate substantially in each case the defendant was the same and the question involved was precisely the same the last action had been tried during a period of over  days and at the conclusion of the f day the jury had intimated their opinion ou the case the jury said  we have now heard the evidence regarding the tattoo marks and subject to your lordships directions the jury do not require any further evidence upon this at the requestf serjeant ballantine there was an adjournment on the court reassembling after the adjournment the learned counsel for the plaintiff referred to the tattooing and sup posing the jury to be governed by that evidence and not by the generalevidence he stated he could not withdraw from the case as he was in a position to recall certain witnesses i and other persons as to that the jury retired and on theirreturn the foreman said  i am desired to express that the judgment of the jury was based on the entire evidence upon that statement his brother ballantine advised the elaimant to submit to a nonsuit the plaintiff now pro posed to procced to try the same question with reard to the doughty estates this according to the practice of the mourts he could not do without paving the costs of the former proceedings his lordship here rferred to tidips practce ed  p  to i r  and to  qb  as laying down that rule of practice he had come to the conclusion that this application could not be resisted on the ground of surprise the only question was whether the court should not allow the order to stand over for a timle he thought the right course would be that the tinie for proceeding to trial should be extended to six months if the money could not be found in six months it probably would not be found at all on those terms he thought the rule ought to be made abso lute that the claimant proceed to trial and pay the costs in six monthsthe other learnedljudges gave separate judgments to the same effectthis case occupied the whole day until  oclock
