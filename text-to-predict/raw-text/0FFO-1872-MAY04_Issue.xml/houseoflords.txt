samended the bill as amended was ordered to be reportednaval educationthe earl of lauderdaue said he was about to put a question which was one of considerable importance to naval oeuicers and had direct reference to the efficiency of the niavy generally it was whether in the avy they were to have a highclass scentifc and philosophical education at the expense of personal experience a iaugh he had a great respect for a highclass scientific andl philosophical education but if it xvas to he had at the expensej of experience he would have nothing to do with it highclass education of that kind would never make an otficer or a sailor uor would it ever prevent a ship from going on shore it was commonly said that naval officers had a low class of education  but le begged to dispute that assertion they came into the ynavy very young and from his experience as president of the college of portsmouth for five years he could say that not more than one boy out of eight who came into the navy fr om the large schools could pass in the common examina tions of reading writing and arithmnetic if they svent up direct none of them could pass withouta cram butit freuently occurred in the case of young men who had got into the navy that in a few years thev were heard of as taking high honours at the university he did not know how that was done but he thought it too must be done bycramming a laugh he had neverknown an instanceof avighclass universitymanbecoming anavalofficer but he bdl known many instances of young men who after havin entered the navy took highclass honours at the univer sity and attained to the most exalted positions in the church and the state he might piuat to bis noble and learned friend on the front bench as an examplelord chieltsfordmy noble and learned fiiend will forgive mc i underwent no examination a laughthe earl of lauderdale said his noble and learned fricned was an example of a man who had attained a hiuh position in the state after having been in the savy the naval college at portsmouth was an ex tremely useful institution if it was desirable that raval officers should have an opportunity of keeping ttl and improving their professional knowledge the government it was understood were about to remove the college for the education of naval officers from portsouoth where it had been established for very many years nnd which might be caled the very centre of the navy to greenwich which was now totally unconnected with the ns avy and he wranted very much to know the reasons which bad induced the government to form that determination one of those reasons was said to he that at portsmouth there was no school of naval architecture but there had been although it had been removed iu ports mnouth could be seen everything connected with the navy they might see the drawings of ships as sent dowvn from the admiraltyships in mouldthe first plate of their bottom laidships launched rigged manned armed and made ready for sea instruction could be got in gunnery manceuvring of ships taking them in and out of harbourpractical insight into every point that a naval cuncer ouoht to be acquainted with greenwich as he had said was totally unconnected with the iavy ther had heon dockyards thereone on either sidehut the govern uent had sold them one of them being converted into a huge slaughtersouse he thought the removal of the college from portsmouth to greenwich would be highly de trimental to the efficiency of naval officers he therefore wished to ask the noble earl opposite upon what grounds the government intended to remove the college for the instruction of naval officers from portsmouth where they have every opportunity of improving and keeping up their professional knowledge to greenwich where they will be entirely separated from the navythe duke of somerset wished to put another ques lion in connexion with the same subject so that the noble earl might answer both at the same time there were three systems of education in the navy which so far as he understood were now to be interfered with one was for the education of the naval cadets he believed that was to be materially altered that system of education was carried on at dartmouth and it would be very undesirable to bring it into a large town such as either greenwich or portsmouth young lads should not be exposed to conta dnination in large towns they had therefore been placed in a port where their education was going on with much satisfaction but that it appeared was about to be altered the next question was what was to be done wvith the school of naval architecture which bad been established at kensington when removed to greenwich would it beopen to the private trade  the third question had reference to the officers who were at present studying at portsmiouth they had now the great advantage not only of studying under scientific professors but of seeing the practical application of their studies in the dockyard ho wanted to now the scheme of her maiestys government wvith re gard to these three departments of naval educationlord dunsany was not surprised that the govern mentfinding themselves in possession of a large unoccupied palace conceived the idea of applyin it to naval purposes and determined to establish a vays college but if it were a mere question of economy ho very much doubted whether it would not after all be less expensive to enlarge tie present building in portsmouth dockyard than to adapt greenwich hospital to the purposes of a tnavalcollege it was exceedingly important when they nere constautly bailin newf ships that ireshexperleece of them should be obtained by the ofcers of the navy and it was by being on the spot and going out on trial trips that they conlul ascer tain how long it took those great monsters to turn the circle or halfcircle another new department of naval science had recently sprung n ph e alluded to the torpedo department and young men being edncated for the navywould have no gno opportunitv of gaining practical know iedgc in that department or in seeing how the present inrge guns were put on hoard of the ships as for green wick hospital it did not follow that it it were not made use of for purposes connected with the navy it might not be devoted to some other national purposethe earl of camperdown said that the apprehension felt by the noble earl as to the removal of the naval col lege to greenwich must have been caused by his nonac quaintance withthedetails of the proposed arrangement and with the extent to w hich it wvas proposed to move the college to greenwich and he trested that the explanation le had to give would have the effect of di iminishing som e o f the noble earls objections during the last  years two views as to the proper method of naval nstruction had uuderone much discu ssion one view wna that it was absolutely necessary that a naval officer sould throughout hls career remain in connexion with bis profession and be as much as possible surrounded by his brother officers on the other hand it was contended that the education to be obtained during tho period when an officer was not em ployed wvas not of less value than the advantage to he gained by his beingo surrounded during his whole career by naval officers and naval associations it was as well that he should state that in his opinion the days had passed of no examinations and little education things w ere now changed and much education was nowv given the career of education might be conveniently divided into three periods the first was that when the cadet lavine passed the examination for entering the navy was obliiged to prepare for active duty the second period was when he attained the rank of lieutenant when he was obliged to prepare himself a ain for exacit nation in gunnerg and the third period embraced the remainder of his career and included his swing to col lege and obtaining the instruction provided siy the autho rities the question as to the best means and best place for the education of naval cadets had been considered by the aidmiralty for a long time and some measures would be adopted but one measure which would not be adopted viouldbhethat of sending the cadets to greenwich the second portion of a naval officers education was also a period of compulsory education because it was not possible that a young naval officer out with the deet at sea could come home prepared to pass his examination without further instruction and in this part of the education the particular study of gunnery would not in any way be inter fered with those who had seen the excellent would be of opinion that it constituted the finest school of gunnery in the world and no persons were less disposed than the pre sent board of admiralty to interfere with the practical course of that instruction the number of the people now studying at the college wu on the average from  to  young subhalt ern s four or five lieute nants stu dying for commissions in the royal miarina artillery from five to eight lieutenants preparing themselves for gunnery lieutenants two commanders and twvo cap tains the stat connected wvith the college though not numerous had been most active in promoting the education of the young men and ohficers but he was perfectly willing to allow that at the presert time the provision for the hiher education of naval officers was not sufficient con sideringthe importance of the navy to england and with out newv instrucotion and additional lectures the desired re sult could not he properly attained thc noble lord said that it would be easy to increase the accommo dation in the college hiowever as the college was situated in a corner of the dockyard there would he great difflculty in increasing the accommodation to any extent and at present it wvas insufficient for the purpose for which it was wanted he would not deny that portsmouth had considerable advantages over other sites for a naval college in afiording a facility for officers to witness the sea trials of new ships and in having the dockyard close at band but he did not think that any attendance in the dockyard was absolutely enjoined wvith regard to obtaining the attendance of superior pro fessors greenwiich would possess considerable advantages over portsmouth  amil if the expectations of the govern ment were fulfilled it wzas probable that a larger numberof officers of various classes would attend the college than had hitherto been the case even granting that they were cut off from association with portsmouth wvhich would not he en tirely the case because by far the greater number of sub lieutenants would have to go to portsmouth to go through their course in the excellentso that even then the number of persons associated together couldnotbesaidtoberemoved from the influenceof tlvexr profession if at greenwvich they would not have the advantage of a dockyard they would at all events have the great advantage of being near shoehury nesswhere the trial ofe heavy gunnery wias carried on it was urged in opposition to fixing upon greenwich as the site of a naval college that it wvas too near london and that the allurements of the metropolis would he too much for the younger naval offlcers there was however the security that the younger naval offlcers would be under the neces sity of attending lectures wvhile in the next place it had been found by experience that at wfoolwich which was almost equally near london the offlcers who went there to be educated were not unwvilling to avail them selves of the advantages which had been offered to them even granting the justice of all that had been said by the noble lord on that point would he he would ask undertake to say that there were none of those allurements at portsmouth to which he objected in the case of greenwich he had spoken hitherto only of the execu tive offlcers of the navy but there was a most important class of officers who were being educated in our dockyards and very few of whom had an opportunity of obtainine ang higher education whom it was essential that we should have educated in the most effective manner he alluded to the engineerotllcers as matters at presentstoodafteropen com petition at ehedockyardsand afterpassinga few yearsthere about eight annually out of about  were sent to south eensington for a period of three years the probability was that instead of a smau number of those officers heino sent to suuth ensington in futulre they woull in some formu or other have the advantage of a higher education at the naval coulege at greenwich as regarded the school of naval architecture the students were educated at the docicyards in very much the same manner as the engineers and only two of the most promising selected by examina tion were sent up to south kecnsington for those persons also it was proposed to provide in the new naval college at greenwich certain models at south kecnsington which were of the highest interest and value had been referred to and that collection it was intended to remove to green wich in that way by the concentration of officers lec tures and models that improvement mighnt be obtained which he thought it was most desirable in the inte rest of tho service should if possible be effected it had been asked whether it was proposed to pro ceed in the same manner as hitherto with respect to the architects in private trades and he had no doubt the first lord of the admiralty wvould seriously consider the proposal which had been made to him by the com mittee whlich had been charged with preparing the news arrangemenxts for the college at greenwich hie did not he might adld think it imorobable that his rigrht hon friend would accede to the proposition that the same advantages should he held out to those in private trades as to others the whole subject he might add had been most seriously canvassed bo th iathe navalprcss andby th countrygeueratly for the last two years and it could not he thought he denied that on the whole there was a growing opinion that greenwich was the most eligible site for the establishment of a new naval college eie wvished to repeat that there was no desire on the part of the admiralty to substitute theore tical for practical education in the navy the first lord of the admiralty was fully alive to the necessity of pro moting in the highest degree the qualities of seaman shlip and physical superiority among the officers of the service and he could assure the noble lord that in any arrangement which might he made the continu ance of the connexion of a sailor with the sea and with the active duties of his profession would he duly looked after and provided for hiear hearthe earl of lauderdale reminded the noblo earl that the trials at shoeburyness to which he had referred were simply the trials of newr guns while at portsmouth an offlcer would have the opportunity of seeing the actual practice from the forts as wvell as of going ont to sea in ships wthich carried large guns as to the enlargement of the college at portsmouth it was a matter about which there wvas no difficulty it msight he carried ont for a less sum thanuthat which would have to be expended at green wich as to general opinion on the subject he could only say that he had spoken to a eat many naval officers with respect to it and that he had not heard one of them exr press an opinion that greenwich was a better site than ports mouththe earl of caiiperdown repeated that it was not intended in any way to interfere with the practice adding that in the statement which he had made he had perhaps gone further in some respects than hc ought to have done inasmuch as the subject was at the present moment under the consideration of the eirst lord of the admiralty hie believed at the same time that nll that he had stated would he found to he perfectly correctextradition treatielord rosebery in moving that an humble address be presented to her mlajesty for returns tating t he number and nature of all treaties or conventions at present in force with foreign states for the extradition of criminals said that public attention had been directed to this subject by the case of dliblanc but hardly a crumb of information was supplied with reard to these treaties in  the then attorneygenerali brought forward an extradition bill and in the course of his speech said that while france had o extradition treaties and a merica nearly as many this country had only three now at that time as far as he could gather four such treaties had been madewith france the united states enusarki and prussia it was quite possible that sas their continuance depended on the will of the high contracting parties some of these might have ceased to be operative and at any rate it wa s important that information should be supplied if itaas really the fact that only those remained in existence during the two years which had since elapsed a new attorneygeneral had come into office but the counu try had obtained a very small increase of information intie course ot some recent proceedings in the court of queens bench theattorneygeneral said we had not a treaty of ex tradition with america mr justice blackburn apparently overcome with astonishment saidnot with america the attorneygeneral replied no but negotiations are going on mr justice blackburn asked whether the time had expired and the attorneygeneral said be was not sure but that a proposal was pending to extend the time but the act of parliament founded on the treaty with ame rica provided that the treaty should continue in force till one or the other of the signataries gave notice to the contrary there was no limitation of time there fore in the treaty anid the period of its continuance could not be extended when such vagao sttements were made in quarters which you would assume to be well informed their lordships were justified in turning from these doctors who disagreed and in applying to the foreign office for information there could he no object in keeping those treaties secret indeed the events of the last two years had made secret treaties rather out of fashion the publication of extradition treaties must surely be useful and necessary a forger for example if he found that he would leave these shores only to be brought back in hand cuffs would perhaps hesitate before committing such a crime the knowledge that treaties of this kind existed must have a repressive effect on some crimes like forgery which were committed with premeditation on inquiry it might be found that more extradition treaties existed thanwith america for if not we might as well give up the sysem f etraitin teatcs ltoeter ele trusted that the government wvould grant the modest request he now made forinformationon a subject than which few were rooreimportant and certainly none were more obscure hear hearearl granville was glad that the subject had been brought before the house and rejoiced that the noble lord should take any opportunity of adding to the sufficient though few proofs he had already given of his power to take a most importaut part in their lordships disossions not knowing that the noble lord would refer to the attorney general he had not been able to communicate with himand could not therefore say what he had stated to the court of qaeen bench or whether he had been cor rectlyreported he earl granville must therefore con fine himself to giving the information askei for three extradition treaties were now in existence one with france one with the united states and one with den mark that with theunited states comprised murder at temptstomurderpiracy arson forgery and fraudsby means of forged documents the treaties with france and den mark comprised murder attempts to murder forgery and fraudulent bankruptcy there was also atreatyof extradition with china but it wvas of a different character from those existing with the countries he had iust mentioned the principle on which the three treaties rested was that anv demand for the surrender of a criminal should be made through the diplomatic agents of the country re quiring it and that the surrender should only be made after it had been established that according to the law of the country to which the alleed criminal had escaped sufficient grounds existed for appreending and committing him in the case of denmark thera was an exception as to the surrender of natives of denmark no such provision existed in the treaties with the united states or with france as to the former neither the americans nor ourselves could hesitate about giving up natives for the identity of language woulil make it difficult if not im practicable to enforce such a provision as to the french the case had never arisen the belief was that france wyould be opposed to the surrender of natives the universal principle adopted on the continent of europe being that a native subject of any state could not be sur rendered by the state besides these treaties powers of surrendering criminals existed in some of our colonies and places near them  but these were not treaties they were separate legislative enactments with re gard to prussia an extradition treaty was con cluded in  and in  one was made with france but in neither case did the government succeed in obtaining the sanction of parliament and therefore the treaties remained inoperative two years ago a difficulty arose with france as to certifying the depositions taken but by subsequent legislation that difficulty was removed his noble friend was correct in stating that no time was limited in the treaty with the united states that treaty being terminable at any tinie by six months notice from either of the two signataries a treaty with germany was now almost on the point of being signed delay had arisen entirely through the difficulty which eng lish lawyers and foreign jurists experienced in defining the crimes to which the treaty applied but he hoped that no long time would elapse before the treaty was concluded all these treaties were terminable at six months notice he had no doubt that other countries would follow the good example which had been set with regard to those treaties the value of which his noble friend had not in the slightest degree overratedthe motion was agreed topacific islanders protection billthe earl of lkimbe rley in moving the second reading of this bill said that any of their lordships who had read the papers which had been presented to parliament on this subject would be of opinion that legislation was impera tively required the great extension of communication with the south sea islands and their rapid colonization by europeans had brought about a state of things which did not exist a few years ago at present there was a great desire that those colonies which were suited to the growth of tropical products should be supplied with labour other than that of whites and polynesian labourers were in great demand for that purpose this immigration of polynesian labourers was confined principauy to the colony of queens land and the settlements in the fiji islands the immigration to queensland had been placed under strict regulations by the law of the colony which provided on the whole in an effective manner for the protection of the labourers who had arrived in the colony some doubt had been expressed on that point but as far as he had been able to learn from various sources anl especially from his noble friend the marquis of normanby who had latelv gone out as governor there existed a real desire on the part of the colonial legislature to make efficacious provision for the protection of the labourers and if further legislation should be required no indisposition would be found to pass more effectual and stringent laws the legislature of queensland could make regulations with regard to the labourers who had come to the colony and the vessels which arrived within their ports and came under their own jurisdiction but a system had grown up of late by which vessels belonging he was afraid to a great extent to the subjects of her majesty went to the south sea islands decoyed the natives on board or frequently car ried them on board by force and conveyed them to the settlement in the fiji islanls over which the queensland legislature had no control whateverand where no sufficient regulations for the protection of these poor men ex isted the masters of vessels whc had engaged to procure a certain number of labourers were not likely to be exceed ingly scrupalous as to the manner in which those labourers might be obtained if their lordships could conceive how extremely numerous were the persons engaged in this busi ness how varied their influence and how many opportu nities they harl of evading any regulations which her majestys cruisers might attempt to enforce they would feel no surprise that very great evils had grown up he could not help referring here to what he might term the crowning atrocityof the murder of bishop patteson he caled it  the crowning atrocity not because he laid such great blame upon the islanders though they had been guilty of an inhuman and cruel act as on that system of fkidnapping which had led to the loss of a valued friend for the late bishop had been a valued friend of his nothing could have been more melancholy here was a mlan who had devoteil his whole life to the spread of christianity and civilization and to the improvement in every wav of the natives of these islands wve hal the strongest testi mony that the bishop was universally loved and regarded by the natives with the utmost veneration and such was the inflaence which he had acquired over them that what ever he did or recommended was received with implicit trust when a feeling of trust of that kind was once esta blished in the minds of these uncivilized people the revul sion was all the greater when they supposed that their trust had been misplaced the reason why the natives believed that their confidence bad been misplaced was thisthese atrocious kidnappers acturlly made use of signals and dis guises to induce the natives to think that the bishop was aboattovisitthemandtomake themcome ou shipboard but when they came on hoard they were seized and carried off to the fiji islands under the miserableand melancholy mis apprehension that the bishop was in reality an enemy they murdered their best friend the guilt therefore reseied not so much upon the natives as upon those who had brought about such a state of mindin these unhappy pen pie and here he must say that he regretted what was stated to have been done when the cruiser eosario viaited these islands ehear hear it was necessary that the natives should be made to feel that a civilized country was strong enough to avenge any atrocity ommittes on itssub jects but the hotse would agree with him that a power of this kind should be very zautiously and sparingly usel and he was quite sure that those who had read almost the last words of bishop patteson himself would espeeially la ment the steps which he was informed had been taken to avenge the murder he was quite certain that the com mander of the rosario acted in the belief that he wvas only performing his duty and he was not therefore disposed to cast too great blame upon him those who were employed at a distance from home and who had to act often under circumstances of great difficulty had a heavy responsibility to bear and we should always be exceedingly careful in finding fault with them but he was
