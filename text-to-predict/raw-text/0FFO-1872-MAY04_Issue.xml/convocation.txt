bishop of licois gave notice of a declaration on the proposed synodal declaration conlcerning the atha nasian creed xvith reference to the greek church aud the clause jllioqae and alsvv with regard to the warning clauses in that creedthe bishop of ely rose to support the following resolu tion wlhich was proposed by the bishop of gloucester and secouded by the bishop of peterborough before the ad journment of the debate in february that it is not desirable to invite legislation on that part of the th report of tile ritual comzissioners which relates to the athanasian creedthe bishop of ely after pointing out the advantages which lma resulted from tbe adjournment of the debate until tile lower house had considerel the mattersai l that without dionbt a large nuther of person felt a hardship in connexion with the use of this exposition of faith a large number of the laity conidered they had a grievance on this accunt snil iiany nonconformists who ottherwise sould be dtraw vinto tbecharch were kept out by it thengain it prevented acoriial union vitlitbe greatchurchesoftheeast anod that was a questioa which might be considered hereafter feeling leeply for those iu whose minds these doublts and tiiticulties arose and claiming for himself the possession of large religious sytnpathies he said be vvas perfectly sensible of the great strenigth uf the language in what were called the danunatory clauses he should indeed have been very tnankfal if the creed had been dravn up in some what didferent terms for there wlere in it words which did niot mean au thal some persons attri buted to theam and which in the present translation were ambiguous requiring indeed theological acumuen and experience tor their just interpretation and the laity undoubteedly felt it a grievance that they not having that theological experience were required to repeat theii in their unadorned simplicity but he would ask whether it was not inevitable that there should be grievances in connexlou with all oldestablished usages and he submitted that it was impossible to relieve the tender coisciences of those with whom he deeply sympa thizedwithout imposing greater grievaucesou thechurchat large and on other persons whoun they were bound to con salt at all event there shouild be years anud years of thought and pryer and consultatiou tvith the leanued members of other churches and if it might be with the universal chubch before any alteration should be madle iu its formn and use believing the words to he true from beginning to enl he did occasionaliy shrink froun sonme of the strong language in it and if any retransla tion should en hle us to relax them he should be thankful yet if that were impussible he would ratber retain it than lose it for its loss would be irreparable bcesies this it would be a breach of faith towarls mauy thousands of clergmen and many would be driven away from the church he should suppoit the bishop of glouces ter in saying that this was not the time to deal with any alteration of the creed of st athanasius change at pre sent woould cunciliate bat fesv wvhile there was danger that change at present wouild alieunte manythe bishop of wllciiester moved as an amend ment that this house assents to the resolutions translmlitted to it by the lower house as to the retention and use of the confession of faith commonlv called thjat of st athanasiusthe learning anal arguments on this subject bad he said been thoroughly exhausted iu the debates and it remained therefore for their lordships ta deal with the question strictly as a practical one whlat wvere they to do do sotnething they inust because the resulution which had comue ulp to them fro the lower honserequired absolutelv thiat they in tbeir position as bishops should eithdr give their adhesion or make au amendment to it orin somen way give utterauce to their opinions upon a subject of such importance as he wished to ansver certai isatemoients which had been made in the house by the bishop of stl davidls he deeply regretted the absence o that righlt rev prelatewhom he had earnestly requested to be present the questions before them werefirst should there be an omis sion of the athanasian creedfrotnithe serricesof the church secondly should there be if not an entire onmission a for mally permissive oxlission  or thirdly should there be an alteration in the creed the creed being retainel  it was only necessary to say a word with reard to the second question because he hoped it would h e felt that thme per mission to read or anoit to red so imprant a part of the service was asoltitely inadmuissible fcr a miioment it could only lead to party spiritof a most pernicions eharacter and would give an individualelcrgymau the liowerof pleasing or slhocking his parishioners whereas it was most inmportant that the lay people should not he put in any way at the mercy of oficiating clergymen tbteuas tothe omission of the creed he was anxious to say a wvord because he had been told that inanlotlerplaceadigeitarvof thechurch had stated and founded an argumenet uonthestatemeotthathehad preposed to the ititnal commissio ers that the creed i lajol be taken from the services of the church aud re inltted to the articles lie nished to plate tlat lie never trade any sueb propos whatq er he did give notice that he should draw the attention of tbe commissiou to the ques tion but as a inatter of fact he never did po because when the tire came le felt that tb matter ha behen well con sidered and he no louger thought it necessary to muake his motion he should object exceedingly to remove the creed to the articles because he believed that to doso would cause a schism in the church of england it was the great hymin of the church and the use of it was that in these things so sung orsaid in the public vorship of the church truth stole iitto the minds of the worahipper without thleir kuowing it anl they became more poisasred of tho truththan byformalandrdogmatic statements which affected the intellect rather than the heart as to the third proposition to leave out what were called the daunatory clauses be ob jected altogether td the alteration of this creed aud on these groundsbecause he thought it nnfir for any one peculiar hranch in the church to alter public doca ments of the universal church secondly it would not give any real satisfaction to those who found fault with it  and thirdly it would pat the remining portion of the creed upon a different footing and pwould ive a netv and intenser vigour to everything they left unaltered he then proceeded to deal in an elaborate theological argument with the views expressed by the bishop of st davids and con chaded by presng very earnestly upon the kouse the adoption of hi amendmentthe bishop of lrochiesrut teconed the amendmentthe bishop of losdonr in risinlg to support the bishop of gmocesters resolution said he areed wihthe lower hxouse that it was not desiratble to make nay alteration in the creed at the present tine wvith respect to the damnatory clauses wbich were a stumbling block to many be expressed his opinion that they were no part of the vircdcadsaof the creed as a creed and since the majo rity of those who were disquieted by the creed were dis quieted by no clauses except those called the dantnatory clauses it became a question whether the church ought not to consider the propriety of removing them and leaving the creed alone in its integrity although he did not propose that any consideration of tbis sort should be undertaken at the present timne he objected to the amendmentbecause the resolution of the lower house seetned to pledge them not only to the proposition that alteration shoald not be mnade now but that no alteration should be made at any timethe bishop of lltï¿½nd also supported the resolution lvhile he approved of the tirst portion of the amndment uas to the reteution of the creed he totally dissented from the second part which assented to the use of the creed hie felr with the bishop of london that the creed went further than holy scripturethe bishop of ltcafitln in supporting the amendment from a missionary point of view contended stronglv for the retention and use of the creed having failed to find in his own experience any reason why it should not be used in the public services even with people in the simplest state and when just emerging from heathenisnlthe bishops of hereforfd and cn chester also sup ported the amendmentthe bishop of glocestfr having stated that by his resolution lie merely wished to postoe the consideration of the question and not to put it offior everthe archbishop of canternusny gave his reasons for voting as he intended to do since it was probable that his vote vould decidle the ouestion for the present the time inight come ivhen they might conciliate the scruples which they beheved to exist in the minds of many without doing injury to the church the bisbop of wfinchester bad pointed oat that his resolution spoke only of the present but his grace thought there wvas great force n the remarks of the bishop of glocester they had by a deliberate vote referred the consideration of the manu script as well as the translation of the athanasian creed to a committee noxv as he understood the first of the resolutions before them the lower house shut up the question which their lordships had per mitted themselves to inquire into it was a little difficult to make out wvhat they meant and for that reason he in clined to the original motion now before them rather than to the proposed amendment he did nou wish to say more with regard to the general question than seemei to be called for by the remarks which had been made by soeie speakers that day upon the misunderstanding or mis interpretation he aight even say vilfnlmisrepresentatiou of what hehad said upon the subject lis lvords had been to this effectthat the words of the damnatory clauses of the creel were acceptet by no persons without qualifica tion and the remarks of every one of his right rev brethren that day had convinced him more fully of the abso lute accuraey of what he had stated one reason why he wished to see these damnatory clauses omitted uas that he conisidered it very desirable to get rid of the remnant of that state of things which under the old mode of dealing with subscriptions haddoue great injury to many tender consciences it was one of the privileges of our time that we had gralually got rid of the system which he very much disliked aui which he trusted the chuirch vould be thoroughly rid of before long they had seen a great change in the mode of subscriptions in the church of eng land and he considered the alteration a great im provement because the declaratiou uow caled for irom every member of the clerical profession more exactly expressed what was exactly meant than the old declaration  and as he conceived there was a remnant of the old system in their assent so far as they did asient to the damnatory clauses and as it was very desirable to get rid of the remnant of that old state of things he wvas very anxious to see those damnatory clauses remnoved from the services of the church after reverting to the qualifi cations pat forward by several right rev prelates he gttarded himself against the supposition that be did not wish minatory declarations such as our lord had himself sanctioned to be retained but he desired that thev should adhere to the absonlite sinmplicity of the declarations of christ and his apostlesthie anlendienet was put to the vote and lost the presi dent giving his casting vote iu favour of the original reso lution whiich was next put to the vote and lost by a majo rity of one the votes being five for and six against the original resolutionthe house was then prorogued until the frst tuesday in julythe lower housethe house yesterday reassembled in the jerusalem chamber the ven archdeacon
