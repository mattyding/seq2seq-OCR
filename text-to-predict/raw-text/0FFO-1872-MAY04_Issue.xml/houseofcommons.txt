was deserving of the first premium and the stxth place was accorded to the design of mr stevens it was to bc regretted however that these gen tlemen did not recommend the government to adopt any one model but advised thodm to ask the opinion of distinl guished artists and then decide who should be eimployed to mii aiaetid erect the monument in honour of the dukes memory nothing further was done

to be erected in st paumls at a cost of  for the first  mouths and a propor tionate sum for such further time if any as was found ne cessary for its completion this condition obviously showed that in the opinion of the noble lord the work would probably be executed withinl  months from the day on which the order was given in point of fact however the work was scarcely begun by the end of   months after the order was given ml stevens was called to account on several occasions by the lirstcommissioner of works it was always difficult to elicit a reply from that gentleman but in december  he stated his willingness to complete hib model for  in addition to the l already paid to him in decem ber  the correspondence was still going on between mr stevens and the first commissioner of works but it was not till  that he was allowed to see the model which ought lo have been completed eight years before the cause of the delay was this in thefirst place mr stevens alhough as that arbiter clegantim the member for white haven thought he was the most able sculptor in the coun try was a man of such undeteamined character that he could never make up his mind to go on with his workl in the second place when mr stevens had work in hand he did all the common labourers work himself instead of employing labourers to do it and the result was an enor mous waste of time in march  he asked the theu first commissioner of works lord john manners a ques tion as to the progress of the work and was told that it was hoped the monument would be completed in two years in  he asked a further question and was informed ly the noble lord that he could hardly expect all the figures to be in their places before the end of  still the delay continued until the present first commissioner finding it useless to leave the v ork any longer in the hands of mr stevens determined upon intrusting it to some other sculptor this was a wise and sensible decision but the treasury overruled the judgme
