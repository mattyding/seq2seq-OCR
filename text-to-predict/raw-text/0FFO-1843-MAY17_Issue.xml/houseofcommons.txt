workinx in thes mines even the inoble lord nearv him must himself admit that thoepeyticres were the grosaset exaggeratitue now he did not besitate to iell lhbs homse that the greater part of the

tacments of mr franks were withtout founi dtion and particularly so as to the distance which women were employed to push or draw those waggona the report stated that the distances varied from  yardis to ito but whast was the real state of the case i it was this that the dissianre did not exceed aine yards  thus everything wenat an as if the whole purpose was to arcommodate the evidncee to a proconceived set of nations amongst the gross error put forth by mr franks was that the people who worked in the mines wera not allowed time fr dinner  while the evidence which thent lay before him showed that they hsd an hour for dinner one for breakfast and half occusiosally in the course of the day mlargaret hleaps to whoss evidencee frequent reference had beeni made distinctly deposed before a magistrate to statemaents the reverse of those put frth by mr franks the house would observe thiat she stated that the roads on which those waggons moved were always kept hard and dry and smooth and therefore that the whbels ratm easily on themi she further stated that she was in good health and that the greater number of the colliers went to church regularly en sundtys decently dressed sant that on the whole they were better off thin otherse of the working cllasse that in the rmines they are alldecently clothed the armse of the men only being balre toewitness who gave this testimony appeared to be very intellii gent and beinz called on to read a portion of the scriptures did so very well thea there was that case disposed of he regretted to say that the measwre which the noble lord brought in had been hurried through with indecent has e and now he would ask the house was it fitting to maintain a law which woold drive many of the por colliers to destitu tion at a moment when they themselves were earnestly pro testing against the measurei the noble lord maight say that the petitions against the measure originated with the owners of mines and not with the colliers or that if the working men and women did sign them they were dragooned into doing so by the owners of minces h ut then he would ask was there any one prepared to say that the ministers elders andeadioal men ofscotland wereato bedragooned intosiga ng any petitions contrary to their settled conscientious feel ings l hewassure thenhouse would agree with him in think img that he had produced suffcient evidence to show that the wrhole of the complaints against ti measwre aroes solely from the workingpeople themselves he declared distinctly that he bad never been in communication with alny coal owner on the sulbject of the present proceedinig he wam himself a coal owner  but be could very sincerely assure the house that ke had no interest in the resalt of the preatnt proceeding  for th mines in which he wan concerned were let at a fixed rent payable to him by a company so it mattered nothing whether they realised large or mall pro fits with respect to the operation of the lbill itself he would lay confidently that its effect had been not only to throw women but men also out of employ msent n ot long since he had been waited on by a depu tation of women indeed he had repeatedly received deputta tionx who set forth the stale of extreme distress to which they were reduced by the opeamtios of the bill to take from the poor the means of employment and sumsiteance wasl to degrade them mutch mere thaln they could polsibly be low ered ini the scale of existence by permitting the former elate of things to contiisue to him nothing appeared more oh viowks and indisputable than this that the commissioners were men under the influence of very strong prejudice mand in fact the extracs from the reports would leave no doubt on the minds of any one that they had been tbetae into flagrant and palpable misrepresentation theoo andgallat genttleman then quoted largely from the report made by mir franks mr franks said in his re port s in the enumeration of the leading characteristics of the collier communmity it would be wreni to pass over the state of crime as it exists among them inch being generally considered as a tolerably good test of the condition anud cha racter of a people  but in truth as far as i have been en abled to judge of the character of the clatss tnder considera tion theyisar more distiongished byan absence of energy than byta civity of mind which excites to crime   and the prison returns of the year ending  which i hate in sarted below sustain my preconceived opinaion this consi dteration is i confess very gratifying to me for it is
