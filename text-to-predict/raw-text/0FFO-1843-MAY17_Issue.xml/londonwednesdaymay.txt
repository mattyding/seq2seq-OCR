regulates em ployment in mines and eollieries he brought the subject under the attention of the house in great detail and proposed that in scotland any unmarried woman above the age of  should be permitted to work under groundlord asuay the author of the act which mr c bbcuc sought to alter objected to his motion con tending that in scotland as well as in eugland the legislature ought to adhere to its original object of keeping the women exempt from this description of labour and leaving it wholly to men and boys the law was now working wel for the morality and happiness of the people and he entreated the house not to frustrate it the petitions which had been prevented to the legislature from women praying permission to work in mines and collieries were not voluntary those petitioners had been obliged to sign themmr huse supported the motion he would not yield to lord asuliy in his desire to make his fellowcreatares happy but he saw no objection against allowing women of mature age to accept labour at their own optionsir j graun while he desired to do the fullest justice to the motives of mr c bruce must resist his proposal experience was uniform in favour of the exemption of women you could not degrade the women without demoralizing and brutalizing the men the experiment of amelioration had hi therto been most successfalmr cubtbis said he would vote with lord asnr ley and added some sentences upon the corn laws the application of which was not clearly discerned by the houselord f egritton thought the movers speech proved too much for it really went to show

posing the motionmr eozbnuc admittea that legislation might be properly applied to the labour of children but he did think that adults whether men or women were better judges than parliament of the way in which their own labour should be employed his sympathies indeed were with the law that excluded women from underground work but he could not agree to legislate for the regulation of any labour ex cept of those who were not competent to exercise a discretion for themselveslord dngannon though not without hesitation resolved to give his vote in concurrence with lard ashlrymr p strwant in respect of the present distress in scotland which rendered this particular time a very inconvenient one for the closing of any channel of employment was content to vote for the intro duction of the

lockuirt supported the motion of mr c biwos and vindicated the motives of the scotch owners by wvhom the object was promotedmr einadlxv opposed the motion and contended that the house had a perfect right to legislate against any nuisance whether physical or moralmr alderman thormpox believed that in south wales great as was the present distress the men would endure ten times ai much rather than let their wives or daughters undertake this kind of employ ment it was in its own nature unfit for women and he would resist this motionmr c bruce xopliedae had no wish to inter fere witk the geaeral principle of lord asblmxs bill that the labour of women should evertually cease but he desired to mitigate the evil of too sudden a cessation the ground therefore on which ho put kis motion was not the doctrine advanced by mr roenuucu tbat it is unfit to legislate at all for regulating the labour of adultsthe house divided for the mnotion   against it    majority against it  sir c niprix then brbught under the considera tion of the house the subject of the naval lists he eulogized the character of our naval officers and their services both in war and in peace and complained that a znaval officer was not placed at the head of the admiralty lord st vrxcencr a distinguished admiral had held that sta tion and his administration had been worthy of all praise he should like to see a naval commander inchief at the head of the admiralty responsible for everything aud under him an admiral in each department acting under a warrant if ministers would not do that let them make a lord high aa miral in the person of prince aldert according to the precedent in qaieen ales time he analyzed the lists of persons eemployed in the dockyards and other civil departmnents of the naval service and complained that the proportion of naval men on each bore too small a proportion to the number of the civilians the true policy would be to re ward naval services by this kind of cvil appoint ment which would involve the additional advantage of saving the present pensions on the subject of a retired list he was much disappointed to learn that ministers were not prepared to do anything he recommended that captains who had reached  years of age and were within  from the top of the list should bo permitted to retire on an increase of pay that room might be made for younger and more active men otherwisa if a war should break out you would be placed in the alternative of employing men too old for their work or of putting their juniors over their heads there was not the same urgent necessity in the case of commanders but here also the maeasure would be both useful and just he believed that all which was necessary might be done for  a year which was no great sum upon a naval esti mate of  he moved an address to herataya praying that she would give directions for a list on which captains might retire with an in crease of paylord inegestn seconded the motion adverting to the evils of want of practice he recommen ded that all opportunitiem should be taken in time of peace for exercising our fleets in various evolutions he thanked the government for having restored the efficiency of our ships of war by filing up their complementssir r paxa could not agree that the first lord of the admiralty emould necessarily be a naval man although he fully admitted that a naval man might often be advantageously appointed to that offiee acknowledging as he did the justice of the praise bestowed by sir c n apit on the existing officers of our navy he could not think that system a very bad one which had produced a body of officers de serving such a panegyric as to the present proposal he hoped the house would enable him to resist it with success each of the departments of the state was always representing that the particular sum required for its ewn purposes was a trifle in the total of the estimates here however the expense of which he had a calculation made would be larger than sir c narixa seemed to have caloulated nor would it produee the advan tage he anticipated for the oldest captains on the list the men whose retirement it was an object to induce would be the most likely to held out knowing that the first brevet must give them their flag the only men likely to take the inerease of pay and retire were the younger officers whom it was desirable to retain a report had been made only a few years ago by sir g cocxnurxy sir c adkx and sir t haidy unani mously recommending it to the crown not to extend the principle of a retired listlord j russxu doubted whether the house of commons ought to address the crown at all for the purpose of directing the course of the executive government in such a matter as the conduct of the navy it was on that account that the late minis try when they desired to revise the naval and mili tary services had advised the crown to issue a com mission of its own on which the duke of wzvyqo tox had cousented to act for the purpose of fur nishing such practical advice as the executive go versment might safely adopt with respect to this particular proposalhe would leave it to the considera tion of the admiralty and the decision of the go vernment and hoped sir c napien would not press it to a divisioncaptain benxrxv concurred in this hope believ ing that the discussion would meanwhile have had a beneficial effectcaptzin phll clarged the admiralty with having paid more regard to services on the hustings than to services on the quarterdeck he gave credit to government for having now manned the navy but they had been in former days the first to un man itcaptain plumpjx complained of the slowness of naval promotionmr s hrreert vindicated the impartiality with which naval patronage had been distributed by the present first lord of the admiralty as to the civilians employed in the dockyards they were chiefly artisans sueh as masons carpenters and so on and consequently their places could not have been filled by seamen he referred to the testimony which sir c narrzn himself had last year borne to the integrity as well as ability ot lord had dingtois administrationsir c nariwi in reply
