tbe proceedings in that ecurt might happen to farnish abont the middle of november lest a csnte cause on for hearing before the master of the rolle which was not noticed by air knox and the editor of the morsing advriiser inquired the resson for its nonappear ance and was informed that as the case was iccemplete he mr knox had abstained from sending any report the editor of the aforsing advrtiser paidtat he should have been ennsulted on the subject while mr knox insisted that tho discretion to insert or eusoend the insertion ef the report was vested in himoelf tbe disptte between tho parties was fistlly referred to the committee of mnagement by whom the affairs of the paper which belongs to a very large bedy of proprietors are conduced mr knox was sum moned to appear before tbem but he aid no attention to the summons and wrs dismised from tbe establishment mr knoxupon his ditmissal addressed a ltter to ive gentlemen connected with the leading newspapers published in london stating the facts of the dispute and requesting their opinions which he afterwards printed and circulated very extensively one of the five individuols addressed by hlr knox was the plintiff who is one of the parliamentary reporters of the mforinq rherold and is also connected with the london jogroj oj commercc on the th of december  the mforniq adtetrtiser under the headinz  reporters of the press copied from the iteekly dipatch te following para graph we should not have alluded to a matter that has occupied and even at th x moment engager the ntteution of s several gentlemen connected with the press but for a party intimately connected with the affair having brought it before the world in a printed shape the document to which we allude wasforwarded to vts last week and is now lying before us and we believe the lords and commons reportere and those connected with the police and superior conrts have also been furnished with a copy of it what are the facts i it appears that a shorthandwriter connected with the mlorinto advertiser witbheld the first days proceedings in a law case intending when the business terminated to supply a full and faithful report of it the reporters right we be leve to this mode of transacting his employers butsiness was questioned by the ediltor who urged that the early pro ceedings ought to have been sent to him that he might deo terldine whether the publication should be deferred or not thereporter we understand questioned the right of deci sion to the editor sic and the consequence was the dis missal of the former by tho latter thus showing his complete authority subsequently the reporter wvroe to several gsen tlemen connected with the press including one on the tixes and another on the aforninq herald boh theee individuals sanction the practice of withholding an incomplete case and the tattr te of opinion that no gentlmarn can benceforth as sociate himslf with the morning advertiser the question now assumes this shapeare the reporters to ride roughshod over newspaper editors by determinitg what matter ought o be inserted or what ought tobe omittedl we fancy if pro prietors of newspapers were to compel tbe latter to give way in a matter so imrortant to their interests the club wonld attempt further usurpations and in a very short time the character of the j eurnals would be changed and destroy ed there must and there ought to be in every wellregu lated establishment an individual whose dvto is final and any attempt to disturb so wiolesome a regulation is fraughlt with danger as a matter of right and duty the editor of the iiforninq advertiser has exercised a discretion that undoubtedly belongs to hims and without which he would be  mere cipher to this extract from the columns of the disptck the editor of the advertises appended the fellewing commentary the last sentence ol which constituted the libel for which the action was brought  these remarks of our cotemporary induce us to revert to circumstances which had been dismissed frotu our notice ai a matter of interest to the press we are now induced to state the facts referred to as follow the reporter omitted all notice of the court confided to his charge and when ques tioned as to the cause first alleged that bshving got wet he was apprehensive of taking cold if he came to the office and next that the court was all day occupied with one case only upon whicb judgment baring been deferred he considered it unnecessary to give any report whatever of the court though neither of these excuses contd have been admitted a satisfactory yet to show more clearly the  neglect of duty reference was made to the other morning papers in which two cases were reported at soma length in one of which cases a previous order was discharged vith costs vida morning papers of saturday th november the reporter was then informed that the facts woult be reported to the proprietors hle subsequentlyreceired notice to attend a committee of tbe proprietors in reply to which he wrote a most insulting letter to the editor who was thus left no alternative but to leave the reporter to his own discretion rather indiscretion sic or to recommend his dismissal the latter being consi dered the preferable proceeding was accordingly ordered by the committee of management such are the facts the letters obtained from certain reporters on the timis herald c subsequently published bear their own commentary and as their writers are for the most part known to be sometbing worse than werthless they are safe from say redress that could be exacted from them either in a court of law or a court of honoarin both of which they are already bank ruptmr serjeant talfourd in the course of his address to the jury submitted that there was nothing in the last paragraph of the publication which pointed to the presnt defendant who might have been one of those excepted from the charge brought against the majority of the letterwriters the aricle stated that the writers of the letters were for the mos part known to be something worse than worthless evidentlyeshowing that the writer did not seek to fasten the charge upon alllsrd chief jnstic tindal summed up the evidence and tbe jury founds verdict for the defendantsthe remainder of the day was occupied with a case of grabam and otbers assignees v dariewhich was an issue under the interpleader act to try whether certain goods lately the property of a hankirupt were now the property of hissassignees or of an execution creditor it is almost a work of supererogation to add that the cose possessed not the slightest intereatfor any one but the parties concerned
