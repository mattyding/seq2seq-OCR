court of exchequer tuesday my wilk custujmiuue fraudsthre atrey ce v ccandrqjus js iv i rrzus jorcd baron rolfe and a specialjurythe trial of this information was resumed this morning at half pst  oolook when his lordabip having taken his seat scoompanied by lord gronville somerset who was also is attendance the whole of yesterday the following evidence was given bywilliam barnbyi held a situation in the cnstomahouse as landing waiter in  i cant recolleot tho date of my appointment i was put in the irish coastgnard and then went into the english coastguard in the year  or  i was appointed landing waiter ina london i knew homersbam well he was i landing waiter i met him at mr candys house in  the upper part of this bine book for jaly is my writing the heading i mean candy and co tbis enables tue to ay that it was in july i bad known mr candy some timo previously aud dined frequent ly with him my impression is that when i wrote this i was dining at candys with hunt and ho mersbam candy was present part of the time this and several other blueboaks were produced thin book was pro duced in the state in whioh it formerly was i am familiar with the use of the bluebook in the customs and i know it is not in the state in which it ought to be mr homersham prodnced thin bluekook he having on that or the day before made the examination of  two cases of mer chandise particalars unknown for mr candy i think they had been examined that morning but em not sure the original heading was in the hand of one of the regietolertki i dont inwtjit khva en rmj colel there ere beistalblank bluebooks prodaced simi lr to this this leaf the first was selected from one of the blank books i cant say whether candy wes theeatta moment but be was in and out of the rgoom he saw us taking oulr wills anud desired uas to bave  thoe beat port homerebam xelected this leaf from the blank baok and at tempted to trace the original heading at the window on to it he was in liquor and could not succeed ho spoil the leaf and seleeted another and asked me to trace it for him i did so anud this is mny writing sight charles candy and co d july two cae particulars unknown the entry  galleyquay    is in homer shams hantd according to the course of business that ought tobave been inhis hand as the examining offi cerazd the words i case p no  and case no  are also in his and ought to be so the origial leaf was then destroyed the quatn tities put down in thle substituted sheet were considerably leos than those desteribed in the original i never knew what the original quantities were hut i shiould think those substi tuted were not a fifth of what they ought to havebeen the leaf was then put into the hookr and the seal put on it the seal was made by a friend for me at homwershams request he brought me an impression of the real seal that wae some time before not for tbis particuflar occasion mr hunt and homnersham settled the almount of the tares together the first leaf of this bluebook is genuins the second not it is the august book it was altered in the satme way as the other it was done in mr candys drawingroom the clerks kee ding was not traced the first leaft was left be cause it was not necesawry the contents of the first eest there are correct as far as i know the two next leaves were substituted and the qauatities there recorded are defi cient and much leesa than those in the original leaf i cant say how much less but the sum of money paid for doing it leads me to say it was touchl lessat least onefifth i wont swear to the exict entry i dont knowr how much llomerham got but it was a great deala hatd ul of noteswhich hunt gave him i myself have got some money myself from candy between  and  it was considered a gifls at various times and i had also some loans i gave him an i  u for themcrossexamined by sir t wildse had known homer sham about  years i cant say how long i had got that seal maide before this transaction i got it engraved about two months before it was done by an engraver opposite to the senior united service club i dont know which  did not go myself it woe a friendas mr burnby i have not seen him for  months he was an artillery officer at woolwich i paid him but i dont knowr how mnuch i did not tell him the purpose as i did not knew ttbat was to be done i knew it was a customhouse seal i had of course aseen blueblooks and the impressions a thousand limes i could not minsgne what homer sham wanted it for and i asked him several times lhe alway s aia  ill tell yen some day and i never got any otber asnwer till i saw hima use it in candys drawing roami in july   dtd it because he naked mue to do so it was a were sccodent my frienad get it done for me he was promotea and was going to have a new card plate so i asked biun to get the seal esgraved far me a week or  days after he gaive it to me i did not know what hsmer sham wanted and never thought it was for a dishonest pur pse i paid about  i think for it i dont knaow wbers that seat is now hromersham is dead mr candy did not dine with us h iisbors and gig were at the door to take him out of town i might have beeni there three hour the alteration took place after dinner which wee at  oclock i went by mr hunts invitationa mr caudy came in both beoead alter too homersham produced the blank blue book it waa similar to those now in coulrt they wore al ways delivered out sinely as far as i have seen i am not sure whether i wenat there with hemerbahmi er whethier he came in while i was dining with hueat i think the first thig due ashunt asiking him whether he had brought thebook hmersham hesitated and hunit saidnev mind bumnby he is all riglit homerebam then proceeded to take the leif rut a greal deal of conversation passed upon that tubjet and about bow mauck they should save hut i cant reecliect what it was the seal was melted she string untied and lbs leaf takent out by homershatm they told me what they were going to do bii i cant say what i sad of course there wa al cauttion given to me not to give information but no thing about what i was to have i made no remonstrance or obseration thalt can recollect the leave were thirowin into the fire homershamn hxd a bundlle of banknates on each occasion there was a regular thinig in thalthouseit was half what was saved to mr candy andi the other half to honmershmnandhiant there was no calculatiouemade that i can recollect if gotm nothing on that eccasien hut i bad received money from lr candy before for other goods done by homerabalm that motst have been between thle first anld second occasion i moan by  beorael before the seconid meeting i thisk it was to the best of my recellectien be tween the two the payments were in banknotes hat i never kept any acouant and caunnot give the numbers or names of any one to whose i paid them or any of them i cannot say whena i first received any money from mr candy i have given an account to seome ether persons i gave them about the dates i cant give them to you for i have not the cmoantano about me it wae a few days ago huti at henowgie thkedantes witheut the memorandumi itis a oe saw it about a week or ten days ago i think the first was  but am not sure i cant say without referriog to the memorandum i did not know i should be asked the exact datee and sums i knew i got  on one occasion  it was ink nots but i cant say the amount i perhaps made the memorandum a few days after such gifts my object was merely to see what  received i have not seen it elton when i was examined about this i referred to it i think the amount was nearly  when be gave me the first sum bhe sasd  you are ertitded to es much i said very well and took it he said  you remain quiet till you get a  silk floor and i will make you your l w and  the first year i did not read the leaves that were taken out i cant say how homersbam had possessed himself of those customhence books i received money several times from candy  gave the i  u in his office it was for isg mr candy had never turued me one of his house or desired me to turn out upon my oath i never went to him to propose to get goods and he never turned me out but we had had words ho had bees doing busiuess with homersham to a great extent and i said ii certainly am entitled to sumas share we had high wrords about that he said it is no such thing  i have not doen a casewith him for some mouthis i was satisfied that he had and insisted on it he did net call me a scoundrel but he migh have used hard words  dined with him afterward het did not turn ma out by the collar after showing maehis books forwalked out i dont know how choses he followd i have no idea how long before july it was that this transec tion occurred i dont know that it was before or after i have said i never received anything for those affairs for i did not wish to criminate myself i was examined before ho mershams dleath about my knowledge of smnugrling transac tions  think i mentionedthesee cases betfore his death i think i did to mfr westont and the survetyorgeneral i have been examined by the beard and never mentioned these for  was net asked about thema but i think  told weston about these booksi before homtertshamiis death there was a great deal of information given by me i was examined before him to give all the information i knew of about smuggling transactions i dont know whether i told of these to mr weston or to another gentleman i have been examined so often that i cant say when i was examined by mr wes ton i wore  had disclobed all i knew but i cant say whe ther i told of these or no  never got any mnoney from liomerasham for a share of these transactionsa i have lent him money and ha paid me out of a check by candy for   cant tell the date but it was in   had it in may hand  it was cashed in my presecec at mastermnans and i got my money i had lent him it was  which l had lent him some time before i have done some good deall of

given thera there is yet a degree of mstery about them which is inexplicable there is moreover it deficiency in the rest of the cae which be it rensemberac is not one between a and it bat one between the crowos andsa subject who is accused of serious offence against the law rore is the attorney gesxrat for the crown whoset whole duty ought to be the elucidation of she truth whose object ought to he justioe alone hie ougha in the pursuit of that object to lay before the jury every tittll of evidence within his reach  yet he abstains front provingrmassy faet relative to these hooks which he an

if the alteration was made before the books were returnecl how was it that it was no discovered i all the elerkes now say it is quite palpablenawnd yet no one seems to have su pected it when the bo s wre in use taccording to the o dinsry course of the office the absence of proof oat this point is surprising and so are the princriples whirls thle attorneygeneral laid downt in his address to the jury it was then stated thalt the defendant had committed an ir rogulasity which would be called in aid to convict himn if hto did not explain the charge agains him that irregularity turns cut to be one qtilte in anicon withl the practice of thu customs for alt their officers admitted that it was every days practice for merehauts to take goods out withouit paying ar once the daties theresa this was proved and yet the at torneyganeral called it an irregularity for which he has the power of scatchingz a verdict and penalties against the defendant if he doese nct anrswer fully another and different charge which is founded on air baubuys testistosy the customs have themselve adopted this course of irregia larity and now they turn raind and seek to make as ins proper a use of it as has been stluded to by the attorneygenra is not that a flimsy veil wherewith to coaiceat the weakness of the real case i is not that gnch ans attempt to catch penalties as was never before made against a merchantli sulch conduct was surprising  nor was it lets o to hear the attorneygenerml say that the defendanat w bound to disprove his guilt waa t here ever so gross a direlictien of all the best principles of britis law l and in such a case is tho defendant to he called en to disprove guilt attached to him by ouch a miscreant as burmby i the attorneygeneral has both prosecuted and defended in his timne ats all eoosiel of eminence have done i ask him to place himself in my situation anid to act am he woulld then i ask him to refraizn from such a coerse as that he hax propounded and i call upon him to desist from seeking for an answer to suspicions engendered solely by the oath of sucht a maaa so burubsy it can ot however be denied that there has been gross and eeanddatus neglect of duty and precaution by those to whom the affairs of the castoms have been isitruated it is admitted ona alt hands  hut is that any reason why the character of men hitherto respected should be assailed by suchecharges as these i do the commissiosaers expect to yin dioate thomselves for their past negligence by a newhorsn zeal and activity whioh is displayea in digging up every mis creant who may trump up isuch charges and bringing themi into court i bad they discharged their duty three years ago mn a proper and efficient manuersuch a degradig exhibitiorn as this of today ovould have been averted here however the case it and it most he dealt withl aceordingly whatare th at setting aside for a moment the evidence of buuyw ere it is asked is the testimony by which the de fendant issoit to be implicatedl there is nothing sub s nti nwich to fix by way of anxwer the books are raid to hare been altered with the defendanits connitance and for his benefit  but where la the proof or even the svi dence of the time when that alterationk took place i if the alterations had been made on the day of the esatry thougth the aclm ih escape attention in the hurry of business how mcameigtbt that forged stamps were not deterted i it may be answered  oh they were not examined in the hurry of business if so then i will ask why were they put on at all if they are not to be examlined l what are they for if not to test the legality of the leaves yet they escape detectiont in the ofrice and what is more extraordinary still it appears that all the leaves en which the case tuirnsi actually hear the signatore of anothier officer who must have had the very page unuder his eye when he signed his name aud when the fraud was complete and yet he is not called to say how the book were when he saw them on that ocoselon this is most singular it may however he all true  these books may have been altered ausd they may he irregular but whsy is the defendant to be called upon now at the lapse of three yearn t expiain mand account for that alteration ansi that irrguliarity when the bookz hare bcen always under the con trol and custody of the commxissioners or their servants and these connected with them at that time are net all called to ive that acoountt which they ought to he able to supply to the juryl it may ho that theo whole customhvuse ia aa nest of thieves  but what haa the defendant to do with that setting aside always for the present mr beirubyis evidence i no allusion is now made to that wretch gasping for breati under the pressure of an old batiley indictment for perjury whibh hs been removed by the crown to gain tune no at lusion is made to him hut takinog the case wvithout him whty abotild the importer now be called upon to explain an appk rent irreglilarty in the cuetomnaomfce which wea notde tected by the clerks in  i it is very hard that he eshuld be expected to do so and yet the attorneygenerml would rest his case upoia th e absence of such an explanation why mdr knox a man of most irreproachable character the our veyor of landlugwatters himself raw these books and tha ceses on the day after or the very day on which the false entry bears date lhe saw them together and took the tares so as to calculate the gross and net contents of the canes and he approves of the entries for hlis aignalureiso on tho very pages which are charged withl having been alteredi with snobl a case it is that the defendant is caled on t grapplead in or der to eke it out the crown hab calsthe merchnts to gives their opinion as to the capacity of such casesmen who dealing in english goods alone are not ceniversant with french silks and little wiling perhapei to falvour a merchant whio deals isrgety astdexclusivelyin frenche silks surely there must be same honest foreignt traders in this city who might be called to ahow what the probability was that these oases would contain oaly just what the entrise gave l surely it may safely be asserted that but for the evi dence of that wretch buruy the cawe has signaly failenagalst mr candy  withoult that man there is nothing at il to answer alnd as to him the defendant will cer tainly adduce evidence of a chasracter wholly conclusive and irreconcilable with his credibility it wil be remera bared that he swore to mr candys having been pre sent in july when the first bockvwlas uteed now it will be proved that air candy was in france at that yery times i will show that he went abroad as usual to select his wareo at the end of june and that he did noo retuirn till the end of july i wil show that fact by his servant who secenk penied hiss and kept in a book the accoant of his expentli tolre on that journey this book shall be produced and i will further give in evidence the letters of the
