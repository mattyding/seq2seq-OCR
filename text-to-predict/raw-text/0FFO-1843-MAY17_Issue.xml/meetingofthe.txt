that thisoonference hailed with the fullest satisfaction the pro gress which free trade principles were making in the publictind as evincd by the strong manifestation of opinion made by the eletors in every part of the kingdom particularly in lhe agicucral districts and whiclh wa conlirmed by the in creased nubrs wbo voted in the minority on the division thte preceding night upon mr viliers motionmr croos seconded the motion which was unanimously adoptedthe names of the members who voted in the minority were then reed amid the cheers of the meetingur villues then addressed thb conferene ho said the ivision of the previous night wes a strong encourage mnet for them to persovere the interruption which the discussion had met with in tho houst of commons from the opponents of free trade fally indicated the importance of aegitating the subject hear hear he thoughtt there never was a time when discussion upon these laws was more imperatleely called for hlear hear the advocates of rmonopoly had adopted a very ingenious hut at the same time most mischievons jambiling together of tbingshe prosperity of the farmer and the support of the landed interesten the subjecs of a repeal of the corn laws hear hear  but after the speech of the ton member for stockpors and the numerous meetings that had been held it the agricultural districts he thought it would have bean curious if tbe monopolists had offered any argu menas of this kind in isupport of their position  hear and laughter the law had been maintained by a fraud upon the fermer and by heartleas falsehood to the labourer hear the monopolists bad hitherto pleaded the interest of those claser hut the farmers had given them the lie cbeers  while the deplorable state of the population and the dreadful misery existing in the agriculturil districts fully answered the stupid and imbecile position taken by the mo nopolistsbat the less food there we the more the labourer had of it ihear bear one result of the late ditcussion was that the questionwas now strippadofautloe extraneous matlers with which it had been mystified it was at length admitte by their opponents that the struggle was between a class and the community lear a cabinet minister had admitted that tke corn laws were maintained for the purpose of supporting the interests of a particnlar class ber hear and some minor gentlemeu in the house who could not with all their caution prevent the secret from slipping out said the fact was they wanted to maintain the landed interest dominant in this country hear hear in proof of this fact be muight mention the speech of an hen member who recentlydined with his constituents at shrewtbnery and told themhedid not care for a sliding scale or a fixed duty or wbether it was so msny shillings more er so many shillings less but what he tvanted was to keep the landed interest up permoet hear hear ile thought that the increased number in favour of a total repeal of the corn laws was chiefly owing te the exertions of the anticorn law league the coarse taken by that body must he persevered in and there was no reason why hon members who did not vote with him en the previous night might not swell their minority en the next division if they could not so far change opinion as to briog it to bear on the present house of commons there was still an ulterior course that they might pursue but submit any longer to the mischief the insisr the degradation of these laws he did not think the people of thie country wenld cheersmr cobnor observed ttat leoking to the absence of msny irish members who if ia this counnrv would have voted with them the number in favourof mrvilliers had inereased  inco last session the farmers bsd been humbugged for  years they had been told and balieved thst the legis lature cauld secure them s per qnurter for their oorn but they now had the avowal of sir r peel himeelf that be coald not guarantee that prices shoul nat fall to s per quarter an other cabinet minister had stated that the corn laws were neretsary to eeable the landlords to pay their morteazs now he would say if that were written on every vii sge churchdoor in the kingdom there was an end to corn laws forhimselfso losgas his healthandstrength oermitted he should be most bappy to go into the agricultural districts and fraternise with the famers and farm labourers and show them that all had one common interest is this question if the memoers of the league did their duty in their several localities in regiaterinz their friends aselecters and members of their own body they might have a
