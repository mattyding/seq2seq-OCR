discrepancy between thei testimnony or by any internal improbability as to the matters they deposed to the noble end learned lord then proceeded to state generally the substance of the evidence adduced which has already appeared in detail in the times it appeared that the marquis of townshend then lord cleartley solemnized a marriage on the h of msy  with miss gardner a lady entitled to considerable fortune the daughter of mr and mrs duenn gardner the parties lived together bult for a very short time a coldness almost immediately arose and they occupied different rooms and ia two or three weekis they lived in different houses about a yearafterwards inlmay t lady chartley withdrew from the residence in gloceaterplace which she occupied with the knowledge of her husband and went to reside in lower grewenorxtreet where her father and mothaer lived takiog weith her the furmitare without hejr husbands privity end con sent and there was good evidence to show that these t wo par ties never afterwards had any commutlirlion wvith each other on after this a suit was instituited in  by lady chartyfor the purpose of disaqlving the marriage on the ground of impotency exhibiting a libel to this effect by oatt to thisl libel an answer was given is which lord ckariley tbought fit to dejay the allegation  but baforo the isse was tdd it appuared that lady chartley formed an attachmeut which enel in a criminal cennoexioao with a testlomnan of the name of msrgetts she was thou living wlth her father antd shetber but it appeared that some objection was uaken on their patrt to thet connaxion and lady chart loy and mr margetts went frees the houase together and afterwards returned  but they had previously gene to live togethei for the greater part of the year near finobley and she very seen after became pregnant lady chartley con tinued living with mdr margetts theare as manx and wife and the parties to whom the house where they lodged belonged treated them asi man and wife and it was only after some tinge that they found oult that the lady was lady cias tley sbe appeared to live moot affectionatey witk mlr margetis and was there delivered of a male eblid which afterwards died they went away fromk that house in july  air wargetta accompanying the lady in a carriage and during the whole of the time they were living at finobley the laind lady of the house never saw lord chartley there it appeared that alr psiargetts and lady chartley subsequently went to the house of the ladys father and there four covers were laid on the dinnertabletwo for lr and mrs duna gardner and two for air and mrs margettsfor lady chartley then went by the name of margetta a name which she prisod highly disregarding and despising that of her husbard she never allowed het self to be callefd by any other name than mrs margetts objecting to be called lady leiceeter or lady chantley observing that she did siot desirto be called by tht odious or disgustin name the scruples therefore of mlr and mrs dann garaner to this connexien were by this time ctot over whether by the performance of a mnarrige ceremony or not their lordshtps were left to con jeottre  but this was proved by one witness an elderly lsdy that airs margetts said she wished to have the marriage ceremony performed ino england and their lordships had therefore only to cornjectutre whether or niot it had been per formed in any other place this lady performned the sem blance of the marriage ceremony end mir and binx margetts repeated the responees in the month of july  mirs idargettai as she was calledi becalme pregnant while living ini her fathees house where she was proved to have the same bed with mr mlargetis and she made an observation to the maid servant about her increased siz conveying the hndpreeionl that she was advaurioc iu pregnancy and shei shortly afterwards removed to no  hunterstreet and she continued to live in that street until r mergettss death thus that mr margetia antd this lady lived together for a number of years as man and wife end that their son john and othier children were called by the name of mlargetts were indisputable the con j ohnl was sent to westnainstersobool inl  was entered as john blsirgetts in the book snd con tinued to be called so until  he was then taken away and a change was made in his name all the children five in sneknher of mr andi mrs margetta being sent to a churchlon inca metreposte to t naptized they were not baptizd in t the name of margetts but were celled lord john townshend lord william townshend and so on the son john was sent back to westmineterschool after the ceremony and was then called lord john townshend and continued to be so called and here in the coarse of the evidence occarred a carious circumstance unex pectedly he believed to all parties from the circumastance of the usher at wesminsterschool who deposed to these facts being a gentleman from the county of huntingdon and welt acquainted witht the margetts family this gentleman was asked whether any resemblance could be traced between the son john and mr margettz and he said that there wasal striking likenes between them insomuch that he could have picked the boy john out as a margetti out of soo this john margetts subsequently assumed the title of lord leiceter when entered at the london university and st the general

on docutmentary evi dence and on the knowledge of a great miany persons he thought that any one who stuldied the details of the evidence must feel atisnaed that the interference of the legislature in this extraordinary manner was not necessary to secure jas tice between the parties the very fact which his noble and learned friend had concluded by staling would in itself make it difficult for any

caee of peerage l he thought they should be cautious in enterlaining stich hills for they might be interfering with the prerogative of the crown this kotse had no original jurisdiction in such cases
