franceparis ily sm bullet senator and expremier was yester day almost unanimously elected by the academy of moral and political sciences as the successor of count daruthose present yesterday in the chamber of deputies when a question by m boissy danglas on the affairs of dahomey wvas discussed witnessed a scene often repeated in a french legislative body when it is carried away by a sentiment of patriotic enthusiasm and deaf to every attempt at calm and thoughtful discussion all who sought to introduce judicious and well considered remarks were overwhelmed with pro testations the same thing occurred once immediately after the death of captain biviere when it was proposed to pass a resolution with regard to tonquin and one result of such sittings is that when later on the consequences are discussed it is impossible owing to the absence of regular and wellreasoned debates to lay the blame for the resolutions arrived at upon any one in particulari do not mean by this to discuss or criticize the measures which the government will take as regards dahomey in the first place no one knows what they will be and the information is lacking which it would be necessary to have in order to judge them exactly what i would dwell upon is the strange confusion which exists here when any attempt is made to define this familiar but much misunderstood wordpatriotism to many persons patriotism even when sincer is synony mous with national selfishness they juistake for patrioticenthusiasm wvhat is merely the passion of selflove or even of pridein yesterdays sitting evidence appears of this confusion in the minds of almost all the speakers it is not the case that patriotism cormnands lrance not to rest satisfied with a lasty chastise ment of the petty negro king who has dared to attack her on the african coast how conld it doso it was in the midst of similar angry and un reasoning demonstrations that the question of tonquin was first discussed while the chamber was in a state of excitement it compelled i jules ferry to enter on the expedition and when later it was found that the climate the soil the difficult communications the esaspera tion of the native population and intrigues from abroad rendered the expedition which had been so lightly entered on one of thu heaviest enter prises ever undertaken by modern france then thoso who unconsciously drew m jules ferry into it wvere the first to attack him and to accuse him almost of treason for not having resisted the excitement which they themselves had causedmi aristide boyer raised a debate yesterday on the measures taken on may day m constans made a vigorous reply containing the same ideas as those he enunciated in his conversation with me of the th of april ee said there are twvo ways of anticipating a day such as that in question the first consists in taking only those measures sufficient to permit if that is necessary of the reestablishment of order by violenco and often with the help of bloodshed the second consists on the contrary in the dis couragement of the fomenters of disorder by a great display qtforce but in tlhe latter caseo one is sure to

violent means i say the govern ment for when i speaak of myself it is to facili tats discussion but it is certain that the oqinion of themembers of the government was unamouson the point   there is one town in france which did not follow the instructions i gave in that town the municipal magistrate thought his actian alone would bo susiciently efiicacious ile thought the good sense of his fellow citizens would suffice to secure good order and he thought that he could answerfortranquillity on the ground alone that he had the promise of support from those he redresented he lost no time in granting them the citv theatre for a public meeting he said that nothing was finer than those dremonstrations which were made peacefully in the streets thus asserting the autbority of a great people conscious of its power in fact the demonstration was begun quietly but it wound up by an attaeck on the police commissaries which made it necessary for the troops to inter fere in a more serious way than they had done clseivhere however no one took advantage of this fact becauso doubtless the persons wounded vere on the side of the government  for in this ountry those citizens intrusted with the main tenance of public order are precisely the only ones in whom certain parties talke no interesta vote of confidence was voted in one division by  to s and in a second by  to  the minority comprised
