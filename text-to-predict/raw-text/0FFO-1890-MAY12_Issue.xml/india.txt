indiacalcutra may i mentioned a fortnight ago that the collector of incometax in calcutta had called upon the agents to make a return of profits on goods con signed to them for sale by persons residing out side india and that the chamber of commerce hadrequested the government to direct the with drawal of the order the government has replied that the purport of its former letter on the sub ject has been misapprehended that there is no intention of reconsidering tho question at present that the local authcrities have teen instructed to cause the profits on such consignments to be assessed and that it proposes to deferfurther con sideration of the matter should such be found necessary pending tho receipt of reports on tho operation of the orderthis decision has caused great discontent and a meeting of representatives of several public associations was held at the chamber of commerce on riday at which it was resolved to ask the government to suspend action pending the receipt of memorials to the viceroy which are now in course of preparation the tone of the collectors circular excites much comment especially that portion which directs tho agents if unable to estimate the profits to furnish a return of the gross proceeds of the consignments in order that the collector may himself estimate what percent age is to be treated as profit the result is likely to be a renewal of the agitation against the incometax as a wvhole on the ground that the reasons by which its reimposition was justified in  have disappeared and that its operation has beome most inquisitorial and oppressive if sach an agitation is started all classes and races will join for there can be no doubt of the general unpopularity of the taxa most extraordinary decumenu has been going the round of the indian press lately st is a circular letter signed by the ron mr moore and three other senior members of the bombay civil service and is addressed to all bombay civilians of over ten years standing although only pub lished within the last few days it was issued months ago while lord reays guarantee to the corrupt mamlutdars wvas under the consideration of the supreme government it invites each civilian to address to the secretary of state a separate memorial supporting lord reays actionsuch an attempt to induce the civil service to combine in opposition to the supreme authority is unprecedented and in direct contravention of the orders against combinations by government ser vants it sets an example to the civil service of abandoning an attitude of neutrality and of inter fering in politics and it aids the native political associations which have been trying to force the seeretary of state and the viceroy to reverse orders passed after full consideration it is hardly conceivable that lord reay could have sanctioned this illjudged attempt to support him but it is a strange fact that shortly before his departure he appointed ifr mcore a member of the council over the heads of seniors and also promoted the three other gentlemen who signed the circularthe times of idwia commenting on sir j gorsts remark in the house of commons that lord reays farewvell speech must have been mis reported says there can be no question of the accuracy of the report as the speeeh being im portant happened to be a written one and lord preay emphatically repeated what he had delibe rately writtennamely that he tendered his resignation when he conceived the action of the viceroy and tho secretary of state to be a breacl of the queens proclamationthe petition of the mahomedan patriotic association against the introduction of elective institutions now numbers over  signatures from all parts of upper india a document attached to the list of signatures received by the association from battalah in the punjab throws a curious light upon the methods employed by the congress wirepullers to get the ignorant classes to sign the counter petitions which they are pre paring it runs thuswe the undersigned inhabitants of battalah who signed this petition have also signed a peti tion brought round by swaami ala eam which was stated to contain a request that tho government should exempt us from taxes especially those on cattle swami ala ram and his coadjutors told us that the object of the petition was the remis sion of taxes wve are all quite opposed to the proposals of the national congress and very gladly sign this petitionhops a native paper published in calcutta referring to the meetings and petitions of the agitators says that if honesty or the good opinion of the public were among the requirements of the agitation its conductors would not dare to pass in broad daylight as the firm conviction of a people what is transparently the manufactured opinion of a few ringleaders it adds that it shudders to think of the way in which the elec tive system would be manipulated by such hands as theirs so expert in making
