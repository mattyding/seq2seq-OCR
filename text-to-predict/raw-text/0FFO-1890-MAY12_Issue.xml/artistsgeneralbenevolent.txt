toasts had been duly honouredthe cnainsran rose and saidi have now the pleasure of proposing the teastof the evening pro sperity to the artists general benevolent institu tion ihe profession of an artist has always had great and enduring attractions its highest prizes afford a fitting reward for even inordinate ambition while the more modest expectations of happiness which are indulged in by ordinary mortals are amply satisfied by that average success which finds a competence in the prosecution of the most enthralling and most inspiring of professions cheers at the royal academy the other night i heard mr morley claim a preference for the sister art of literature of which he is in himself a most distinguished master cheers he said that it was the happiest of callings but i think his claim has been contested by another dis tingaished literary man no longer with usthe late mr william tbackeray who always showed the greatest sympathy with art and artists who is said at the very height of his established reputation to have regretted that it had not been his luck to wield the brush instead of the pen and he has left it on record that there can be no higher pleasure in life than the struggle with difficulty and the triumphant victory of a great and a successful artist cheers but gentle men tonight i have to bring before you the other side of the medal and i have to ask your kindly sympathy and generous support for those who tempted by the possibilities of this noble profession sink by the wayside or are trodden down in the rush of eager competition before they have attained to the goal of their aspirations cheers  think that there is no urofessien in which misfortune is more frequent or more inevitable than in that of the artist in all other trades and occupations perseverance and industry by themselves are almost sufficient guarantees at least for the means of subsistence  but in the case of the artit the greatest perseverance and the greatest industry will be thrown away if the public do not happen to appreciate the merit and the value of the work which ile produces and unfortmately the public that master of all of us has not always an absolutely infallible standard of taste laughter and cheersand even when it arrives more or less accidentally at the correct con clusion its judgment like old port takes a long while to mature laughter every one knows of the cases of artists whose merit is now universally recognized aud the possession of whose works is hotly disputed by amateurs who yet during their lifetime were relegated to obscurity and neglect and poverty thea there are other cases in which though the judgment of the public may have been favourable even during a mans lifetime still its estimate of the value of his works has been altogether disproportionate to that at which it has arrived after the man himself has passed to the great majority and when no longer he can profit by the increase of his fame and repatation cheers i remember sozme time ago being with a dealer who showed me a picture by david cox which he had sold that morning for g gnineasand he said  there is a curious history connected with that picture i bought it from the easel af david coz and i paid him � for it a few davs afterwards the old man came to me and he said  you are young and you have a wife and cbild  and i think i charged you too much for that picture and i have brought you back   loud cheers so that actnally in the space of a generation a picture which the artist himself hadthought overpaid at the price of � was sold by the same dealer for nearly fifty times that amount under those circumstances it is easy to cee how in the case of artists misfortune may come and failure may result where there is no blame for their failure and where there is no deficiency of merit of course there are also many other causes of suffering there is disease and accident loss of sight and failure of strength and evon death itself which may come before a man has had time to provide against such a calamity for himself and for his ciiildren but there is also that largei am afraid perhaps it is the largestcategory of cases in which men find that the ability with which providence has gifted them is not equal to their good intentionsand gentlemen these are not the least deserving amongst the objects of yorr sympathy since to the bitterness of poverty comes to themn the pain and grief of having failed to reach the high ideal which they dave set for themelves cheers wecll it is to meet all theso varying cases that this institution has bceen established and i venture to think that its object at any rate is worthy of universal support worthy not mercly of the support of artists who have been sucesstul but worthy also of the support of all who are interested in art although we may not be particularly gifted although many of us mav be unable to appreciate as they deserve the masterpieces which are brought before us yet at least we all recognize the value and the importance of art in our national life and the charm and the variety which it lends to what would otherwise be thn dull monotony of human existence cheers we are all of us in whatever position we find ourselves debtors to art and it behoves us in some degree at least to repay oar obligations to its professors and i do not believe that your benefactions for this object can pass through a better channel than that institution for which i have the honour to plead that institution administers the funds which are committed to its eharg with special and personal knowledge of the cases which it seeks to relieve the general institution and tho orphan fund which is an offshoot from the parent association are both conducted wvith an economy which having some knowledge of cbaritable iustitu tious i venture to say is remarkable yon may he assured that almost the entirety of what you may be pleased to give will go directly to succour those whom you desire to relieve and that it will not be frittered away as is the case in so moany other insti tutions in expensive buildings and in elaborate managemoent cheers the reports of the institution bear eloquent witness both to the care and the discri mnination of the committee and also to the urgent and pathetic necessity of the cases which come before them i have no hesitation in commending the association to your generous support i have read recently in a leading article of a leading newspaper that the english people are congenitally blind and ineurablystupid on the side of art tne judgment is harsh but i am not certain that it is altogether undeserved laughter so far as our taste is concerned but i hope and believe that our feelings at least are not blunted to the claims of those who have really fallen in our service since they have endeavonred to maintain and keep alive one of the most important elements of ntional greatuess and national glory loud cheersthe toast having been drunkthe chicua again rose to propose the toast of  the royal academy he saidi have the pleasure of presenting to you the toast of  the boyal academy and i am glad to think that in this assembly which is no doubt chiefly composed of brother artists the toast will be cordially received j think we may extend cur sympathy and even our compassion to the members at that honourable body uon wrhomn is nnnuly throwns the tremendous task of encting the representatives of british art at the exhibitionthe great eshibitionof the year cheers and laughter we know that the judgnsent of paris involved unleardof miseries for his family and his countrymen and yet paris was a man whose taste has never been smspected langhter and cheers and who had on the occasion to which i refer only a limited choice to make laughter in a charming assortment of three meritorious models but wbat must be the risk and the anxiety of those more fallible mortals who have to select from i believe  examples of modem art  cheers gentlemen i think on the whole although their decision must give some pain andmuch diseppointment that its justice will be generally upheld and at any rate if any affirma tion is wanted oftheir authority i think we have had it lately in certain exhibitions of rejected pictures with which no doubt you are familiar laughter but although the academy is best known to us in con nexioa with these hereulean libours it has also otherclasims on our respect and gratitude it is i believeimbue in enrope as the only great school ef art and institution of the kind which has been brought to its present position by pirivate and individual effort with dut any aid or assistance from the state cheers  shall have to connect with this toast the name of an artist who has an european repntstionmr j croraley cheers i hope i may venture to say to hithat i hope the academy may tale some prominent part in carrying out the suggestion which was made the president on a tecent oecasion when he urged the establishment of a national collection of modern british art cheers the possibilities of such a collection have been shown to us by the manchester exhibition and i am quite certain that if it could be brought to a successful conclusion it would be a trimpnhant vindication of the place of the british school in the history of art loud cheersbr j c honsley responded to the toastmr maus stox proposed  the health of the cyhairmanmr cmuimuplarr in responding saidi sm very much obliged to you for the manner in which this toast has been proposed and for the reception whiech you have given to it i cannot help thin king that th chairman is at a certain disadvantage in a gathering like this and that you may begin to think that his voice is almost too familiar to you  no no when i was at the dinner of the royal academy the other night i had the bonour of sttting beside a very distinguished sinter who amonz other thin  told me tls t in hise experience the fault of political orators like myselfon such occasions was that they attempted in some vway or nother to connect themselves directly with the object of the gathering and he said that this was a strained interpretation wfhich led to the worst pos sible results entlemen i shall dot fall into this error i have as elr stone hns already srggested to son no pretension to be an artist if i had to paint his portrait i think i should do it as the irishman did in the story and paint him standing behind a tree laiughter but i frankly admit to you that i have not even the pretension to a wzork of genius of that kind i am not a painter i am not a senlptor i am not even an amateur photographer laughter i am afraid that my opponents would not allow mue even the credit of being an artist in politics  although i will undertake to say if i may judge from the violence of their opposition that they would be glad to give me a good place upon the line langhter of conrse upon the necessary condition that i was hung great lanhter no gentlemen i do not claim directly or indirectly to belong to your great and noble fraternity i claim conly to be present as a friend and i say for myself that i owe so much pleasure to british art and to such association as ihave been permitted to have with british artists that i am only too glad to have been permitted even in the most humble capacity to have contributed to the sue cess of any object in which they are iuterested loud cheersd ering the evenigo the treasurer annmoued subscrip tions and donations to the amount of � which included the sum of  guneas from the chairman
