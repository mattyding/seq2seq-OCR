inter celpt the monev the question was whether the trustee bad intervened in time or whether it was too late it was admitted that the doctrine as to the time of the intervention of the trustee applied to an assign raent of money and the qaestion was whether there was any distinction in principle between an assign ment of money and any other assignment of property acquired by tbs bankrupt after the commencement of the bankrnpcy all property belonging to the bank rudt at the commencement of the bankruptcybelonged to ana vested in the trustee but property acquired by the bankmpt after the commencement of the bank ruptcy did not vest in the trustee until the trustee intervened to claim it hle the master of the rolls could see no distinction between the case of money and the case of other property acquired by the bank rupt during the bankruptcy ele was prepared to lay dowrn this preposition which hsd been put intoritin by lord justice lopes and agreed to by all of thwn until thae trustee intervened all trans actions by a bankrupt after his bankruptcy with any person dealing with him bond dc and for value with respect to his after acquired property whether with or without knowledge of the bankruptcy were valid agaist the trustee it vwould be seen that the vords bosd fe applied solely to the person dealing with the bankrupt the bona ides of the bankrupt with respect to r creditors being immaterial tehere was no case inconsistent with that proposition  herbert v sayer   qb  and ieb parte dewburst  lr  ch app  did not lay down so wide a proposition but the proposition

an appeal from a decision of mr justice kelkewich reported in the times of march   the present action was brought against mir copestalke and mr beddall to set aside a judgment delivered by the late vicechsncellor hall in an action between the same parties on the th of july  end a judgment of the court of a ppeal affirming the judgment of the court below on the ground that the udgment of the vicechancellor was obtained by the fraud of the defendants the orginal action was brought upon an agreement of the d of april  made between the plaintiff and mr beddsll relatingto the sale of a ewspaper called the hour and the plaintiffs case was that mr beddall was tbe agent and nominee of mr copestake at the conclusion of the plaintiffs case counsel for mr copestake submitted that there was no case against him and vicechancellor hlall thereupon dismissed tbe action as against the drefendant copestake and directed certain inquiries and accounts against the other defendant and his judgment was affirmed by the court of appeal the ground on which the plaintiff based his present action was that the court had been deceived by statemlents contained in the defence and repeated by counsel at the trial to the effect that the deendat beddall was not the agent of the defendant copestake and that the latter had no interest in the agreement whieh rtatements the plamntiff alleged were false to the know ledge of the defendants mr justice eekewich held that no case bed been muade out against either of the defenoants the plaintiff appealed against this deelsionmr oswald and mr pochin were for the plaintiff  mr warmington qc and mr levett and mr tindal atkinson for the several defendantsthe courv without celling upon eounsel for the defendants dismissed the appeallond jusroice cotton said that this was an action to set aside a judgment of vicechancellor hall delivered in  tris action was commenced  years afterwards the action before vicechancelor hall was in substance for a declaration that mir beddall who signed an agreement nurporting on the face of it to be made between the plaintiff and himself entered into the agreement as agent for mr copestake and that the latter was the real person liable on that agreement vicechaneellor hall decided against the plaintiff and on his own evidence dismissed the action what was the ground of the judgment of the vicechanceilor  without hearing the defendants case in that action the vicechancellor held that the plaintiff had failed to discharge the burden which lay n hibm to prove that mr beddall signed as agent for and on behalf of mr copestake the object of theesent action was to set aside that judgment as hving becn obtained by the fraud of the defendants but was that so  judgment was obtained by the defendants becanse the plaintiff had not sufficient evidence to disbharge the burden thrown upon him to prove that mr copestake was the real principal on that contract it followed that it was not obtained by the fraud of the defendaznts the ground on which it was said the judgment ought to be set aside was that the defence contained statements of fact not amounting to a e siml traverse but new statements of fact onwhich thdefendants relied  but the defendants were never called upon to prove those facts because the plaintiff never made out a priid facie case to answer the defence which they raised that the agreement was the agreement of mr beddall onlv then it was said that the judgment was nade upon reading the plead ings no doubt that was so  but assuming the state ments to be false which his lordship would not assume it must not be asssumed that the judge inferred any thing else from the pleadings except what the issues were lastly the plaintiff relied upon statements made by conmsel but without entering upon the ques tion whether if such statements bad been made as sttements of fact they were true or false it was clear from the evidence that the statements made by counel for hlr copestake were merely for the pur poe of showing the nature of the issues raised by the action the appeal failedlond jusric llsdlr in concurring thought that the effect of acceding to mr oswalds invitation would hb to make litigation endless whatever might have been the real facts whatever might have been the rel knowledge of the defendants and however wfn a moral point of view their conduct might hogfcourts of justice could only proceed upon evidene an it was not illegalon the part of a defendant to sayto the planif kprove your case the defendants called no evidence and nroved nothinu the plaintiff failed to rove his ease before vicehancellor hall and be failed in the court of appl it was not in accordance with law that he idou now be allowed to reopen his case on the samei
