bravei idvis were the eounsel appearingputlues v tiowasthis was an action by inhabitants of houses abutting or looking out on the market square merthyr tydli for an injunction restraining the defendant who was the owner of the market squre from using the square c or caing or permitting the same to be used for the purpose of any sports exhibitions e so as to otcasion a nuisance to the plaintiffs it appeared that the defndants agent last june gave one sttidt leave to use the square for holding a public show for several dacy stadt payng  the show consisted of a large circular roundabout containing  wooden horses eoried by a steam engine which engine also worked an organ and also of a switchback railwaywith another atain organ a boxing booth and shooting gallery the show ceased on june  the plaintiffs whilst the snow was going on complained to the defendants agent and a correspondence ensued which resulted in the defendants naent declifnng to give an undertaking and expressing his intention of allowing persons to use the square for public shows on june  the plaintifs commneneed the present actionmr beonsz qc and his ursomn for the plain tlffs submitted that the character of the shows con tesunlated hr the defendant could be inferred fromthat of the ehow held in june wbich the defendant to all intentsandpurposeshadadmittedtobe a nuisancemr mclea qc and kr charlxs browne for the defendant submitted that the action was in the nature of a quin tisast action it was founded on the short and isolated occurrences of june sit the defendant admitted that the sbows then held were ob jectionable but the plaintiffs did not ask for damages on that account that being so it would be time enough for the plaintiffs to institute proceedings when and if shows of a similar character were repeated in asnuich as the defendant acdmitted that wrong had been done it must be assumed that he had no intention of repeating tho wrong the ground iu question had been let for shows befcre the year  the defendant desired to continue letting it for shows but it did not follow that the shows to be held there in future would be objectionable and the shows held there in past years had received the support of the neighbouring tradespeoplemb justce cnitty said that the plaintiffs did not claim damages but an injunction they said that the show held in jne constituted an intolerable nuisance lie was of opinion that the term was not too strong a one and that the nuisance which had occurred was both a serious and grievous one the defendant was responsible for it as to shows having been held before  in the same place it was no doubt crue that science in  had not progressed so far as in  and  and the horrible engines which had been invented for making noise were in  not in their present state of development but still the general character of these shows was the same then as now although formerly they might have been less boisterous becanse less noisy some of the shopkeepers of merthyr tydlil seemed to have liked the shows before  but that was because the plaintiffs father washopular in the town or there was some other reason when the plaintiff succeeded his father he was a minor and his property was in chancery in consequence of representations then made the court directed the receiver appointed in the chancery proceedings to dis continue these shows although by doing so the income of the property ineurred a loss of between � and � per annam the defendant had recently come of age and was now responsible for what had recently occurred if a man in possession of land authoried another to do something which wasanuisance to others the landowner was responsible it was quite immaterial whether what had been done was done by a lessee or by a licensee all that the cout con sidered was did the landowner give authority lie might be exempt from consequences if he had taken the precantion to obtain covenants from the lessee or licensee not to ereate a nuisance studt was no doubt also liable the court however had some experience of itinerant showmen they came and went and were dificult to reach by injunction when however a man threatened and intendedto use the language of the pleadings in cases like the presentto authorize others to do acts which amounted to a nuisance it was scarcely necessary to say that ho could be restrained by injunction it had been argued that as no damages had been asked for the occurrences in june the court ought to eliminate them as a cause of action that however was not so what the court had to look to in a quia titmet action was whether injury was inevitable if a man had erected a tall chimney and his neighbours appre hended a nuisance therefrom as a rule they could not at once get an injunction because the chimney might possibly he used innocuously but if there were an apprehension say that a mine would be drowned through acts which the defendant was shown to be contemplating then the court would interfere pro vided that the consequences of such acts would be in the opinion of reasonable men such as the plaintiff was apprehensive of the reasoning however in guia timet cases was not really applicable to the cir cumstances of the present case hiere the thing com plained of had been done and the inference was that it would be done agan the defendant had also re fused to give an undertaking the undertaking asked for might have been too wide but he might have offered a suitable one the defendant too had pleaded immemorial custom in other words he had claimed a right to do something which under ordinary circumstances he could not have done the meaning of the pleading was that he had a right to commit a musance the case as put by the defendant came within the scope of the decision in  bext v gill  lbr  ch app  p  the defendant con tended that he bad the right to do an otherwise un lawful act and therefore he could not escape from the plaintiffs allegatien that he threatened and intended to do that act the evidence in support of that alle gation was ample and suicient and the line of defence made it still stronger the plaintiffs were justified in bringing this action it was plain that if shows were held on the site in question in the centre of a populous neighbourhood people would flock together in great numbers and that it would be impossible to carry on such shows without creating a nuisance the plain tiff was entitled to an injunction with costsbcfrve mr justice stiralingin re n iendustxetara assuajbace cospaary osgreat britain limitediljpon the
