quens bench dtvisitncourt for the consideration of crowncases res rvetbcfore lobd coleridge lord chief justice mrjustice  aweins mr justice myathew mr justice day and mua justice g thaxthe queen v bareuthis was a caso from the sessions of cheshire as to the liability of the defendant to repair two roads in the township of huntington in that county  by reason of the defendants tenure of certain lands in the township the roads are both ancient highways as to one of them an act was passed in  bywhich it was made a turnpike road until the act expired in  and the trustees widened the road and maca damized the centre and after the act expired the then owner of the lands who had repaired it before the act continued under a misacprehension as to his liability to repair it until his death and afterwards the defendant nad done so there was no evidence that the township or parish had ever repaired theroad nor that any one else had done so except the then ovner and the defendant before the act the cost of repairs was small the stones being foind on the lands but of late years the expense had risen to above � the contention for the prosecutors tvas that the defendant was botmd to repair the road as a mnacadaamied road the expense of which they esti mated at froua � to � and the defendants witnesses estimated it at from � to � it was proved that the defendant was not the occupier of any of the lands mentioned or of any lands whatever in the coumty but that he vas the owner of a con siderable quantity of land abutting on both sides of both the highways in question as to the other road it was proved that it had always been repaired by the former owner or his tenants and by the defendant or his tenants and there was no evidence that the towvn ship or any one else bad ever repaired it it was con tended fdr the defendant that as to the post road he was not liable as its character had hboe altered  and as regards both the roads that he w as not liable not being occupier of any part of the lands in respect of the tenure of which he was alleged to be liable but only the ownrle on the tart of the prosecutors itwas contended that the owner was liable as  the person who derived the real benefit and that it was better to indict him than a number of tenants the prosecutor further stated that they hlad asked the c hire oty council to repair the post road bht that they had declined to do so thinking that under section  of the local government act   and  viet e  they were not bound to do so and at their suggestion this prosecution was instituted in order to try the question the jury found that the roads were out of repairand that the post road before it was converted into a turnpike road had a stone pavement oft wide in the centre with grass or earth sides and that it was altered by the turnpike trustees by their taking  the avement and making the road macadamie ad subject to the oints taken and reserved they found the defendant liable to repair the roads by reason of his holdinfg lands the ouestion was reserved for this court whether the defendsat was liable to repair the roads or either of themmr msuall argued the case for the defendant the appellant and urged that the character of the post rond bad been so altered and the burden of its repairs was so increasd that the defendant as the owner wvas no longer liable to repair it and that not being occupier of the lands he was not liable to repair either of the ronds the liability of a party to repair rfstionwe tsaiira could not be increased by changes in the character of the road beyord his ancient and customary liability he is not bound to put it in better repair than it has sbeen from time limnemorial for the liability is prescriptive and arising from ancient immemorial usage be cited several autho rities including  the queen v pickering   juestice of the peace   rlex v the in habitants of middlesex   barnwall and adol phuss reports   the eing v the west riding of yorkshire   east  lord colzeidge threw put that when the turnpike act expired the eriginal iiabilitr revived to the extent to which it had previously existed but the repairs now required are estimated by the prosecutors at above � tloyd coleeidoewo have nothing to do with that but the old reed no longer exists and this is a new obligation altogether then as to the other pointwhich applres to both roads the defendant is noi occugier of the lands on which the liability is sought to be imposed though he is owner as trustee of the lands the party must be occupier lobd cole bidqeit is so laid dovwn ann has never bean ques tioned that is sohir a b lloyd appeared for the prosecutors in support of the verdict and proposed to deal with the second point firstas it applied to both roads  lond colxareabbut we must determine both points for if we decided against you en the second point you would indict the tenants that is so the law is not as has been supposed the liability to repair rac ione clauszzrca is in the occupier  not so if rattons teauro  the queen v ramsden llis black brnu and elliss reports load coieridgb said he did not think that distinction was drawn in the old authorities in  bolles abridgment and the same reason appeared to apply it has been held that where the occupier has been prosecuted he may recover against the owner  baker v greenall  q b riep that shows that the occupier is primarily liable though the owner is also liable and the owner is only prosecuted from reasonsof convenience lord coleeridielt does not follow because as in many instances the occupier when prosecuted may recover from the ovwer that therefore at once the owner may he prosecuted then as to the other point the change in the character of the road under the turnpike act it carefully kept alive the common law liability or left it alive it requiring no express enactment to preserve it ib justice hwaxies supposing the road remained xs it originally esisted nto doubt but the liability continued notwithstand ing the powers given by the turnpike act lebd coxinui said the case had been ably argued and raised some interestidg considerations but he confessed lhat on neither of the points raised did he entertain andy doubt as to the second of the points taken as to occupation there was no doubt that the borden of repair had been on a former owner but the defendant was not the occupier and from the time of charles ii the law had been that on an obli gation to repair rationec tenurcs the occupier must be indicted and that the owner could net be indicted so the law was laid down in a case in  rolless abridgment and so it had been taken to be ever since lhe reason was that the duty was cast pri marily on the occupier who was on the spot on that ground therefore this prosecution failed but that did not dispose of the other and the graver questionas to the change in the character of the road which had been a turnpike road the road was an old narrow roadgoing in part through these lands on the owner of which occupying there was the liability to repair ratione teaura then under the turnpike act it was widened and macadamized and tbus the nature and extent of the liability to repair was greatly altered then the present owner was in dicted for the nonrepair of the road as it now existed now it had been held long ago that acts of this kind did not destroy the old common law liability sod left it as it was before  the king v st georges hanoversquare  campbells xeports that was decided no doubtas against a parish but the same principle applied to common law liabilities that being so if the trustees hbd left the road as it was before the old liability would have remained but the road had been changed and the old road no longer existed it had been altered so that the old liability no longer existed for the road to which it was attached had ceased to exist and the ancient obligation no longer attached to it he put it therefore oa the ground that the party could notbe liable to repair the road as it now existed at all mu jusvicb unweis said his lordship had so well explained the grounds of the judgment that he did not think it necessary to add anything furthermr justice mateew and the other judges also concurredjudgment for the defendantbeforr mr justice wills and a cosainon jmtryrance v oiflynnthe plaintiff in this action is the proprietor of the united service gazette and he sued the defeendant who was the late editor and manager for money said to have been paid by the plaintiff for the defendaut at his request the defendant on his part counter claimed for certain sums which he alleged were due to him  hut the principal question and the only one that was eventually left to the jury was as to the terms on which the the defendant was engaged it seems that the defendant was introduced to the plaintiff in june  and with a view to settling upon what terms he would be willing to undertake the management of the paper was allowed to examine the books when he came to the conclusion that he could work the paper so as to make over � per annum net profit he thereupon agreed to undertake the editorship on the terms that he should receive no remuneration except  per cent on any advertise ments he might intrdduce unless the profits exceeded � per annum when he should be paid half the surplus profits which were made over and above that sum the terms agreed upon were embodied in a letter to the plaintiff which was last seen iu the latters possession but which had been unfortunately lost the defendant continued in this employment until june  when certain questions having arisen between the parties an accountant was employed to examine the accounts and draw up a balancesheet when it appeared that in the irst year of the defendants management the profits only amounted to about  whilst in the second year they reached nearly � the defendant thereupon claimed to be entitled to half the surplus made in the second year after deducting � as due to the plain tiff  but the latter contended that the agreement did not contemplate that each year should be taken sepa rately but that the accounts should be taken jat the end of the engagement as in ordinary partnership transactions aud that if this were done nothing would be due to the defendant as taking the two years together the profits bad not reached � per annumthe
