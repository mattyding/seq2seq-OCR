iihich was the same at all the platforms  that this msss meeting of railway workers ef every grade considers that the time has fully arrived when the s axinmnu hours of railway men in trafii and goods departments including loco be  per week and railway shopmen  and also that it is high tfime railway managers and directors should at once take steps to grant a substantial increase to their essioyds scanty pay and thereby put them on a simi lar footing with other industrial workers and futher that this meeting pledges itself to lrngabout these changes by nil lawful meansthe mover speaking amid a downpour of rain ex pressed his regret that the demonstration had not added its strength to that of the previous sunday which was to demand practically the eighthour day and thought that for the railway men to ask for  hours a week was a moderate demand he did not suppose that many of them held railway stock a laugh and he wondered how those who did and travelled on railways the men of which worked for  and  hours a day could do so with peace of mind this country was supposed to be a free one bait he held that freedom was illusory and a sham where men had to labour those many hours their position was one of serfdom and slavezy cheers it vas im possible he said to reconcile the interests of the capitalists and the workers under the present condition of things and those who desired to reconcile these opposing interests might as well try to hedge in thecuckoo or do any other impossible task as to the  interests of the workers in parliament he declwed that it was impossible for men like himself to repre sent the working men there the working classes had been fooled by having such as himself there no however much theysmight sympathize with workers men like himself could not thoroughly understand the workers wants and aspirations and labour representation could be properly secured only through men like john burns men who had raised a family on s or s a week cheers there was much to be done before the workers could be called really free pirst they must bave a reduction of the hours of labour and it was because capitalists throzghout the world recognized the fact t tt this reduction would bring about great results that they were opposing it on all sides the working men throughout the world by their umitythe men in monarchical england in republican france and in socaled democratic americawere being opposed by capitalists but the workers must realize what aiam smith the middleclass political economisst of a century ago declared  the reward of labor is the full product of labour upon the raw material ana they mnst concentrate their efforts upon obtsining this and then they would achieve the complete emancipation of labour cheers he urged them to work for the legislative limit to the hours of labour it would take  years to unite men in obtaining the limit bh individual effort in  years lite had been achieved but with the legislative limit every man and wroman in england and scotland would at once be placed in a good position and they couldtbhea force on their other aemands cheersbms aviming in seconding the motion said that it seemed as if the railway directors had been  getting at the clerk of the weather but workers would have to stand more than a shower of rain if they were to get their wants considered cheers if there was one fault to be fonud withthe railwaymen in the park that day it was that they were only asking for nine hours a day he would have liked them to have demanded eight hours bht the demand for the nine hours must he regarded as a step to the demand f or eight hours cheers the railway men were the hardest worked classesl and the most powter ful if they combined together for if he did combein the railway comp nies could not stand anst their demands cheers cornbmed they could paralyze the trade and work of tbe country cheers but they must not be content with coming to the park on one sunday they must work every day in their cause they were warking by the side of men who did not belong to their union and it was only by making their union strong thai they could hope to maxke ihort work of the  black legs cheers tiany of the railway men had votes but they used their votes to send to parliament su ch men as bradaugh and broadhurst with the reslt that there was in the eouse of commons only one man who would work for the labour interest e workers allowed themselves to be dragged at the tail of one or the other of the political parties and it was time the workers showed they did not care whether gladstone was  in  or out they had a good representa tive in xr graham notwithstanding his own denial of fitess to represent the workers  and they shouldl take care that no man had their votes who did ndt promise to support their immediate interests in the house of commons cheersmr john btieys who was received with groat cheering supported the resolution he said thewere there to demonstrate on behalf of the general lailway workers union which was called into existence six months ago as a protest against the apathy the laziness and the indhiference of the older society upon the burning interests of the unskilled railway servants and workers in the kingdom this union he said was formed six months ago and it had increased its membership by  it had already been instrumental in obtaining material con cessions from the railway companies cheers ae was there as a member of the biggest trade mnon in the world and he told the old trade unions that mnless they furbished up their armour and usea the sword of trade unionism instead of going to the fight with he scabbard the work would be dunn by the younger unions cheers there were he said  railway servants and boys on the railways of the kingdom  of whom were eligible to join the union the average wage was s a week comnting directors salaries and all a laugh the workers were on duty    and  hours a day and in some cases they had been known as at man chester to be cn for  hours  shame he wished the directors had been alone in a train and had been run into the  deed end  cheers and laughter these long hours most be stopped cheers they might  go in  for nine hours or ten hours and he would support them but they must supplement their efforts byjoining the big organization supported bythree million of workers to bring all labour down to eight hours a day cheers the railvray companies of this country had � of reveoue yearly of which � went to the nonprodncing shareholders and if the companies reduced the hours of work so as to give employment to  more men the dividends would be reduced only from  to  per cent the railuay men were roc paid for their skill but their wages were determined by the number oi men out of work showing the potentiality of the  blacklegs and if this potentiality could be reduced then the railway workrers could go in for increase of wages cheers he was there as a trade umionist a londoesouty coencallor and as a socialist who believed in going still further and he told the railway com panies that the railway mer must lave shorter homrs and more wages in this work he instanced the dangers of their duties by saying that out of  shunters  per cent every seven years had to look forward to being killed outright or badly injureda mnasacre which must be stopped cheers if the rail way companies would not concede the emad then they must seek for the nationalization of the railways cheers in vitoria where the rilways were held by the state the workers weres paid tice as much and worked aborter hours than in bugland though twice as mach was paid in victoria for coal and material than was pad in eigland he chargesfor fares were twovthirds les in victoria than in englad and al
