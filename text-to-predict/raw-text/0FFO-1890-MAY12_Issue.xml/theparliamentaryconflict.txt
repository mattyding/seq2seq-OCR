the pasliamemtary confljotin romenoe izwo the conflict between signor crispi and the senate is as i anticipated subsiding and i leamn today that tha latter will content itself witb the demonstration of its opinion on the teform of the operc pie and if the chamber insists on tbe articles that were cub out the senate will accopt the solution that at least is the present impression the only weak point in signor crispis position is that he lost his temper a little at the unexpected turn in the discussion in the senate and in his haste said that he shouldappeal to the country he should have waited  hours to say the same thing al that was objec tionable was the form of the declaration ior an appeal to the country was the only solution if tha senate did not yieldsignor crispi is not the man to bh dismounted by a hasty word if he makes a mistake or says anything unbecoming the circumstances he is not too proud to recall it and make amends which he can do without loss cf dignity as we have seen in various cases he is so easily master of tho situation that he is in no need to stand on small details of consideration we have been hearing for a long time that he is losing his hold on the country anad that his majority is diminishing but there is no truth in this ile is objected to by many on personal grounds but the same people are not in the least anxious to see him go into opposition in point of fact there is no question of vital importance on which any great difference of opinion as to the course to be fol lowedexists inthe general counsels of the country there is a small party of theorists and senti anentalists which has taken up a shadowy policy of conservative measures and under the lead of the marquis sostegno is amusing itself by build ing a sand dyke againsttheadvancing liberalism or as some will have it radicalism of the country but i apprehend that its strength in the elective chamber will never be considerablethe great work of italian statesmanship is not to drive or withstand but to control and guide reform and the whole country is so well awaro that at this moment signor crispi is the only man wvho firmly grasps the reins of the smruly team that no one is liely serioasly to con test the position i hear that in case the senate decides to hold act and allow him to g to the country the pope wil lot the catholics vote and indeed that the influence of the vaticanwill be given tothe opposition thiswould much simplfy matters and in my opinion it is what signor crispi would desire for as there can be no organization of the official party without an opposition preceding it the nrshalling of forces would be rauch simplified by the entry of the catholies openly and formally into the lists i believe that this is hat signor crispi has always desired and therefore i have no faith in its coming to passthe entire politieal interest isconcentrated on the financial situation and this is to a great extent still enveloped in clouds the european situation is so far from lbeing considered secethat no substantial relaxation in war preparations can be looied for nor can economies he made in this respect matters stand where they did months ago and are likely so to stand till war comes people begin to say that the best thing that could happen would be the outbreak of war so as to end the strain and suspense the first shot will cut many klots some of them inextricable by any other disentanglementrome miar in view of the next reneral electionthe lradieal party had resolved to hold z congress in roine te inaugural meeting of which was arranged to be held at the costanzi thkatre tomorrow tbh organi ers of the movement having however been infcrmed that the police wvould interfere signor ferrari of the extreme left addressed an inter pellation on the subject to signor crispi in tho chamnber today the jemier replied that it was his duty to order the police to prevent the meet ing and added that he must adhere to his decision
