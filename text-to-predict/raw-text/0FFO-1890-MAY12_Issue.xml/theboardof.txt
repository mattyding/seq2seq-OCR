included in class  was again proceeded withthe frst articles taken were  cinnamon cloves cochineal cordials extract of meat hops indigo isinglass lard and nutinegsmr emerson for the wholesale grocers claimed that these were articles which should go unader the head of  mixed grocerieslonrd bralf of bunlxig said that at present the court were only desirous of knowing what class the traders wished these goods to go into did they agree that they were all properly in the fifth class mr emerson said they did not but asked that they should be reduced to the third classmr edgar howell for the drapers association asked that hosiery should remain in class  as in the clearinghouse classif cation packed in trusses packs or bales it was only the vcry lowest class of hosiery that was packed in that wayrir gamble representing the hosiery trade of leicester was of opinion that when packed in boxes the goods should be included in class on the question of  plants and shrubs in baskets mats pots or tubs mr carrington of worcester called attention to the fact that manv of the plants in pots were exceedingly cheap such as jeraniuns and in nearly every order received by the grower they had to give a large quantity of valuable stock as compensa tion for the charge for carriage the pots were care fufly packed ana it was seldom that any damage occurred to them plants were sent verv long ais tances large consignments went to canada and the united states at present a great many of the cdn sig nents would come under the head of smallsmr william paul remarked that plants in pots comprised vines roses stove greenhouse bedamg and climbing plants vines in pots ranged from s d to s each with the exception of these and of exhibition plants which were few in comparison with the bulk of the trade all the goods containedunder this description were very ehean and they were conveyed in great quantities during  years he had sent hundreds of packages away and had not received as much as � for damage a truck load of shrubs would contain  or  and the average price for a truck load would be � in his opinion the reten tion of trees plants and shrubs in the clsses pro posed by the railway companies would materially njure the trade and not benefit the companiesmr light southeastern defended the classifica tion in regard to which he said it was not proposed to alter the excisting classification which covered thealuable plants as well as those of a cheaper kin so far as claims were concernxed it was the con signee and not the consignor wvho made the demandmr sykes representing the woollen and worsted manufacturers of the wfest riding of yorkshire objected to the proposed classification of these arricles the trade be said was a most extensive one amounting to something like � sterlinz per annum and it was most desirable that it shoula go into class  the bales were not liable to break age and the goods were so pnckedathat they could be easily bandledmr twelvetrees great northern pointed out that woollen and worbted goods in many of the companies powers were in the very highest class in the york shire district they were invariably carried at the highest class rates they were iiable to injury from being lifted by cranes anrd otherwise and sometimes a bale was lost or stolen in transit and the railvay company was called upou to pay for it the value was high ranging from � to � per ton until   woollen and worsted goocs  in trusses packs and bales did not appear in the clearinghouse classification in that year they were brought down to the third class on the understanding that it was the commoner sorts only that were so packed the experience of the railway companies when claims for loss were made was that the distinction between valuable and low class goods had not been observedmr evans for the woollen cloth manufacturers of gloucester wilts somerset and devon endorsed therepresentations of l sykes on behalf of the york  shire trade he disputed the statement of mr twelve trees that bales of woollen cloth wore frequently lost in transit and added that very curious articles were lost by the railway companies sometimes on one occasion the great western company lost a boiler he could not imagine why a truss of woollen cloth should be more liable to be lost than any other merchandise the average length of a truss was three feet and it was easily packed and carried it was also carried in track londs so far as damage was con cerned he denied that cloth could sustain injury unless there was vwilful negligence the goods were wrapped up in paper and then covered with coarse canvasmlr wilkinson great western said that the cir eumstances under which woojlen and worsted goods were carried varied in different districts of the coun try and in most instances the merchandise was of a description that required special care it was a very valuable article the arrangement made between the traders and the railway companies in  was that the infenor goods should be carried in the third class and the supernor goods in the fourth class but that had not been the experience of the companies since on the contrary the very reverse had been the case one of the articles carried by the great western railway was scarlet hunting cloth whish was worth about � a ton it was carried in bales without specification the raivway companies found that a good mary claims were sent is mn connexion with the carriage of clothmr sykes said that a bale of cloth worth � would be a very exeeptional case the average value of a bale of yorkshire goods wras about  a tonhit conrusty bovawhat have you to sayabout the scarlet hunting cloth  mr sykes said that was a very exceptional artiele all classes of goods were packed alike irrespective of value but the greatest care was taken in packing them yarn  and  yeast  brought the considera tion of class  to a close upon class mir fp carver on behalf of the lace manufactarers of nottingham objected to the proposed classification of  curtains and asked that they shunld go into class  they comprised a variety of articles which were not lace in the strict sense of the term sucha as mosquito lace window blinds and curtain nets which ought to be classed with upholstery it was unreasonable to classify them with valuable laceloatn bat iron oa bllcaleig pointed out that the nottinghmn manufacturers had not sent in wvritten objections their case mnst therefore stand over and in the meantime their representative had better communicate with the board of trade it would be necessary to have another caay upon classification seeing that the consideration of the hardware list had been lneld overmr howell stated that the scotch objectors had sent in a list of their obiections to the board of trade yesterday but he desied to intimate on behalf of mr ithite miller who represented the scotch traders that they were not sufficiently distinct from the english objections to render it necessary to ask the court for a special hearing it was due however to the scotch objectors that some reply to their representations shold be giveh by the railway companies in writing where they did happen to difer i from the english objections he aid not propose to give evidence unless the court desiredlondi balforn of buasrrgir said that a good many of the scotch objections were oi the same lities as those of the english traders there were some that were peculiar to scotland but they were very few and stood upon a different footing he thought the nest arrangement vwould be for the court to read what the objectors said together with aby reply which the railway companies might choose to send in if upon any point further information was considered necessary the parties interested would be communicated with reo added that the court had how completed the classifiation with the exception of hardwate and the vegetable and fruit schedules i next week the sittings would be held in the west minster
