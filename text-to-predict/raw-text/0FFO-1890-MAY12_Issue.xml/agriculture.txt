 r  aicuituricrop and stoc prospectalthough wre have retrned to a lower temper tre anrd cold rains the agricultmral situation has not mraterially changed and reports from all districts speak of the crops both winter and spring sown as looldng well speaking generally the spring corn is looking well and in those dis tricts which escaped previous ramins the general downfall of friday has done much good it may be added that reports received last week from  counties all spoke of the outlook so far as crops are concerned as very satisfactory live stck also are doing wellvegetable and flruit farmitgtaking advantage of the great interest now taken in the question of the extension of vegetable and fruit farming in this country the royal agri cultural society of england have had the very able paper which was vritten in  by mfr charles whitehead revised and brought down to date and it is now issued as a sixpenny pamphlet at the date of the first appearance of this paper it was noticed a some length in the times and so far as the practical portion is concerned there has been but little need of extensive addition theore important alterations are to be found in the very interesting history of the present phase of the question statistics and facts on the subject are ably marshalled and the result should be most beneficial to the extension of that petite mdture which is so much to be desired at the present timelr whitehead very rightly lays stress on the fact that wheatgrowing is not everything for tunately there are other things than wheat for the english farmers to depend upon and he thus defines his contention there is meatmaking which will not for a long time if ever be materially interfered with by foreign competizioa there are barleygrowing butter and cheese raaling wool production fruit seeds and vegetable culture poultry reaing and the breeding of good arimals of all kinds for home and forein requirements if we inquire what class of agrinci rjss have bald tbeir head above water during the late hard timesit will be seen that those who may be termed specialists have fared the best the term  specialist  indndes all breeders of stock of reputation frrdt and vegetable producers seed growers and cheese and butter makersthis contention is proved at some length and then very cogent reasons are given in the case of frurit and vegetables and then a short history is given of market gardening in this country it seems that the cultivation of vegetables for markret was first adopted in this country about the middle of the seventeenth century gardening for pmfit according to fuller the historianc crept oat of rolland whence vegetables had lon been imported into england  to sandwich in rent and it has gradually developed into a most important branch of national industry it is satisfactory to note that the past ten years have seen a lag increase in this cultivation the acre age devoted to which was in  and  as followsthib increase has not been made within the area of market gardening proper which has been described as  the inner circle defined by com paratively small holdings spade culture and easy distance from the london markets so that the produce can be sent in upon wagons and carts early and fresh nor altogether in the  outer circle extending somewhat far into keni essex and surrey where vegetablegrow ing is carried on upon a large scale with the appliance of implements and machinery used in ordinary farming mr whitehead points ont that the extension of vegetable culture has taken place in most of the counties of great britain and most notably in bedfordshire kent mfiddle sex and worcestershire this extension has con siderably reduced the profits of the market gat dener which were frequently very largeit is thus satisfactory to know that very matked progress is being made in the matter and that progress should in the near future make still further strides owing to the very vigorous aid which is now being given to it by so influential bodies b hints on vegetable and fruit farming by charles whitehead fls fgs london john lurray albemarlestreet g mat silage e sepme tssome recent experiments in germany have further demonstrated the value of silage as feeding material the most important perhaps are those by consul brockman who at the session of the landwirth schaftlichen association in bartenstein east prassia gave in much detail the result of his experience the silage or pressed food which he prepared consisted of hay of t e second crop mustard red clover vetch seradeila and lupines be considered that the failures which attended the making of silage were due generally to want of care in making and pressing the stacks ihough he does not go so far as to say like sone silage makers that it is immaterial how wet the herbage is he cautions farmers against stacking it too dry in which case it shonld be watered after the silage had been in the stack four or five months itws examined and it was found to contain acids in the following proportions the pressed hay  per cent clover  per cent vetch  per cent seradella and lupines  per cent and mustard  per cent the temperature of the clover stackthe crop having been choked with weedsrose to deg fahrenheit but all the other gtacks did not exceed degthe following table shows the analysis of the several kinds of silage and their comparisoni with hay and green cropsaaixlis mnd compaisos or suagzspressed food consul brockiman is of o icion made from the aftercrops was very much like meadow grass with a little more fatty substance in it vetches also gave more fat they having been gathered when in pod the pressed clover was very much like cloverhay the large proportion of ash in the mustard was due to its having been much sanded by heavy rains and the clover was also sanded through iying in the fields for a fortnightanother exuerimenter is mxrhanish who at falken berg silesia put up several stacks the first con tained mustrd grass and stubble clover the second stubble clover and rape  and a third rape carrot tops and maize he found the cattle liked the food and were bealthy and the yield of milk was increased without any injurious effect on its flavour mr hanish does not advise dispensing altogether with the use of bay when using silageagricultural educationthe subject of agricultural education has occupied the attention of a joint committee of the central chamber of agriculture and the farmers club acda report based on their deliberations has been issued it gives the history of the agitation for government help in the matter and discusses the various methods suggested at different times and by different persons it then makes the following recommendationsl that there should be established and main tained at the cost of the state a central normal school of agriculture that state aid should be liberally given to certain endoweed and cournty schools on condition of their establishing an agricultural side for the proper teaching ofthe theoryandracticeofagriculturepracti cal instruction being carried out on a farm which might either be the property of the school or rented by the school or available by permission of neighbouring farmers arrangements should be made for the de livery of courses of lectures by the teaching staff or other lecturers open to farmers of the district  that grants should continue to be given by the state in aid of local effort to proviide technical instruetion in dairy or other branebes of farm work  tht aid should be similarly given to local agneulkmal aociations or chambers of agrienlture cngaged in scientific research f that in all cases where state aid is afforded it should be of a permanent character subject only to certain definite conditions laid down by the board ofre and to the admnission of adn inspection by an offdcer of the board  that sanplefacilities should be agotdel by the fstte tq ensble childtn in rural elemnntarksclools to acquire knowledge of their future work either as agricultural labourers or astenants of small holdings
