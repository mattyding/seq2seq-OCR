lonvdon monda y may  if the strength of the opposition to a bill is to be measured by the number of members of parlia ment who give notice of a motion for its rejection the hostility aroused by the government propo sals for the extinction of licences is of an excep tionally formidable character on the second reading of the local taxation customs and duties bill which is to be taken tonight mu carse has priority with an amendment declaring that the house declines to assent to the extinc tion of annual licences in the manner provided but he is followed on the notice paper by over forty separate and distinct motions for the read ing of the bill this day six months this superfluous display of zeal is possibly not un connected w ith a desire to make what capital may be attainable out of a popular subject temperance reformers are too much addicted to the habit of converting love of temperance into hatred of those who render intemperance possible and have frequently overlooked or even opposed valuable suggestions merely because they were not duly barbed with hostility to the publicans in the present case those who have the interests of temperance really at heart would do well to consider whether the summary rejection of the government proposals or their withdrawal in face of a threat of an inadmissible expenditure of time would not hirnder rather than forward the reduction of public opportunities for drinking whatever objections may be alleged against the governrcent bill it ought not to be forgotten that it goes furtlher than any legislation yet proposed in the way of prohibiting the issue of new licences this alone ought to entitle it to respectful consideration especially when it is remembered that in a country like this with a rapidly growing population the mere stoppage of new licences has all the effect of actual reduction of the number in existence when so much stress is laid upon the acknowledgment of prin ciples in legislation it is surely something to place upon the statute hook for the first time a formal assertion of the principle that the dis cretion of licensing authorities while remaining unfettered in the direction of diminution is to be rigidly limited in the direction of increase it may be that the principle is not applied with sufficient thoroughness it may be dosirable to amend the removals clause to include offlicences in the provisions applicable to onlicences or to place further restrictions upon the granting of new licences in new localities these are matters of detail to be settled in cormittee but in the meantime there is the broad question whether the principle of forbidding the issue of new licences shall be accepted by the house or rejected without any prospect of the recurrence of such an dpportunityit is admitted on all hiands that licences in general carry with them no legal right to renewal ancd therefore none to compensation for extinction but while the licensing authority is thus guarded against legal claims every one who dispassionately regards the question knows that a certain moral and equitable claim to renewal during good be haviour has been created by the long series of transactions between the legislature and the liquor trade an immense capital has been in vested on the faith of continuity of policy on the part of the state which has drawn a very large annual revenue from the presumption it has created and fostered if the liquor trade be an evil thing then in its establishment and mainten ance the state has been a willing accomplice upon most profitable terms it is mean and dishonour able for one party to a transaction of the kind to fall back npon a technical plea in order to justify destmetion of the other partys property there is no claim founded in law and it is right that there should be none but there is a claim founded upon practice sanctioned by public opinion and followed for public convenience there is no legal claim upon the posastrsgurzaal for the loss of valuable property in transit through the post but an equitable claim has been set up by public opinion and is officially recognized a railway company has no legal claim to the con tinuance of the powers on the strength of which it built its line and carries on its business one parliament cannot fetter the legal discretion of another nor could a railway company enforce compensation even for a fatal reversal of conces sions but there is a moral obligation wvhich one parliament can and does impose upon its sncces sors because there is a natioual continuity wholly independent of temporary opinions and majorities society and civilization rest to an often unsuspected extent upon conventions which are not susceptible of legal enforcement in the strict sense but which are nevertheless reckoned as even more secure than specific provisions by statute to break down these conventions is to girike at thx foundations of ublic credit andchat conld not be excused even were the moral com plicity of this nation in the establishment of the drink traffic mueh less obvious and unmistakable than it is mu srtaroadhowand usefully points out in our columns today that as regards one rather important class of licences there is actually a legal vested interest beerhouse licences dating from before  can be refused only upon one of four grounds named in the act of that year aud therefore have a parliamentary title so long as the specified conditions are observed it may bo as is maintained by mui howand that the county councils will not be able to deal with them effectually without com pulsory powers and limited compensation but these are matters of detail and at present the question is whether any details are to be discussed at allmu caine and others indulge in alarming statistics concerning tbe magnitude ef the vested interests which as they maintain will receive legal recognition if we affirm the principle of extinction on payment but if that is all that alarms temperance advocates nothing could be simpler than to add to the bill a clause declaring that nothing it contains shall be talen to alter in any way the emisting staius of publichouse property such a provision would in fact strengthen the legal decisions now relied upon to show that there is no legal vested interest in a licence while leaving moral and equitable claims where they are considering how strongly the temporance people advocate local control of licences and the undoubting faith they profess in the curtailment of the drink traffic if local opinion bad its way it is singular that they find no comfort in the reflection that under the bill the county councils would be entirely free to buy up licences or to leare them alone if they buy them up local wisdom and tam perance zeal must be taken to dictate a judicious use of tho money  if they abstain from buying the community is in no worse position than before provisions which are not put in force at least injuro no one not even the moost ansteroe zealot  but if by the rejection of the bill these provisions are lost there will be lost along with them other pro visions restricting the issue of new licences the absence of which will certainly not further the temperance cause it will be interesting to see how far the present outcry coupled with the excellence of the chance to embarrass the go vernment and oceupy time that might otherwise be given to the irish land bill will prevail with mr glardston and others to mako them renounce the opinions they formerly advocated on the ques tion of the moral claim of licenceholders to equitable consideration squch a claim has not until recently been dispated by statesmen and it is amusing to note the struggle in such minds as sra tiroaas fawbeszs between old orthodoxy and new antipathies the proposal to give licences ten years grace and then treat them as absolutely without claim to compensation is in fact an admission that the present value of ten years enjoyment is a fair price to pay for extinction or rather for power to extinguish at will an actuarial variation in form of payment does not in the least alter the principle though its adoption would postpone for ten years that reduction in the number of licences which under the govern ment scheme would begin at once
