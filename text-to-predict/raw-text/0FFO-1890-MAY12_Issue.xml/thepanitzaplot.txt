confessions and have moreover given conclusive evidece ainst one another it will not have been forgotten that whon major panitza was arrested on the st of febrtuay the bulgarian go vermnent strenuously denied that any consider able number of officers were implicated in this plot it now appears however that nine officers of the reserve are to be anraigned with him besides four civilians and a russian officer captain porfizy ealobkoff the preliminary examination of the prisoners was conducted by a special con mission consisting of major kontinchef presi dent of the courtmartial of sofia captain stoy noff a magistrate of the said court and two fficials of the home officethe mnost serious feature in the indictment for it is one of international importance is that m eitrovo the russian minister at bucharest and bsome officials of his legation are directly accused of having abetted panitzas plot well knowing its object m ivan zinovieff chief of the asiatic department in the russian ministry for foreign affairs is also accused of having along with personages situated in higher positions than himself encouraged the conspirators and aided them with moneythe plot seems to have originated in  when panitza being on military duty at rustchuk was introduced by the russian officer kalobkoff to bf wiamoff secretary of the russian legation at bucharest panitza who was a partisan of prince alexander of battenbyrg felt disgusted at the election of prince ferdinand of coburg to the bulgarian throne and listened to the proposals of wiliamoff for promoting a revolution one jacob son dragoman of the legation at bucharest was admitted to the conferences of the pair and subsequently opened a correspondence in cipher with panitza matters did not go very far how ever owing to the illness of williamoff but panitza has repeatedly declared under examination that if it had not been for williameffs death the revolution would have been effected long agoin november  the correspondence between tacobson and panitza was resumed and from thattime to the date of panitzas arrest a great number of letters and telegrams were sent to the conspirators by jacobson kalobkoff and ether russians the cryptogram consisted in the use of terms connected with the wive trade and the conspirators were incessant in their demands for mnoney jacobson on his side urged panitza and his friends to speedy action one of the accused named theodore arnaondoff landlord of the hotei vitosch at sofia acted as intermediary as it was quite safe to address him any number of despatches relating to consignments of wins and exhoritions to  lose no more time in con cluding our business as for money panitza musi have received plenty for he spent freely and at one time supplied another of the accused dimitri rizoff with funds for starting the christo bolef newspaper which attacked prince ferdinand in such scurrilous terms that its editor was sent to prisonto sum up the clauses of the indictment which refer to the clandestine correspondence of the conspirators the proof of jacobsons paxtici pation in the plot is said to rest on  letters interchanged between him kalobkoffand panitza between february  and january  the proof that jacobson acted with the knowledge of his chief m hitrovo is founded upon sevoen letters and despatches while the proof that the russian officer kalohkoff held all the threads of the conspiracy is grounded on  letters and despatches it must be added howvever that the epistolary evidence against m hitrovo jacobson and the russian foreign office in the person of mi zinovieff is corroborated by the confessions of panitza and several of his fellowprisoners including the russian kalobkoff himseltwe come now to the details of the plot panitza by reason of his distinguished services enjoyed great influence in the army and he found no difficnlty in getting a number of officers to promise that they would join him in anyenterprisewhatsoever in some cases where his own powers of persuasion failed jacobson who paid him a visit at sofia and kalobkoff came to his aid by distributing money and giving profuse assurances that all officers who joined in over throwing prince ferdinand would ba marked out for the special favour of thhe czar it is a singular thing that many of the officers who declined panitzas proposals nevertheless kept his secretaccording to the indictmont panitza be haved with reckless audacity he invited officers to meet him at the hotel vitosch inveighed openly before them against prince ferdinand and m stambouloff and declared his set intention of overthrowing tho government how he escaped arrest so long can only be ex plained by his personal popularity and perhaps also by the fact that m stambouloff knowing him to be a frondeur by nature treated his proceed ings as mere bravado panitza was watched but it is certain that the government can have had no idea how dangerous his plans werehis irst plot was ready for execution last autumn when it was intended to arrest prince ferdinand and his ministers on their return by railway from philippopolis the guard of honour at the sofia railway station was to be composed of men whom panitza could trust and two squadrons of cavalry were to be kept in barracks ready to come out and scour the streets whenever panitza should send the order the indictment is somewhat obscure as regards the means by which panitza was to get a large force of cavalry and infantry under his orders and one can only infer that there must have been more secret adherents to the conspiracy than the government now cares to acknowledge it must be noted in this connexion that immediately after panitzas arrest tho comnanding officers of several regiments were quietly removedprince ferdinand escaped arrest and probably assassinationby suddenly returning to sofia before he was expected panitza is said to have broken into violent imprecations when his schemo thus failed and from that time he was less and less careful to conceal from his accomplices that princeferdinandl and the two miinisters stambouloff and mfutkuroff with colonel petrcff chief of the staff must be killed one evening at the hotel vitosch he disclosed his whole plan to lieu tenant rizoff after m aking the latter swear an oath of fidelity he said tlat the russian general damontovitch was awaiting prince fer dinands overthrowv and wculd immediately that event was accomplished ento bugarma as high commissioner ho ppnts wcud then go to st petersburg taking r zcff with him as his aidedecamp and pray the car to nominate two candidates for the bulgarian thronea few days after thizlat is on the night cf january panitzx tricd to precipitate matters by a coup p d navzi accompanied by lieutenant rizeff andc andendeff tho hotelkeeper both armedwitirevolvers he returned late to his house and put on his campaigning uniform his wife clung to his neckand entreated him with tears to cause no bloodshed which he promised and then sallied forth with his friends to the house of dr mirkoff physicianinchief of the army dr mirkoff was roused from bed and ordered to come out instantly with the con spirators and use his influence to cause a pronunciamiento in one of the barracks this he rafused but two revolvers being pointed at his head he wrote a note to his friend colonel kissoff commander of the garrison of sofia in which he said  do what yoa can for the bearers the position of bulgaria is critical it rests entirely with you to save the situationthe threa conspirators then went to colonel kissoffs house but although they tried coawngs and threats that officer sternly refused to play the traitor considering the desperate mood of the con spirators who must have felt that they were now in eissoffs power it is a wonder that the colonel was not murdered it is equally strange that when kissoff had seen the conspirators leave his house he did not immediately go and inform the war lfinister of vvhat had happened panitza was not arrested till the st of february but the in dictmera does not say whether kissoff informed against him nor does it give any details as to the final coutp de main which panitza is believed to have plannednamely that of kidnapping prince ferdinand during a court ball in fact the indictment leaves the reader tomarvel whether dr mirkoff and colonel kissoff were too afraid to seize upon the conspirators until they had becomo fully assured that the army would obey ordersit only remains to be said that tho indictment presses for the punishment of the accused accord ing to native law the military code and ottoman law which all decree the pminishment of death for the crime of which the prisoners stand accused
