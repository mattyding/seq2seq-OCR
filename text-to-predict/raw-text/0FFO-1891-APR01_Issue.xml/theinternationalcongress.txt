secretaries of the labour exohange thew latter explained that tho building in which the congress was assembled was only a part of thetlabur exchange which was now in course ofionstructibn anld would cost Â£lwoluibelecting workmen as municipal councillors they had enforced the doctrine that aspublic itoney was spent to buildstock exchangesr and lotlier structures for the use of the middle classes so also ought public funds to be disposablefoir tho special benefit of the working classes hence they had nowr not only the labour exchanlge of paris but similar institutions at m arseills nines lyons st jetienne c montpellier bor deaun toulouse and other towns the secre taries of the paris labour exchange were woll pleased to be able to receive tho miners of dhferent countries in txe house that belonged to the organized workers of paris and wished every success to the congressafter these words of welcome had been trans lated into german and english i philippe and i ribanier writhdrew from the platform wvhich was at oneo odcupied by the committee of the miners international riederation consisting of mr t burt mip president lmr b piekard bip general secretary  m lamendin french secretary  m cavrot belgian secretary and herr chroeder german secretary ir pickard idp returned thanks to the workmen of all trades of paris who had placed the labour exchangehall at their disposal and to the paris municipality wvhich had taken so keen an iuterest in the welfare of the working classes le felt sure that the greater the freedomgranted for workingclass oiganization the more readily would the peoples ot the world unite and render wvars impossiblethe congress then proceeded to verify the credentials of the delegates this business occupied a considerable time ultimately it was showvn that  english delegates were present and the number of members of the societies and federations they representedwhen added together came to a grani total of sg germany had sent  delegates representing  minersand austriahlungary one delegate from bohemia who claimed to speak on behalf of  miners belgium was ropresented by  delegates who were appointed by  miners and france by  delegates who represent  miners the grand total is  delegates representing  miners this latter figure is not absolutely correct as some societies appear on the list in their separate capa city and then as members of a federation for some of the foreign delegates also the num ber of miners in a district have been taken and they do not all necessarily and regularly pay their subscriptions to their unions it would therefore be an exaggeration to say that the con gress represents close on a million miners who are financial members of trade unions but it is no exaggeration whatsoever to estinate the congress as representing more than half a million miners who are organized in trade unions and this smaller figure is in itself sufficiently impos ing to command general attentionthese facts being ascertained the congress adjourned and met again at  in the afternoon after a certain amount of discussion misurider standing and explanation the presidents secretaries tellers and other olficers of the con gress wvere elected  mr thomas burt mip who was elected president for the english language for the dayrose to deliver an inauigural address ele warmly congratulated the congress on its increased strength as shoiwn by comparing the figures mentioned above nith the number of miners represented last year at the jolimont congress not only had the trade unions been strengthened but greater freedom had been acquired in the different countries and especi ally in germany organization was the basis of all progress  on this at  least they were all agreed but the strength of their ciganization increased the weight of their responsibility the miners held in their hands the motive power of almost every other trade le hoped therefore they would all agreo not to act lightly and with out due reflection strikes wvero like wars they required selfcontrol discipline and ammuni tion it was for the congress to profit by its great force to build the edifice of the future not on sand but on the solid rock of discipline self sacrifice and thorough organizationm cavrot the belgian secretary was elected president for the firench language and resigned his right to spealk and herr schroeder theo pre si dent for the german language delivered only a brief address he said that after ah burts eloquent speech nothing remained but to pass from words to actions the germans entertained groat hopes as to tho results of this congress for their position had been very materially improved by the jolimont congress they had now no need of eloquence but must proceed to that prac tical international organization which was forced upon them b y tlhe international character of capital iie therefore brought the days business to a conclusion by quoting the words of carl marx  workers of the world uuiteour own
