the canadian pacificrailwyaynew york march in a conversation with a press representative today mr chauncey f depew president of the new york central railway said the canadian pacific railway has become the greatest road in canada and one of the largest systems on the continent of america a railway covering such a vast territory must if properly managed necessarily gather a great amount of business destined for the seaboard and i think that this class of business in the case of the canddian pacific railway is yet in its infancy it certainly cannot be otherwise than beneficial to new york to bring this increasing traffic here rather than permit it to go to other points of course new york can never secure the whole of the business because boston will naturally receive its share and the line to portland maine will have to be fed but the attraction of gravitation is in the direction of new york harbour and this with proper traffic agreements between tho new york central and canadian pacific railways will be sufficient to increase largely the proportion coming to this point the arrangement will be an undoubted benefit to the canadian pacific railway as it will have a direct and strong line into new yorkas far as the effect upon the other trunk lines is concerned it cannot be otherwise than beneficial the canadian pacific railway is at present and has always been a factor outside of the eastern and central traffic and trunk lines associations it is at present bound by no agreements and is under no obligations to submit to the rules of tbese associa tions but undoubtedly its appearance in new york with any strength will lead to its becoming a member of these associationswith the most beneecial resalts to the general railway system of the united states stronger and more intimate relations will grow between the canadian lines while the natural interchange of traffic between the united states and canada will become more vigorous the sentiment on both sides is for reciprocity  of this there can be no doubt i discovered during my recent trip along the st lawrence that the desire for reciprocity be tween the two countries is practically unanimoasthe new arrangement will undoubtedly give a great impetus to the business growth of ogdensburg and oswego ny aud incidentally to the other thriving commercial and manufacturing places of that region the manufacturing places especially will have the advantage of thelshort haul  for the sale of their pro ducts in canada while on the other hand the latters enormous lumber output will be of great assistance to new york state preventing as it will the famine which is now but a short way off owing to the rapid extinction of the americatk forestsdalziel the times speciala new cometmtount thailtoncaliporniamn nch a small but fairly bright comet with a tail of  minutes inx length was discovered by professor barnard t   on tuesday night at the lick observatory the positiorn being right ascension one hour ten minutes and tet seconds north declination  degrees  sminutes moving rapidly southward in the direction of the son at the rate of one degree wler day whieh willsoon carry it out of sight this is the th comet that has been discovered by professor barnarddadzielthe marquis of dufferinrome marcih the marquis of dufferin took his departure from rome last nigh on leave of absencercuteranmrmcan sealers smaillg underbritish coloursottawa march the attention of the dominion authorities has been drawn to the fact that the owners of american scaling vessels are registering their ships in canada in the name of canadian citizens in this way they secure the protection of the british flag while trying to evade the laws of their countrydalzidrussiast petersburg march the military tribanal of st petersburg has sen tenced prince vadbolsky a sublieutenant in the pavlovslcy regiment of the guard to three years detention in a fortress in consequence of his recent duel in which he killed his opponent m monossoff who was a lieutenant in the sanme regimentrcutcr
