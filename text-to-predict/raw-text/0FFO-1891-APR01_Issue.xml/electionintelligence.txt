election intblligenobworth eligoearly yesterday morning both sections of the nationalists commenced active canvassing operations in north sligo in both town and country and the day was consequently very quiet in the evening a mass meeting was held in the townhall sligo in support of alderman collery the antiparnellite candidate mr michael davitt who received a tremendous ovation on rising to speak referred to the refusal of the mayor to allow themh the use of the townhall on the previous evening and said that it was better that they had not broken in the door of the hall on that occasion by waiting they had done a good service as that large meeting fully showed he would make a few references to one or two speeches delivered by mr parnell within the last few days mr parnell addressed a gathering at farnaharpy on monday and took occasion to refer to what happened at dromore west on snnday he boasted that mr sexton and his friends had to retire precipitately towards sligo in consequence of attacks made upon them that was the language used by a man who a short while ago occupied the prominent position of a constitutional leader in the politics of the three countries the speech at farnaharpy instead of being advice to the people to restrain themselves and not to be cowardly rowdies was one in which mir parnell directly incited his followers to use sticks and stones and batons if mr parnoll could find food for boasting in conduct like that he was very sorry for him and pitied him and he regretted for the honour of their country that mr parnell should have gone so far as to laud conduct wvhich was nothing less than the worst possible rowdyism it was true that the antiparnellite party came back to sligo from dromore west bnt they did not run away as if they had cared to trail the cause of ireland in the dust if they were as reckless as mr parnell and thought as little of their characters as he did they could have given battle to the roughs of dromore west and have held their own and put the stone throwers to the rightabout cheers they were resolved however not to accept that kind of challene honourable challenges thrown down to them they took up when they would not bring per manent disgrace upon the conntry cheers he for one would never encourage irish nationalists to resort to violence of that kind against other irish nationalists it was known right well what would have been the effect of a general free fight in dromore lvest upon the cause of ireland as it was viewed and looked at from great britain america and elsewhere the people outside the country would say that they were reducing ireland to the condition of a pandemonium and turning the national cause into a huge faction fight and that the people who would resort to that would prove them selves unworthy of havine the blessings of irish national selfgovernment n sunday they the anti parnellites acted with calmness courage and dignity they saved the character of their country and their cause and every truehearted nationalist wdnld sayafter reading the previous days proceedings that the victory in reality rested with them and that defeat and disgrace were on the other side cheers mr parnell had said that the violencefirstcommenced with the icarthyites attack on him at castlecomer in kilkenny but that was not so as it commenced at ballinakill fair with the parnellites and that the affair at castlecomer was a result of the tactics at the former place early in the day he did not encourage the young men of castlecomer to continue those tactics but reprimanded them and denounced those tactics on the spot but that was not what mr parnell had done opponents should be fought whether english or irish by upright and manly methods and so long as that struggle between mr parnell and the majority of the irish party con tinued he wvould to the best of his ability restrain those on the antiparnellite side from resorting to the blackthorn arrangement or the policy of stone throwing mr parnell had also boasted that at the time of his meeting in farnaharpy  mr davitt was in hiding at enniscrone like many ofir parnells statements that was absolutely untrae for at the very time he was within half a mile of the meeting canvassing for alderman collery mr parnell was always talking aboat the leadership and was exceedingly anxious about it and having repeatedly declared that there was only one man capable of leading the irish division it followed that whenever he was talking about the question of leadership it was with the object of proving that nobody hut himself was capable of filling that position mir parnell undertook to criticize the qualifications of three men who were opposed to him and the manner in which that highbred gentleman the man of university education referred to the men who had been working longer in the irish cause than he had been was first of the foulmouthed healy cheers for healy everything that had been said by mlr realy during the controversy had been founded on truth and if in mlr parnells opinion that language was foulmouthed what must mr parnells conduct have been when it gave rise to such language  cheers mr parnell had also referred to ir sexton whose splendid service to the country completely refuted mirparnells slander and then he referred to their humble servant as the hysterical davitt cheers and laughter and said that he had not belonged to any party for more than  hours ile might have his faults and have committed a fair share of mistakes but he had never boasted of his performances and qualifications or his virtues and never for one moment in his life had he aspired tobe leader of the irishraceandno one wasmore alive to his own disqualifications than himself cheers be had been doing humble work in the rank and file in irelands army fighting for ireland and enlisted in it  years ago long before mir parnell was heard of ontside the ancestral mansions of avondale cheers mlr justin hicarthy was a  man and was qualified to lead the irish party as he was willing and had declared that the party should be led on the principles of democratic government of the people for the people cheers ir parnell band recently developed tremendous anxiety for the welfare of the artisans and labourers of ireland that newborn zeal had excited a great deal of amusement to the trade unionists and organized work ing men of ireland and the whole of great britain mr parnell assumed sympathy far the working men that he did not really feel in his heart for if he had been a friend of the cause of the working men he would have spoken upon those subjects years ago cheers mr davitt said the latest programme mr farnell had producedone of  or  others might be called the sligo programme and instead of the  eight hours work and eight hours play eight ours rest and ss a day it should be  iighthours work and eight hours play and eight hours in the company of   a voice kitty oshea andlaughter mr davitt concluded his address by referring to the labour question in detailmr mhugh a local gentleman said that mr parnell had rnade several false statements about him on saturday last and he would
