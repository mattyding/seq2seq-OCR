death of lord granvillewe learn with great regret that earl granville died yesterday afternoon le had been suffering for some weels from an abscess which had formed on the side of his face this produced extreme prostration his constitutionbeingalreadywealened by occasional attacks of gout although he rallied several times his friends were never relieved from gravo anxiety during tho whole period of his ill ness oe passed away peacefully at the residence of his nephew mr georgo lovosongower mp in south audleystreet at a few minutes before  oclock yesterday eveninglord granville was attended in his illness by sir andrew clark sir james paget and dr reginald harrison during the last few weels very numerous inquiries have been made as to his condition and messages of sympathy have been sent by the queen tho prince of wales and other members of the royal family the callers at eouth audleystreet included the leaders of both political parties and many imembers of the house of commonsthe news of the sad event was telegraphed to the queen at grasse and a special messenger was sent to miarlborough house to acquaint the prince of wales who had arrived there a few hours previously from sandringham his royal highness at once drove to south audleystreot and paid a visit of condolence a large number of cardswere left at the house yesterday and intho evening among them being those of the french ambassador lord mionklbrettonthedowager lady londonderry lord tweedmouth mer w h smith athe earl of cawdor viscount cross viscount weymouth sir lyon playfair sir eaward thornton the earl of st gernans sir robert peel and viscount hoodgranville george levesongower second earl granville was born in  the year in which his father was raised to the peerage when honours earned in the wartime were being distri buted after the crowning victory of wyaterloo the first lord granville a younger son of the miarquis of stafford had been a diplomatist of considerable distinction in  he had gone to st peters burg on a similar mission to that which subse quently was to be confided to his son and had attended the coronation of alexander as our am bassador extraordinary in  he was minister at paris and his son who had been educated at eton and oxford was attached for a time to the legation but the actual apprenticeship the young man served to regular diplomacy was a short one  and in  he was returned to parlia ment as member for morpeth three years after wards hewas appointed to the office of undersec retary for foreign affairs but ho had then little opportunity of gaining official experience for in a short time tho melbourne ministry was broken up having lost his seat for morpeth in  he came backl to the house of cormnons as representative for lichfield and tho clever young aristocrat mado himself somewhat conspicuous for thevigour and ability with which he advocated the cause of the anticorn law leagtuo and tho principles of free trade five years later on the death of his father he took leave of the commons to many rising politicians that involuntary exchange has been the death of hopes and the grave of ambi tions probably lord gcanville rather gained by it for not only wvere his temperament and his talents for debate better suited to the more sereno atmosphere of tho ijpper house but the change re moved him from a sphere where hewvas overshadowed by rivals who were to share the lead of the liberal party for many years to come it is certain at least that had he not been in the peers ho would never havebeen thought ofas possible prime minister in  meanwhile hehad been made master of the buckhounds that ornamental post seemed admirably suited to one who notwithstanding his spirited speeches on free trade had been chiefly thought of as a graceful courtier and polished man of the world and thero was a very general outcry when in  lord john russell trans formed the master of the buckhounds into his president of the board of trade mr bright spoke the mind of the manufacturing interest withmore than his accustomed bluntness and lord john russell resented with constitutional heat a very farfetched charge of nepotism jir bright had the grace to avow afterwards that lord johns penetration had not been in fault as a clearheadecl and energetic man of business lord granville gave proof of those versatile abilities which marked him out a year or two later as vicepresident of tho commission for the international exhibition in that capacity his geniality and his business powers won him golden opinions from all conditions of men his closer relations with her majesty and the prince consort confirmed if they did not originate the warmpersonal regard which those illustrious per sonages always expressed for him while foreign exhibitors and especially our frenchfriendswere never weary of praising the unfailing courtesy and the winning polish of manner they were so well fitted to appreciate perhaps fewv things did more to foster the entente cordiale which was to exercise so important an influence in european politics than the manner in which lord granville reprosented his country at the feles offered to tle english commissioners by the paris municipality in honour of the exhibition  and in particular his speech at the banquet of the htel de ville was overpraised as a triumph of oratory by an audience ho flattered by his command of their languagein  for a short time as usual he was tan talized by the exercise of real power in the post for which he was marked out by his trainind and his tastes in a few months he was callet to the foreign office and he was not to return to it for nearly twenty years ot many statesmen indeed had to practise more incessantly the diffi cult virtues of patience and selfdenial and the tale of the subordinateorornamental appointments he successively held is in fact the secret history of arrangements and compromises between lords palmerston aberdeen russell and ciarendon whenhe consented to take thoplaceof lordpalmer ston in  we suspect he regarded the appoint ment rather as a sacrifice to party loyalty than as a gratifying recognition of ilis claims hie could have had no illusions as to the permanence of the russell inistry after its chief had broken with his masterful ally the death of peel had left palmerston the most prominent of our statesmen especially in the eyes of foreigners he had flattered the national pride by his highhanded assertion of the national honour his famous  gavi romanus sum which was no idle boast had passed into a household word and he had just carried off a grand triumph in the famous bon pacifico affair his successes and popularity had somewhat turned his head and he had as serted his independence of action carelessly and indeed aggressively the queen bad complainedrepeatedly of despatches that were altered after her approval lord john russell was the last maan to care to know himself reduced to a cipher in his own cabinet and the cause of offence that broke the back of the camel came when lord palmerston overrode the official instructions to our mlinister in paris by hastening to express to the emperors representative in london a hearty approval of the coup dat lord palmerston fell gracefullyand nothing could be in better taste than the moderation with which he accepted the rebulkes he had provoked or his reticence when he might have explained or coloured his conduct but it wvas popularly believed that hehad been sacrificed to reactionary influences from abroad and thus lord granville succeeded to his office underpeculiar difficulties but his habitual tact stood him in good stead and he had certainly lost no credit on the resignation of the mlinistry it was in  as wa have said that the queen sent for him lord derby had resigned on the carrying of the vote of want of confidence which lord hart ington had been chosen to move as mouthpiece of the allied liberals the choice of a premier wvould obviously have lain between lord palmer ston and lord john russell but it was doubtful whether either would yield to tho other  and it was thought that the difficulty might possibly be overcome by going to the lords for a chief of the cabinet lord john settled the question in a somewhat unexpected fashion he declined totake office under lord granville but declared himself quito willing to serve under lord palmerston and perhaps lord granville was not dis appointecl at being released from a responsibility which muiust have weighed heavily on him ashead of the ministry he must have been driven to choose between the mortifying rdle of a r oi faingant and an incessant struggle against con flicting forces he could hardly hope to controlthe fact of the queens having sent for him on that occasion caused him to be talked of again as a possibla premier on ihe death of lord palnier ston but with the exception of the chairman ship of the royal commission of the exhibition of  and his appointment to the lord warden ship of the cinque pcrts in  his public life continiued uneventful till mrgladstone tool office in  the new ministry was rich in intel lectual power  the difficulty was to distribute places in an embarrassment of pretensions  and as lord clarendon seemed to have a prescriptive right to theoforeign office to lord granville was assined the colonies his administra tion of theso was marked by that transfer to canada of the greater part of the vast dominions of the hudsons bay company which provoked the revolt in the red river and made lord wolseleys reputation but apart from the im mediate duties of his department his position in the lords taxed all his capabilities in supporting the irish measutes of his chief hle was not a great orator  he never broke out in the brilliant perorations which sway the feelings and confuse the judgment but he showved a power of lucid arrangement with a command of hardlheaded argument for which he had hardly as yet re ceived sufficient credit his imperturbable good humour never failed him even when his temper must have been sorely tried  and though his weapons were neither sarcasm nor invective vet he taught his opponents that on occasion he could bo a dangerous enemy a quick thrust and the spatkling rapier wound pierce to the very marrow if it left nothing behind it to rankle in the wound then as often afterwards he showed that strong practical sense which was a conspicucus featuro of his intellect a measure might be unwelcome and lend itself to damaging criticism but the question was wvhether circum stances and the changes in them had not made something of the kind unavoidable if so it was mere waste of breath disputing upon things as they possibly might have been whilo speculating on remote contingencies was hardly less unprofit able so ho would often argue earnestly and con scientiously for measures as ho had often to develop and defend systems of policy for which in the abstract he had little liking in  it fell to him to move in the lords the second read ing of the irish church bill seldom had he greater occasion for the display of adroitness selfcontrol and conciliatory temper there was a strong feeling that the english church was being menaced indirectly through the irish esta blishment  that the measure was subversive of vested rights and a beginning of the letting out of waters lord granville maintained that the bill must be judged on its merits and its ne cessities happily the abuses of the irish church system were altogether exceptional the leader of the liberal minority appealed to the house on much the same grounds which in fluenced lord salisbury when he recommended his followers not to divide against the more revo lutionary iand bill of  free and powerful as the house of lords undoubtedly was there was one thing than which it was less powerful and that was the clear expression of the national will he wound up with an earnest and un usually impassioned appeal to his hearers to look at the question as if ireland wereothe stronger and england the weaker and oppressed country in  he adopted very similar tactics and argu ments in introducing the land billit wls in that year on the death of lord claren don that he went to the foreign office to lie on anythinn but a bed of roses the outbreak of the francoerman war had upset the balance of power in europe  and both belligerents were savagely sensitive to those  infractions of neu trality  which demonstrated our impartiality he had been assured by the permanent offlicials in the department on becoming foreign secretary that the world had never been more profoundly at peace the halcyon calm was ruffled iimme diately the first burning question that was broached was that of the neutrality of belgium mir gladstone more suo provoked irritation and awakened uneasiness by the reserve of his atti tude in the house of commons probably lord granville remonstrated  certainly he spoke out manfully and decidedly in the upper house he said  the government knew their duty and were resolved to abide by the position they had taken up the upshot was that new hipartite treaty by which england france and prussia undertook to maintain the quintuple enagenent of with those obligations wlvcic subsequently gave occasion for the subtle interpretation of lord derby lnext russia seized on the opportunity of the war to announce her intention of withdrawing from her engagements as to the black sea she scarcely troubled herself over the impossible task of finding a decent pretext for the repudiation she had judged and judged rightly that england would not go to war alone lord granvilles original despatch on the subject was of course unanswerable as he put it simply no single party to a contract can withdraw wvithout the assent of the rest but the real question was felt to be whether russia had secured the complicity of prussia mr odo russell was sent to versailles to try and find out it became clear that bismarck while de claring that he had not sanctioned the step had no intention of breaking with russia in any case but on the assumption that england would not fight he suggested a conference of the lowers as a graceful way out of the difflculty lord gran ville was forced to admit as raiton dgtre of the conference that the abrogation of a solemn treaty might be an open question by way of soothing our national susceptibiliies an ingenious proto col wias devised which solemnly stated the indisputable fae that no state could releaso itself from engagements without the consent of the parties to which it was pledged so the con ference formally met to register a foregone con clusion and knock oi the fetters that chafed the czar it must have been mortifying to the high spirit of lord granville when he had really to swallowv his own words and withdrawv from his impregnable attitude as champion of inter national morals hle had more success in his correspondence with count bernstorff who had remonstrated against the malevolence of our neu trality  and his powerful state papers were admitted to be masterpieces in that delicate style of composition on the other hand he had to meet the proposals of the french government of national defence thatengland should interpose between the belligerents as mediator on the basis of the neutrality of french territory to any one but a beaten and desperate combatant casting about for a chance of escape from the worst con sequences of the strnggle any scheme of the kind was obviously impracticable england could only mediate by consent of both partiesa con sent which germany would never give  and m chaudordys proposition really meant that england should interfere actively as an ally while lord granville intimated as much incourteous language he did all that lay in his power to bring count bismarok and  thierstogether hoping that something might bo gained for france by th eloquence of tho veteran states man he appealed repeatedly against the bom bardment of paris and exerted himself to arrangce the terms of an armistice and at home as abroad throughout the embittered struggle he occupied the invidious position of having to defend his consistent neutrality against fervent sympathizers with the conquerors and the con quered the feeling in england from the first had run decidedly in favour of the germans  and the french emperor was gene rally blamed for wantonly rushing on his fate the freneh smarting from their losses sufferings and humiliations keenly felt ourwant of sympathy  and lord granville had to answer the unreasonable appeals of men who main tained that by upsetting a government they had purged themselves from responsibility for the misfortunes it had courted nor wefe they themoreready to forgive him that he had borne a leading partin the benevolent arrangements for revictuallin paris and that he had previously instructed tle members of our french legation to do all in their power for the assistance of re fugeesin  his diplomatic ability was again tried to the uttnost a new commercial treaty was to be negotiated with frenchmen who were anything but kindly disposed towards us  while our longpending disputes with the victorious americans were brought up for adjustment by international arbitration the language in which the american  case  was stated set iall precedents of interna tional civility at defiance the bitterness with which mfr sumner had agitated the claims seemed to have inspired the formal statement of them nor was it merely the tone of the representa tives of the united states that was offensive the temper in which they approached the ques tion was even more conclusively shown by the demand for damages said to have been indirectly incurred by the launch of the alabamaand her consorts which included avith the loss to the shipping interests pretty nearly the whole ex penses of the wvar and was estimated vaguely at from  to co millions sterling the insolence and the wild extravagance of the american bill of costs roused the indignation of the british nation no mlinistry that did not peremptorily reject a claim so preposterous could have retained its popularity for a week yet on the other hand it was adrnitted by most calmthinking men that the americans had a legitimate grievance and the ministry had determined that if possible it must be redressed in fact tho offensive con duct of the negotiations was a strong reason for removing the root of bitterness that must have been at the bottom of it lord granville felt this and fully justified his character for firmness blended with flexibility with bland decision he never wavered in his refusal to admit the indirect claims  but at the same time he gave convincing proofs of the sincerity of his desire to see all differences amicably settled the british agent was instructed to take no part in the proceedings till those indirect claims were categorically aban doned but when that was done the arbitration went forwardunder conditions made transparently favourablo to the americans  since it could only be found that liability attached to us by in venting the famous retrospection rules lord chief justice cockburn in a masterly docu ment exposed the fallacies which in his opinion had influenced the tribunal and its decision was received in england with mortification if notdis approval all that can be said is that as with the renunciation of the black sea clauses it was a case in which we had to make the best of an un fortunate dilemma sacrificing for the sake of peace and goodwill something that almost touched the national honour lord granville had the habit of such ungrateful and disagreeable tasks and he evinced his patriotism by charging himself with a duty which no other of his colleagues could have performed as efficiently so in the following year we find him excostulating with russia as to her advances in central asia comnt schouvaloff was intrusted by his master with a special mission and theenvoy with many fair words assured us that the armies of the czar after chastising the xhivans would definitely evacuate the trouble some ehanate of very similar value as it proved was the assurance given by prince gortchakoff that russia would thenceforth abstain from interference in the internal affairs of afghanistan but if the russians proved false to their wcrd our foreign miinister cannot be held responsible he was forced to profess himself satisfied with their solemn pro mises when it was impossible to exact substantial guaranteesin  disausted by the succession of elec toral defeats that had culminated in the stroud election mlr gladstone startled the country with the announcement of a dissolution in spite of the proffered bribe in the shape of the abolition of the incometax the answer of the constituencies was decisive it was in a letter to lord gran ville that the lately allpowerful premier an nounced his probable retirement from public life intimating that he might possibly divesthimself of all the responsibilities of leadership at no dis tant time  and that he should only occasionally attend the house of commons when the liberals left leaderless by the defection of their great chief chose lord rartington to fill his place in the rouse of commons naturallyg an increased share of responsibility de volved on lord granville in the lords as critic of a foreign policy which he could not control ho vindicated the consistency of his earlier politi cal life by still setting necessity or expediency before dipity when it seemed that standing on our dignity miaghr cost us too dear the position he took up in the debate on the berlin memoran duma illustrates our meaning  the three em perors  had come to a decision on their line of conduct towards turkeyunceremoniously inviting the assent of the western powers by telegraph lord granville had he been foreign minister would have assented for england believing that the concert of all the powers would have assured peace in the meantime re would not have scrutinized the procedure of the emperors too closely their attitude towards turkey might have been highhanded  but then the end would have justifiea the means as he put it familiarly if a peaceable individual interferes with a drunken man undoubtedly there will be a row if six policemen come up the drunken man knocks under but the conservative cabinet judged the situation differently or rather they took a broader viewthat embraced the future with the risks to us that might arise out of mischievous precedents lord beaconsfield made it a ques tion of the national honour england had been slighted and was bound to marlk her senso of the slight under pain of having to fight sooner or later for her prestige while lord derby with his habitual caution suspected secret understand ings to which we might stand rashly committed and the behaviour of the three statesmen on that important occasion was eminently characteristic of each of them lord beaconsfields much abused imperial policy was the outcome of a fore thought which perhaps gave excessive regard to the l nland of the future and which may have troublea itself over superfluousprecautionsagainst contingencies wlhich might never occur while lord granville was more disposed to live through the day and to leave the morrow to take care of itselfon the springing of the grand surprise on lord beaconsfields last ministry lord granville was again sent forto consultwith thequeen but in fact the nation had spoken with an unmistakable voice the great majority was mir gladstones ownand none but mr gladstone could be the coming premier lord granville went back to the foreign office where his place was by no means a sine cure tbough his services to tlhe european concert wlhich secured the cession of territory to mion tenogro and greece were more unobtrusive than conspicuous inan proposes but god disposes mr gladstone had congratulated the country on the prosperity of irelanai all things considered radical irish legislation as we know on the authority of the duke of argyll had never been contemplated by the liberal cabinet  yet tho attention of the country was to be engrossed by a vital home question and the session of  was monopolized by the irish land ill owing to an unseasonable attack of illness lord granville was absent from the discussion of that momentous mneasure on its second reading in the lords  and when it was so searchingly analyzed by well informed critics tho government could ill spare one of its ablest speakers he had shown imme diately before his accustomed abilitv in his correspondbnce on the tunis affair setting forth in explicit language the interests of england in the mediterranean and his determination to maintain them he elicited assurances from m barthelemy st rilaire which so far as words go left nothing to desire re could do no more in the niean time than assure us of i moral sympathy  in the unfortunate event of future complicationshowever goodtempered and adroit lord gran ville showed himself as leader of the house of lords throughout the period of mr glad stones second administration he was doomed to be less happy in the proper business of his de partment though bred in tho purple of diplomacy and possessing a wide and intimate know ledge of continental statesmen and their policies lord granville was always rather supple than strong and his french connexions and tastes drewihimno doubt quite unconsciously into a sort of opposition too feebly and spasmo dically manifested to have any potent and per manent effect towards prince bismaroks system it was his illfortune that after he came into office with his chief as representative of a purely domestic policy repeating the old watchwords of peace retrenchment and reform eircumstances brought him face to face in rapid succession with a series of diplomatic difficulties in every quarter of the globe for which neither his stock of rather oldfashioned maxims nor his experience in years of prosperous tranquillity made him a match to tell at length the story of lord granvilles administration at the foreign officebetween  and  would be to recapitulate the external histoty of the empire dtiring a period of extraordinary disturbance and alarm the treaty of berlin proved to be a more stable arrangement than lord beaconsfields critics were willing to admit as has been proved by the fact tbat with slight modifications it has secured for nearly  years the stacus qguo in europe still the preceding storm left a ground swellbehind it with whieh lord granville had tol deal though this was the least part of his task wven the porte had been compelled by the dulcigno demonstration to fulfil its immediate obligations franco began to mako her power felt in northern africa and after her acquisition of a dominating authority over tunis had been substantially recognized there was no more to be said except to register a somewhat tardy resolution that in tho future the interests of the british empire would be watchfully safe guarded lord granville it must not be forgotten was popularly identified with the system of neglecting and disparaging the imperial re lations with the colonies and he was credited rightly or wrongly with the responsibility for the surrender to the victorious bcers after the majuba hill disaster in this condition of feeling which was not confined to the united kiingdom may be found the explanation of the long hesitations and the sudden resolves the vacillating movements and the ambiguous expla nations which male the confused record of the egyptian difficulty duringr four eventful years a pro lem that will puzzle the historians of the th century in  at any rate the egyptian question was sprung upon a perplexed cabinet not wholly united on the subject if rumour may be trusted and lord granville was confronted with the changing developments of the problem that led certainly by no reasoned process to the joint note the bombardment of alexandria the campaign of telelkebir the restoration of the khedive under british direction and tutelage and lord dufferins famous despatch these breathless sensations into which a ministry hampered with the peace pledges of  had been plunged and in which they had parted company with mr bright seemed to have passed away for the momentbut no sooner had order been reestab lished at cairo than lord granville was beset by two spectres which pursued him to the close of his term of officethe suez canal controversy and the soudan imbroglio lord granvilles efforts to cope with these multiplied embarrassments were signalized rather by good intentions than by practical tact the conven tion for the management of the canal provision ally concluded in  had to be dropped in view of the vehement resistance of the british shipowners who contended that it would place the commercial and political interests of this counthy at the mercy of france and i le lesseps if the plan had been persisted in a parlia mentary defeat would have been almost inevitable and in the then state of home politics that was a danger to be avoided at all hazards so it was with the question of the soudan after the destruction of hicks pashas armv and the defeat of baker pasha another parliamentary crisis was avoided for the moment by sending general gordon to khartoum but the ambiguity of this mission qualified by later messages to gordon from the foreign office was destined to leave the brand of  indelible disgrace for which indeed lord granville himself was probably in a very slight degree responsible on the foreign policy of the ministry still less had he any personal re sponsibility for the delays to which it was due that the expedition up the nile after heroic efforts arrived at khartoum just too late to save the hero who had devoted his life for the honour of his country and the cause of humanity neverthe less it is always injurious to the credit of a statesman to be associated with a succession of failures and lord granvilles management of the egyptian question all round inspired little confidence at home and was treated with insolent contempt abroad an open breach occurred with france on the subject of a temporary reduction of the interest on the debt  while at the same time prince bismarcli who had watched lord granvilles policy with unconcealed dislike began to cause trouble in africawhere the british foreign offlce had temporized rather foolishly with german pretensions and evaded a plain settlement and had also entered into an unwise agreement giving up the lower congo to the portuguese now so difficult to dealith on the zambesi the result was not only that we had to yield to german pressure at angra pequena and the cameroons but that a conference of the powers was convoked at berlin to settle the future conditions of the  scramble for afriea but for this the question of  spheres of influence  would never have grown to its present importance and england would have stood practically alone as the civilizing power in the  dark continent itwas not only in africa that the actionor rather the inactionof the foreign office jeopardized british interests the colonists of australasia were frantic on discover ing that the representatives of the mother country had allowed germany to establish formidable pretensions in new guinea and france to assert herself in a highly unpleasant way in the south pacific they failed to recognize the force of lord granvilles ingenuous apology that the british government was  quite unprepared  for the practical assertion of claims which by diplomatic lachies had talken a character of substantial reality the discontent with the policy of the foreign office had assumed very serious proportions at home as well as in the colonies even before the russian crisis of  in which it was seen once more that our diplo macy had been hoodwinked and overreached t
