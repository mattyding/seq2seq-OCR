dissatisfied with the americandelay in adjusting tho matters arising out j of the recent lynching of italian prisoners at new orleans italy apparently desires that the united states should immediately take the full responsibility for the killing of italian subjects which under the american form of government it is impossible to assume at this stage the state of louisiana boing primarily interested and the president deferring action pending the investigation in that statethe action of italy in suddenly recalling her miinister is in american opinion hasty and ill adcvised unnecessarily involving two nations in a possibly serious difficultythe investigation has not yet proceeded far enough for official announcement to be mnade whether any of the persons lynched were actually italian subjects the american government is raady to act in a proper manner but this sudden procedure complicates the situation by its ap parent hasto and discourtesy the prebident may convoke congress to consider the zituation with a view to meeting all possible contingenciesthe special reason given in baron di favas letter of recall is that the king of italy is dis satisfied with the progress of the adjustment betweer the two countries in regard to the new orleans massacrethe situation has been gravely complicated by reports from florence to the effect that some american citizens had been soized deprivod of their passpocts and imprisoned in that town this wvill compel tho united states to tako action the cabinet has been considering the subject todayour oan correspondentwashington lancu baron di fava tho italian mlinister today presented to the state department letters of recall which he had received from the italian govern meat this step caused great surprise at the department as it was wholly unexpected and the investigation of the new orleans lynching case is not yet completedlvaterthe star this evening states that baron di fava felt compelled to withdraw from the country but is ieaving the marquis imperiali di francavilla the secrotary of legation in charge of current affairs tho journal adds that the barons passports swill of course be handed to him at oncereferring to the political aspbet of the matter the star describes the situation as so now and scriotus that no official expressions of opinion can be obtained at this hour from any sourcetime must be allowed for the administration to think and except that the cabinet was in session for two hoors today it has as yot had no oppor tunity to digest the facts in a calm manner it is stated that pfr blame will rimake an official announcement tomorrow of baron di favas re call possibly containing an expression of the viers of the united states government but in the meantime the muinisters pleasant relations with the state dapartment and the country will have been severed it is doubtful whether in view of the extraordinary circumstances of the recall there will be the formalities at the white house usual on the occasion of the departure of a ministerthe sar says i when the affair is looked at from a distance of time it will appear to have been verr much hurried tho letter from governor nicholls to mr blaine caused the trouble it was received here several days ago ancl a copy was sent at once to baron di lava this of course gave it the appearance of an ultimatum from thiis government and it appears that the baron accepted it as such and cabled it in that character to his govetnment baron di fava has worked his home interests to the degree of appearing overzealous at this end of tlhe line but todays developmaents would indicate that there could not be too much zeal on his part to suit his govermment wvhich appears to have made the matter an issue of the highest importancethose commenting on the surprising event of today agree that to break away from this govern maent is not merely an act of discourtesy but of open hostility to have done it peiding the investigation now in progress at nev orleans is sigurficant it is said of an utter disregard of the onventionalities and cthics of nodern diplomacy indeed in that light this government now has logical reason for feeling affronted at this lack of faith in its assurances on the part of its hot headed neighbour it will probably turn out that the italian governniant has acted very hastily and has unnecessarily involved two nations in a serious difficultythe journal concludes by declaring that arbitra tion would have been the proper course to pursue when once the quzestion of the citizenship of the aen killed at i ew orleans had been settledbaron di favain presentinghis ietters of recall declared that the united states not having given assurances that tho murderers of the italian suiects acquitted by american magistrates and murdlered in prison while under the imme diate protection of tho authorities of knew orleans wonld be brought to justice italy found lherself under the painful necessity of showing openly her dissatisfaction by recalling his majestys mtinister froni a country where tlle italian repre sentative was unable to obtain justicenew yore rtritmcir a special telegram received here from washing ton
