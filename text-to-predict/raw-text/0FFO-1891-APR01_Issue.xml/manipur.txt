maknipurmanipur is a small native state in north eastern india situated in the heart of the mouitainous region which lies between theassam valley on the north upper formerly independent burmah on the east and south and the chachar district on the west until  not only the number of inhabitants but even the area of the state was a matter of great uncertainty but in that year the census disclosed the fact that there were  people this figure being nearly three times as great as that given in so recent an authority as sir alexander mackenzies  north eastern frontier of bengal at the same time the area was ascertained to be  in lieu of  square miles the proximity of manipiun to the country of the lushais ikulds sutis ikagas and other wild hill tribes and the savage character of its own people have given rise to con stant feuds so that in early days the country was barbarous in the extreme manipuris used to raid into burmah and burmese intolmunipurwhile its internal history was marked by wars of the most savage and revolting type in which sons murdered fathers and brothers murdered brothers without a single trait of heroism to relieve the dark record of treachery and bloodshed ijntil recently slavery was a recognized institu tion and the socalled freed inhabitants vwere compelled nuder a system termed  laloop  to render ten days service to the rajah out of every  without remuneration othe hill ranges of manipur are clothed witb dense forest trees of great variety among whicli are teak and indiarubber miost of these immense tracts of timber are however unutilized sir a mackenzie says that the reion is generally rich but undeveloped while coal iron and gold have been found the tea plant is known to grow wild in various palts of the country although the general facial characteristics of the mlanipuris are fdongolian there is great diversity of feature amongst them some showing aregularityapproach ing the aryan type the chief road into the country is that leading from manipur to the dis trict of cachan which was constructed by the british govermment after the first angloburmese war and which is said to be in good condition fit for packbullocks in cold weather the valley is well supplied with tolerable roads which though not metalled are suitable for the ordinary trailic of the country tbe chief obstacle is the bridging of streams wvhich is done by the manipuris after a primitive fashion requiring yearly repairing after the flood season the revenue of the state is estimated at about rs to rso the military force consists of a sort of militia which is liable to be called out wvhen required and is believed to number in all about  including infantry artillery cavalry and ilregularsour present relations with the state may be said to have begun at the time of our first war with burmah manipur had been devastated by the burmese and its ruling family had fled to cachar upon which the british government cooperated with the manipuris in restoring gmbheer sing as rajah and secured his recog nition as ruler of mianipur in their treaty wvith ava gumbheer sing died in  and his son chandra kirti sing the late rajah wvas placed on the thron by the senaputty while the sena putty himself became regent the subsequent history of the state was marked by frequent at tempts on the part of diflerent chiefs to obtain the throne but all were frustrated and three of the leaders lost their lives for a time the throne was actually abdicated by the young rajab but in  he was restored and during the anxious time of themutiny his conductwas praiseworthy owing to manipur being too distant and difficult to be properly managed by the district officer at cachar from which it was separated by seven anges of hills each from ft to ft in heitght and four large rivers unfordablc during the greater part of the year it was found neces sary to station a resident at the capital who is now under the control of the chief comn missioner of assam the influence exercised by colonel mhculloch as political agent at zmanipur was most beneficial and since his time no one has been more successful than colonel johnstone who took charge in and rendered conspicuous service by raising the siege of kohima by the nagas in  the raids instigated by the rival members of the reigning family of manipur practically ceased in  but the lushais xamhows sooties and other neighbouring tribes have at various times committed robberies and other acts of violence on manipuri territory and have pro voked retaliatory measuresduring the last few years there have been occa sional insurrections against thd autbority of the maharajah sur chandra singh in september  scarcely three months after his public ina stallation there was an outbreak instigated by the wangkhairakpa who ranks next to tlhe senaputty and is the principal judicial officer in the state the revolt was quelled by the maha rajahs troops without any great difficulty and terminated with the death of the wangkhairakpa who was shot through the head while making a rush at the maharajahs private residence another unsuccessful attempt against the maha rajah was made by manipuri exiles under jogendra singh during the same month the rebels wrer pursued from cachar by a detach ment of the frontier police and finally defeated by a company of the th goorkha lightlufantry under lieutenant row who was despatched from manipur by the political agent mir primrose in  and  matters vwere quieter but a rather brutal case of flogging inflicted in the spring of the former year by order of the maha rajahs younger brother the senaputty or com mander of tho forces who is regarded as the in stigator of the present rebellion sheds some light on his subsequent behaviour the maharajab acting on the advice of the chief commissioner expressed his intention of banishingthesenaputty from the capital but the sentence was not carried into effect for some reason or other if we may regard the present conduct of the senaputty as tho sequel of this incident the leniency was sadly misplaced a present of arns was made to tho maharajah in   enfields being placed at his disposal in lieu of  smoothbore muskets together with  rounds of ball ammunition twvo pounder guns were also presented to his eighness for assistance rendered to our troops in burmah together wvith rounds of common and double shell and case shot and six martini rifles to the mabnrarahs brothers with  rounds of martini cartridges it is doubtless these very arms which are now said to have been turned wvith such terrible effect against our
