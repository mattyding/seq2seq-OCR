l the disastepr in manipurcalcutta incar nothing is definitely known yet regarding the ecent extraordinary occurrences in mianipurien the government has no trustworthy inforna tion beyond the facts that fighting was going on and that the wires were cut between ivanipur ud the two british frontier posts of kohima and tammoo the following may be taken as accu rate as far as it goesit will bo remembered that the blaharaiah was deposedl last september after a revolt headed by hlis second and third brothers known respectively as the jobrai or heir and the senaputty or commanderinchief the maha rajah with his fourth brother styled the lord of eiephants took refuge in india and are now in calcutta since thon the powver has been in the hands of the jobraj and the senaputtyour traditional policy in mfanipur is to recog nize the de faco ruler accordingly bmr quin ton proceeded thither intending to instal the jobra and deport the senaputty to india as being likely to prove troublesome

telegraphed yesterday since then  more men have reached kohima and the small guard which was stationed at langthobal abont four miles from manipur have arrived at tammoo on the burnmah frontier thoy state that they were attacked overpodwered acnd obliged to fall backit is difficult to ascertain the truth of stories repeated by inaccurate men but it seems clear that a suddon attack was made on the residency on tho night of the d and that fighting was still going onoon the th thereport that the troops ammunition was exhausted and that mlr quinton ordered the men to save themselves appears to be doubtfulit is stated that sir mlelville was killed soine where between blanipur and kohima that nr quinton colonel skbne lieutenant simpson and mr grimwood were made prisoners that mrs griimwood captain boileau and lieutenant gurdon have escaped in the direction cf cachar and that the residency compound and the chief commissioners tents were plundered and burnt it seems strange however that a compact force of  goorkhasbelonging to the fmnest regiments of the bengal army should have been routed by tho rude militia of an urwarlike people and it is not beyond hope that the party is intrenched and is still safemioreover a bcdy of  goorlhas under cap tain cowley was advancing on ranipur and was duo there on the tlt inst while lieutenant grant with  men was also advanciny from tammoo neitler of these bodies has been heard of but if they found mlr quintons and the residency escorts still holding together the combined forces might be able to keep tho mani puns in check for a long time a any rate there is reason to believe that the government has not given up hopethe cause of the sudden outbreak can only be conjectured probably the senaputty was the moving spirit perhaps the most likely supposition isthat tho lanipuris seeing a considerable bodyof troops with mir quinton feared that they were going to share tho fate of upper burmah and in a sudden burst of unreasoning fury resolved to attack themthe military authorities are taling prompt measures besides the troops already mentioned the following are to go to manipur tho st goorlhas and th sikhs the d bengal in fantry leave calcutta today for silchar and  goorkhas loavo golaghat for kohima at the end of the week it is understood that the th bengal infantry proceed to manipur at once from burmahthe line of advance has not yet been settled the state of alanipur is an almost circular basin surrounded by hillsand it is approached by three principal passesfrom kohima on the north cachar on tho west and tammoo on the south probably the difficulties of transport will render it expedient to send troops to all three basesthe expedition is not likely to meet with very serious opposition for mianipur is a weak and unwvarlike state without a regular army and as yet there is no reason to believe that the kukis nagas or lushai tribes will join it therefore the main ground for anxiety is the fate of mir quinton and his partyand without being unduly sanguine thero appear to be fair reasons to hope for their safetyour own correspondent by indoeutropean telegraphtangoox ltarcn si xteen sepoys who formed part of mr
