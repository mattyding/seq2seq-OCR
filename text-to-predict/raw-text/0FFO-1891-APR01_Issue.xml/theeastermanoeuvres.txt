the easter manceuyesrom un iihflaxy cob eondzntdover ifcea hooking back over the now conciuded easter campaign of  and comparing it with the numerous predecessors at which i have been present i feel that i can honestly say that the force continues to improve one is so accustomid to assume that among armed men the rank and filo intuitively obey the orders of their officers that the improved discipline of the volun teers is taken as a matter of course and attracts no attention that discipline in the field has made great progress any close observer must admit there is no longer an idea of argument cr suggestion but orders are obeyed promptly and without comment provided the officers know their work and do it there is no lack of discidline on the part of the mentill recently the pattern and the amount of equipment have differed widely  now there is ittle difference in either respect between corps except with regard to such details as the pattern of a haversack or a waterbottle to the best of my observation every volunteer on the ground was fully equipped wvith the exception of valises and one regiment did carry valises a large prc portion of battalions were also accompanied by one or more of their carts and i understand that arrangementsfor obtaining such additionax carts and horses as might be required have practically been mnade mloreover there is to each brigade a supply and transport officer whose duties at present contined niainly to observation would in the event of mobilization at once become im portautthe difficulty experienced in time of peace in doing anything outside the battalion is exempli fied by the brigade bearer companies i know of one caseand i fancy it is typicalin which the brigade surgeon an able and energetic man has done all he could to comply with the instruc tions and to organize a brigade bearer company  strong but in vain the medical officers of the different regiments have given their fall sup portbut the men only attended the lectures in vary insuficientnumbers it appears thatthev are afraid that they are to be taklen away from their own regiments mioreover tne captain of a company does not caro to let a good man go for bearer work the menl should be reassured on the sub ject of leaving their own regirments or have it pointed out to them that of course their own regiments would be first attended to and that brigading the various regimental detachments would only resemblo massing the bands for marching past in other ways also the brigade surgeon should have his hands strengthenedit was ordered that on monday ten rounds per man should be carried in carts to be served out under fire i presume this order was obeyed and undoubtedly it is right that all op portunities should be taken of practising that which would certainly have to be done in war and lwhich is a very difficult thing to do properlytheorists sneer at marching past which they say takes up valuable time and is a relic of the pigtail and pipeclay days they ask whether battles were ever won by march ing past practical soldiers and especially those who have had much to do with the volunteers take a different view of course too much time may be spent on marching past as on any other thing and assuredly a battalion might march perfectly and be very inefficient in the field on the other hand marching past is a great steadier and with the present tactics an occasional steadying is needed it is more over a test of drill and discipline above all it renders the service popular and the men like to be gazed at and applauded as they go past the saluting point this is especially the caso with the volunteers and i am convinced that with the great majority of the force easter mion lay would lose much of its attractions if the final march past were discontinued but the marching past should be better done distances better kept saluting improved one of the most useful subjects for reflection in connexion with the easter campaign is whether the time is employed to the best advantage at the outside there are only three full days for sunday is in variablygiven up to churchgoing andholiday this year friday seems at all events at dover and at poctsmouthtohave been given over to commanding officers to employ as they chose and as a rule they chose toemploy it in ordinary drll whether in so doing they made the most of their opportunities is tomy mind questionable it is true that many men cannot come down till late in the fore noon of friday but there are many who can and do arrive either on thursday evening or the first thing on friday morning in the arrangements of the day these are the men who should be con sidered but the fact that many men cannot arrive till late onthe forenoon of friday makes me regret the marching columns of previous days the advantaaeo of thesewas that the march shortened the raiiway journey and afforded scope for the tactical instruction of a compara tively small number of men by dividing even  men into two bodies of  men each and rmaking one the advanced guard of a pursling and the other the rearguard of a retreating army practical instruction in difficult operations could beimparted mistakes could be pointed out at each stage and every man would play a partl in the drama the laggards of the brigade could join after the days work was over f am sure that the marching columns were very popular with the force and the men gained in health as well as in knowledge of their dutiesone word in conclusion about the horsing of volunteer batteries wve have had an in stance of two different systems in both cases the horses are hired for the occa sion but in the one case the horses only are hirezl in the other the men are hired with their horses the disadvantago of the latter svstem is that if there is in peace a bad bit of ground the owner or driver says s thats more than my horses can do and he proceeds to detach them from the team in war he would probably consider exposure of himself or horses to the enemys shell a peril to be avoided at thefirst opportunity colonel hozier on tho otherand hires the horses which are ridden by his on men in uniform at woolwich he has a tegularlegal agreement wvith a contractor to the ieect that for drill purposes the corps is to be urnished with a certain number of approved orses at a moments noticeat so much percad per day the corps has its own harness a mobilization the necessary horses are taken bsolutely and at once at a price periodically evised by an officer representing colonel hozierrepresentative of the contractor and  veterinary surgeon there is very little haggling about prices colonel hozier could not on account of the prohibitive rates of the railway companies bring these horses to dover he was led to believe however that a contractor would supply his requirements on the spot the horses offered proved unsuitable and fresh horses had to be hired wherever they could be picked up and harness fitted to them yet with these untried horses colonel hozier on the monday made first a roughish march to theiendezvous then climbed fom there up a very steep height and came into action without keeping the other troops wvaitingl and finally ad vanced and took up a second position if all the volunteer batteries were as mobiie as those of the d kent the anxiety about that branch of the i

days had returned to town the mobilizaion at all places having come to an end the previous night many of the corps arrived in the metropolis in the very early hours having left their temporary

where they were again quartered on monday night after taking part in the lieldday at portsmouth  and the quarters at mlilton eastbourne warley and all the minor scenes of volunteer easter activity have now been vacated the variety in the times at which the many corps have returned home has not been caused so mnuch by railway necessities as by the desire to complete hour periods so that as large an amount of camping allowance as possible may be claimed bythe commanding officers yesterday morn ing toe the army service corps company which has been supplying blankets to the engineer column at
