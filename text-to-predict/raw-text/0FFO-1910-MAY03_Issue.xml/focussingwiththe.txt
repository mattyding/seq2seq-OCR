focussing with the handcameraone of the first difsulties to be encountered by the user of the handcamerawhether he comes fresh to photography or has passed through his novitiate with a stand camera is how to be quite sure that his picture is sharply in focus on the screen there are some who suppose that this difficulty is got over by the use of a  fixed foais camera but this is quite a mistake it is only as if a tailor were to determine to make all his suits to an average size regardless of the dimensions and pro portions of his sitters sometimes of course he would be fairly right but more often than not hopelessly wrong a  fixed focus camera does not give us everything always in focus but simply means that the camera maker has decided befotehand the distance at which most of our subjects are to be photo graphed if we want to get them sharp and has absolutely prevented us from adjuiting the camera to deal with othler distances since we could do as much for ourselves by ceasing to focus the camera nothing is gained but on the other hand much is lost by the use of an instrument of this designthe amateur who is tempted to buy a fixed focus camera with the idea that by so doing he is going to get rid of the trouble of focussing or of estumatmg distance is making a very great mistake he has stifi got to estimate distances to know what be can or cannot take or else he will waste many plates or films on blurred unprintable pictures while he may be quite sure that befome he has been at photography very long lie will be regretting that he did not get in the first instance a camera that allowed him to focus miost forms of hand camera are provided with an infinity mark a misnomac as the mark is not or at least shoiuld not be placed at the point at whichl objects infinitely distant are in focus by estending the camera to this mark the beginner may use it as a fixed focus instrument until he is in a position to appreciate the power of aiterai the extension to suut the subject being dealt wthithere are three methods of focussing at present in use for hand cameras the first and that most generally emwoyed is by altering the separation of the iuins and plate generally by racking the lens in or out the position of the plate with reirrence to the body of the camaera being fixed the second is by inserting in front of the principal lens a secondary one of more or less pcrwer according to the distance of the object that is tobe brought into focus these secaldary lenses being simple marnifying glasses as a rule are known as magnifieras the third sÂ«etem applic able only to the cooke iens at present is by altering the separation of the cononent parts of the complete lens and soaltering its focal lengthall three systems are alike in this that unless the camera is one of the aeflex type in which case thefirst system is invariably used they demand on the part of the photo grapher the power of judging distance in each case there is a scale of distances on the camera and the user must set a pointer to the mark on that scale which gives the distance at which he estimates the object to be hence the necessity for aciirmg the powar to judge distances rapidly and accuratelyalthough soime who use the hand camera never seem to acquire this power it is not because it is at all difficult but becausethey do not make a systematic attempt to master it one spare afternoon deliberatelr occupied in a series of trials will be quite aifcient to give the photographer a confidence in hi power to do what he has to do in that respect a confidence which will be justiid by the result hehas not to calculate great distances because with the lenses that are fitted to hand cameras a point is soon reachae usually not more than  or  yards away beyond which everything will be sharp if the mindi cator is set to the infinity maik the most important distances to estieaate are those from three to ten yards tlere are several ways in wlich the practice may be had one is to settle upon some object beforehand and a distance from it the distance being somewhere within the just nmtioned limits one then walks quickly towaidss the object stopping short at what is estimated to be the predetermined distance the estimate is then checked by aotual measurementt and any one who does this a few times will be quite surprised to find how rapidly he acquires the desired power another plan may be put in hand during a country walk and that is to stop fromt time to time estimate quickly the dstance of some object and then check it by actual measurement one must take care not to get into the habit of practising always with one particular distanceit is curious that one has quite a distinct tendency to do sothe comparative merits of different methodsof focussing are eaily summed up thesystem of magiliflers has the advantage that it is very cheap to construct the lenses are generally mere uncorrected glasses and all that has tv be provided is some arrangement for bringing one or other in front of the main lens while their use does not interfere to any great extent wiath the definition of the lens it follows that being themselves uncorrected they must affect it to some extent and must affect it the moro the more powerful the magnifier the conse quence is that the system is only applied to comparatively cheap apparatus it may be well to mentioni how to determine the jocus of the magnifier to use on any particular occasion the rule is very easily remembered sincs it is simply this that if the original leis is fied so that the plate is at the infinity point practically this is what is done though it is not strictly so as already pointed outthe magnifier necessary to bring anv nearer object into focus must have a focal length equal to the distance of that object from the camerathe graduation on the focussing scle of a camera is usually accurate enough but it is well to check it to make sure as there is always a possibility that the lens may by some accident or other have been changed since the scale was fitted this checking is easily done by exposing a plate on some subject wlhich has a series of welldefined marks at different distances from the camera a fence is a capital subject for the purpose and should be photographed at such an angle that it is very much foreshortened the camera is set carefully by the scale to one of the intermediate distances on it and a chalk mark or a piece of white paper is put on that particular board of the fence which is at the distance from the lens for which the camera is set this distance may be measured with a piece of siring to make quite sure if when the negative is developed the piece of tho fencing which was marked is not the sharpest of all the scale is inaccurate iu making the test the marked object should be allowed to fall somewhere in the middle of the subject photographed some hand cameras which are arrauged to take either plates or roll films have two scalesone for plates and the other for fllnsan arrangement whieh is rendered necessary by the fact that the position occupied by the roll film is usually nearer to the lens than that of the platethe method of focussing adopted in all the best cameras is to vary the distance of the lens from the plate and many are the designs by which it is carried out one objection applies to most of them sooner or later the wvear and tear makes the camera rickety but with a properlyconstructed apparatus this will take a very long time and the camera should stand years of frequent usethe most perfect form of focussing arrange ment is that of the reflex camera where the photographer sees on the screen the actual effect of turning the focussing screw and thusian go on focusing a moving object right up to the very instant of exposure reflex cameras have their advocates and their op ponents and for lenses of five or six inches focus ut the mlost and working at apertures not larger than f there is a good deal to be said en both sides but when we come to con eider the use of lenses of long focus or of large aperture or both especially such openings is f or thereabouts there can be no doubt about the advantage or rather the absolute necessity of the reflex arrangement when uch large apertures are used the focussing has to be done to a nicety as a very slight altera tion suffices to throw the picture out of focus it is not a case of being able or unable to esti mate distances  one has to do more than that the exact part of the subject to be in sharp focus has to be settled as very often one cannot jet the whole even of the principal object alone sharp when a very large aperture is being used it is essential therefore to see what one is doing and if stopping down has to be done to see how little stopping down will suffice and the onily way of doing this is by means of the reflexcsmera  itmaybe noted toohat the reflex camera is the only one whose finder once correctly set is always correct alike with near and distant objects and whether the front is raised or not it will be concluded from the foregoing that lenses of greater aperture than ffl or thereabouts are not of much use on any but reflex cameras and withlimitations this is a correctdeductionnothing has been said about focussing witlh the groundglass ecept as far as reflex cameras are concerned  as although many hand cameras are fitted with a groundglass focussing screen this can hadly be used when they are employed as hand cameras strictly speaking at the same time any one wvho is hmited to a single camera should certainly have one with ground glass focussing screen as even the keenest hand camera worker often finds it possible to use the camera on a stand and to focus the subject beforehand as with an ordinary stand camera and whenever this can be done it is certainly best in the interest of the results to do so
