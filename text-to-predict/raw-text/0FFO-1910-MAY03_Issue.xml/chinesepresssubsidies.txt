chinese press subsediesthe viceroy cang jpnchfjsmemorialmom  cobrespondlmtsehanghai mani ilin my account of tho quarrel between prince ching and the censors published in the time of liarch  i referred in passing to the im peachment of the shanghai taotai tsai nai huang for squandering money in buying up chinese newspapers with a view to stifling their criticism just after posting that letter there came into my hands a full translation well authenticated of tho memorial submitted to the lhrone by tho viceroy chang jenchiin of the liangiang provinces on these very charges which lhe had been ordered to investigate the gist of this extraordinary document has already very briefly been telegraphed to you but some fuller excerpts are well worth quoting here for tho first time we learn what had become of the missing tls or rather tls of the huangpu conservancy funds which were so urgently called for and so obstinatelywithheldat the time when dredging was stopped last autumn for want of money the evident desire to exculpate the taotai from charges which the investigator of today may himself be called upon to parry tomortow is also not undeserving of attentionpurcehse of newswmisafter setting forth the natmue of the cliarges which he has to examine the memorialist quotes a report of taotai tsai naihuang of april the newspapers at shanghaibring destraction to the govcrnment of the day raise agitation wnder the outward pretext of public indignation on the part of the people of this country act as teecret abettors in the conspiracies of the revolutionary parties their utterances are given easdly and unsparingly and stimulate public motives for the furtherance of private interest and of al these papers the worst is the universal gazeue it is requested that funds be appropriated for the purchase of this paper and that some other trustworthy person bo deputed to manage it that thereafter public opiiion the shea pao and the hu pao be purchased one by one and that pubzio opinion and the hu pao bo then amalgamatedmunder one namethe amount required by the taotai for this simple device was in all tlsthe careful inclusion of the odd cents is a delightful pece of unconscious ironywhile an additional tls is needed for the deficit in current expenses of the several newspapers from the end of april  to the end of february  of these sums the finance office of kiangnan tho province of yunnan and the northern commissioner of trade were to contribute varying proportions tho bulk of the money tls would come out of the taotais treasurya report as made to the effect that this latter amount is borrowed from interest accrued on huangpu conservancy funds to be replaced by the incumbent of the post of the shanghai taotaiship whether acting or substantive with a yearly contributionof tis after this comes an elaborate account of how public funds may be manipulated by being put out to interest in different industrial enterprises in order to provide for the antici pated yearly deficit of tls in the workinig of the newspapers  such concludes the viceroy  are the true circumstances resulting from investigation with reference to the redemp tion of the several newvspapers of shanghaii must observe continues his excellency that the newspapers in the shanghai settlement are numerous and some among them are upright and some devious in conduct there are many also which confuse the government with evil writing which cast con fusion and doubt among their readers and which act as the private organs of their principals whilo among them also there are some who cherishing motives of private animosity attack the deficiencies of others and stander them with a view to intimi dation and blackmail and the persons concerned regardless of selfrespect accept bribes paid in order that the person in question may bo let off the influence of the papers has thus been gradually increasing and last year the action of tsai naihuang in devising means of obtaining control of them was in fact with the object of resisting wild discussionat this point an extremely ingenious touch is introduced taotai tsais report it is emphasized was made to exviceroy tuan fang subsequently transferred to chihli on the death of viceroy yuan shuhsun and cashiered last november and was commtni cated to the waiwupu so that no blame can be attached to the taotai moreover there was really no malversation his loan of huangpu conservancy interest it was proposed to repay by contributions of the official holding the shanghai taotaiship and this step wa therefore not of prejudice to tho public fundsby way of confounding all further criticism the viceroy adds triumphantly in every country of the wvorld the government appro priates funds for the assistance of newspapers in all cases with the object of protection tbi is a matter of common occurrenceand his excellency now feeling himself on sure grbund ventures upon a sally against the author of the original impeachment censor chiang chunlin whoso misfortunes were described in my last letter the viceroy strongly protests against the censors insinua tion that  tho members of the imperial family and the high dnisters together with tho great viceroys and officials of the proviaces are all in anxiety lest newspapers should expose them and therefore this process of purchase has been carried outa crgue of potcyapart from the abovementioned newspapers it is argued there are many others and it is hardly possible that they could all be bought up and prohibited from speaking even the most stupid person would not attempt this still the papers in question were bought and managed by the ofricials though no official stamp was set upon them but the practice did not worlk well it involved we are told coatradiction in terms and fact and was de cidedly unsatisfactory the viceroy therefore requests thatthe shanghai newspapers mentioned in the original petition shall without exception revert to thecom mercial management and tho subsidies issued fshal be returned it the amount obtained is deficient the shanghai taotai on the lines of the above men tioned arrangement shall contribute funds to com plete it the issue of annual expenses shall also cease and the funds obtained and the money placed out at interest shall be wvithdrawn in regard for the fact that these are public fundsas for newspapers in futuro every new one shau be officially examined and shall give security of good behaviour inames shaii be registered and if a n£wspaper misconduct itself in any wayif the artilees contined in the newspaper are extrs vagant and wrong and contravene the press laws or if the chinese concerned shal fasely represent themselves to be a foreign undertaking punishment closure and investigation will folow and the post office will not be permitted to tranmit the paper by this means a reorganization will follow and arrogant sentiments will be reprvssedto all this the imperial rescript is as follows  we have taken note such is the imperial decreeas the secuel has shown the huangpn conservancy funds would appear to have been restored at least the requisite money for dredging hast sinco een producech but while such a conception of finance prevails in the highest quarters of the nation there is little prospect of any radical fnancial reform what moreover is to boecome of the native pres  the above story bears out in string anner the remarks recently made in th time on the gradual gagging and corruption of native newspapers those that vwere bought at the taotnis suggestion so far from bbing the worst in eneral character were regarded at one time in shanghai by independent readers as among the most respectable that tlley were unsparig critics o£ offieial was all totheir credit at the present time they labour under a double disadvantage for while the official eye is fixed severely upon them they have not even the consolation of an ilicit share in the spoils of the huangpu and other funds during the past year the tussle botween officials and newspapers has been growing more and moro acute as witness tho innumer able measures devised for tightening the restrictions of the press law and the action of th nanking provincial assembly and of censor ching testifies that tho contest has already beguhkto attract the attention of the progressive party chinese newspapers are not altogether admirale according to foreign standards but in the interests of freedom of speech the out sider may sympathize with them in the struggle
