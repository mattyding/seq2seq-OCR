churches and insti tutes  launches  chaplains and quite an army of scripture readers apd other workers and which had its operations of loving help spread to every corner of the world there were several reasons why the whole nation should back up the mission in the first place in spite of all foreign competition great britain was the greatest seafaring nation ia the world the fact that half the shipping in rotterdam antwerp and hamburg was british showed how tremendous were the interests of this country in the operations of the mission the thouspnds of pounds spent on foreign zniwshons waer to a large extent discountedunless our soldiers and salora by their conduct were efficient missionaries the chaplains never let the work degenerate into mere amusement and the reigious ain was

thelast  years had been going on to pervert church of england teaching on essentigl points of the christianfaith and to assimilate their services to those of the church of rome the past year had been ayear of strife and discord both in church and state and what prospoet thero was a year ago of bringing to an issua the great question as to whether the doctrines principles and ordor of the reformed church could be maintained had been interrupted by the general election which for the time focussed the attention of the nation on things political and they had still to wait for a settlement of such great questions as the replies of convocation to tho letters of busines of the im portant subjects of education and of disestablish ment in wales and other large questions which engaged the attention
