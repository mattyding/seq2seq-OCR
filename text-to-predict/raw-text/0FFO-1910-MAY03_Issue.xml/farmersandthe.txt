farmers and the developmentgrantmtom a correspondentthe promises of the development grant which have stirred the expectancy of all sorts of institutions and of many unrelated persons espeoially inventors seem scarcely to have touched the farming class yet farmers small and large are the people who should chiefly benefit if any one is to benefit and three of their community one each from england scotland and wales are among the com missionersof the £ of which the grant con sists £ a year for the next five years will be spent directly and immediately on the farming interest and the other £ if iightly used should in the sequel touch the farner more nearly than any other class it is possible though this is left vague that the grant may be made permanent doubtless one reason why country people have taken less interest in the grant is the great but pro bably accidental prominence that has been given to afforestation a form of development in which most fatmers profoundly disbelieve afforestation is a wise policy in certain districts that no one will deny but it may almost be said that one duty vi the commissioners is to  disforest or to restore to fertility waste and half waste lands of which some at any rate are producing trees indeed in a pro gramme of development this task will come at the head of the list as when goldsmith wrote his  deserted village  halfatillage still mocks many a plain and other plains potentially fertile are not tilled at a  it will be as necessary for the commissioners as ever it was for lord palmerston to take down the map they will find on it even in counties reckoned fertile great areas which for one reason and another yield next to nothing some are under heath and illgrown pine such as the tract on which lord shaftesbury has been attempting to establish small settle ments at west moors in the neighbourhood of bournemouth some are so stubborn with clay that the farmers were at one time driven off the ploughland and still hundreds of acres are wasted ulnder poor grass how mariy fields of this quality fetching a rent of under los an acre mar the face of the country on the northamptonshire border of huntingdon  some tracts at the edge of east coast rivers lie awaiting such reclamation as is pictured in the spacious sheepland of romney marsh all these species of waste or semiwaste land can be added to the national capital can hold a prosperous working population if they are treated scientifically on a concerted plan the reclamation is no theory the example of east prussia cannot be too often quoted the government there won permanently to the states use many hundreds of acres by the very simplest means less than  miles from london you may see from the railway the need for similar restoration fields of thorns and briers which are gradually mastering the coarse grass  lie along the great northern railway almost within sight of the incom parable marketgarden lands of bedfordshire and on the other side some of the dourest tracts in england divide the almost suburban villas of surreythe worst soil has many of the constituents of the best sometimes barren soil differs from fertile loam in little but texture in any case the principle can easily be applied that the con version of useless soil to useful depends not on radical alteration but on comparatively simple additions in the past the principle has been applied empirically on a wiide scale in england but was confined chemically to liming and chalking mechanically to draining operations modern skill in analysis splendlidly advanced at rothamnsted and the manufacture of artificial manures make victory over stubborn soils much easier and much cheaper the land itself in these areas can be bought so cheaply that reclamation might in a few years pay a dividend we may subscribe to the general sentiment expressed in the intro duction of the bill the resettlement of deserted and impoverished parts of its own territories may not bring to the coffers eof a state a direct return which would fully re imburse it for its expenditure but the indirect enrichment of its resources more than compen sates for any apparent and immediate loss if this sentiment is scientifically applied to the reclamation of land to agriculture rather than to afforestationwhich on any large scale is after all a counsel of despairit will enlarge british territories in the best sense of the term a beginning might well be made on some of the crown landsthe map before tlhe commissioners will be more than geological it will indicate the roads and railways and the density of popula tion where agriculture is most backward and where the struggle is hardest railways are remote and population sparse this part of the grant does not properly come under the head of agriculture but cannot well be omitted in a review of farmers expectationsfor a few light railways would give new life to many agri cultural districts for example the spacious district which lies between huntingdon capital of the county which headed the list of rural depopulation and oundle in northampton shire is depressed less by its clay soil than its remoteness from markets and from ideas some of the grass lands are of the best dairy ing and poultry might flourish but this county of little villages and little towns though close to london is more remote from english mar kets and more innocent of organization than provinces of the styrian alps which market their produce in england the same may be said of mid essex which is yet nearer to the market of the world a light railway or two would do for the land what the multiplying networks of such railways is doing for thebelgian ardennes the country cries for communica tionand new ideas new enterprise would follow in the wake of the metals ihere again there is reasonable ground for believing that the enterprise would eventually be remunerative it was suggested but the matter is fixed by no regulation that half the sum or a million in all should be spent on communication and on the face of things motorists are as much con cerned with the expenditure as farmers but if this sum is available it is to be hoped that the commissioners will in the first instance extend communication in those places were it is needed by producers the choice between the light railway and motor traffic of which several successful ventures are being made in the southern counties will depend on local conditions it is understood that such under takings would soon transcend the sum in thehands of the commissioners but they could at least give an example and a lead and in the annals of english agriculture the greater advances have always sprung from small ocular demonstrationshigh farming which in the end is good farm ing depends for its success on the culture of the best t is little more expensive and it is very much more lucrative to keep good cows than poor cows to sow good seedthan bad quite a small but an excellent example of this was given eight or nine yeas ago when certain english breeders distributed through a depu tation of farmers a number of firstclass poultry in ireland from this sprang the now con siderable export trade in eggs to give another example canadian farmers multiplied their crops many times by selected and reselected seed given them both by govern ment farms and by private donors who set the system afoot by persuading the school children to compete at the game of seedselection again the oxford county council have remarkably increased the output of the allotments by testing vegetables in model allotments by conducting parties of allotment holders to see the plots and by selling at cost pricethe seed of the sorts that best suit the locality the commis sioners have a great opportunity of extending this sort of work for the improvement of stock muoh the vjmplest chetapest and bestmethod is that of the royal commission on horse breeding a big farmer can keep or easily procure the services of a firstclass bull or ram or boar for in no country are such fine animals bred the smaller farmer finds it very difficult and expensive if bulls of certified milking strain were made available at small fees to the smaller farmers and small holders who are always tempted to buy and breed inferior stock we should see in a very short time a raising of the milk yield all over the country in this as in other departments it would be best to work through existing institutions and employ the agency of the county council agri cultural committeesas things are the farmer can get little help in any branch of his business from the amassed knowledge of the country plenty of expeii ment is going on as by the mendelians at cam bridge by mir spencer pickering in fruit cul ture kew gardens wye college the royal horticultural society at wisley the royal agricultural society to some extent the board of agriculture the midland dairy college at derby the ailnwick farm and above all rothamsted with its  years and more of continuous experiment are continuously pro moting knowledge a national vegetable society has been started and the national poultry society is active but the results of their work filter slowly to the farmers concerned the experimenters themselves have great diffi culties in getting the cooperation of farmers and no single institution is under any obliga tion either to supply or apply its information a central bureau of information such as is supplied by government farms in canada where all information is sent out gratis is a crying need now that at last farmes are them selves beginning to feel the teed of more scientific knowledge such a central bureau could at the same time direct the allotment of funds to specific experimentsenglish farmers are handicapped by a host of deficiencies in organization the meat trade is controlled by the importers who can dole out as they please from cold storage the absence of local factories dairy and pork factories perhaps sugar factories checks out put and reduces the proper value of produce but all these things should concern the board of agriculture which unhappily is not permitted to organize actively thie commissioners of the development grant are not perhaps the people to take up this work but they should at least be able to support with both money and influence tlose semiofficial organization societies who can define the need in a particular place of a perticular cold storage plant or a factorythe farmers clubspeaking at a meeting of the farmers club yester day at the hotel mdtropole mr t a haviland secretary of the central land association said that possibly the establishment of a fresh highway autho rity under the development act might be regretted as tho multiplication of such authorities was hardly likely to conduce to either economy or efficiency in road managementthey could not but note erith satisfaction the ad mission by the government of the principle that cer tain trank roadsshould be construted and maintained at the cost of the imperial exchequer indeed it seemed likely that if the government were to take over any of the existing main roads as they had so frequently been asked to do it would be necessary for them to establish some authority other than the local authority and possibly the road board esta blished under the act might later on be entrusted with the maintenance of many more roads than those which it was proposed should he constructed by them he thought that many including even those who owned motorcars would welcome the principle thht motorcar drivers should especdally contribute towards the cost of the roadsthe section of the act which gave power to the read board to purchase land compulsorily on either side of and within  yards of the new road esta blished a new and very important principle it was realized however that there would not be funds left to purchase any considerable area of grounds but it seemed a pity that the act did not provide for adequate notice being given in the case of proposed purchase of land not only to all high way authorities as it did but also to al owners and occupiers and for the blding of a full inquiry before any scheme was sanlctioned quite apart from any arbitration to determine the compensation to be paid for land compulsorily acquired at which inquiry every interest should be allowed to be fully repre sented the effect of taking land might make ifself felt over a very much larger area than that of the land actually acquired by altering the worling balance of ferms and possibly by disturbing many tenants much however must necessarily depend upon the personnel of the road board and they could only hopethat the board would copsist of able practical men who would use their somewhat wide powers with discretion and with due regard to the many interests which might be affected by their action so that the act might be made of real benefit to the community without inflicting unnecessary hardship upon the individual
