automobile notes for some time past the automobile associa tion has had under consideration the question of establishing machinery which should ensure to its members a supply of efficient and trust worthy drivers and save them from those who deserve epithets of opposite senso and it is now maturing a plan which seems calcu lated to attain the end desired for some three years past there has been in existence a society known as the society of automobile mechanic drivers wlichl has sought to raise the standard of drivers by admitting to membership only those who could point to three years praoticaldrivingandmechanical experience but in spite of the excellence of its aims it could not point to more than a very moderate degree of success this society the automobile association is now going to take under its wing giving it theshelter of its own home and making it an integmal part of its organization at the same time however the society is to remain a separate entity free to follow its own devices as regards such matters as the management of its internal affairs and the making of regula tions for the admission of members to its ranks or the expulsion of those who may prove themselves unworthy it will also retean its character as a friendly society and the sub scriptions paid to it will be vested in tmustees to be applied for the benefit of its members in the shape of sick and unemployed paythe scheme seems to have the elements of success from the point of view of both the drivers and the owners on the one hand it promises a solution of the driver problem at any rate so far as members of the automobile association are concerned and ought to ensure them a supply of suitable men on the other the society can scarcely fail to benefit by alliance with an association whose members numbering  and commanding over  cars will naturally turn to it when they are in need of drivers and the man of good character and experience should not readily lack a situation when he haes so important a reservoir of employ ment on which to draw cooperation of this kind between employers and employed might be more frequently practised with advantage in other industries but in the case ofthe paicd drivers of private cars it is perhaps the only course open certainly the more militant methods of trade unionism could have scant chance of success and the weapon on which their devotees depend in the last resort the power of going on strike could not be applied with effect because the majority of owners are able to drive their own cars and therefore could afford at any rate for a time to dis pense with paid assistance at the cost of comparatively little inconveniencethose who have been scoffing at the delay in the issue of the english regulations in con nexion with the international touring conven tion and pointing to this as one of the matters they order better in france must be a little disappointed at the rapidity with which the necessary arrangements have aotually been completed it was on the nd of last month that an order in council was made appointing the local government board to be the authority under the convention and as it was exactly a week later that mr burns in accordance with the terms of that order authorized the royal automobile club the automobile associa tion and the motor union to perform the duties specified in connexion with the issue of certifi cates of fitness and competence and of inter national travelling passes he at least cannot be accused of undue dilatoriness according to this order which cameinto force on sunday it will be remembered that any person resident in the united kingdom who may wish to take his car abroad and tour in countries signatory to the convention may obtain an international travelling pass for which the sum of s is charged but before this document is granted he must obtain two other documents for each of which a similar sum has to be paid making a guinea in all one of these is a certi ficate that he is a competent driver which will not be issued unless he holds a licence to drive under the miotor car act  and is not under  years of age and the other is a certificate that his car fulfils the conditions as to con struction and mechanism specified in the con vention the order also introduces some modifications into the motor car act which however affect only foreign cars and drivers touring in this country with international passesin spite of the demands it makes en the pockets of niotorists the development and road improvements fund act long ago lost all semblance of being a measure calculated to further the specific interests of automobilism and therefore it is not surprising that the list of development commissioners announced by ir lloyd george last week contains no name that is specially identified with motoring probably this is pretty much what was ex pected and more disappointment will perhaps be felt that the chancelor of the exchequer has not seen his way to adopt the socalled unit system in calculating the taxes to be levied on motorcars instead of the per saltu method that has commended itself to him the plan he has chosen divides cars into eight groups according to horsepoower and in consequence of this mode of classification a car rated at say  hp pays  per cent more than one of   hp naturally the owner of the former car will feel that he is rather badly treated and that he suffers a hardship which would be avoided had the payments been made to increase on a gradually progressive scale this could be managed as has been suggested by the motor union by taking the horsepower of each car and multi plying it by so many shillings in order to arrive at the amnount payable and the heavier rate of taxation to which cars of high power are subjected could have been retained by exacting a higher payment per horsepower from those over say  hp than on those below that figurein connexion with the argyll cars the plan is behig introduced of quoting priees that include all necessary accessories sueh as lamps horn windshield and tools if this is a step in the direetion of the practice followed by american makers of asking customers to accept standard designs and making them pay heavily if they insist on modifications there is something to be said for it as tending to diminish the cost of produ ction but it is more than questionable whether the british purchaser is yeteducated upor downto the point where he wrnll be content to have his personal tastes and preferences confined within the bounds of a narrow uniformity and so long as that is the case the abolition of  extras attractive though it be as an ideal must remain difficult of accomplishment to take one item only however excellent the lamps that are fitted as a standard some customers are sure to have a fancy for another type or pattern and then the sweet simplicity of the fixed inclusive price at once disappears no doubt it would be a comfort to motoristsas to other people to know exactly where their expenses endbut that is not one of the privileges usually attached to the running of a car and after all as regards its complete equipment ia the first instance the extras  are not an unknowable and varying quantity like those of the seaside lodginghouse keeper any purchaser can witlh very little troubledraw up a list of what he requires and ascer tain the cost of the different items from the seller and if he is then unable to calculate the total of his initial outlay his intelligence scarcely fits him to be let loose on the public roads in charge of a carthe british motorcar industry is represented at the brussels exhibition by a collective exhibit arranged by the society of motor manufacturersand traders it occupies an excellent position just at the foot of the grand staircase which leads out of the british section on each side of the chief thoroughfare between the main belgian section and tho rest of the exhibition ten cars are on view to the light there are two bare chassis one a hlumber and the other a vauxhall two open touring cars by the same makers and two closed napiers while on the left there are two closed daimlers a star with torpedo body and a twoton commercial van by the rylnield company whose engines are also to be seen on motor omnibuses running in the streets of brussels other
