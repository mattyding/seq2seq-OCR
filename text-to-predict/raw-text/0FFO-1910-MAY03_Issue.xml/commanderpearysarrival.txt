i cothander pearys arrivalecommander peary arrived at plymouth yester day morning in the steamer kronprinzessin cecilie from newv york accompanied by mrs peary mffiss peary and master r peary captain r a bartlett who was in charge of the roosevelt in which com mander peary made his last expedition to the north pole was also a passenger in the shipin the course of a conversation with a press repre sentative commander peary said he did not intend to go to the far north again why should he  hle might take a trip to northern regions for a pleasure cruise but his work there was done he was over  years of age and his pioneer work there wasdone there were younger and more able men i to continue the work in which ho and others bad been engaged he believed that in the very near future it would becorme the fashion to make excur sions in large pleasure steamers to high latitudes excursions to the arctic ice could be arranged without difficulty and would get a good deal of support especially in view of the sport to be obtained there with reference to antarctic exploration he said he thought that captain scott would succeed in reaching the south pole and planting the union jack there unless he should meet with some unfore seen accident sueh as the loss of his ship he regretted that it had been found necessary to post ponc the american expedition till next year the decision was probably due to the diceulty experienced by the american national geographical society in luising the necessary funds at such short notice it would have been a very good thing if both espedi tions could have set out at the same time not only from the scientific point of view but because the two parties could have supported each othercommander peary was of opinion that in the present state of knowledge aviation was not of much use in arctic or antarctic exploration and said he was not surprised that captain scott had declined the offer of a flying macline for his expedi tion he thought no one who knew anything of the conditions prevailing in the regions of ice would have anything to do with flying machines at least in their present state of development as to the relative difllculties of arctic and antarctic explora tion the advantages were all on the side of those who went to the antarctic as they had a permanent land surface on which to travel no track or trail could be made in the arctic region and no deposits or stores placed in caches for another season for there the ice broke up every year whereas in the antarctic the explorers could travel what distances they liked to caches made in view of an emergency which would remain undisturbed for months or yearscaptain bartlett in the course of conversation expressed indignation at the baseless reports that commander peary had sent him back so that he might not share his leaders glory in reaching the pole the whole thing was he said absurd it was arranged from the very flrst at what point he should returnarribval in

captainbartlett who had travelled trom america with him would receive the same honours and courtesies as himself referring to statements in some newskapers to the effect that captain bartlett had been

last supporting partyand he went nearer the pole than any other white man excepb commander peary himself they both understood the matter thoroughly and any statement that had appeared as to any
