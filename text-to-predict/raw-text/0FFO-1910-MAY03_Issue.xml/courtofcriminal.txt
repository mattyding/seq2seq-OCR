with regard to certain transactions between the appellant and the late mr dickins there wvas an arrangement that the ppellant should charge mir dickins  per cent over and above the cost price of the articles the subjects of the transaction it was alleged that the appellant represented the cost price to be so iuch whereas it was considerably less nnd that thereby he defrauded emr dickins of the difference the only issue before the jurv was whether or not the statements admittedly nmade by the appcuant vere true but in crossexamination a number of questions were improperly allowed tending to show thatjthe appellant had been guiltv of fraud in cases other than those set out in the indictment there was no suggestion put before the jurv that the par ticular charges for which the appellant was ipdicted wvere part of a system the whole question wtas whether the statements made by the appelant ecre true or false if they were false the intent to defraud was selfevident moreover tho cross examination related to matters of an entirely different nature from those charged in the indictment and even if it was necessary to prove an intent to defraud the evidence he objected to would not go to show such an intent but would merely go to show general fraudulent character and such evidence was clearly inadmissiblemr bodkin mr leycester and mr ttoomo with bim for the crown submitted that the questions pitt in crossexamination now objected to were properly adnmitted statements were mado by the appellant which were inconsistent with the entries in nis books and the crossexamination wvas

punishable as abovemrn justzcb bray read the following judgment of the court in this case the appellant was indicted for the murder of his mother and was convicted of an attempt to murder her and sentenced to penal servi tude for life he appeals from this conviction on several grounds which we will deal with one by one first it is said that there was no reasonable evidence on which he could be convicted or as it is put in section  of the criiinal appeal act that the verdict cannot be supported having regard to the evidencef carstho evidence put shortly was this that on january  last the mother was found dead in a sitting posture on a sofa fn a sittingroom in her house there was a round table standing two feet from the sofa on the furt er side of which was a wineglass three parts fued witli a liquid made up of a drink called nectar and as was afterwards shown containing two grains of cyanide of potassium there were also on the table a nectar bottle two lumps of sugar and a spoon there was no evidence to show that she had taken any of this liquid and the result of the post mortenm and of the analysis of the contents ofthe stomach and of the contents of the wineglass was to show she had not died from poisoning by cyanide of potassium but that death was most probably caused by syncope or heart failure due to fright or some other external causeand further that the quantity of cyanile of potassium in the wineglass was even if she hadtlaken the whole insufficient to cause her death the appellant was proved to have bought cyanide of pftassiurn on december  previous hle stated in his evidence that he bought it for ease hardeng a chisel and that he had placed it in a cupboard in the room where the mother was found dead and that he thought it possible she might have taken it from there the prisoner did not live in this house no traces of any of this poison vwere found after her death either in the cupboard or in the house nor of the newspaper in vwhich the appellant said he had wrapped it there was a good deal of evidence showing that the appellant had a motive for killing his motherviz to obtain her money she having made a will in his favourand also showing that the appellant had made several dstatements previous to january  to thc cffect that he expected cns mother a death although in fact her state of healthl was not such as to show that she wras in any dangercoscrntixons ox ine factsin our opinion thc evidence was sufficient to wsarrant the jury in drawing thepinoere hat the appellant hnd put the cyanide of potassiumr in the wineglass it as strngly urged that even if this was so the smallness of the dosc showved that he could not have had the intention to murder her lhut there wvas evidence that on seime dav between christmas day and the newv year tc prisoner had produeed to a witness carden froms his po ecketa smsall substanec about th e size of a marble rwhich appearedlto bim to resemble ssugar candy and stated thatthis stuff is a deadly poson a small quantity aboutthe size of a pins kerob put into a little water would sober you  ie the witnessl  if you were drunk instantly there is no doubt he was referring to tho cyanide of potassium which he had bought a few dayspreviously he therefore perrectly well knew the deadfv character of this poison antl supposed that a very small quantity would produce an instant elceetupon consideration of all the evidence including the denial of the prisoner that he bad put anything into thewineglass at all we are of opinion that there vas suflicient evidence to warrant the jury also in coni ing to the conclusion that the appelant put tho cyanide in the glass with intent to murder his motherquertson ofs  atrrenpvthe next point made was that if he put it there with that intent there was no attempt at murder that the jury must have acted upon a suggestion of the learned judge in his sunmming up that this was one the first or some later of a series of doses which he intended to administer and so cause her death by slon poisoning and that if they did act on that suggestion there was no attempt at murder because the act of which he was guiltyviz the putting the poison in the wineglasswas a completed act and could not be and waa no t intended by the appellant to have the effect of killing her at once it eould not kill unless it were followed by other acts wfhieh he mightr have done there seems no doubt that the earne d judge in effect did tell the jury that if this was a case of slow poisoning the appellant would be gpuilty of the attempt to murder we are of opinion that this direction wasv right and that the completion or rum pd comnpletion of one of a series of acts i ntene ny a mnan to result in killing is an attemd tto murder even although this fcompleted act wu d lnot uless efolloed by the other acts result in killito tho b eginning of the atten pt but would   n t  hnone the less be an attempt whue saying this ve must say also that we do not think it likely the jury acted on this suggetlon becausettherc ws nothing to show that the administration of small doses of cyanide of potassium would have a cumulative effect we think it much more likely having regard to the state ment made by the prisoner to the witness carden that the appollant supposed he had put sumcient poison in theglass tkill thi of course would be an attempt to murdercoinon law on statutory aitemprwe now come to the most difficult point vwhich was thisthat undersectiong of  and  vict c  if the appellant were found guilty of attempting to murder it would be a conviction of the common law offence of attenpting to murder nnd not of any of the special statutory offences under sections  to  of  and  vict c  if this point were a good onethe punishment would be only two years imprison ment instead of penal servitude for lire which could he given in case of a conviction under any of the sections  to  of theact of  and  victc  the argumnent on the part of the appellant was this that sections ii to  of  and  vlictc  dealt with special offencesviz sections  to  doing certain acts with inteit to murder section  attempt ing to do such acts with intent to murder and section  doing other acts not mentioned in the previous sections with the like intent that these were made spccial statutory offences distinct from the common law o enceof attempting to murder and that the attempt referred to in section d of  and  vict c  was the common law offence and not one of these special statutory offences in support of this it was said that at the time of the passing of  and  vict c  though the statutory offences comprised in sections ii to  of  and  vict c  existed under earlier acts now repealed they were not known as attempts to murder they did not comprise all attempts to murder there being no enactment having tho effect of section s and the only offence known to the law as attempt to murder was the common law offence and that must have been the offence contemplated by that act further it was argued in proceeding under sections  to  of  and  vict c  the indictment mulst state the particular offence under the particular section there could  not be one indictment charging the different offences under each of the sections alter natively and that the result of holding that under an indictment for murder a man could be convicted of one of these special statutory offences would enable the prosecution to include m one indictment a number of special statutory offences and that if that had been intended it would have been enacted by  and  vict c   whosoever shall by any mneans attempt to murder shall be guilty of felonynteht  and  atrm tr  to murdenfinally it was argued that there was a difference between doing an act with intent to murder and attempting to murder in support of all these points great reliance was placed on  reg v connell   cox cc  the argument on the mart of the frosecution was that the act  and  vict c lor the first time dealt comprehensively with all attempts to murder and made them all felonies and all punishable with the same maximum punish ment viz penal servitude for life so that after the passing of  and  vict on a conviction for attempt o murder under  and  vict c  the con viction was a conviction under  and  vict c  and punishable with penal servitude for life that although this might havethe effect of including in one indictment several special statutory offences that was the necessary consequence and effect of the act  and  vict c  and if it were not so there must in every case where thero was a failure to prove the eharge of murder be a fresh indictment and a fresh trial on exactly the same evidence which would leadto the samc result and that this was the very mischief which the act of  and  vict c  was intended to remedy and that no hardship on the prisoner would result no new evidence would be introduced and he would be convicted of the attempt on the same evidence which was relied on to prove the complete offence as to the last point it was said that there could not be an attempt to murder unless there was an intent to murder so thatif a prisoner were convicted by the jury of an attempt to murder he must necessarily have been convieted of an offence within one of the sections  to  of  and  vict c decisiox of tm countafter full consideration and having had the advan tage of hearing a most able argument from mr maddocks we have come to the conclusion that the reasoning of the prosecution is sound and must prevail we will deal flrst with  reg v connell  supra the ground of that decision seems to be that the record would merely show a conviction for an attemnt to murder and it would se consisfent with the record that the attempt had been by some means other than those mentioned in the special statutory offences which at that time  did not include an offence under section  it might be therefore that the prisoner was convicted of an offence which was only punishable as a common law mifsdemeanour and there would be no authority for the statutory punishment it would be consistent with the record that the man should have been sentenced to penal servitude for life when he bad only been guilty of a common law misderneanour we think  reg v connell supra may be distinguishable on these grounds utthe passing of  and  vitt c  removed this difficulty that act was intended as a code for all attempts to murder this group of sections  to  is headed with the words attempts to murder and these words fortify the conclusion at which we have arrived after the passig of that act all attempts at murder neces sarily fall within one of these five sections if that act had provded in so many words that all attempts to murder should be punishable with penal servitude for life the effect of such an enactment on section  of  and  vict c  must have been that if the prisoner were convicted of the attempt to murder penal servitude for life could be awarded and sections  to  of  and  vict e  substantially were such an eniactment it is not a sounhd argument that it that bad been intended there would have been this one section and that alone because we know that in acts which are intended to consolidate as well as to amend the law it is the practice to re enact sections in the repealed acts and then to fill up any gap rather than frame new sections in new language by the time the consolidation act comes the language of the old sections has often been judicially interpreted and it is desirable to use the same language we think that no such inlfer ence as was suggested by mr maddocks can he drawn from the absence of the simple provision that all attempts to murder should be punishable with penal servitude for life as to the difference between acts which are attempts to murder and acts which are done with intent to murderwe feel some difficulty in aceteting what mr justice kennedysays iu rex v linnaker    kb at p  but however that may be it is sufficient to say as we have already said that all the offences in sections  to  are treated as attempts to murder and there cannot be an act done with intent to murder without its being an attempt to murder and a prisoner cannot be convicted under section  of  and  vict c  unless as here the jury have found him guilty of an attempt to murder for these reasons we think the appeal fails and must be dismissedsolicitorsmaddocks ogden and co coventry for appeuant director of public prosecutions forcrown
