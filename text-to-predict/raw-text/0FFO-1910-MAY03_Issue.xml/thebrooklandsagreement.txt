tie brooklands agreement and teeconciliation schemefrom a correspondentthe failure of the employers and employed in the lancashire cotton spinning trade to come to an agreement on the wages question at the joint con ference in manchester yesterday may lead to another great industrial conflict in view of this grave danger a careful review of the position is desirablethe industrial treaty known as the brooklands agreement wvhich terminated the  weeks wages dispute  and has regulated negotiations between employers and operatives in the cotton sinnng trade ever since declares in its preamble that the representatives of the employers and the representatives of the employed hereby admit that disputes and differences between them are inimical to the interests of both parties and that it is expedient and desirable that some means should be adopted for the fature whereby such disputes and differences may be expeditiously and aiicably settled and strikes and lockouts avoidedthe broollands agreement was signed by the representatives of the employers federation the amalgamated association of operative cotton spinners the amalgamated association of card and blowing room operatives and the amalgamated northern counties assocdation of warpers reelers and nvinders and has with the exception of the seven weeks dispute in  been the means of settling all disputes that have arisen since it was signed nearly  years ago this result has been secured entirely by negotiations carried on between the parties themselves intervention in the cotton trade has never been popular either wnith employers or onr tivaftter the settlement of the dispute of  it became apparent that the brooklands agreement required some supplementary scheme to come into operation when a deadlock arose arbitration was then offered by the employers and the proposal was nearly carried through but brolke down on a matter of detail mluch consideration was subse quently given to a scheme which was formulated by the employers for the automatic regulation of wages according to the state of trade and engaged the attention of representatives of both sides during thoyears  and  many conferences being held this scheme broke down at the end of  on account of the refusal of the operatives to submit their estimate of trade profits to impartial investiga tion several leading men on bothsldes however wvere convinced that an automatic scheme for the regulation of wages was not only possible but ought to be carried out and pursued the idea assiduously various attempts were made to bring this mode of settlement into operation in connexion with wages disputes but the operatives always objected to dis cussing such a scheme while a dispute was ia progressautomatic reglation op wagesthe settlement of the dispute of august  which was signed by representatives of the organiza tions on both sides contained a clause that the joint committee which settled this dispute should meet together as early as possible for the formation of a scheme for the automatic regulation of wages according to the state of trade as a preliminary to the tarrying out of this undertaking the scheme which had been devised in  and over which there had been nearly  conferences was revived with some modifications in its working by the employers who decided to put it to a practical test under this revised scheme a subcommittee of the liverpool cotton association was appointed the duty of this committee being first carefully to inquire into and settle the various grades of cotton from which standard counts of yarn aro spun and then meeting twice a week to decide the marlet value of these grades of cotton and to transmit the prices to a wellknown firm of chartered accountants in manchester the prices appearing in the market reports not being accurate enough for this purpose an equally well known manchester firm of yarn agents who sel for many spinners was selected and asked to transmit to the same accountants in banachester the market prices of the standard counts of yarn each tuesday and fridaythis arrangement has been going on for more than four years and from the frst these figures were sent to the firm of accountants in manchester by the liverpool cotton association and the firm of yarn agents on the distinct understanding that they were not to be disclosed without their permission they have been tabulated solely to be used in the event of a dispute and wil clearly show the margin between seling yarn on the manchester exchange and buving cotton to cover it the same day alspeculation for a rise or fal in the market being thus eliminated the working of this scheme was fuly explained to representatives of the operatives and a further step was taken to make an experiment by applying the result of the tabulation of these ligures to selected mills an accountant being ap pointed to act for the employers and another for the operatives to carry this out it wil be seen that this scheme provides three sets of experts who are not only independent of the employers and operatives but are each independent of the otherthe first dealing with the purchase of the raw material the second with the sale of the yarn and the third with the gross margin arrived at between the price paid for the raw material and the price obtained for the yarn and from this to ascertain after deducting al the expenses which vary according to the time under review what return isleft on the capital employed and whether a rise or fall in wages in accordance with the brooklands agreement is warranted the brook lands agreement does not admit of inqre o less than a  per cent rise or fall at a time and this only after an interval of  months from the last altera tion in wagessince the brooklands agreement came into exist ence seventeen years ago the operatives have had nearly  per cent advance in wages the male card room hands having had  per cent more than this but in  a  per cent reduction all round came into operation on the recommendation of the president of the board of trade the consideration of the conciliation scheme was revived in the latter part of  sir edward clarle presided over the joint meetings in manchester and considerable correspondence subse qcuntly took place between him and mr c w oacara president of the employers federation copies of this correspondence were forwarded bv sir sir edward clarke to the operatives organization it appears from this correspondenceb which was published recently in one of the operatives reports that a deadlock arose owing to the failure to agree as to the standard from which advances and reductions of wages should be made the last reposition of the employers was that the  standar  should be fied at  per cent below present prices and that the maximurn rates should be  per cent above that standard and the minimum  per cent below the standard the employers proposition which was an advance on anything they had offered before was to flx the standard at the highest point that wages had ever reached  before the advances given in the recent boom which was brought about by exceptional conditions of tradethe seven weelks dispute in  has been pre viously referred to in connexion with this it hasto be recorded that the operative spinners amalgamation which is generally considered the strongest trade union in the cotton trade accepted the o per cent reduction in wages asked by the employers whilst the cardroom workers amnlgamation declined to accept it the result of the action of the latter was complete stoppage of mils containing about  spindlesit cannot be made too clear that the cotton industry is interdependent to such an extent that a dispute with one section of the organized operatives leading to a stoppage brings about in a very short time the paralysis of the whole indust y not only so but the effect spreads to the nmerous industries and great  mercantile ierests which are so closelyswdiated with the cotton industry in the two procemes of cotton spinning and weaving alone there are heardy  persons employed and the em playment given by the other industries referredto
