bad been cited by counsel upon an appucationfor judgment the jury had found that therehad been negligence in the prepara tion of the eatalogue also that the plaiptiffs had suffered no damage it was argued that upon those flndings the plaintiffs were entitled tojudgment with costs and the case of  arzetti v williams   b and a  was mostly relied upon by the plaintiffs counsel in support of that contention ie had carefully considered all the cases that had been cited in the report of the case of  farzetti v williams  the fisst three counts of the declaration were set out the report went on to state that the third countstated the facts still more concisely and there was a general averment of damage to the plaintiffs circumtances and credit tho jury in that case found for the plaintiff on the first three counts that amounted to a verdict that there had been some damage to the plaintiff the present caso was distinguishable from  miarzetti v villiams ns in his case there was a finding by the jury that there had been no damage mfr jtustice parker in fiving judgment in  marzetti v williams saidan extreme case nimay be put where a party who had sustained no inconvenmenc might bring an action but the remedy in that case would be to deprive such party of costs this was not like a case in which a person trought an action to vindicate a right the conclusion he had arrved at was that

appeared for the proprietors of the newspaper john bull limited and mir hemmerde kc mr vv l williams and r arthur wool appeared for odhams limited printers of the neowpaperthe action arose in consequence of a paragraph which appeared in the paper john bull on july   and the defences put forward were substantially that the words did not bear the alleged or any defama tory meaning that they were not libellous and that in their natural signification they were truesin edward carson in opening the case said that the plaintiff was a solicitor and the libel com plained of charged him with lending himself to getting a witness in a pending suit out of the country such a charge against a solicitor who was an ofincer of the court was especially grave the plaintiff had been for a considerable time solicitor to the national cash register company limited articles had been appearing about the company in john bull with reference to its dealings with its customers and in the issue of jul   appeared the following paragraph r paterson and mr palmer seem to be getting a little uneasy as to the ending action against the company mir f c sibbald was one of its agents when in december last be was summarily discharged without compensation her made a claim for it which they repudiated but just recently they heard that he was to be caded as a witness by a hotel proprietor whereupon their solicitors meaning thereby the plaintiffs firm approached him and offered him the £ he had previously been refused for the purpose of going to america so anxious were they that he shquid leave that mr beardall meaning thereby the plaintiff of miessrs beardall and co solicitors to tho national cash register company actually got the steamers tickets for him and for bis wife and two children handing him the balance ef the £s in cash mr sibbald and his family sailed in the columbia on saturday june  we may add that the hotel proprietor is not likely to be greatly disturbed by the absence of mr sibbald and he has another witness who can testify equally well to the circumstances he wishes to provethe person sibbald referred to in that paragraph had been agent for tbe company in the leeds district in  mr paterson the president of the american cash register company came over with a mr panlmer and the latter became manager and a director of the english company the dismissal of a number of he cnmploucs in england followed amongst those dismissed being mr sibbald formerly mir sibbald a d other employs had been in the companys service in anmerica when under the new nianage ment their contracts were terminated money was paid to the others to enable them to go back to america but mr sibbald said he did not intend to go back he had clamed a sum for the expenses of himself and his family for returning and the com pany had actually drawn a cheque for him but when he intimated ho was not going they can celled the cheque mr sibbald nevertheless claimed to be paid and in june  he asked for an interview with the directors they referred him to their solicitors and he accordingly went to the plaintiff and said that he did not make his claim as of right but would consider it a favour if the company would give him the necessary money as he was anxious to get his family home to america as the result of that interview tickets were bought for mr sibbald and the balance of £ was handed to him on june   at that time an action was pending between an hotel proprietor at leeds named crane and the companyut the plaintiff had ascertained that crane had never intended to call mr sibbald as a witness in november  an order was obtained that the defendants should identify the hotel proprietor referred to in the paragraph they failed to do so untu january  and then said it was a mr reed of kilburn but at the time of the libel there was no action by mr reed pendingjulius beardall the plaintiff called by mr lusn gave evidence bearing out his counsels opening state ment he was a solicitor in practice in george street hanoversquaro and had been solicitor to the company for some years and a director of it since  after the articles began to appear in john butll eight or nine actions were started against the companycriossexnrnationcrossexamined by mr bottomleyas a director he had taken all reasonable steps to ascertain the business and the circumstances of the companv board meetinps were only held at intervals as occasion required as director and solicitor he had read all the articles about the company which had appeared in john butll one of the articles in question stated that thc company ias cycnically violating its contracts with shopkeepers who had bought its machincs he edvised the directors to take action on that but they did not  anotherarticle called the company a barefaced swindle but no action was taken there was an hotel proprietor called reed the company had sold him a cash register machine and had since returned him some money he did not know that in june  reed was going to bring an action against the company reed got up a meeting of persons who had bought machines and witness sent a clerk to note what took place at it that was on june  which might be the day on which mir sibbald sailed mr sibbald had been the district manager under wbom the machine had been sold to reed witness did not know that reed had been circularizing tho agents of the company to find mr sibbalds aqderss a firm of solicitors bad in january  made a claim against the company on r sibbalds behalf for dismissal without notice but witness as the companys solicitor repudiated that at once mr sibbald alleged that the former mana ging director of tho company mr saxe had promised him to pay his passage back witness never asked mr saxo i that was true mr saxe started a rival concern and the company was afraid that if mr sibbald remained in england he might enter into the service of that rival that was why they wrote to mr sibbald that they would take his tickets on his undertaking to sail to america on the boat on which the passages were taken there was no other reason for getting him out of the country the question of sending mr sibbald away was never discussed tit a board meeting nor was any minute made of it witness paid the money and got a cheque for it from the company since the actions against the company had been started a number of the dismissed agents had been reengaged there had been a resolution of the board that none of the dismissed agents should he taken baek on any terms he could not say whether that had been iescinded it was not true that the only agents who had been reengaged were those concerned in the pending actions mr palmer was still a director but was very ill and wvould probably never attend the board again it was said that he bad formerly been mr patersons valet and masseur witness had now issued a writ on behalf of the company he obtained it on the satur day before the monday on which proceedings were taken against john bull for contempt of court but he did not serve it until the following tuesday witness considered that he had a highclass practice it was not his habit to pay people commission for introducing business a man who had been a clerk in his office brought an action against him for commussion on business introduced that action was brought in the county court witness settled it for an agreed sumcrossexamined by mr f e ssrrnthe first suggestion that mr sibbald should leave the country was made by mr sibbald himself on june   when the latter flrst asked for money he said he was entitled to it that was when witness met him at frascatis restaurant in november  rie then wanted the money without going away the circumstance which weighed with the com pany when they finally decided to pay him was that he asked for the money as a favour and not as a right the rcason for their being willing to pay was not that henwas then willing to leave the country the only reason wvhy they wished him to leave wvas their fear that he might join the same companywitness did not after june  communicate with mir sase vwith reference to his being a witnees in aacton by one cox against the company a writ ad now been issued by the company against john buu that was oly issued on april  last and nowrit had been issued with reference to the previous article which described the company as a barefaced swindle it had nt occurred to him that that raised a grave charge against a commercial com pany in whieh he was deeply interested a big reduction was made in the price of the machinesin april  and since then many claims had been made by traders against the company many of them had been settled by payment of moncy the only clahnis  wth which witness personally had toere in which litigation actually ensued hundreds of claims hatd been brought against the company and messrs paterson and palmer had paid out £ in relation to them palmer bad since sent in a bill to the american company for £ for new patents and improvements but the new patents had not yet been granted when the deision was come to that no dismissed agents should be reengaged there were no claims against the com pany when they decided to reengage some claims were being made the complaint against the com pany was that when the company originally sold machines they agreed with purchasers not to sell to other persons at a lower rate in spite of that agree ment the price was afterwards much reduced and hundreds of actions were started against them for breach of contract the dismissed cmploys who were taken back into the companys service were persons who could be valuable witnesses for or against the company in the actions but that had nothing to do with their taking those men on again witnessliad had no idea that mr sibbald was in any way in touchwith pesons brinbing an action aganst the com pany the documents might show that mr reed who got up the meeting against £he omnan had been supplied with his machine by mir sibbaldand his codirectors he had brought this action himself but his codirectors had never taken pro ceedings and he could not suggest any reason why they bad not brought any action except that as against them the statements vwere true i eexaminatioreexamined by r lvsnthere was not the smallest grain of truth in tho suggestion that he had corruptly got this man away nor as far as he knew was there any truth in the suggestion that bis co directors had the american company had a capital of about two million pounds and did business all over the world the english subcompany had been in existence about s years and had never done anything in his opinion dishonourable mr saxe started a rival company on leaving them in junc s and the great majority of their cnztployds went overtosase upto then theybhd had no trouble with their eniploys  they had had no claims against the com pany until the aiticles began to appear in john bult and the companv had won all the actions they had fought when the first cheque was made out for mr sibbald there was no action pending against the company when american agents came over here it had been the practice to arrange to pay their fare bome again he had thought of starting pro ceedina against john buu for blackmail but counsel adest that the case was not quite strong enoughreexamined by mr bottomleyiie submitted the case to

lord there are two cases of champion and co v reed and sons and reed and another against champion and others which have been moved into this court i understand i am in a position with the help of my friend mr montague lush to relieve your lordships list of those two cases altogether as we have arrived at an arrangement i ought to say onc thing i think about them messrs champion are solicitors the original action was an action brought in respect of solicitors professibnal charges forservicesrendered to lessrs reed and sons messrs reed resisted payment because they took the view on information which they now wish frankly to admit was imperfect and erroneous that they had not been faithfully served by messrs cham ion in the matter there was therefore a counterdaim and some very serious questions were raised between the parties there has becei however a veryproper and full disclosure of documents and i am now authorized and in structed to say on behalf of messrs reed for whom i appear with my friend mr jacobs that we are perfectly satisfled that the information before us was incorrect and that messrs champion in this matter have really discharged their duty as one would expect solictors ito discharge it that being so of course there is no justification at all for the countevclaiin which was originally set up on im perfect information the way in which the actions arc to be disposed of is by messrs champion taking judgment for the claim for professional services which is not a large claim and their costs in the ordinary way i have nothing now to do except to say and i wish to do it in explicit terms that my clients are perfectly satisfied that they bave been properly served by messrs champion and they wish me to withdraw unreservedly as i do any imputations made against messrs champion and to express their regret that those imputations should bave been made arrangements have been made to satisfy the judgment forthwith and that i am glad to say will dispose of the two cases both the action in which messrs champion were the plaintiffs and the cross action in which messrs reed were the plaintiffs in that way with your lordships consent the whole thing can be disposed ofmr montague lusni appear with my friends mr j b matthews and mr flogg for messrs cham pion of course whilst these suggestions stood upon the record it was a very serious matter and we pressed the action on i am very glad now that my friends clients have seen all the docunients in the case that they have come to the conclusion that there was no possible foundation for any of these suggestions the judgment therefore is a judgment which is a substantial and not a nominal one the actual full amount will be paid by way of n cbarge which has been arranged between the parties and there willbe judg ment for my clients on the claim and counterclaimmr simonthere are terms i do not think we can have an order in the ordinary sense there are a lot of termsmr montaoue lusiryesmn
