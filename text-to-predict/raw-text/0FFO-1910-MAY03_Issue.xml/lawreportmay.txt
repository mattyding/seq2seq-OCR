was an appeal from a decision by mir justice bargravo deano in chambers hich raised an im portant question of divorce court praetice tho point being whether a husband who had been ordered to pay hil wifes costs ina a previoun trial could proceed to have his petition reheardl or retried uttit he had complied with this order the facts giving rise lo this question wera as followsin noveraber and december last a petition by the wife for a judicial separation on the ground of cruelty and a crosspetition by tho husbaud for divorce on the ground of his wifes adultcry wvith the eo respondent were tried before mr justice bargrave deane and a special jury the trial lasted seen days fee the tines for november    and  and december    and g with the result that the wifes petition vds dismissed but the jury were unable to agreo on the issuo raised on the husbtands petition and were discharged without giving a verdict the husband was ordered to pay to the wife her costs of the husbands petition and the taxed costs of her ovwn petition ptiinabefore the hearing of the consolidated zuits the vife obtained as is usual in these cases an order against the husband for security for her costs of trial nder which £ was paid into court and during the treial she applied for and obtained an order for further security the wifes taxed costs were allowved at £ of vhieh after deducting the i £ still remained unpaid on march s ilast the husband was ordered to pay the said balance vithin seven days it appeared that the husband lhad caused his petition to se again set down for trial uith a conmmon jury onamarch  the wife applied to the registrar for an orer that all further proceedings in the cause be stayed until the order of mlarch l for payment of eosts had been complied with and security given for the wifes further costs of trial the registrar made the order in the terms asked but mr justice bargrave deane on the matter being brought before himn varied the registras order by stliking out the wvords referring to the costs ordered to be paid by the order of miarch  and stated that he did so as ho did not think he had power to make such an order as was aaed for but he gavo leave to appealthe wife appealedir m surasrt kc and mlr bayfoad who a peared for the appellant relied on  keane v keanne lr  p and d  and contended that the wife was entitled to the whole of her taxed costs from her husband and that until they had been paid or secured all further proceedings oughit to be stayedmr barnartn kc and mr w  wrillts who appeared for tho husband contended that as the defndant was a poor man it wrould bo an absolute denial of justice to him to stay all further proceedings against hlis avife until the costs of the earlier proceed ings had been paid and that mir jnstice bargrave deane who had heard the flrst trial and knewv all the circumstance had a discretfon in the mettei and that his discretion oughtnot to ba interfered wiath security for the wifes further costs of the retrial would of course be given when the amount had been determined in the usual waythe curer allowed the appealthe master of the roris in the course of his judgment said if the divorce court in soemo respects treated a wife worso than the husband in non respect it treated a husband worse than a wife inasmuch as it vas the practico of the divorce court to order a husband to provide his wife with the sinews of war by making him pay or give security for her costs the origin and nature of this practica could not be better stated than by quoting from the observations of the late sir george jessel in  robert son v robertsou  pd  where he said at page  the practice seems to bo to require the husband cither to deposit a sum of money or to give security for a sum of money to cover the wifes costs and that sum many bo increased from time to time by application to the court it seems also to be the practice that where the wife fails and costs are awarded to her or rather to her soliciturfor he it is who gets the coststhe costs properly incurred are not ordered to be paid but only the costs properly incurred not exceeding the sum paid into court or secured by the petitioner i may say in fairness tosir james hannen that this practice as we are inforaied by the learned registrar in court did not begin with hiin and that he merely followed the practice of his immediate predecessor who followed the practice of sir cresswell cresswell but the ipractico of the old ecclesiastical court of wbich court theprobate court may be conisidered to be the legitimate successor was quite diferent tbere the rulo was to ta and pay the whole of the wifes costs before thohearing and the amount was not limited in any way to any sum which tas securled or paid into court by the husband the reason whv that practice was notfullowed when the probate couib was instituted is curious under the old systen as the evidence was all in writing and complete beforo thehearing therewas no dificulty il taxing the whole costs  but with tho new divorce court tho practice of oral evidence was introduced and then the costs could not be taxed beforehand no ono could know hovv many witnesses would bo called or how mrany summoned or wthat time their evidence would take or what would be required for their maintenanco or for their joumeys or expenses aind therefore it becamo impossible to follow the olderactce of the ecclesiastical court then iu the ltvoreo court as they could not tax and pay the costs before the hearing thero arose a practice of making the husband pay into court or secure a suffi cient sum and then folloning a false analogy wheni the wifcfi costs were taxed they were limited to that sum now on principle it is plain that tho wvhole foundation of the rule depends on the liability of the husband to pay tho necessary and fair costs of the wifes defence i take it that that rule is founded on the old english law which gave the whole personal property of the wife to the husband and gave hini also the incomae of her real estate  so that in the absence of a settlement which as wo all know is a comparatively modern introduction she was abso lute y penniless and therefore the ecclesiastical cot not only provided for the costs of her defene but also gave her alimony pvendenic ifk so as to pro vido for her maintenance then a little further on ho said at page   i have given what i believe to be the true view of the origin of the liability of the husband  but i am not oblivious to the nobler vfew if i may so express it held in the house of lords that no gentleman indeed no man of right feeling would wish that his wife should not have the means of fairly investigating and fairly defending herself against so odious a charge as that of adultery really if there had niot been as i do believo thero is the common and pecuniary reason for fizing the husband with tho costs i think that that reason ought to be sufficient to all rightminded menrule the principles thuis laid down were now carried out by no  of the divoreo court rules wrhich enabled the uife to apply to have her coists of and incidental to the cause  estimated and securedand under this rule there wvas jurisdiction to stay further proceedings in a pending suit until the estimated costs were pro videa for or secured and the eame principle ought to be applied to costs assessed and fixed as these costs were by taxation after stating the facts of the ease his lordship said mr julstice bargrave deane seemed to have doubted whether hc had jurisdiction to stay these proceedings till these earlier costs had been paid but in his the master of the rolls opinion an order to stay wits in accordanec with tho old practice of the ecclesiastical court as appeared fromn  eane v keane lr  p and d  and was in accordance with the later decision ia oseph v joseph   lao times  in which mr justice barnes as he then was seemed to have decided this very point a strong assertion by that learned judge that therc was jurisdiction to mako such an order to stay proceedings for nonpavmcnt of thevwites costs and the court could not refuse to allow this appeal without overruling  joseph v josephi which he the blaster of the rolls was not prepared to do as it seemed to him to be a decision entirely in accordancewith the divorcc court prac tice t he appeal therefore mlust be allowed and the order of the registrar restored with this variation that if the amount of the wifes costs were paid or secured the stay would ho remaovedthe lords jttens also delivered iudgment allowing the
