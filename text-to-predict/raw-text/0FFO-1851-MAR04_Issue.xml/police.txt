misconduct of the conductor of an omnibus towards his applicants wifethe applicant stated thathis wife was a passenger in one of the omnibuses whichrun from the westend of the town to the railway station at the bricklayersarms in the kent road but finding she had no small change when they got into the westminsterroad she handed the conductor haif a sovereign the omnibus still g on at the time

person in the vehicle she knew the epithet smasher applied to herselfl and she spoke to the conductor asking hin what he meant and desired him to return the halfsovereign he however refused to do so asrting that it was a counterfeit coin and that he should not give up the possession of it until he had it defaced in such a manner that no attempt to pas it again could succeed applicants wife then desired to be set down in the londonroad and when the omnibus stopped and the door was opened the conductr caused several low fellows to stop and gape at her in consequence of his saying that the lady

the halfsoverelgn cut into three pieces although applicants wife insisted that it was a genuine coin and blamed him for mis representing her to the crowd he then gave her back the coin defacedin the manner described and jumping up on his place behind the omnibus was driven off but fortunately she had the preaence of mind to take the number of the vehicle the applicant added that when his wife got home she described alt that had taken plae to him and laced in his hand the pieces of the halfsovereign which he imme diately took to a silvergmiths shop in tie neighbourhood and they were pronounced to be gold under such circum stances the object of his present application was to ascertain whether the conductor was not amenable to punishment for having acted in such a scandalous manner towards a passenger against whom there was not the slightest foun dation for such an imputation as that he had cast upon her character the appicant produced the three pieces which formed the coin his wife had tendered to the man of whom he complained and which he added were genuineiwr abeckstt said that if the above statement was cor rect the conduct of the conductor of the omnibus was highly to be reprobended and that before he attempted to have the coin defaced in the manner the one now produced was he ought to have ascertained beyond a doubt that it was counterfeit he the conductor therefore had rendered himself liable not only to punishment for that offence but also for the language he had used towards the applicants wife the magistrate added that he should grant awar rant against the
