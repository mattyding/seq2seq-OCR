the d ultthe following is the letter of our correspond entthe governorgeneral is making a progress through the punjab in great state and would have ewe this reached peshawur had not his march been im eded by heavy rains and bad roads he has visited x the cantonments near his line of march and it is therefore hoped that his visit may lead to the im provement both of roads and barracks the pun jab is perfectly tranquil and likely to remain so for shere singh uttur singh aud chuttur singh have been removed from the northwest provincesito cal cutta and were safely lodged in fort william on the th of january assam and scinde on the eastern and western extremities of the empire have both suffered from light incursions of the adjacent predatory tribes i mentioned in my last that a force had been sent from assam against the agami nagas a party of these people have now retaliated by making an incursion into our country murdering three british subjects and carrying away  men women and children it is supposed that a force will be sent against them under colonel lester as the troops already sent do not appear sufficient the affair on the scinde frontier has afforded nother example of the chivalrous daring of the scinde horsea corps which many most experi enced officers who have witnessed its performances in scinde and the punjab unhesitatingly assert to be su perior in efficiency to any regiment of british cavalry the men being equal to english troopers in bravery and selfconfidence and superior to them in the management of their horses and weapons the affair happened in this wiseon the th of december a party of mounted plunderers made a foray from the hills of the western frontier and carried off a few scores of camels as soon as the intelligence of the incur sion reached kund khote jemadar doorga singh in command of the detachment of scinde horse sta tioned there set off in pursuit taking with him a dufedar and  troopers with  beloochee guides after a long pursuit during which several of their horses dropped from fatigue the jemadar and the few who had kept up with him got sight of the robbers about  in number who thereon aban doned their booty and took to flight doorga isingh mounting a fresh horse and continuing the pursuit on reaching the foot of the hius the robbers turned and showed front having been reinforced by a fresh party of horsemen and between  and  armed foot while all of doorga singhs party that had been able to keep up with him were two of the scinde horse and one of the beloochee guides the latter recom mended the jemadar to give up further pursuit but he replied that the guide might go back if he was afraid but that he himself could not face his commandingofficer if after sighting the robbers he did not attack and kiu some of them he then went at them followed by his two sewars and the beloochee his party was of course surrounded and cut to piecesand the finishing stroke was about to be given him when he had the presence of mind to call out  god be praised  here they come on which the robbers suddenly made off as if panicstruck without waiting to strip or plunder the slain whose bodies were brought in by a party next day the guide was brought back by other parties of the frontier guard who had been out in search of the robbers the camels also were all recovered other parties of marauders were still hovering around the hills with the view as was supposed of making a descent upon the nazzarees in that quarter but a squadron of scinde horse being sent to observe them occasioned the abandonment of their design some of them however made a dash at the camels about boordeeka and carried off a num ber of thema circumstance the success of which is attributed to the death of jemadar doorga singh who guarded that portion of the frontier mr hunter late of the th regiment native infantry has been assassinated in the neighbour hood of benares he was found outside the fort at chunar insensible from the effects of a deep sword cut on the head which fractured his skul and caused death in a few days the instigators of the murder are said to be well known government have offered a reward of  rupees

at the presidency a large proportion of whom had served under him in scinde he was enter tained by the club on the st in his fare well speeches at kurrachee and bombay sir charles spoke explicitly regarding the causes of his resignation he said that when he first was made commanderinchief he thought he was to be commanderinchief in truth but that he soou found out that he was not to be

have as yet been taken by the supreme govermment for enforcing its just claims on the nizam it is rumoured that the board of control have for the present put a veto on the occupation of any portion of the nizams territory in satisfaction for the debt and it is surmised that sir j hobhouse wotld prefer a species of commission like the ex isting mysore commission for regulating and set tling the nizams affairs it is certain that no movements of troops have taken place such as would be required for supporting a step of such gravity as the occupation of berar mean while the state of the country
