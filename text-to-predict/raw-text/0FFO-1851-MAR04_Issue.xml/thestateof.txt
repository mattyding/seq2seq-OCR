thbe sta t of europethe french republioja portion ofthe fouowixig appeared in our second editionthe following is our paris correspondentr letter dated sunday  pm had m creton and his supporters yielded to the repeatedly expressed desire of moderate men and withdrawn their proposition the public might have been spared the scandalous scene of yesterday which recalls the memory of the wildest debates of the convention that scene of revolutionary violence which suspended the sitting for more than half an hour was occasioned by a person named marc dufraissethesame who addresseda letter of sympathy to the accomplices of the assassin fieschithe same who was the favourite commissioner of m ledru rouin who was named by him to that office in several departmentsthe same who was named prefect of the indre by m recurt and who was at length dismissed under the government of general cavaignac by m senard this pale shadow of robespierre this panegyrist of the crimes of the convention and of the revolutionary com mittee is one of those whom m thiers and his friends received as partners in the coali tion yet good may come out of evil the speoimen of government reserved for society in case the mountain ever arrive at power as exhibited in the proceedings of the assembly yesterday may not be without its advantage it is dif ficuilt to see how the result of that stormy debate can be otherwise than favourable to the govern ment a comparison must be made betweei its moderation and the violence or weakness of its adversaries the incident unless men have at tained that degree of madness which we are told immediately precedes destruction must prove to all extreme parties the absolute necessity of disarming the  whites cannot continue their warfare against the government without imparting to the reds the force that these will inevitably employ against the former the  reds cannot triumph for a single day without losing on the morrow and by the mere force of their extravagance the fruits of their vic tory moderate men hope therefore that the scene of yesterdaywill act as a lesson to the whites if indeed they are capable of learning anything as a check to the  reds and a cause of strength to government but for the appearance of m dufraisse in the tribune it is difficult to say what would have beea the fate of m cretons motion that outburst of savage declamation could osly be compared with the ferocious language of the worst days of revo lutionary history in france the language of saint just of couthon and of collot dgerbois can alone give you an idea of the eloquence of m dufraisseis discourse was throughout the most earnest and apparently the most sincere defence of the most detested acts which have marked the sanguinary reign of the convention and in which the history of france may be traced as a wounded man in a crowd is tracked by his blood at one moment as these ominous doctrines excited the enthusiasm of the mountain threefourths of the assembly actually trembled with anger and with shame m berryer his eye dilated with passion and cleaving through the crowd that involuntarily made way before him with an impetuosity that all yielded to rushed to the tribune and in a voice of thunder that stilled for a moment the tumult beneath him de nounced in the name of honour of morality and of the public conscience the horrible language just ex pressed several rounds of applause followed this de nunciation but when he declared that after such de testable doctrines audthis enunciation of them in the assembly mens consciences were no longer free and demanded not the rejection of the proposition but its adjournment it is impossible to describe the tu mult that arose the sitting had to be suspended for threequarters of anhour the minister of justice re opened the discussion and after denouncing in the nameofthegovernmentthelanguageofthemountain also demanded the adjournment of the question for six months m piscatory made the most desperate efforts in the midst of the confusion to continue the debate or adjourn it to monday but failed at one moment it is probable that the motion would have been voted were it only to protest against the language of dufraisse and as a defiance to the mountain but nublic decencywas am ly avenged by  berryer andthe majority appeared satisfied with the brand affixed to the foreheads of the wouldbe robespierres and couthons and returned to its ori ginal intention the thiers and piscatory fraction of the orleanists did their utmost to prevent a divi sion while the effect of m berryers languae was still so strongly felt m piscatory and m jules de lasteyrie struggled for the possession of the tribune the mountain did its best to aid them defeated in this m piscatory demanded to speak on a question of order and while many others attempted to gain possession of the tribune clung to it still with desperate strength m thiers was close to him and though he made no attempt to speak himself urged his subaltern to persevere such a scene of violence and recrimination has been seldom witnessed anywhere the orleanists were defeated the adjournment of the proposition for six months was voted and m thiers and general changarnier voted with the mountain against the adjournment such was the scene enactedyesterday and wvhich will not contribute to raise the character of its representatives in the eyes of the countryi should have said that m girardin was one of those who at the close of the sitting tried to address the assembly his speech was cut short however like that of m piscatory but en revanche we have this day in la presse what m girardin would have said had people showed any inclination to listen to him the joyrmnal des dgats expresses its regret at the defeat of the propositionfor such its adjournment to six months may be considered though it consoles itself that it was not formally re jected it yesterday advocated the measure on the score of humanity and justice this praiseworthy feeling is it is to be feared not of an universal kind the elder branch of the bourbons exiled during the long prosperous and pacific rule of louis philippe was no less a subject of commiseration than the princes of the house of orleans and it is not for gotten that so late as  the government of that king resisted the mere taking into con sideration the petition of the brother of the emperor the actual governor of the invalides jerome bona parte who solicited permission to pass his old age in france where he had been amongst the last to sheathe his sword in  this was resisted on the ground of danger to the state surely then there appeared less danger to the tranquillity of the country from the presence of a helpless old man devoid of talent or energy than there may now be from that of the prince de joinville and the duke daumale one may then suppose that justice and humanity have much less to do with the advocacy of the orleanist party than the hope that some advantage at the period of the election in  may be drawn from the presence of those who would profit by the repeal of the law m berryer boldly denies the right either to condemn to banishment or restore his prince who if he re turn to france shall return as its legitimate ring it is a pity that the other party does not imitate the frankness of the legitimist statesmanif we may draw any inference from the fact of mbroglieole and berryer votingfor and mmm thiers placatory and lasteyrie against the ad journment it is that not only is there a division be tween the orleanist and ilegitimnist party but that the so much talked of fusion has not lately made any very rapid progress indeed the siecle declares that they are more than ever dividedand that division continues in the orleanist camp itself it concludes its reflections thusthe country will understand that thoee monarchical pretensions alied yesterday dividedtoday aain joining tomorrowr only perpetuate discord and hatred and that to triumph over theec elements of disorder it must attach itsclf with sti mere energy and incecrity than eer to the republic loyally

probability that any disagreeable incident willmar the festivity of the day maskers are to be met here and there though in less numbers than usual but the throng of carriages is much greater than last year the authoritie must be sure of the tran quillity of paris to authorize the processionfrom the appearance of the city one would believe that the exhibition of an enormously fat ox and the promulgation of the rights of man are considered matters of about the same importance by the good people of paris the moniteur announces that the office of the electric telegraph at the hotelof the
