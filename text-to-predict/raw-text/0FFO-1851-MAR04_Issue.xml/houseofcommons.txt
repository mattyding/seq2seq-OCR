ecclegiastical titles bill after all that had occurred during the last  dayswithoonsiderable disappointment he had hoped that sinca the oasah had been upset the noble lord would have seenthe eceseity

the right bon breenet his sincere and heartfelt thanks  hear ad a laugh had declared himif opposed to all legislation oa the ebman catholic question that sentimaent had bneeechoecl by the earl of aberen in the houso of lords ani he sr reynolds presumed that the ilustrious duke to whom the noble lord hab referred as having advised the queen to recall her former ministers was of the same opi nion and yet in the teeth of au this the noble lordsaid is was his intention to movo the second reading of theccle siatical titles bil on lfriday next would that bill be presented to the housein a modified form on fridy  at alt events he hoped the ish liberal members would be at their posts to oppose it for his own part he would offer the most determined opposition to the measurei au iti stges and if the irish and english liberal members would stnd faithfully together he might ventare to sayi without using language that could be construed into a threat that he defied the noble lord topass the bill hear hewr and further he would assuri the noble lord that evon if it were possible to pass his biu of pains and penalties which was a declaration of war against the catholic hierarchy it would remain a dead letter intbat part of the united kdigdom called ireland the english catholics were only a miserable fraction numerically but what they wantedi in numbers they supplied in reqsectability they too were re solved to offer the bil the most strenuous opposi tion and he could state on the part of the catholics of ireland that they were determined to make common cause vsith the catholics of england hoar hear the irish catholics would not accept for themselves exemptioa from pains and penalties which were to be imposed upon their english brethren it was his belief that the millions in ensland cared nothing about the bill and were desirous of enlightened legoislation on ether subject the petitions which had been presented in favour of the coercion of the ca tholics were about in in number signed by  per sonst fohile the petitions atoaint the bil were  with  signatures hear hie wias prond to be able to say that he rajs one of the irish members who had gained so much approbation in ircland and so little from the govern ment for helping to n pset the state coach by taking theg jinchpin out on a recent oceasion alaugih and he gave the noble lord notice that he must be prepared to encounter the most determined opposition at every stage of his insult inr bill i ol tion of the emancipation act of not aiberl irish representative must fail to be in his place to record his vote against the bill however it might bo modi fied it was all very well for the noble lord the member for colchester to talk about not offering a factinau opposition to thei government but his faith was no insulted by a biu of pains and penalties it would be better to adopt lord stanleys sauggestion and institute an inquiry on the subjeg than to proceed further with the government hop step and jmp legislation under the false pretence of complying vith tho demands of the people the hon member for ayrure stated the other evening that the people of scotlard took no inerest in the antipapal agitation and notwithstanding the secreta at wars shake of the head he believed that statement to be correct in proof hardly a petition had been sent from scotland on the subject the hon member for rochdale who was weu acquainted with the sentiments of the pro testants of ulster aaid that a feeling of indifference pra yaled there with regard to the question under these cir cumstances he belived that the proceeding of the govern ment was the result of an artificial movement and if not intended to divert the attention of the people from other subjects it had certainly had that effect rear hear par liament had been sitting a month and uothing had bser done beyond scolding theopope and cardinal wiseman a laughmr oswald vwished to know whether it was the nobla lords intention that the bill in its altered form should pre ventas the bill now before the house didthe bishops and deans of the episcopal church of scotland from taking the titles of their dioceses and deaneries which they now tookllord j russell declined entering into any diecubssionr with respect to the detils of the bill at that moment the secretary for the houb department would late on friday the alterations which it was proposed to malke in the mea sure with reference to what had fallen from the hon mem ber for dublin he begged to inform him that it was necaary to read a bill a second timo before any amendment could be made in it hear hearhir wakley hoped that ministers would consider the matter well before friday came and then be prepared either to abandon the bil altogether or to shelve it for this sesaion by referring the question to a committee as had been sug gested in the other house surely after the speech of the tight hon baronet the member for ripon the government znust be satisfied that no such bill could pass into a law hear if persisted in tho measure would lead to a great deal of augry discussion and produce a vast deal of strife in ireland and under these circumstances the best thing the noble lord could do would be to abandon it a noble lord oppoite had promised that the government should receive no factious oppositiou fromthatside of thehouse considering the decapitated state of that party a laugh the pledge was not worthn much in saying that theparty wasdecapitated he was abut repeating the words of their leader their noble leaderhad declared that althourh he was associated with  gentlemen there was amongst them only one man of official experience and his experience was of the wrong kindhe did not likle bimand as to the others he would not have them at any pnco a augh that was what their acknowledged leader nad said in another place and that noble individual had also stated what his plans would be if he came into office he gave that noble lord great credit for his declaration he thought he had acted a noble and manly part cheeraa part which entitled him not only to the warmest approbation of members of that assem iby but the warmeet commendation of the country h earhear the noble lord had frankly stated what hiswies were he had stated that if he assumed office it was is intention to propose the imposition of a duty on imports of food for the people the course of policy adopted ia that house bad been of a totally opposite character hon mem bers opposite cornined of the distress of the owners and occupiers of land  hat distress the former were suffering he had yet to learn but the distress of the occupiers he ad mnitted and deplored the noble lord in the other house said that he would remove their distress by raising the price of the food of the peo le by a tax on the food imported into the country therefore those who sup ported the noble lords party knew what they were gni there could be no mistake about it the pro position was placed fairly before the country and if an election took place the question to be decided would be a high price or a low price for the food of the people  no re was teling hon gentlemen only what their leader had declared if that noble lord was not their leader who was vwas the party in such a state of confusion that there was neither leader nor members hon gentlemen seemed in clined to repudiate their leader in another place as he had repudiated trem here the noble lord had certainly shrunk from office on account of the regiment with which he was connected a laugh but to return to the point from which he had wanderedthe hlouse of commons had a riht to expect from the noble lord at the head of the  vernment candour equal to that which had been displayed by the noble lord in the other house eliear what the people out of doors were talk ing about was the necessity of making larger reductions in expenditure the noble lord in another place had said nothing upon that point but there must be reduction the noble lord at the head of the government might be aesured that independent members felt no hostilty to the members of the administration personady they looked not to men but to measure the people out of doors did not give the government credit for extraor dinary capacitythey thought the noble lord might have more efficient codeagues but they gave the noble lord credit for ability and sincerity he hoped therefore the noble lord would look about him and try and gather around him men endowed with the capacity for governing the country hear hear the people were careless what faction ruled so long as its measures were such as to benefit the nation hear hearthe marquis of granby said that the hon gentleman vho had just sat down had paid a welldeserved complimont to lord stanley foihe statesmanlike and moderate speech he made in another pice but the hon gentleman went on to esy that the noble led had confessed he was unable to form a government because he could find only one person of official experience in that house and that that person was one in whose sentiments he did not agreemr warley explained that what he said was that lord stanley had declared he could find only one person of official experience in that house and in his imr wakleys opinion that person was of the wrong kind lear hearthe marquis of granby was anxiouis not to be led into a corn law debate on that occasion but he must be allowed to stato that what lord stanley dil say in the house of lords cries of  orderwell in another place laughter was not that he wished to raise the price of the food of the people but that he thought a revenue might be obtained by means of a moderate duty on foreign corn ironical cheers from the freetraders without materially raising the price  hear hear and a laughmr mioore assured the house he was not then going to discuss the ecclesiastical titles bill or to make any party obervations whatever but he did think it was not unimpor tant to urge upon a bewildered house and a ruffled admi nistration the necessity of taking timethe one to recover its senses and the other again to try its wiing before entering upon a courso of legislation which more than any other re quired serenity of mind and an informed judgment hear hear if the government and the house were prepared to legislate upon the subject of the assumption of titles it was surely right that at au events they should not embark with cut chart and pilot upon the troubled and unbpown se in which the administration had already foundared and in which some of the most experienced and  ancient mariners had decined to spread their sails hear hear and a laugh it would be generally admitted he tlought that the species of legislation to which he referred however necessary was calculated to excite angr ani mosities to sitir up bad passions and sectarian hatre a mong the people and therefore whatever legislation they might be ultimately compelled to adopt they should legislate upon it once for all and with an informed understanding ef the subject upon which they legislated considering therefore the importance of the subject and considering also the fact that the noble lord had confessed that the bill he had intro duced did not answer his own expectations he thought that the least the house could epect was that sufficient time should be given to consider the amendments that were to be stated on the second reading hear hearmir newdegate wished to know when the return of the number of addresses which had been presented to her majesty on the subject of papal aggression for which he had moved at the beginning of the session would be laid upon the table sir g grey replied that they were laid on the table about  days ago mr sadleir also expressed a hope that ample time would be given to the irish members to consider the nature of the ecclesiastical titles billthe second reading of the biul was then postponed till friday nextthe other orders on the paper were also postponedon the motion of mr w wivirials a return was then ordered of the public money expended on each of the royal places gardens parks and the appurtenances thereof stating te amount of expenditure from parliamentarygrants crown revenues surrendered to the public by the civl list acts and other sources and a statement thereof in detail in the eame form as that for  in each year from  to  in continuation of parliamentary paper no  of session  and a return of the amount of the salaries and other emoluments of the rangers and deputyrangers of the royal parks in each of those years and also of the number of houses and tenements purchased for enlarging the ground attached to buckingham palacejr williaiis also moved for a return of all new places created and appointments made since the th day of april  whethor under any act of parliament or by any other authority and of the names of the persons a pointed to them

annual expense of the chancellor of the exchequer said that if hb had been aware of the hon gentlemans intention to mnake this statement he would of course haee come down pre pared with papers to show that during uhe time the present government had been in power they had reduced far morelaces than they bad created hear hear he would not however object to the return being grantedlord j russell observed that the return for which the hon member had just moved would only show the nusmber of places created but not the number of places made void for instance supposing that  places had been abolished and  places created the return would only show the number of creations but would give no idea whatever of the eavings that had been effected hear hearthe motion was then agreed to and the house adjourned at  minutes to  oclock till friday next
