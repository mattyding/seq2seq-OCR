arizefight between two men named mitchell and wynnhen the ring had been formed and the men were ready to commene the battle mr bury doyne a neighbouring magistrate who had received information of what was about to occur boldly went with two constables to prevent it he with great spirit forced his way through the outer ring and had reached the rones round the inner ring when he was hemmed round and prevented from stirring when the men were about to begin the fight he struggled to get in to prevent them crying out that he was a magistrate and calling upon all around to assist in preventing a breach of the peace whereupon those around him pushed his hat over his eyes and each time that he attempted to raise it pushed it down again the cry of a magistrate a magistrat  was raised while some said he is not a magistrate  and others cried  down with the beak and on with the fight however the majority of the meetinz immediately began to disperse the fight between mitchell and wynn did not proceed but when the mass had sepa rated two of the lads of the neighbourhood began to setto on their own account but not for a wager however they were soon eeized by those who came to the assistance of mr doyne the magistrates thereupon determined to proceed by indictment against all who were present and refused to assist mr doyne in preventing the fight or took a more active part in itmr william goddard a timber merchant and mr mar maduke irish an innkeeper were put to the bar charged with having refused to assist mr doyne and also with having attended a riotous and unlawful assemblymr carrington and mr sawyer conducted the prosecu tion mr alexander qc and mr skinner defended god dard and mr williams defended irishboth defendants pleaded  guilty to the first count and no evidence was offered on the othersmir alexander on behalf of his client said that mir goddard had erred through ignorance of the law not know ing that it was the duty of every person to assist in prevent ing a prizefight and was most anxious to state that it was from no disrespect to mr doyne that he did not assist when called upon as an evidence of his desire tomakeevery repar ation for this involuntary omiesion he had pleaded  guilty to not having assisted the magistrate and he had the autho rity of the magistrates before whom the caso was first heard and in whose district the breach of the peace occurred as well as of the magistratewhowas the prosecutor and who ex erted himeelfin a praiseworthy mannertoputdown thisunruly assembly that they would be satisfied by having a promulga tion of the law in open court in order that all persons and especially such respectable persons as mr goddard might know that it was their duty to aid when caued upon to dis perse such an unlawful assembly as that wbich took place atwbite wvalthammr carrington said he was instructed on the part of the maidenhead division bench of magistrates the sub stantial charge against the defendants was that they refused to assist mr bury doyne a magistrate in putting down tlae riotous assembly on the occasion of the prizefight mr goddard was as he had been informed a most respectableerson and he mr carrington felt it right to state one aract which was that mr goddard when before the magis trates on this charge expressed his contrition for not havin assisted mr doyne much in the eame terms as his counsel had now done the prosecution was instituted with the view of making it public that on the occasion of prizefights it was the bounden duty of every person to assist a magis trate or any other peace officer in putting down such unlaw ful assemblies with regard to the first count in the indict ment ho did not purpose to offer any evidence the gentlemen whom he represented being satisfiedwith the course taken by the defendantshis lordsiip in passing sentence said there could be no greater nuisance to a neighbourhood than the intrusion of prizefighters he did not believe fromwhat he had heard that eitherof the defendants intended to encourage the fight but the particular charge against them was that they with held assistance when called on by one of her majestys jus tices of the peace to suppre a disgraceful public outrage the object of the prosecution was he conceived abundantly and happily accomplished by the admissions which they had rightly made and he would state that they left this court without any imputation upon that respectable character with which they had hitherto passed through life he deelly regretted to learn that violence and great indignity had been offered to a gentleman in the performance of his duty and he trusted this proceeding would teach people that it was their duty to aid in putting down urawful assemblies taking into consideration au the circum stances he thought the justice of the case would be met by the sentence he was about to passthat they should pay a fine of lathis morning eight other persons including the prize and gratuitous fighters were put on their trial charged with attending a riotous assembly and assaulting a magistrate in the execution of his dutymr williams ir skinner and mr laurence appeared for three of the prisonersone pleaded guilty to attending an unlawful assembly  the others were found guilty of that charge and one brad shaw an eton lad who had been sworn to by one of mr doynes assistants as having bonnetted mr doyne was found guilty of assault alt but bradshaw were on the re commendation of mr doyne and the magistrates sentenced to a fine of la and to enter into their own recognizanees to keep the peace and bradehaw was sentenced to a fortnights imprisonment but afterwards on recommendation from the magistrates and repreeentations that so long an imprison ment would be ruinous to a boy in his condition the impri sonment was reduced te four days to date from the com mencement of the assizesthroughout the triala all parties seemed to concur in prais the spirit determination coolness and good sense of mr oyno in suppressing such a riotous proceeding with so smau a force and most certainly we ought to add that great praise fas due to the people for the reverential respect with which the majority of them obeyed the law when they found that a magistrate had arrived to enforce itjoseph saunders aged  a shoemaker was tried and convicted of a rape on miss isabeua lydia pullen under

service at the cathedral and this morning commenced the business of the assize the cbief baron sitting at i prium and mr baron mlartin presiding in the crown courtclown coubrat the frst appearanoe of the calendar the large number of prisoners for trial  was rather startling but upon ex amnmg the offences with which the prisoners were earged we were struck with the very trifing nature of nany o them and wo were glad to fin dthey did not esceape the notice of the learned baron in charging the jury his lordship said that so far from there being any reason to suppose that crime had increased in the county he thought that they might congratulate themselves upon the appearance of the calendar he would however call their attention to one dr cumstance and he did so for the purpose of their considering whether some steps might not be taken to prevent cases of so slight a character being brought to the assizes at all there were very feweases tried wherethe expensewas less than from  to  and yet he bad selected  cases where the pro perty supposed to have been stolen did not amount altogether to  it was a waste of public money and of much valuable time to try cases of this description at so enormous an ex pensemen were charged with stealing a peck of beans shooting a duck stealing a sack a few gallons of hogsmeat a shoulder of mutton an iron rat trap two rabbit traps  turnips  glass bottles kc it appeared to him to be a desirable thing that some mode sheuld be adopted to prevent this he congrtulated the county that during the last seven months there was no offence at all approaching that of murder there was one case where a father was charged with the manslaughter of his child but he owned it appeared to him from the depositions that they would throw out the bill as there was no legal evidence to show that the death of the child had been ac celerated by the conaduct of the father there was a case of manslaughter on the high seas but it struck him that the man had died of scurvy and that the conduct of the captain of the ship had nothing to do with the death of the seaman there were six cases of arson one was setting fire to parkhurst prison and another to a workhouse one might understand that the feelings of persoeas confined in these places might induce them to commit crimes of this kind the others were those where the parties were charged with setting fire to agricultural produce those were cases of great importance and ought to be thoroughly investigated ano if persons were guilty they ought to be severely pun ished there did not appear to have been any malicious feelings towards the owners of the propertynsi pbius courtthere are nine cases in the list but nothing has yet oc curred to justify notice there is a case of seduction for tomorrow
