reason was there to suppose that clarke also had not been imposed upon there was no salis factory evidence of their being engaged in a common design to defraud the prosecutorthe learened judge in summing up asked the jury whe tler they did not believe that the whole transaction was a trick  if instead of a speech the prisoner had produced his venerable parent whose word was not to be broken or the venerable beasts about which he pretended to be traffick ing the case would have been a very different onethe jaury found the prisoner guiltythe learned judge in passing sentence said that until the recent change in the law he would have been liable to transportation and he certainly richly deserved transport ation the law however did not permit him to pass the sentence which the case

undisputed it was quite clear that the prisoner had fired a pistol close to his wifes head and it was difficult to con ceive that he could have had any other intention than that of killing her it was equaly certain that the pri soner had been deeply wronged by his wife and that he had been impelled by jealousy to the commission of the crime that however was no justification either legally or miorally it was the duty of all men to control their pas sions for that purpose the light of reason was given to tbem and the world would cease to be a fit habitation for ratioxal creatures if the impulses of violent passion were to be subject to no restraint the landlady of the wagzon and horses at daventry proved that the prisoners wife and a man named burton had been lodeing at her hoase for
