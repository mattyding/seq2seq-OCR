statement and little hope is entertained of his ultimate re covery a most strict mvestigation is now being instituted by chiefconstable hatton an the authorities in order if possible to throw light on this mysterious affair  and we understand that information has been received sufficient to justify a suspicion that the officers injuries were produced by foul play and not by accident it is difficult
