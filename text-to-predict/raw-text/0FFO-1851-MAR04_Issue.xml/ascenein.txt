a scunb iv the lebgsla t vbe assembly offranorbat halfpast  oclock on saturday m benoist dazy vice president took the chair when the discussion commencedi on thc following proposition moved by ml creton  the ilaw of the th of april  banishing the elder branch of the bourbons and the decree of the th of may a banishing the orleans family are repealedm creton said that his proposition was not intended or calculated to excite political passions it was an appeal to all generous sentiments and to the great ideas of justice and honour the assembly was not composed of party men but of the legislators of a powerful na tion which would understand the noble instincts of nature constitutional monarchy and parliamentary go veranent appeared to him the form most conducive to the welfare of his country but a great and magnanimous republic such as he comprehended ita republic without fear or reproach laughter would never find him in the ranks of his adversaries the law should not visit the inno cent and the proscription of individuals was in bis opinion still more odious than the confiscation of their property noproposition was more national more trulyrepublicant for its realization would do more honour to the republic aumd place it higher in the estimation of the world than any othermeasurewrithout even excepting the abolition of capital punishment therev wasno motieto justify the banishment of the members of the two royal familiessome of whom were tvo young not to be innocent the moment moreover was opportune and the reasons adduced by m odilon barrot on a former occasion in favoar of ibt adjournment no itogor existed  berryer combated his proposition be ciluse he misunderstood its meaning and bearing in  the hon member had himself made a motion in the cham her of deputies in every respect similar to his proposition and in developing it he stated that laws of proscnption were at all times inefficient measures to gearantee the stability of governments the initiative of his proposition did not accerdinglybtiong to himit belonged to his hon colleague mi berryer in conclusion m creton entreated the as sembly to abolish the lawsa of proscription and let the noble exiles avail thermselves of their abolition if they thought proper in two months it would be too late and the a sembly would then regret not having accepted his proposi tionm berryer said that m creton had adverted to a speech he had dehvered in  with all the energy he was pos sessed of he had at all times in and out ef the legislature combated laws of proscription which he regarded as impotent and inefficacious  he strenuously opposed the adoption of a new law of proscription and dunn his whole life and under every regimen he had defended the proscribed to whatever poltical party they belonged no body could doubt his affection for a branch of the exiled family and misunderstand his opposition to the abroga tion of the law of  but he perceived the uneasines that prevailed in the country and in the assembly respecting the future destinies of france and he did not wish by his adhesion to the proposition to afford a pretext or arms to ambition and evil passion its adoption wouldbe their jus tification the assembly had resisted such pretensions by refusing its confidence to the last cabinet and rejecting the dbtation for his part he was determined to persevereand it was because he felt in his heart and conviction the highest respect for the exiled princes that he did not wish they should become objects of accusation or instrdments ins the hands of intriguers to disturb his countrynumerous members on the right loudly demanded the close of the discussionm desmousseaux de gire however insisting on his right to support the proposition spoke for some time amidst the noise of conversations in hi opinion the president of the republic was highly interested in the repeal of the laws of proscription and he wondered and regretted that hehad not himself taken the initiative of the measure in  his uncle caused a prince of the bourbon family to be shot in the ditches of vincennes that was a bloody stain on his memory which his nephew should strive to efface and an opportunity was offered him by the repeal of the laws which banished the relatives of the duke of enghien the justice of the measure could not be contested nor was its adoption likely to rouse any bad passionm de royer minister of justice said that in so grave a matter the assembly necessarily desired to know the opinion of the government it regarded the proposition in a double point of viewof principle and of the duty and responsibility it entailed upon it its opinion was the same the preceding cabinet had manifested on two former occasions it a mitted the loyalty and generosity of the proposition andwhat was preferable its justice and neither ho nor any of his colleagues should combat its principle but aext to the question of principle was that of its expediency he re peated what his predecessors had stated in s and  that political prudence did not permit as yet the resenta tion of such a measure the adoption of which would create serious dangers now the causes invoked by the pre ceding cabinet had not ceased to exist and the situation of the country did not admit of that abrogation if the go vernment had thought otherwise it vwould have long since taken the initiative of a measure wvhich was calculated to do the greatest honour to the cabinet that would have it in its power to realize it if he and his colleagues had resisted the temptation it was because the sentiment of their duty and the interest of the country imperiously commanded itm barthlemy st hilaire who followed said that as a partisan of the measure he wished to explain his vote in the name of republican principles  speak for yourself cried anvoice on the left the banishment of the two royal families was a simple measure of public safety adopted by the provisional government its principle as the minister stated could not bear discussion no the republic had not committed an injustice and if anything honoured it rendered it strong and imperishable it was the generosity it had displayed after its victory in the constituent assembly he had voted for the ostracism he now combated because the security of the republic in his opinion no longer re quired the maintenance of proscription the republec was stronger than people generaly imagined and he enterthined nb apprehension for its stabilitym marc dufraisse who spoko next declared that tho laws of proscription were just useful and necessary and that it was highly legitimate and wise to maintain them he then proceeded to develope his theme interrupted at every moment by the legitimist members m berryer he said had stated that royalty whether legitimate or ac cepted never perished lte would reply that the penalty of royalty should never perish either to the eternity of the monarchical right he would opposo the eternity of the penalty according to  berryor if dynasties are inno cent revolutions are guilty he would tell m berryer that dynasties wrere judged and condemned by insurrec tion he could not admit the doctrine of the in nocence of princes burled from the throne by the people did those princes recognize the legitimacy of the revolution if they did he would vote in favour of the repeal of the laws of proscription m dufraisse then referrinz to the trial of louis xvi jstied the death of that unfortunate monarch loud murmurs on the ljegiti mist benches and cries of  order orderir the president said that for the honour of his countri he could not permit the vindication of an act justly brandes by historym marcc dafraisse observed that he had not justified the act but merely said that the members of the convention vho voted ia favour of the appeal to the people wished to bring back france to monare  didnot the rasndfather of your king addressing the orlesnists  the ath warrant of thatking loud

aid that he had addressed an appeal to the assembly in the name of the peace of the country and of the dignity of the exiled princes but after the detestable sentiments expressed at the tribune bravos and applause on the right and centre his convic tions words and votes were no longer free and he entreated the assembly to adjourn the discassionthose few words of m berryer thhrew the assembly into the greatest confusion m iscatory an up to the tribune but most of the members having tumultuously left their seats rushed into the semicircle and actually besieged the tribune which m piscatory held
