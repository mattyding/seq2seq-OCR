tions on the subjects which had occupied their lordships at tention during the last ten days nor for the purpose entering into a discussionof any of those questions of publici policy which had been mentioned inthe course of those exl planations which had taken place neither would he tenture upon any strictures whatever upon tho peechuof the noble earl near him the earl of aberdeenj although it was upon the subject of that speech that he was anxious to address a few words to their lordships he the duke of argyll confessed that iti struck him that the speech of the noble earl partooks somewhat more of an argumentative than of an eoxr planatory character but the intention for which he rose was one very easily fulfilld he held in his hand h petition from the corporate body of the city of glasgow upon tho subject of the papal aggrecsion  a misunder standibg or misconception had arisen in many quarteral wsith regard to the state of public feelio ia that part ofl the united kingdom on the subject of that aggresion thero were two circurstancet in rhich the situation of scotland differed from that of england in respect to the racent proceedinks of the pope of rome the first was that this apal aggresion had no reference to scotland at aui the prelates of the roman catholic church in that country i were now in the situation of vicarsapostolic if a balll should ever be issued for a similar purpove in scotlandi to that for which one had been sent forth for england i the probability was that the individual would be madei archbishop of edinburgh who novw rejoiced ina titleasome i thing like that of bashop of lityra at thesame time he i could assura their lordahips thit the feeling whichhad been arotised inscotland by this papal sggresion againat thqi established churoh and the laws of elgland was we etrong and pervading there had not itwastrue beenteli same number of county meetings in scotlaad as in england i on the subject but the same feeling had been expressoed at theme of the towns of scotland as at the neetngs which had n held in this country one of the largestneetings ver held iu glasgow wasin referencoe to the billi ibsich had been introdumed on this tubject his opinion was that if adissolutionof parliamenthad taktn place with aview to call forth a popular demoostration on this subject the difficulty in scotland would hase been not to rouse the feeling  of the people but to restrain it within due and moderate bounds e would teu their lordship in a few rords theounds on vwhich the petitioners on this subject proceeded lheyin the first placeproceededonthe prineiplethat although they were boun to olerate the roman catholic religon yet they were not bound to tolerate vrery assumption of the roman catholic church and that the assumption whih was so often made by the roman cathaouer and be feared he might add by some prskhtants also that tha people of this country wera so bound was neither good in logic nor true in fact every civil government had ifelt it necessary to curb and restrain the free actioo of the romancatholic ohireli wheu in its full csiger secondly the petitiquers uniformly procoededon this farther principlethac whatever restrictions might have been necemary at any former time with regard to the pretonsioms of the rolan catholic hierarey were especially ueessary at the present moment xhey beliered that no one ofthe pretensions of that church had ever been passed by or abaidoned they believed that it was an unchangeable church and lastly the peti tioners ilmost uniformly referred to the recent aggression against this country a proof of tke spirit in which the claims of tha roniish church would be pat forth and referred to the proceedigs of the roranh hprch over the continent of europe as evidehce of the tmper in which any power that church miht ac quire would be exercised in this country the no�le earl near him the earl of aberdeen seemed very stronglp to intimate that the beat courae which the goveraraent could pursue in regard to this quesion was to pass it over quietly and the noble earl said that he rezarded this pnpal aggression aore with contempt than with any other feel ing in his estimation however th roman catholic church as by no means so contemptible a power as the noble earl seemed to think it but one that was calculated to exercise the moat baneful influence on the social and political in terests of the country hear hear he must say that deeply as in other circumstances he should have deplored the events of the last ten days yet looking to the high principle and the incorruptible faith exhibitedin the attemapts which had been made to form a ministry and the circumstance that the failure to do so had called forth the opiniis ex pressed by the noble earl shared as he had stated by almost all his former coueagues he did not besitate to tay that he rejoiced in that failure hear hear he rejoiced that no government had been formed in england on the basis of passing over in total silence an act that had been proved to de an aggression against the public law of edropeandagainst the spirit if not the letter of the municipal law of ngland hear hear and above all an aggression which if passed ever would infallibly lead to furthet encroach ments on this country which would in the end be plunged into the contest with the grievous disadvantage of being hampered by fatal admisions and fainthearted acquiescencelord brougham presented several petitions from places in the county of cork praymg theirlordships to reject the ecolesiastieal titles biu which had been introduced into the other house of parliament the petitioners heapsd or lavished upon that biu all the expressions of reprobation which it was possible to eniploy but though he felt bound to state their prayer to the house he could not be expected to go along with them in the expreesions they used when they described the meaeure as a violation of the principles of civil and religious liberty aud as an insult to their clergy and a plunder of their property on this question he would not at present express any opinion whatever but he was anxious to statethat nothing which had fallen from hisnoble friend opposite from the noble earl or the noble dake who had just spoken had shaken the view with which that night he had entered the house just on account of the statement made by his noble friend lord lansdowne with reference to the establishmnent of a strong government and just on account of what they had been told of the feelings of the people of ireland and scotland he implored her majestys government to pause before they rejected the advice not to proceed to legislate at least at present on this subject but to be satisfie with a resolution of both hoases of parliament hear hear that course would be attended vith two inestimable advantages it would post pone for the present that religious agitation the worst of all agitations which was tearingsociet to nieces on both sides of the channel though in epposite dlrectionsit would post pone at least if it did not altozether allay it it would avoid the constant renewal of that agitation and acerbity of feelng that at present too much he might say too fatally prevailed osi both sides of the channel and it would give timefor what he had always thought called for anid what the events of thb last few days added infinite force to the necessity of further inquiry of fuller and more accurate information respecting all the matters involved in the qules tion hear hear wvhen

proser mode of dealing with this subject was precisely thatwhich had been recomnended by tle noble lord lord brougham viz by resolution on the part of both houses of parliament carried to the foot

a penal measure it was amother question how xr it might be severe or not bat he would remind the noble earl that perscution wrasverr difrerent at difreretat periods people entertained different ntions
