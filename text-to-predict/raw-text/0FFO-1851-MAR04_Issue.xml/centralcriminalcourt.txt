mlayor the recorder the commonseiueant al dermen hunter salomons sir c marshall and lawrencemessrs carden and hodgkinson sheriffs messrs lawv and ellis undersheriffs cthe calendar at present contais the names of  pri sonersthe recobder after the grand jury had been sworn said in addressing them that it was a matter of congratula tion that the state of the calendar was such as would not render it necessary for him to detain them more than a few minutes and indeed when he first came into court he an ticipated that he should at once have been able to remit them to the performance of their duties since he bad taken his seat upon the bench however the depositions in two or three cases had been put into his hands to which he consi dered it necessary to call their attention by a few observa tions he was gladto rceive that the calendar was not only light m numbers rut also in the quality of the crimes charged in it and that it did not contain a single charge of the iighest nature known to the lawthat of murder there were however three cases involving the destruction of human life wbich were of rather a pecuhar character and he thought he ought very briefly to call their attention to those cases in the first of them it appeared that the injury inflicted was of a very trifling description and con sisted merely of a punctmre in the hand by a fork and the death of the person appeared to have been owing to his bad state of body at the time he received the injury it was his duty however to tell them that if it should appear that the injury although triflin in itself sti by reason of the bad state of the body of the deceased eventually roved fatal the party would still be liable to the charge of msn slaughter in the next case it appeared that the deceased was suffering from a malady which must have terminated her existence within a comparatively short period but not withstanding that if it should be established that the injury inflicted by the accused party accelerated even to the very smallest possible degree the death of tho deceased he would be equally guilty of the crime of manslaughter although the period of the dissolution might only have been anticipatedy a very short interval the third case of manslaughter was one of an unusual character it appeared that a little girl  years old had been sent into the room occupied by the prisoner to request her to be quiet she being at the time intoxicated and making a great noise and there could be no doubt that the prisoner gave her a quantity of gin the effect of which was to cause immediate insensibility and she was removed to the hosital where she died two or three days afterwards these being the facts he should recom mend the grand jury if they should be of opinion from the evidence that would be laid before them that the prisoner had recklessly and incautiously administered a quantity of spirit to a girl of tender years and that death was the result to return a true bill and he might remark that the fact of the prisoner being in a state of intoxication at the time would not afford any excuee for her conduct the learned judge then said there was a case of a most disgust ing character in which a person filling the position of a gentleman and a member of the college of surgeons was charged with felonious assaults upon no less than seven young girls it would not be advisable for him to make any reference to the disgusting evidence that appeared in the de positions and he would merely remark that if the grand jury should think it was made out that there had been anything of wbat the law called duresse either by intimid t tion or by the administration of spirits to some of the rs wvho were brought forward as witnesses so as to hinder tem from offering that resistance which otherwise would have been expected from them he considered the grand jury would be justified in finding a true bill in all the cases in wvbich those facts were made to appearthe grand jury then retired to their
