the first wirelesselectrical pioneers reminiscencesthe jubilee commemorations of the institu tion of electrical engineers concluded yester day with meetings in the afternoon and even ing at which about a dozen speakers contri buted reminiscences about the development of the industry attention was devoted chiefly to the generation and distribution of electri city though references were made to tele graphls and telephones by sir william noble the engineerinchief of the post office and mr j e kingsbury mr a a campbeu swinton mentioned that examination of the notebooks of david hughes showed that in  he had made numerous experiments in the transmission of signals by an elemen tary form of wireless telegraphy though he did not know he was dealing with electro iagnetic waves the existence of which had not then been discovered by hertzin opening the proceedings si celmles parsons said that he first attacked the prob lem of driving dynamos while he was an apprentice at elswick in  and he de signed a rotary engine of which about  examples were built  but not until  did he take up the construction of the turbine and of the electlic generators it was to drive which on account of their very high speed gave as much trouble as the turbine itswlf the first turbine made  revolutions a minute and the armature of the dynamo was less than in in diameter it worked satisfactorily from the start though it was far from eco nomical in steam consumption which was  times greater than it is in lkrge modern units the first turboalternator wvas built in  in  two  kw turboalternators were ordered for elberfeld germany and in  a turboalternator of  kw was supplied to the commonwealth edison com pany of chicagoin speaking of the introduction over  years ago of alternating current transmission at r volts at the deptford station dr s z de ferrant said that among the elec trical difffculties was lack not only of know ledge and experience  but also of suitable insulating materials another speaker mr v pantridor told how under dr fer rantis guidance when everything else failed the staff made their own cables they were in ft lengths and as about  nmiles were laid there were over  joints about  miles of these original cables are still in daily usesome incidents that occurred when he was spreading the electric light nbroad were nar rated by mr b drae he took a brush machine and lamp to madrid in order to give a demonstration in the buen retiro publio gardens as no wire could be bought a por tion of the circuit between the dynamo nnd the lamp consisted of iron hurdles suspended from the trees nd some germans vho were struggling to get their installation started first were puzzled by this arrangement which they imagined to be part of the brush systetn after the light had been in use for some time a spaniard on the strength of legal acquisition desired to take over the working but regarding ths as premature mr drake objected and to settle the question pocketed an essential piece of the dynamo the result was that he was threatened with imprisonment for theft and with having to fight a duel when he came outmr james swinnurne also bud some amusing foreign experiences to ielate in paris where he had gone to establish a swan lamp factory there were unaccountable delays in gettingthe engine to start after it had been erected finally he was invited to the engine house where he found the engine covered witl flowers a bouquet for himself and the workmen in holday garb with bottles of wine his health and that of the engine had to be drunk and next day the engine was at work
