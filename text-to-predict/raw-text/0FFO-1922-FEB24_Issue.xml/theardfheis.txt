damages act  was pre sented and read a first time on the motion of load st johan of bl xsothe irish situationthe lord chancellor replving to a question by earl bultton said theevents which took place yesterday at a meeting of the sian fein body in dublin will have been noted by your lordships the implications of the decision there taken are a little difficult to appreciate clearly in this country and i should be unwiiuing to commit myself pre maturely to an expression of opinion as to what their result is but the irish ministers representing the provisional government have been invited to come to this country during the weekend in order that discussion may take place between them and the representatives of his majestys government as to the effect of the decision reached yesterday in the sinn fein body as far as the government is concerned and subject to these discussions our position is of course precisely the same we stand by the treaty and we do not at present understand that the decision taken is adverseto that view but if either the noble lord or any other noble lord widl be good enough to put down a question next week when the discussions i have indicated have taken place i shal no doubt be in a position to give fuuer informationbulgaria and hungarylord newton asked if the supreme council were still insisting upon the formation of voluntary armies in bulgaria and hungarv in spite of the excessive additional expenditure involved and the difficulty of obtaining recruits in spite of the declarations of the supreme council as to the necessity for a reduction of armaments there were todav three and a half years alter the peacemore men actually under armns in europe thau there had been beforo the war the only allies that had disarmed were this country and to a certain extent italy the only countries v here disarmamenit had peon put into force were the two small nations of bulgaria and hun gary it was ridiculous to suppose that they could be a danger to anyone they were surrounded by hostile nations two or three times as large and possessing armies  times as large it was a most deplorable thing that the mistaken impression should be created thbat thiscountry desired to act in a vindictive manner against the snrall nations which were against us in the warlord sydenham said it was evident there was a propaganda on foot working in three principal directionsobstruction of the enforcement of reparation against ger many the dissemination of commnunism throughout the world and the restoration of the assassins who had brought the world to ruin part of the propagnda were the vicious attacks upon poland hungary and  montencgro why should hungary be deprived of the means of defending the little country and the few rights that had been left to her bulgaria was in a somewhat different position but she like hungary had aggressive neighbours surely these countries might be permitted to aise the very limited forces that were allowed to them in the cheapest and easiest manner he supported the appeal of the noble lordlord curzons replymiarquess curzon secretary for foreign affairs said his noble friend lord newton spoke as though our representatives at the supreme council or the meetings of the ambassadors conference in paris acted under special instructions different from thos given to the other powers this matter was for the time being in the hands not of the supreme council but in those of the ambas sadors at pariswho were charged with carry ing out the treaties signed and ratified and they had no alternative but to carry them out the object of those treaties was to get rid of the danger of large standing armies in europe and to put a stop to the spirit of militarism in small countries as well as large which was the foris et osigo of the late war thle first and most obvious necessity was to substitute voluntary enlistment for com pulsory service the ireaties that had been signed provided for voluntary enlistment and it was applied all round and would be applied to turkey when the time came his noble friend seemed to think that it did not matter if they evaded or altered a treaty it was truc that bulgaria last autumn complained to the powers that slhe was unable to raise a voluntary force without raising the scale of pay to a figure out of proportion to her assets the powers at once took up the matter and made a roncession and similar conces sions had been made in the case of lungary this force would be arndly sufficient for the maintenance of order there was no reason why hungary in straitened circumstances required a large regular army or no reason why the powers should allow it a shortterm conscript army was a luxury they used to public destruction and ultimately to their own destruction and a menace they could not display in the future it was im possible to allowv any deviationfamine in russiathe archbisiiop of canterbiry said he desired to call attention to tlhe facts now in our possession with regard to the famine in russia and to ascertain whether any action in connesion with it was likely now to be taken by the government or wvethier they could give the house any anticipation of what was liklely to be the outcome of the reports now issued for a long time past wel had all been aware that we were living in the presence of one of the most appalling calamities that the world had ever known while ui e had been about our work the people of russia had been dying by thousands and the facts were beyond words wvlhether the house looked at the reports now issued or at the newspaper pictures an unspeakahle horror pre vailed over a vast area the picture wvas so awful that it seemed to apply to some other age than our owvn for a long timc past the matter had been overhung with the difficulty of getting informationnow a change had come the veil had been to anlarge estent lifted and falcts put before tltem by those who could give them a true picture and by those competent to judge about it dr nansen and sir beniamin robertson had given them details of the terrible shqte of affairs in the fmmmine area of russia the report made a difference in the whole situia tion and set before thern in fairly clear objec tive what was to be done a definite plan worked out to accomplish it and tie money required for doing it that put the situation in a different light from that which had been previously before thbm tbe huge area affected was in the volga basin containing some  millions of people and it was calculated that nbout  or  millions were literally starving this was not due to the ravages of wvar but to a drought folloving a season of halfsowing of seedthe relief societies of america had made themselves responsible for about seveneighths of the need that wtas estimated to exist leaving oneeighth to the british relief forces the united states had voted not as a loan but as a gift more than four million pounds the district left to us had not been touchedby the americans there were about a million and a quarter of people in the area for the most part we had helped childrenonly the americans helped children only or mainly at first but finding that amistake were adopting the policy which sir b robertson so eloquently advocated end taking care of adults ns well as children there were a few facts wlhich alle viated the horror of the situation there was no kind of pilfering or nbstraction of food or money that was being sent for relief and our distributing agencies were efficient the soviet government was cooperating to the best of its power in bringing relief by contrihiuting the seed corn to be put into the ground for next year it had been noted by observers that these unhappy people who were reduced to the verge of death were if they had anything at all to eat ready to sow the corn rather than to eat it what was needed in the area taken over by great britain vab according to sirb robertson a half a million of money this would not do everything that could be desired but it would make an incalculable difference we had a certain amount of stocks within about three weeks would begin the period of five weeks during wlhich the thaw took place and no transport wvas possible witlin the next week or two the stores must be got for w ard the great object was to get in the american area what was requisite to keep things going till the middle of april in the middle of april we should have to take over a neow responsibility for keeping the people until the harvest in august according to this nvise observer given the necessary help weo could wvitlh care prolong the feeding of tle childrenwe were nowv feeding about  and feed also possibly  or  adults whom we were not niowv feeding for want of money a very large numnber of people must die but this enormous result in the preservation of life could be secured in the area in question could the government see their way to any such substantial grant as when supplemented by voluntary aid would enable this to be done the marquess of aberdeen drew at tention to the statement which had appeared in the press that dr nansen had become an honorary member of thie soviet and to dr nansens disclaimer in a letter to thc times of february  lie thouglht that in the cir cumstances an apology would be appropriate from mr novikoff who had commented on the matter in such a way that the inference was that dr nansen was disqualified for carry ing out the work entrusted to him by the league of nations of conveying russian refugees to their homes dr nansen had transferred  refugees to their homes at a cost of about Â£ dr nansen also sent  suits of clothes to the most needy of those prisoners it was a  most mischievous thing that discredit shouldbe thrown upon the good work of dr nansen hie joined in the appeal to the government to do something to clear thle character of this country from the aspersion that it was show ing a lack of concern in the russian famineuseless storeslord ematott said he was chairman of the russian famine relief fund which was responsible for the disposal of the stores given by the government through the red cross to help in relieving the distress and suffer ings he did not xvant to look a gift horse in the mouth but he must sav that a good deal of thoso stores were useless for the relief of  famine the fund had to collect the storesfronm army dumps and send them to russia at considerablc expense anmong the stores were  tons of limejuice which could not be said to bring great physical relief or moral comfort to people dying of starvation the pork and beans and tinned beef in the stores though less useful than grain were still of some use in feeding adults the stores that were brought to constantinople were mainly composed of motheaten clothing and secondhand goods with some medical comforts they were found to be of so little use in russia that with the consent of the govermment they were diverted to the relief of refugees in constantinople dis tricts these stores which were said by the disposals board to be worth Â£ were valued by lloyds at only Â£ the re maining stores valued at Â£ by the dis posals board consisted of medical drugs and hospital equipment it was impossible for the fund to have them valued but he was eredibiy informed that many of the drugs were what was called timeexpired from the point of view of famine relief something more digestible was required than operating tables of which there were many in the hospital equipment a donation of Â£ or Â£ would have been more serviceable what were wanted more than anything else were grain beans rice and commodities of that kindlord weardale described the work of the save the children fund and urged the government to supplement the efforts of the voluntary societies by a grantthe governmient viewmarquess curzon said that he agreed with almost all that had been said by noble lords all honour was due to the generosity of the american government who had given  and whose agency working under mr hoover had accomplished and was ac complishing so much lord emmott had spoken as the chairman of the russian relief fund and it he wvas dissatisfied with the nature of the material with which he had to deal he could assure him that no one was dis satisfied with the way in which the fund and particularly lord emmott himself had de voted themselves to their task as to the question of the stores it alwiays seemed in our country that the administration of charity was accompanied and disfigured by stupidity of the grossest description so it had been in this case he imagined that it was the disposals board which had been responsible for the errors which were complained of and he promised to put himself in communication with those persons with the view of seeing whether any more serviceable stores were available lord emmotts committee had been responsible for sending out sir benjamin robertson and no more competent man could have been found he also paid a tribute to the selfsacrifice of dr reginald farrar those of their lordships who recalled the father dean farrar were not in the least surprised at the selfsacrificing career of the sonhe had asked sir benjamin robertson to advise him on the question and the advice given was that it was no good for us to attempt anything in the large area that was being so successfully covered by the american or ganizations and that we should concentrate on the two little islets whieh were admainistered by the save the children fund and the society of friendshe lord curzon was glad to hear lord emmotts view that the scope of the work ought to embrace the adult as well as the young he recognized that large sums of money were asked for but when he went to the chancellor of the exchequer he repeated in language tbat was convincing that we had  nearly two nmilions of unemployed here and he talked about the geddes axe and that two depart ments were to disappear the chancellor of the exchequer added that if he went to the house of commons for a sum of money lie could not get it he could only say that glad to help as he was he had not persuaded his colleagues to help he suggested that those who were bringing this matter forward should organize public opinion and if neces sary get twvo or three hundred members of the house of commons to sign a round robin to the government to consider the matter he was sorry he could not give a more consolatory replyindia and egyptmarquess curzon replving to the earil of minucrton stated that a dispatch had now arrived from the viceroy of india with the viewvs of the government of india on the situation and it was being prepared for sub rmission to parliament it would be accom panied
