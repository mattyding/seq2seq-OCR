of piomise of marriage brought by a divorced wife against the husband who had divorced her it did sometimes happen that in the interests of the children people who had been divorced came together again human nature was such that sometimes people would forgive the greatest offences committed against them women more easily as a rule than men but what made that case so curious was that the divorce was not one that a man could overlook and forget it was not a case of a woman seduced by some man of fascinating appearance and social achievements but a common sordid divorce of a woman caught in adultervy with her husbands ehauffeur the jury would have to consider whether it was in accord with human nature for a man in such circumstances to be eagertoremarry and rebuild the
