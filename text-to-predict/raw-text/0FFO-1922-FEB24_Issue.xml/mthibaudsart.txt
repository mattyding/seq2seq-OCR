m thibauds artphilharmonic concertthe philharmonic orchestra under ir frank bridge gave a line performance of don juan last night and accompanied m thibaud in lalos svmphonie espagnole with the scherzando often omitted butter worths  shropshiro lad thle bachelgar fugue and beethovens c minor symphony completed the programmemr bridge is a good conductorevn a very goodbut it would be difficult for the superconductor bimself to get all through a long programme quite successfully at only a days notice something had to go by the board and it was the beethoven which we need not therefore discuss the  don juan was excellent crisp and finished to a degree full of noble sound perlaps strauisss own performance of it the other day had something to do with this another well managed thing was lalos  symphonie as was natural with a conductor who is a string player one could feel that the soloist could spread himself its he pleased and be certaini of support whatever he did m thibauds playing is so natural and easy that people are apt sometimes to see nothing much in it and an audience does not warm to him as to niore demonstrative players but every thing is there quietly in its place both the scherzando and the andante were most poetic and gave one quite a new impression of the work elgars arrangement the subject of considerable discussion seems when looked at temperately to be as defensible as any other arrangement and on the same grounds  if a new voice says an old thinlg it can say it only in the tories wliich are its own in a translation we ought to be able to forget the original  to do otherwise leads to pedantry
