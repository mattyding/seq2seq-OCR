whether an explanation could be given of the alleged misleading cuotation of captain castexs article in the rawae mai tjme of january  on submarine warfare by the first lord of tho admiralty at the sitting of the committee on limitation of armaments on december  at washington and wvhether this misleading quotation if made affected adversely the proposals to reduce the submarine tonnage of the leading naval powersmr balfour lord president of the coulncil city of london cuthough i somewhat regret that captain castexs articles should not now be permitted to fall into oblivion it may be convenient if i enumerate the points to be borne in mind by those who would rightly estimate their bearing on the submarine discussion at washington these points seem to me to be the following it is clear in the first place that his state ments did not commit the french admiraltv still less the french government least of all the french people he spoke only for him self but none the less his views could not be ignored the articles themselves were ably written they occupied the place of honour in a french technical journal of authority published under the direction of the french naval staff and their author is or was an instructor of french naval officersan important part of the flrst article is occupied with an exposition of german views on the proper use of submarines in war it is in the course of this exposition that the notorious passage occurs respecting the unique value of this weapon for the purpose of accomplishing the final ruin of british sea power but it has to be observed that though this statement is embedded in a statement of german opinions with which captain castex is in general agreement he is entitled to plead that this agreement does not extend to every sentence which the statement contains we cannot therefore conclude that he desires the destruction of england but only that if he did unrestricted submarine warfare would be the maritime weapon upon which he would probably relyit is true thatcaptain castex while ap proving german principles sees blemishes in german practice he thinks as we all think that they too often conducted sub marine warfare with a cruelty which was both useless and stupid useless because it did not further the military objects they had in view stupid because in addition to bein useless it outraged the consciences of civilized mankind but for submarine wiarfare properly conducted he has nothing but approvalthe question then arises what in captain castexs opinion is submarine war properly conducted  for present purposes it suffices to reply that it certainly permits the destruc tion without warning and without examination of merchant vessels the sinking of liners with their crew their passengers and their cargo now it was these very operations originally devised as he proudly claims by french ingenuity which came under review at the washington conference it was these operations which undermr roots guidance the governments of france of italy of japan of the united states and of the british empire unanimously declared to be grossly immoral it was the perpetrators of them who were pronounced liable to be punished as pirates cheerswashington conferencereportmr balfour in reply to kr gnstrar dovil nemcastle x cu said that the verbatim report of the proceedings of the washington conference was of such length as to make the cost of publication prohibitive as soon as the report was received from washington with the speakers permission he would arrange for some copies to be placed in the library of the housethe genoa agendain reply to mr malone leyton e l who asked when and where the conference of experts prelminary to genoa would meet Â£r llroynd george said there will no doubt be interchange of ideas from time to time between the officials concerned and it is hoped to have a meeting with french and other experts shortly an international agenda committee will meet shortly before the conference at present the material for the conference is being examined by officials of the departments concerned and representatives of business interests are being and will be consulted i hope to discuss the whole question with the french president of the council on saturday nextgerman war factoriesand gun storesmr a williamns durham consett l asked whether the geiman government had adopted a system of fictitious leases to so called commercial companies of remount depots motor transport services army cloth ing factories and powder magazines being semces which under the treaty of versailles it was bound to suppress and whether the effect of those fictitious leases was to reserve to the german government the right to terminate thtm at any moment and to reenter into possessionmr lloyd george repliedthe report of the interauied military commission ofcontrol of february  to the allied mlitary i committee bf versailles states that the geiman government proposes to let a certain number of foimer administrative establish ments such as clothing factories supply depts etc to limited liabilitv companies for a period of  years the german govern ment might hold a controlling interest in these factories the interallied military commission of control are at present engaged in examining the question as to whether these transfers are genuine or not and a report will be submitted in duze coursesir r a sanders undersecretary for war bridgwater cu informed mr a wmwms that the number of complete cm howitzers discovered by the alied military mission of control hidden at the works of herr rokstroh at heidenau in saxony was  besides  inner tubes and a number of other parts it had now been established that work was done on these weapons after the armistice the aulegation that a german official was a party to this very serious case of concesament was being rigorously investigated the total number of howitzers of this clams allowed to the german army under the treaty was streplying to another question by mr a weaxs as to whether he had information that officers of the allied military com mission of control recently discovered at spandau arsenal two rooms stored with docu ments which the german government had declarel to be nonexistent or lost constituting a retura of the armament establishment of germany at the date of the armistice and that ithese documents were removed

ceeding at constantinople with that object in view repliedit is hoped that the turkish question will be discussed in paris in the neai future the answer to the second part of the question is in the negativethe price of beersir r horne answering fr i lytx stratford cu saida reduction of one penry per pint in the duty on beer as now sold is approximately equivalent to a reduc tion of s a standard barral idvolving an estimated loss of revenue of Â£ a year but increases or decreases of duty are not necessarily reflected in lull in the retail prices chargedpayment for the army ofoccupationsir r horne asked by mr lsmm whether the Â£ paid by germany in respect of the cost of the british army of occupation had been encashed by the exche quer and including that amount what was the approximate sterling value of the germai payments in cash and in kind as against the estimated cost of the occupation o Â£  and whether suci german reparation payments had injured british trade repliedthe Â£ referred to has been paid into the exchequer owing to variations in the rates of exchange between the dates at which expenditure on the british army of occupation has been incurred and those at which repayment has been made by ger many it is not possible to answer the second part of the question by giving sterling figtures moreover all figures are at present subject to revision and dependent on decisions stin to be taken by the reparation commission and interallied agreements still  to be finallythe gold mark figures arethe estimated cost of the british army of occupation up to january   is  gold marks receipts of all kinds from germany whether finally allocated to the british empire or not less spa coal advances amount to about  gold marks it should be added that tbe gold mark equivalent o s has been paid out by the treasury to canada australia and new zealand in settlement of that part of the british empires claim for army of occupation which was in curred in respect of canadian australian and new zealand troops no reparation payments have been made by germany to this country and the last part of the question therefore does not ariseracial minoritiesmr balfour replying to lseutarn colosxer guiness bury st edmunds cu saidthere is no commission or other body appointed by the league of nations to super vise treaties affecting religious or racial minorities but there is a special section of the secretariatgeneral at geneva to deal with matters arising out of that branch of the leagues functions the procedure is that minorities whose protection is secured by treaty guaranteed under the league can as soon as the treaty comes into force and the council of the league has accepted the obliga tion bring their case before the league which deals with each matter as it is presented on its merits treaties affecting racial minorities in thrace and acedonia are not yet in forcelieutenantcolonel guinness have not half a million refugees already arrived in bulgaria and is not that prima facic evidence that they are not receiving just treatment at the hands of other countries in the conquered territories  is there no hope for these unfortunate people until the treaties are revised and if so when will that be  mr balolitmy hon and gallant friend has travelled into a vast area of inter national politics i recommend him to address that question to the foreign office lieu teantcolosel gunocsss said he had addressed to that department a question about bulgaria and had been informed that nothing was going to be considered at present and that the conference in paris would deal onlv with the treaty with  turkey could the matter be brought before the league of nations so as to get some settlement made for the unfortunate bulgars  mr balfojmy hon friend wiiu see i think that it is not the business of the league of nations to lecture the supreme council or tell them bow to get on with the business of finisbing these treaties it really is a foreign office question in answer to loan r cecil hitchin ic mr balfour addedi think it is quite pos sible that some further elaboration of the machinery dealing with minorities may have to be made by the league of
