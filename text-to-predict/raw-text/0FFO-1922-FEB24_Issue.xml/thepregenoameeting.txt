the pregenoameetinglines of agreementcrux of sovietrecognitionfrom our onvn corvespondentparis feb it is now definitely settled that m poincar and mr lloyd george wiiu meet on saturday at boulogneit is probable that aeither will leave their respective offices before saturday morning and that both will return home the same daythe very fact that the conversation is to take place and will be of so short a duration makes it clear that the last fewv days have seen a soesible rapprochement betvreen tho french and british points of view while much has been done to clear away misunderstandings  through tho usual diplomatic channels it be comes more and more evident that france and great britain are very deeply indebted to the tact and persuasiveness of m benes the czechoslovak prime ministerwhether through him or through lord hardinge it seems now established that the british government has given satisfactory assurances to france on three of the points made in m poincares note of february  there can now be uo question but thatthe genoa conference will not behoer mitted to discuss exsting treaties hait will not be permitted to deal with the problem of reparatlons and thatthe holding of the conference will in no wavy impair or infringe upon the duties of the league of ationbtin regard to the league of nations indeed it is believed that the british government has so far rallied to the french standpoint as to be prepared itself to propose that the league be asked to ensure the practical applicsation of some of the decisions to be taken at the genoa cnference this of course will mean that tlio league will be officially re presented at that conferencesoviet recognitionthere remains to be discussed the vitally important and difficult question of when and how the soviet government can be recognized france it is obvious desires that recognition to be later rather than sooner and to be subject to definite conditions and it may be to deffnite guarantees as well the british government on the other hand is believed to be of opinion that the ac ceptance of the cannes resolutions by the soviet government is m the general interests of europo sufficient to warrant immediate recogniitionin some quarters it is suggested that a compromise may be arrived at by allowing each power to decide for itself the extent and manner of the recogni tion not only does such a suggestion run directly counter to the poliev con sistently pursued by successive french administrations that it is for the allies to frame in conceit a common policy towards russia but it also may be dangerous to french interests from an economie point of view for it stands to reason that those powers more pre pared to make terms with the men of llioscow would be accorded mostfavoured nation treatment in the matter of com mercial concessions thus this suggested freedom of action might well lead to the uidignified spectacle of a scramble for the favours of leninthe leagues positionle temps tonight cals attention to another subject which may well be touched upon by m poincare and mr lloyd george on saturclay while it admits that it is highly satisfactory tliat the league of nations should be charged with technical duties as the result of the genoa conference it points out that the holding of the genoa con ference mav imperil the position of the league of nations and the chief object for which it was called into being the league was born in order to prevent a new warnow one of the objects of the genoa conerence is apparently the signature of a treatv by which various states of europe enter into an engagement to respect the frontiers of their neighbours how can such  a treaty be reconciled with the covenant of the leagueit the treaty makes no allusion to the league there vill only be a choice of two evils either the engagement to respect the frontiers wiu he accompanied by no kind of guarantee and then as coinpared with article  of the covenant of the league of nsations it will constitute a step backwards or on the other hand it v ill be accompanied bv guarantees which guarantees can only be furnished by an international organization which will be the rival of the league how can these two equauy undesirable evils be avoided  we only see one ay a clause must be inserted in the treaty to be signed at genoa attaching it to the covenant of the league and stipulating for the compulsory intervention of the league in case of the violation of a frontiernot the least interesting aspect of this suggestion is the consistency with which le temps has never ceased to argue in favour of making the whole league of nations the guarantor for the security of french territorythere is little new to be said concerning the date of the genoa conference while mr lloyd george is still believed to be anxious to have it opened at the earliest possible moment it is pointed out here that a postponement for at least a fort night appears to be inevitable now the conference would presumably last at least three weeks and thus would have to be adjourned over easter this constitutes a strong argument in favour of a post ponement to the third week of april git the earliestthe prime ministersjourneyit was taken for granted yesterday in wellinformed quarters that mir lloyd george would leave early tomorrow morning for boulogne for his meeting with m poincar the prime iinister will be accompanied by one secretary only and will return to london to morrow evening
