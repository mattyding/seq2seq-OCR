the governments attitude to the report andt indicate the policy ministers intend to pursue the sccretary for war last nighlt informed the country of the sub stantial contribution to eeonomiy which the w ar oflico is prepared to makethe mlinistry of labour it is clear has no clcar and precise policy it is atill in the preliminary stage of inquirythe geddes committee in its report on that ministry suggested that a com mittee of experts should investigate tho possibility of economies through the amalgamation of unempoyment and health insurance or at any rate the utilization of the same machinery with a view to reduction of the costs of administration it also recommended that the same committee of experts shoult explore the possibility of placing unemployment insurance on the basis of insurance by industries it was definitelyr in the mind of the gceddes committee that this transformation of the unem ployment insurance scheme would enable the state to dispense witlh the costly employment exchanges eothe ministry of labour has replied by taking action not on one line but on tvo the first already annouhced in the times aecords with the suggestion of the geddes committee and is direct the second deviates from the iecom mendation is indirect and lilkely to produce indefinite delay instead of an inquiry by a small expert cqmmittee the mdinistry of labour is by circular calling for an expression of opinion from leaders of industry and trade unwions some where in the future is a possible com mittee on which employers and worlkmen would be represented to go further into the matter it is a slow incertain and illdirected method of giving expression to a recommendation of great importance dilatory machinery is set to work and in the meantime tho proposal will pro bably be relegated to a top shelf of the alinistry to accumulate dust and decayinsurance by industryinsurance by indutstries presents un doubted difficulties industries that are carried on everywvhere under similar conditions and are not liable normally to violent fluctuations could easily depend upon thenmselves but there are difficulties connected with the demarcation of trades and with the financing of industries having exceptional unemployment ex perience the organization of small in dustries and the making of arrangements for works that do not naturally fall into definite categories the problems are kznowni and are of a character to be dealt vith by experts in consultation not by circular and answer the subject was not long ago under close study by officials of the ministry of labour and little further enlightenment is to be anticipated in response to a letter that amounlts in its length and breadth to nothing more than a request for opinions and an admission that the miinistry has no policy with a show of following the iuggestion of tlhe geddes committee the ministly is as a matter of fact doing sometlhing very different dr mlacnaimara apparently sees no alternative to con tinluinlg existing arrangements so ong as thle pr esent abnormal amount of unem ployment lasts but if the mechanism of insuarance by industries were set up the adminiistrationl of the benefit could be tranlsferred to the new channels even though the ftnds for the emergency period wvere derived from the national pool are the labour exchanges in dispensable  that is the underlying questionthe state of the unemployment fund today can be shoxvn by a few figures ocn january  the inulmber of persons in the unhited kingdom drawing unemployment beneiit was approximately  of whom  vere wholly uncniployed and  vere on short time of this total of  about  were also drawiing graits in respect of dependents coveriiig ahout  vives and house keepers or invalided husbands and about  children on february  the figures were  wholly unem ploycd and  on short time  total gthe deficiency in the unemployment fpnd is approximately £ out of a borrowing power af £ the weekly receipts of the unemlployment fuind vould balance the weekly expendi ture if unemployment dropped to a figure of about  any further improve ment would put the fund in a position to begin to liquidate its debtm inisters invitationdr mlacnarnara states in his letter in the unemployment insurance act of  provision was made wliereby schemes could be arranged and adm inistered by bodies repre cnting lthe employers and employed in a given industry who were prepared to adopt such schemesi for various teasons not the tride°the vindustrviess did ngot nvail themnselves et thie opportunity afforded by the act it remained howvever the policy of the govertiiielt to do everything possible to encouragecontinued at foot of next columnindustries to administer their own schemes for dealing with those of their workpeople who became uneinployed  but owing to the great financial burden caiused by the unprecedented unemployment which began towards the end of  the government were compelled tlhrouglh the unemploymenit insurance no  act of  to close the door tenimporarily to trales vhich might otherwise have pro posed special schemesit was only tuc urgent need of preserving lfuds to meet the general burden of unemploy ment that made this step necessary and as soon as the state of the central fund permits i shall again welcome and encourage the establishniett of special schemes for dealing with unemploymllet insurance on an industrial basisin the meantime the committee on national expenditure the geddes committcej have again called attention to the poillt and in accordance with their recommendations an in quiry by a committee on which employers and employed would be represented into the possi bility ot placing ufiemployment insurance on the basis ot insurabced by industry is contem plated in tlese circuirstanees i am most anxious to lose no time in securing the fullest possible consideration of the whole matter zilthluglh i realize that the difficulties of making any drastic change in the basis of unemploymellt iisurance are aggravated by the present volume of unemploymenti therefore consider it desirable that those practically concerned vith industry should themselves give consideration to the problem in each trade and should thinilk out the lines on which it might be solved through some other ageincy having careful regard to the cost involved in the ewv proposals as compared with that of the present state scheme by this means tbe government will be in a position to know wlhat are tlle considered views of em ployers and employed in each industrv end will be able to consider any practical proposals which may be put forvardi should not wish to lirmit in aly way the scope of the consideration to be given to this matter on the contrary i should be gjad to see the leaders of industry consider howv far chainges in the present arrangements for deal ing with unemployment insuranice can be tng gested with a view both to ensuring economy and enlisting the cooperation of all concerned in establishing suci conditions as will enable state participation in the matter to be reduced to a minimum lt will be apparent to you that any siheme of unemployment insurance must be aecompanied by arrangements for dealing witli the registration ot those who are out of work for tho payment of beneflt to those en titled to it and for the notifidation of vacan cies in the industry wbich buell persons can be askedl to nu and  ihould be glad if ih con sidering the matter your associatio would keep these other questions in iiiid
