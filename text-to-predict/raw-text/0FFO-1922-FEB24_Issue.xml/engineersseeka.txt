by agreement and that its side should be consultedthe dispute began last april when the emploces federation made a formal com plaint to thhe union of  the embargo placed by your committees in various districts in regard to the working of overtime  and ot  the right claimed by your union to be con sulted prior to overtime being worked at the same time they drew attention to some particular cases of interference with the employment of apprentices and the manning of machines but these may he set asidc as minor matters irrelevant to the main issue though they have contributed to the antagon istic feeling of the partiesemiployers bightsthe union held a conference on the fore going complaints and decided that they could not accept the employers interpretation of the agreement but adhered to their own the federations formally replied on april  through sir allan smith reiterating the complaint that an embargo had been placed by union officlals on the working of overtime contrary to the agreement and arguing the question of prior consent as follows during the discussion wvhich preceded the making of the agreement referred to sugges tions were made by your deputation that overtime should not be worked without the prior consent of representatives of your union the employers could not see their was to agree to this condition and it was ultimatcll departed from by your representatives i may remind you that similar claims have been made in practically every discussion which has taken place on overtime and the position bas been anintained that subject to agreecd limitations from time to time the employers are entitled to require their workpeople to work sucb over time as may be necessary notwithstanding this your council bas thought fit to issue an instruction to your district officials to the effect that their prior consent to overtime is necessarv on this question you wyill further keep in mind that although the employers contended and vou by your agreement accepted the contention that overtime cannot be dispensed with both parties agreed that systematic overtime is deprecated and it was explained to your representatives that in accordance with the provisions for avoiding disputes if any case arose where your m embers thought that such advantage was being taken of the agreement as resulted in systematic overtime you were entitled to raise the question and have it dis cussed in local conference and if necessary in central conference ni ecsaymthe letter proceeded to give details of the cases of interference with apprentices and the manning of machines already referred to and intimated that the emplovers were ready to negotiate upon them provided the union agreed to withdraw the embargo on overtime and drop the demand for the prior consent of union officials to the working of overtime the letter concluded with the threat of a lockout if the union persisted in its attitudethe comment of the executive council of the union on this letter sent out to branches prior to a national conference was that where the embargo had been placed on overtime it had not been  proved to the satisfaction of the local officials that overtime was neces sary and that the correct interpretation of the agreement was that  in all cases where overtume was required on production work consultationwould take place and the necessity for overtime be proved to our local official prior to same being worked the national conference held at the end of april fully supported the executive council in their interpretation of the agreement and pledged themselves to meet the threat of a lockout with the fuu force of the organiza tioncrisis of last aprilso the stage was set for a big struggle last april but nothing happened probablv because of the
