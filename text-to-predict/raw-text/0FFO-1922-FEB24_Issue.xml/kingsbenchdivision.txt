collision the admiralty admaitted liability and paid a sum to the lawson company in full settle ment from  until the material date there had been in existence between the admiralty and the defendants messrs baird brothers a running repair agreementunder which accounts were from time to time sent in bv messrs baird and were paid bv the accountant general of the navy with reference to this case messrs baird sent in an account for doing the repairs to the tug and the accoun tantgeneral supposing it to relate to one of the vessels then oncharter to the admiralty paid £ afterwards the admiralty dis covered that the owners of the tug had already been paid and they therefore claimed to recover the amount pfid to messts baird as money paid by mistakethe lawson tug company were on the re cord as additional defendants but they took no active part in the actionthe atrorneygenerta in opening the case said that strictly speaking the admi ralty would not be liable for negligence but when it was clear that an accident had hap pened owing to the negligence of a naval officer the practice was for the admiralty to admit liability such liability would be that of a private owner under the merchant shipping act and would not exceed £ a tonmany witnesses were called and in the course of the evidence it was stated that the lawson tug company were in a position to pay messrs baird if the latter firm should be held liable to repay the money to the admi altya letter was read in which messrs baird had informed the lawson company that the admiralty claimed back the money paid under mistake that however was explained to be not an admission that a mistake had bepn made but only a statement that the admi ralty aleged a mistakemr bevan submitted that as the admiralty had admitted liability to the lawson com pany if messrs baird had sent their bill to the lawson company and they had sent it on to the admiralty and the admiralty had paid it there could not have been any right in the admiralty to get the money back that being so the admiralty having paid mtessrs baird were in no better position than if they had paid the lawson company the evidence showed that one department of the admiralty knew the true facts and the ignor ance of another departmentrepresented in fact by a young woman who was doing temporary work could not be relied on the admiralty cquld not recover even if messrs baird were regarded only as agents for the lawson com pany but in fact the evidence showed that the admiralty  representative at messrs bairds approved of the repairs and he had beeh held out by them as able to authorize work so that messrs baird had a direct claim against the admiralty moreover by making payments on account as the work was done the admiralty led mlessrs baird to suppose that they were doing the work for the admi ralty as principals and the admiralty must now be estopped from disputing the right of miessrs baird to kee p the moneycounsel for the aidm lty were not called upon for replyjudmenrmr jusntice banxacace said that after the collision the tug was sent to messrs bairds yard for repair at the time messrs baird were carrying out repairs to varius ships belonging to or requisitioned by the admiralty and the admiralty had a repre sentative at the works one grant to check the amounts expended and to send in reports on the work as it proceeded when the ulysses came in messrs baird told giant that her repairs were to be admiralty repairs and on tbat representation  grant treated her repairs like those of other vessels properlv under repair for the admiraity at the time that was mistake number one in april  messrs baird sent in an account to the admiralty and grant sent in a certiqieate that the work had been done the account reached a claims department in the admi ralty which dealt exclusively with accounts in relation to vessels belonging to or re quisitioned by the admiralty a booik was kept with the names of the vessels in it it happened that theulyses had at various times been on requisition though shewas not so at the material date the account came before a young woman temporary clerk and she ought to have carefuly examined the book to see whether the vessel concerned was included but she failed to notice that the ulysses was not then on requisition and she passed the account that appeared to be the only responsible part of her duties and i that she was not subject to supervision although in merely mechanical matters she was thus the account was passed that was mistake number two the ovwners put forward a claim for the full cost of the repairs but the admiralty claimed as they were entitled to do the benefit of the limitution of liability to the amount of £ a ton and they paid the owners only £his lonrdsmp then dealt at lenlgth with the correspondence as showing that messrs baird knew quite well that there was no contractual nexus between them and the admiralty and that various statements made in the course of the proceedings were untrue and he said that the case was one which had left a most unpleasant taste in his mouth in his judgment the case was really an undefended action and there must be judgment
