lord birkenheadswarningunionists and anelectiona counsel ofinsanitythe junior constitutional club gave ahouse dinner last nighlt at the club piccadilly to meet the lord chancellor mrw s buchanan vicechairman of thecommittee presided and there was a large attendance of membersthe lord chancellor responding to the toast of his health wlhich had been pro posed by the chairman saidi greatly appreciate the invitation which this club has extended to me i am a politi cal minister and it is in that capacity that i address you i have been io years in the conservative party years in which i have taken an active part in it i could go further and say i had been  years in the party because i was born within the fold and my father before me was a wellknown exponent in the north of england of conservative doc trines if i live so long which i think is extremely unlikelyit may easily happen that i shall be borne in an octogenarian chair to vote for the conservative party i was nur tured in the party and  sll die in that party cheers i have no intention of being driven from it either by the editor of a newvspaper or by anyone else cheersgrave political situationbut it is most undoubtedly true that we are nmet together on an occasion of the gravest possible crisis in the fortunes of the wlhole em pire whether i agree with you or whether i disagree with you i reserve my freedom of judgment and my freedom of speech if we are not ail of us in agreement we can at least part as friends none of us being wishful to drive each other out of an ancient party let me describe to you as i understand it the present grave political situation there are maniy people who are wvearying of the existence of the coalition and the very name of coali tion disraeli once said in one of his generali zationsthe truth of which has yet to be coni pletely establishedtliat this country dislikes coalition that generalization is true in this sensethat we are in a country nurtured on tle party spirit and in the mainand in normal timesa country that has decided wisely in adhering to the view that the funda mental cleavages in the instincts of man should decide the votes which they give and the parties to which they belong but we have lived in the strangest the most bewvilder ing era in which thle citizens of this country have ever lived the wvhole world today is withered by the events of the war and when normal conditions shall reassert themselves no man can confidently saylet mc make it plain where i stand because it is a matter on which i should avoid am biguity i made a fewv observations at a lunclleon about three weeks ago that caused a certain amount of controversy when you invited me to this dinner those observations of mine had been published in the press and i therefore begin by saying that i adhere to every word i said then cheers wvhen we arc asked is not the position in which the country stands today a failure   after the qualified and temporar association between parties which has stood for seven years of our political life i absolutely challenge the state ment that has been made about failure cheers wlheni this government was first formed the verv existence of the empire was trembling in the balance and it was uncertain whetlher the terms of peace would be dictated to germany in the palace of versailles or whether the terms of peace would be dictated in buckingham palace cries of no and  yes i cannot enter into any controversy about thathie would indeed have been a bold man who when mr lloyd georges first govern mentwas formedhad refused to admit that the ultimate solution wvas charged with the most complete uncertainty  i do not need to put it higher than that the result is within the memory of you all what is not so com pletely within your memories is that in the days that followed the armistice there have been dangers there have been crises almost as great as when the enemy was thundering at our gates cheers if there is anybody listening to me today who thinks that there is one minister in the government today who if he could honourably escape from his burdens would not lay them aside with a sigh of relief that man is mad does anyone sup pose that we contemplate with pleasure the months and years that lie in front of us in dealing with ireland witlh india witl egypt with the financial situation and with the spectre of tnvo millions of unemployed in our streets nwe have passed through an era in which we have faced a police strike many of you who lhave followed those things closely know that it was in the hope of the police strike that the bolshevist efforts in this country were mainly launcheld afterwards we were faced with the railway strike and with the coal strike we had to fight that in addition to our staggering financial burdens at a moment fhen we were hoping for incometax relief we were faced with this mad act of insanity on behalf ofthe labour rank mad file whether you like the present leaders of the government or do not like them i chn say to you with the most perfect good feelng that my oxvn mind is quite unaffected in the matter laughter wve try to do our best and if it has not been good enough and there are mien wlio could do better it may be a wise thing to effect a substitutionin this connexion i desire to speak with the utmost possible plainness because in politics i take my orders from nobody cheers i desire to say quite plainly what every onie will admit to be a moderate description of a statesman of europeani reputation like mr lloyd george that i think it extremely un likely he will submit ildefinitely to the kind of humiliations and criticisms to which he is at the present moment exposed cheers i think it unlikely that he will submit and i speak plainly and say that were i in his posi tion i would not submit to themn cheers just consider what has been in substance attained i admit manv mistakes have been made within the last three years let the more ambitious with tle most confidence in their own superior judgment sustain them selves as each error is recounted by thinking how easily and how successfully they would have avoided it laughtera stable governmentin the last three years that have passed since the armistice the british govemment and the british nation have stood like a beacon tower in an unistable and faltering world showing that there was at least one island in wvhich the people had reasonable confidence in the government and that the government was authorized to speak on behalf of the people cheers during that period some seven or eight governments have fallen in france during that period some six or seven governments have fallen in italy and at this moment the principal problem to vhich we are applying ourselves is the regeneration of europe the problem of your unemploy ment never will be and never can be solved if we cannot obtain a stabilized arrangement which will enable theprincipal governments of europe to come together for the purpose of discussion we have at least attained to that all these nations witlh their insta bilities and their uncertainties have felt that at least in britain there is a stable govern ment fixed and certain as the northern starwhat is the position of the british exchange today and what has been its position since the armistice  it stands as high as this country stands for political stability cheerswe are told that the time has comeand i will make no complaint if some of you agree with this viewto dissolve the coalition and that the time has come when the conservative party should make an inde pendent appeal to the electors cheers i am going to allow myself the freedom of very great plainness of speech in this connexion just as i took no offence at all when some of my friends cheered the proposal that the conservathve party should make an independent appeal so equally they may entertain no offence if i state my own view and the conduct which i myself propose to adhere to whoever else adheres to it laughter i take the view that that is a counsel of insanity and so far as i know there is no responsible unionist leader in the government or out of it who takes a different view so far as i know mr bonar law lord derby and the duke of devonshire are in absolute agreement with the view i have indicated to you in these circumstances i am not one of those who when bthe tempest rages and when the captain wquld naturally be on the bridge would givegny par ticular encouragement to the caiin boy to seize the helm laughter and i am more than ever of that opinion when the cabin boy has announced that he doesnot intend to make anotlier voyage laughter i was quite clearly of opinion that we had an absolute justification judged by the highest political staudards of politieal history for challenging the opinion of the country on our whole policy in the early part of the year i desire to make that quite plain because therc are many who at this time disagree with me there will be far fewver who will disagree with mo in three months time no government ever bad more abundant justification ior balleniging the opinion of this country and no government iild haltve doneso with greater certainty ofunionist partys positionwhere does the unionist party stand at the present moment  i am under no delusions there is not the slightest chance of an inde pendent unioniist government obtaining an adequate vorking majority in this country a voice  question there is not the least good saying question go to the north of england which i understandgo to lan cashire go to manchestergo to wales and i may add go to scotland it is true that in scotland in great periods of patriotic appeal when all is favourable to the unionist party you will obtain an adequate response it is piut forward by our critics and opponents that we are chioroformed by our prime alinister i can oxnly tkll you thisif you think men like mr balfour mr cliamberlain lord curzon and myself are the kind of men who would be clhloroformed by any wizard ever born in wvalesthat you greatly over rate the prime minister and you greatly underrate your representatives in the cabinet there are only two alternative policies as i uniderstand tlhem one is that we should con tinue to work with these men and the other is that nve shall repel tlhem and say awe do not desire your helpnow what happened at an election at manchester a few days ago  the candidate i am toldwas anxious to obtain the support ol the coalition liberals the coalition liberals were anxious to give their support but the organization in the constituency was pledged to the cause of independent conservatism and the coalition liberals were repelled from taking part now i have fought many times i cannot remember how many and i never repelled anyone wlhen you have a party which whether numerically strong or weak none the less keeps you in contact ithi the detnocratic side of politics wlheni they are men of whom the leader is the most brilliant man in coaition liberal politics today a man whose qualities you cainot in the least measure by what the caucus tells you in any particular conservative constituency simply for this reason that we are dealing with new millions in the electorate it is somethinlg to be considered these new millions do not neces sarily form their opinions from wlhat is said in the columns of the daily pressfar from iti read the other day in the daily ail regarding the cambernvell election which was the firstfruits of the new policy  final blow for the wvastrels laughter i made some inquiry about this and i ascertained that of the things that had done the most harm in camberwell the worst was the proposal in volved in the stroke of the geddes axe that the hours of education for children should be reduced  what  said the mothers and i do not blame them  send back our children to us in the daytime we have got votes now laughter this was the great blow for the wasters which was involved in that electionmenace of the labour partynow let me here put before you my view of the situation there is one danger and a real one and there is only one danger facing this country today and it is sufficient to submerge it if the situation is badly handled you may dismiss the ridiculous and futile antics of the wee free  party with the contempt they and their policy deservelet us wipe them out of our calculations except as the ponible snatchers of  or  seats at the next electionthere is a great menace and now  speak of wlhat i spoke at the luncheon of the menace ofthe labour partybe under no delusions thev are winning seats every day and they will continue to win seats unless and untilthey are faced by a body vith a coherent and inteligent doctrine which is expressed by men who understand their own minds and can rely on the friendship and loyalty of their own supporters i made some contemptuous but welldeserved observations about the leaders of the labour party the other dayi would repeat them if i had timebut i desire to make one exception i think i ought to make it plain that in my judgment mr thomas has shown courage and statesman ship of a character which no other labour leader has shown cheers i think the coni munitv as a wvliole owes more to him than to any of these chloroform doctors who go about delivering their medium doctrines while bolslievists are receiving russian fuiance in order to keep the party goingwhat is the true position in relation to the labour party  i observe that the daily mail when i made a speech the other day said in a leading article hands off labour i suggest that if the young gentlenman who wrote that article were in our company tonight and you were listening and he said lord chancellor hands off labour we should begin to laugh at him laughtcrnow personally in politics i always address my attack to the formidable enemy and there is no other formidable enemy to the cause to which we are devoted than labour and socialism and there is no other means by wvhich they can defeat us than if at this moment we split and dissipate ourselves cheers do not be under any delusion as to what the labour party really wvant mlr clynes andi mr henderson whom i regard as respectable figureheads of a move ment wvhich they do not understand and which they are entirely powerless to control are put forward when there is a dose of sootlhing syrup required laughter they were both good enough to make replies to the speech i made a fortnight ago and i have not hitherto thought it necessary to attempt having regard to the quality of what they said anv further geassertion of my own view but i will now put to mr clynes and mr henderson a plain question which i invite them to answver at the earliest suitable opportunity and it is thisare they or are they not in favour of the socialization of all the means of pro duction distribution and exchange  if they say they are not they will be swept aside like empty corks which have done their work if they say they are then wve shall know vhere we stand and that the battle is declared and we wil undertake that battle and carry it to its conclusionindispensable alliesi have only this to add i have made it plain that i have the presumption if you like to think for myself and i say that unlessi do not know if it has yet happenedunless this disunion which has recently manifested itself in one branch of the coalition parties de velops to such an extent as to drive from the coalition our liberal colleagues i shall con tinue to give them my support because i think they are our indispensable allies if on the other hand a new situation is created if tle growing humiliations the threats of abstentions of bostility drive them from the coalition i shall myself carefully consider where as an individual i stand but if we go togetheras i am persuaded we must go together for the salvation of this countryto the next election i shall speak throughout the election on behalf of all my unionist friends in the first place if i am asked to help them and i shall thus do what i have done in every election that has taken place for  yearsi shall support those who are giving expression to the views wvhich repre sent the whole of my pohtical creed when that duty is discharged if there be any man who stands for the coalition liberals who says to me  come and help me we have stood by you faithfuiy ini grave times ofnational crisis willt you come and help me now   i shall say  yes i will and i wvill do it when the election takes placei knew before i came here that i must necessarily touch on highly controversial sub jects we live in an atmosphere charged with electricity in which legitimate differences of opinion from day to day disclose themselves all that any honest man can do is to try to see the situation witlh clear eyes and having seen it according to the measure of his experience and powers offer such advice as friends may offer i would not dream of asking that the general brotherhood of your club should assent to what i have said but i would ask you deeply to think about the consequences of a breach disruption and disunion at this stage i earnestly implore you not to underrate the risk of an imperfectly educated socialist party with no coherent viewvs on any single subject in polities vith its immense disrup tive potentialities on the whole structure of the british empire and the delicate fabric of our common life being returned to power not in virtue of its own strengtb but in virtue of our own weakness and lack of organization if those of us who have undertaken the burdens of the last seven years if we receive the confidence of both wings of the coalition i believe we can still win through i believe ve can win another election if our platform is plainly and boldly displayed but beware and this is my last word of entreaty beware how you estrange and alienate men who count for something in scotland in wales in the north of englandcontinued at foot of next column in the wlest men who after all did not hesi tate to run the risk of disrupting and breaking their party when they thought the safety of england required it we may at least make a return to them of running a little risk with a section which i myself believe to be both extremely negligible and inconsiderable i have made my position plainso long as these men combine to act straightforwardly and generously with us i shall act whatever the consequences to myself straightforwvardly and generously with them cheersamong those present werecolonel sir herbert nl
