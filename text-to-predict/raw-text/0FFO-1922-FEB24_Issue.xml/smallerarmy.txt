smialler armywar minister onnext votedrop of  millionssir laming worthingtonevans secre tary for war spoke at chorley in the constituency of captain douglas hacklng inp his parliamentary private secretary last night on the three subjects of expendi ture taxation and unemployment the chair was occupied by sir henry hibbert and the war secretary was supported also by lord crawford the minister saidthese three questions are so interwoven that they are the weft and the warp of one piece taxation on too high a level steals away the capital upon a plentiful provision of which employment in faet depends but until expenditure is reduced taxation cannot be reduced unemployment is itself a direct cause of taxation for are ve not at this moment spending £ a week on one form of relief or another either out of rates or taxes  stagnation of trade reduces the profits of trade and thus the taxes on profits become less productive and it becomes in creasingly difficult to reduce the rate of taxa tion tbis seems almost a complete circle of calamities but yet i recite it and cau your attention to it because i want you to realize the oneness of the three subjects upon which i am addressing youlet me deal first wvith expenditure i noticed in the times a leading article quite recently in which the government was accused of recklessness improvidence extrava gance and waste and the minor lights repeat the charge in a major key they exhaust all their superlatives in a chorus of denunciation now i do not pretend that it has not made uistakes but i believe it has been far more successful in reducing expenditure and pre venting waste than its opponents will admitwar expenditure was at its highest during  millions were employed in the akrmy and miuions more were employed on muni tions and other public services the national expenditure for the year  amounted to £ nearly £ a week then came the armistice and this govern nient came into offlicc the men in the army and in the public services could not be thrown on the street it took time and monev to put them back into civil employment industry vas disorganized work had to be turned from w ar to peace production the cost to the state in bonuses and free insurance for the serving man and for the munition workers land settlement and other schemes to tide over the transition period was not less than £ could this have been saved the government also inherited from the war a whole series of controls and subsidies most necessary in war but most undesirable in peace the prices of wheat flour and bread were controllqd and bread was subsidized this meant a wholehost of officials and by abolish ing the subsidy the saving to date may be estimatedatbetween  and  millions sugar and coal were also controlled with an army of officials and nearly every other raw material was managed by the state and each had its attendant bevy of officialsau controls have been abolished and all subsidies have been stopped and something like  officials have been discharged from overnment servicc i have to remind you of these conditions that honest critics are apt to forget and the baser sort purposely suppress them notwithstanding the difficulties great progressive reductions have been made in expenditurein the last war vear that ending april  the expenditure wvas  milions in the next year ending april  the first full financial year of this government the expendi ture was reduced to  millions in the following year ending april  expenditure was reduced to  rilllions for the year eriding april next the estimated expenditure wvith all the supplementary estimates w hich include manv millions due to war chaiges only now ready for payment is  millions prodigious and progressive reductions have been madethat is to saywe are now spending £ fr every £ we spent in  i quote these figures not with pride or in a spirit of boasting but to prove to you that long before the government asked sir eric geddes to undertake an inquiry into the national ex penditure it was busy at work iii making rcductionlsthe geddes coltteethe gbvernzientaie not satisfied with past reductions they have appointed the geddes committee to advise the chancellor of the exchequer critics seem to think that the times or tome minor paper appointed the geddes committee it was not the opponents of the govermnent it was not the press it was the government who ap pointed the committee to help  the chancellor of the exchequer normally such a committeo would have been pre sided over by the chancellor of the exchequer nothing would have been heard of it until it had examined the various items of expenditure and untilthe departments had prepared their estimates after consultation with the chan cellor of the exchequer it would not have provided copy for the press or sticks with which to beatthe governmentbutf these are still not nornal times a chancellor of the exchequer instead of spend ing most of his thought and time in checking and controlling expenditure and raising and administering the actual revenue is overloaded with other work he has to manage a financial business larger than that of any banker  he has somc  millions of floating indebtedness and  millions of shorttime loans constantly requiring his attention he has a foreign business also to direct both his foreign debtors and his foreign creditors require his attention plenty of time for thought and infinite application are necessary if ireparable mistakes are to be avoided the government fully realizes that a sound financial policy and the careful nursing of our credit and resources will make the difference between prolonged poverty and unemployment and a more or less rapid recovery from the depression which sur rounds usso the geddes comnittee was appointed to review the expenditure of all the depart ments  this committee has been at work for sixs months every hlinister in charge of a department has done his best to help thecommittee for every one of us is cqually desirous of securing economy even at the reduction of many projects which if times were better we should not think of sacrificing many of the economies proposed by the geddes committee were suggested to them either by the ministers or by the officials of the various departments and as a result of their joint efforts reports have been made of the greatest value to the public service a clamour has been raised in the press that the geddes report should be treated as sacrosanct and that every cut proposed should be adopted by the government vith out question that is an absurd position to take ulp and wholly uncon stitutionaleach minister is responsible for the depart ment of thc public service committed to his charge and the government as a vwhole are responsible for all the departments neither the government nor an individual minister can be freed from responsibility for the safety of the country or the efficient conduct of the countrys business because a committee how ever able has reported that a cut here or a cut there can be made the advice given by the committee must be considered by the icabinet and the cabinet must come to itsconclusions and take the responsibility of its actionsarmy expenditurei have bad to consider the geddes report on army expenditure the report advises that there are  officers and men in the army in excess of requirements and advises that  battalions and eight cavalry regi ments shall be disbanded and that the army estimates should be redued by  millions and that next vears estimates should be framed on the basis of an expenditure of  millionsyou will i am sure agree that a publie eeting is not the proper place to go in detail into these questions members are returned to parliament to look after the nations finances and when i present the war office estimates the mps will ask me why i cannot adopt the whole of the geddes recommendations and there will be an opportunity for detailed discussion but i wi put before you some general observations if i were to review the present responsibilities of the empire i should i think soon convince you that having regard to the position in india egypt turkey and on the rhine our potential military liabilities are not less than before the war and that re duction of the iighting forces on the large scale recommended by the geddes committee was not to he lightly undertakenon the other hand the financial and economic conditions of the country are such that unless drastic measures are taken to re duce expenditure and taxation there is no hope of a revival in trade and enterprisewith out which unemployment vill become chronic and a still heavier load of unproductive ependiture will be fastened round our neckswhat then is the duty of the government  it is i think to face uncertain naval and mili tary risks for a time rather than encounter the certain financial and economic risks or rather calamities which would affect all public services however vital and necessary on the basis therefore of being obliged to run rsks in an earnest endeavour to reduc expen diture to meet the present urgentnecessities i will indicate my attitude towards the recom mendations of the geddes committee so far as the army is concernedi told you that the committee holds that there are  officers and men in excess of requirements there are two mistakes in the calculations which produced this result the corrected excess is rather over  not  but even after the correction of this calculation i cannot admit that this is a true excess over requirements for i cannot accept in full the geddes proposals for reduction of the garrison in egypt and elsewhere abroad nor can i overlook the faicts that we have no militia and only very greatly reduced reserves reduction of  offices andmensubject however to the policy of takinz an uncertain risk rather than a certainty of fmancial and economic crisis i am preparel to recommend a reduction amounting to about  officers anid men this in volves disbanding  battalions of infantry  batteries of artillery and the equivalent of five cavalry regiments with correspond ing reduction in the higher stat and ancillary serviceslet no one think that this reduction is a small one it is momentous it is relatively easy to destroy it i not easy to build up the traditions in the army are of slow growth but of the utmost value to destroy a regiment is to destroy a living organism it is the saddest duty that anyone can be caled upon to performi told you that the geddes committee recommended a reduction of  millions in the army estimates in this they wrongly assumed that half a milion could be saved on clothing with this correction and another relating to building of about a quarter of a million their recommendation is reduced to a saving of  mnulions i hope to be able to propose to the house of commons a reduction in army votes of not less than  millions i ought to sav that these figures may not be strictly comparable for some of my savings are not those proposed by the committee and some of those pro posed by the committee i have been com pelled to reject moreover although the committee recommended  millions they did not show how this amount could in fact be obtained so no close comparison is possibleestimate under £the committee in their report point out that the prewar expet diture on the army apart from air was  millions but they forgot to say that the pay of the army has been increased by  times and that the cost of food clothing and equipment is ronghly twice the prewar cost if allowance for this increased cost is made the prewar army wouldtoday cost over  millionsmy net estimates next year apart from charges due to disbanding ofricers and men will be under  miuionsit i may trouble you with one final com parison there has been since this govern ment took office a continuous and rapid reduction in army expenditurein  expenditure was  £ in      in  estimates    next year under   taxation and employmentnow let me say a few words about taxa tsion especiauy in relation to its effect upon employment those who do not pay income tax are apt to think or at least to say that incometax does not matter that those who pay it can afford to doso and that they have plenty left to live on and tbey are the lucky ones for the purpose of my argument i am not going to take the case either of the multimillionaire or of the possessors of incomes subject to lower scales of incometax and supertaxes but i wviu take those whose incometax and supertaxes amount to s to s in the pound i want to sbow you bow these taxes interfere with employ mentsutppose you have £ and still want to use it profitably so as to make an income for yourself and your family what would your position be today  business is very difficult prices have been failing it is a certain loss of money to have large stocks at higher prices wvhich you can only sell at dropping prices if your business depends as a great many businesses do upon your selung your products in india or china or on the continent your customers abroad are not only poorer since the war but have other difficulties their money varies in value from day to dav they cannot calculate w hat your prices will represent in their money by the time you have delivcred your sales to thembut having a true british pluck you are inclined  to venture there are certainly patriotic employers taking risks today which thev would willingly avoid in order that their works may remain open and that employment may be given to those dependent upon it if you succeed in making a good return upon your capital onehalf of vour profits will be taken in income and supertaxes if you lose you will pay the whole loss not one penny wil be returned to you you mav not of course make the venture but if you dont your workmen lose a source of employment ihigh taxation upon productive enterprise is undoubtedly one of the causes of unemploymentlet the working men bear this in mind they are suffering from heavy taxes on tea sugar becr and tobacco they may well wish for these taxes to be reduced but more important still for them is to get rid of at least part of the taxes which directly affect their employment one shilling incometax brings in over £ a year i believe that the £ is mostly taken away from the fund which would otherwise be used in giving employment part of it is now being paid out of capital and part of it would be saved and used as capital if it had not to be paid to the state in taxesexport trade probleinow let me examine some of the other causes of unemployment and tell vou how the government is trying to deal with them even before the war a brisk and flourishing export trade was necessary if au our people were to be employed we cannot live by taking in each others washing we must have food and raw materials from abroad and we have to export something in exchangebefore the war we had at least £ a year more of imports coming to us in pay ment of interest than we have today the capitalyielding that interest has been spent in the war and of course the interest is no longer payable probably another £ at least will have to be paid to america towards our debt to her so that we have not merely to maintain our prewar exports but we have to provide an extra £ if our people are to retain even a prewar standard of comfort these are serious facts and thev call for a policy belief works at home and other expedients for tiding men over hard times are necessary but they must not be mistaken for a policy which will remove or help to remove the causes of our discomfort our policy must be to improve and extend our export trade and steps have been taken by the government with that object a credit scheme for assisting manufacturers and merchants to sell to foreign customers has been put in operation many millions of money have been found in the united lkingdonm to enable the crown colonies to develop their railways and ports and to place orders in this country for their rail locomotives wagons c in my judgment much more must be done in partnership with the dominions and india with the same object our customers within the empire must thus be assisted and their demand for the products of our work people must be encouragedcannes and genoaa governments first duty is to shape its foreign and its financial policies so as to remove all obstacles to the employment of its own people foreign policy must therefore en deavour to rcstore peace confidence and stability to all the nations of europe with these objects in view the primo minister succeeded in arranging a conference of the great powers at cannesand much useful work was done among other things an agreement was arrived at to establish a central internation ion with national corpora tions in the pricipai european countries to remove obstacles to the free play of interna tional tradesince then practical steps have been taklen to bring the corporation into existence meetings of the british and foreign delegates are now being held in londonand i hope the corporation will be one of the means of enabling our former customers to resume relations with us by improving their credit and assisting to stabilize their currencies a conference has also been arranged between most of the european nations which wiu be held shortly at genoa no one country not even powerful britain can guarantee the success of that conference but we have no selrish aims to gain we want peace and a beneficial exchange of trade beneficial alike to our own people who can make the goods as to the peoples of the continent who are suffering from the lack of thembefore i conclude let me say a word on the general political situation just at the moment the government like every other government is being fiercely attacked its enemies profess two quite different policies there are the wee frees under mr asquith or is it under lord greywho say we have not reduced expenditure fast or far enough and there is the socialist labour party which is committed to additional expenditure on un employment reliefunemployment which is likely to be enormously increased if their policy of nationalization of the means of pro duction and distribution is put into practicethe real alternativegovernmenti am quite sure that we need not treat the wee free policy very seriously they protest loudly enough on the platform but in the house of commons they do not show much enthusiasm for cutting down except perhaps the expenditure on the naval and military forces the socialist labour party is differ ent it is the real alternative government at clayton and north camberwell they have won two seats largely on promises for addi tional expenditure electors may vote for the party that makes promises for increased expenditure but a trade revival and future employment depend upon reduced expendi ture and reduced taxation poplar finance may be popular finance for a short time it may appear to give more relief to people  but it can only be given on the poplar scale if more taxation is placed upon those who do work and who are atready overburdened by rates and taxeswhat of the future  if you believe some of the press you would imagine that the govern ment had failed the contrary is the truth no government in europe has succeeded in most difficuli times as has mfr lloyd georges government i or three years it has main tained peace at home at washington peace in the pacific has taken the place of rivalries which might at any time have plunged us again into a life strugglein ireland though nothing is yet certain a treaty lhas been made which while giving within the empire most generous terms of selfgovernment to the south has guaranteed to the north their main aspiration to continue as part of great britain until by their own free will they join in a government of a united irelandabroad great britain stands at the head of the european nations the leader in recon ciliation the promoter of peace and appease ment we are indeedthe only government in europe which has not been changed more than once during these difficult years thisis not an accident you owe it to our prime minister you owe to him who is the most outstanding figure in europe a deep debt of gratitude for the untiring energy which he devotes to the nations needsnow is not the time to divide the nation into classes each for all and all for each is a better motto than eachfor himneif and the devil take the hindmost the whole world issuffering from the economic results of the uar and onlr by cooperation ofall classescan we expect to restore happiness and pros perity to our people
