acknowledge the receipt of your letter of may  and to inform you in reply to your inquiry that his majestys government recognize the soviet government as the de facto government of russia the effect of that letter was discussed by the court of appeal in luther v sagor  the times lr    kbd p  the defendants contended i that the effect of the decree of the soviet government and the recognition of that government by the government of this country was to destroy the legal entity of the russian commercial and industrial bank  that there was no corporationrhich could give the defendants a proper discharge  that the action was really started by mr jones under his power of attorney and that he was assuming to act on behalf of a corporation whose entity had been lawfully determined and  that the effect of the soviet decrees and the recognition of that government by the government of this country was to transfer to the state bank of russia the whole of the assets of the late russian bank of whatever kind and where ever situated or alternatively that such assets had become bona vacantiathe plaintiffs contended  the entity of the company had never been destroyed  that it was not open to the defendants on this suit to allege that it had been destroyed  that the soviet legislation was not intended to have esterritorial effect  that ift so intended these courts would not recognize such effect and  that dealings between the plaintiffs and the defendants created an estoppeltwo ponras pon decisionin his view it became unnecessary to answer each one of the questions for a decision could be reached by considering two points who was the plaintiff and was the plaintiff entitled to sue   were the defendants estopped from setting up a defence as to  the answer to that depended a partly on the effect of the soviet legislation and b partly on the evidence of mr v jones as to a the parties unfortunately could not agree either on the effect of that legislation or even upon the correct translation of the various decrees and declarations upon this question several russian lawyers of great eminence gave evidence he was particularly impressed by that given by dr idelson who was a member of the council of the ministry of finance he appreciated the difficulty of applying any principles of law as we understood it to what had taken place in russia it was not easy to apply the canons derived from the wisdom of the ages to the hasty experi ments of the moment by a decree in  the soviet government purported to nationalize all the banks in russia the enactment which effected these momentous changes appeared simple and if the evidence before him was correct its object was attained with little trouble a witness who was a bank director in petrograd at the end of the year  described the method in which the banks were taken over he stated that one morning he was informed that his bank had been seized by the red guards and that he had better go there re did so and found that the bank had been entered by the red guards there was no business and the staff had gone on strike the bolshevists emissaries looked into the vault of the bank and then sealed it and placed two red guards against the wall the emissaries took possession of all the books and securities and gave no receipt for them subsequentlv the sign boards and the names of the private banks were removed from the bank buildings with regard to the money and securities which customers kept in private safes at the bank the government seized these the soviet government had forgotten to deal with the shares of persons who held shares in banks and by a subsequent decree they confiscated those sharesit was necessary to consider what effect the decrees the declarations and the change of circumstances had on the plaintiffs power of attorney mr joness evidence was of a remarkable character he stated that he was bringing this action on the footing that his branch of the petrograd bank was a branch of the bank incorporated in petrograd and that he was acting on his power of attorney he said that he believed that there were some directors in the south of russia but he could not sav who they were and he did not know who the proprietors of the bank were when he was asked if he had to account to anybody but himself he replied i have an auditor who audits my accounts and i have legal advisers in his his lordships view a power of attorney given to a manager under entirely different circumstances could not remain valid after such profound changes and altera tions as had taken place in the present in stance such a power must be construed as containing an implied condition that it was only valid as long as the same state of affairs existed in russia with regard to the govern ment and the status of the bank as existed at the time when the power was given at the time when it was given it was given accord ing to the russian law it was not as if mrr jones was suing in england on behalf of the bank under his power of attorney in respect of some transaction entered into bv the english branch of the bank of which lie was manager he very much doubted whether that power of attorney was meant to give the plaintiff in england a power to deal with transactions entered into in germany by the head office of the bank in his opinion having regard to the facts which have supervened and having regard to the completechange of circumstances mr joness power of attorney had become exhausted either because the legal entity which created it the old russian company had ceased to exist or because a state of circumstances had super vened which vwas never contemplated at the time the power of attorney was given and in respect of which altered circumstances the power of attorney was never meant to apply he found that mr jones was the real plaintiff in the action and that he was not entitled to maintain it either on his own behalf or under the power of attorney under which he purported to acthe was therefore of opinion that unless the point of estoppel was a good one the plaintiff was not entitled to succeed in this action he did not think that the defendants were estopped from setting up a defence the parties at the time of the negotiations contracted under a mutual mistake of fact at that time they supposed the russian bank to be in existence the power of attorney to be valid and the plaintiff able to give a good discharge whatever might be the position of the bank now it was certainly in a different position from that which it occupied at the time the original contract was made out and the power of attorney given he could not hold that there was any misleading conduct by the detendants both parties were under the impression and contracted under the impression that the present state of facts and afairs in russia were such as to entitle mr jones to give a vaiid receipt for the bonds on behalf of the bank in is opinionthe state oe facts and affairs did not enable him to give such a vaiid receipt and there was no estoppel precluding the defendants from raising such point there must be judgment for the defendantssoicitorsmessrs freshflelds and ieeue nesmr
