nairow like those of a roman and a vwoman was taken up on suspicion bitt afterwards discharged a great number of person howevcr having come to this spot in the mqoming and there being a cuantitv of strawanout no cluc wits cerived ttom these tracks the principal ground of suspicion against the prisoner arose from his having bcen found to pay avay sevcral sums of money after the murder wlthout having had any apparent means ofprocuring it ile paid gs gd fbr a hat s grt to a bootmanker us upon an order of filiatlon s for ale c besides which he was seen in possession of two sovereigns in gold

allowed to sell the bladdersthat he had receivel s for taking a parcel and that his sister had lent him a sovereign to pay the expenses of the order offilistion it appeared however that he could only have received a very few shillings for what beasts he had killed for several months past and his sister although stated by her father to be in the receipt of money for the mainte rance of her illegitimate child eas not called to confirmnthe prisoners stntement on thispoint then with respect to the missing the knire the father stated that after the constable had gone away without findirg it

the magistratc it being very dfirty he had wiped it and ground it on hi sithestone whicl he was very sorry for having done he not being avare what it was wanted for and wwhat was the charge against liis son this assertion of ignorance caupled wvith the fact of the haft of the knife appearing to have been frehly scraped and cut at the shoulder and top pressed strongly against thc prisoner besides his fther his little brotber a fine boy about  years of age was called and they botht swore that the prisoner was at home from  to  oclock on the evening of the murder that he wore laced boots which he unlaced at the fire that he warmed his feet for some tinmc and theta went to bed with his brother they admitted that lie had been out for sonse timc between  and  oelcck and to account for himself during that period ihe prisoner zaid he had gone to the blacksmiths shop to meet a man named dule who swore howevcrm that he had had no appointment with the pisoner the fathers testimony as to the means by whicl his son might have become possessed of money was at variance in some respects with his depositlons before the magistrates and neither his mother nor sister vho were sworn to have been in his company from  to  oaclck on the night in question were called to corroborate his father and brother the prisoner had appointed on the preceding tuesday to go on wtednesday or thursday erening
