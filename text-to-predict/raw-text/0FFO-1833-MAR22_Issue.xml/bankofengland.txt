bran of englanda coturt of proprietors being one of tde quarterly courts lirected by the charter nvas held yesterday after the reading of the minutes of the last court the governor mr horsley paslmer announced a dividend of i per cent as the profits of the bank on the current half year and was proceeding to move in the usual way that such dividend be noxv sanctioned by the court whenalr yomnco begged to put a fewv preliminary ques tions he thouglit that the continuance by the coturt of directors of the system of etirely withholding their accounts fronm publicity was bizhly censurable there could be no ohjection however he conceived to a statement to the proprietors of what he desired to know which wtas the amount of the unredeemed issues of the bank in which he meant to incude the private depositsthe govevnon said that with respect to the depo sits the directors were as on ar former occasions of the kind in the hands of the proprietors in whose power it was to demand publicity there wpas no mystery in their accounts as had been lately shown by the exa minations berore the committee of the house of com mons but he did not deem it necessary unless called upon by a vote of the proprietors to continue such statements the circulation of the banl it had been usual to state to that court and he would therefore inform the hon proprietor that it amounted at present to about tmr young would be content wvitl that declaration and vould assume which he might fairly do the private desits to be w more which together constituted in his opinion a circulation far too great for the wants of the country the deposits ought to be taken as part of the circulation just as much as those rnade with private bankers for they could equally be called into eirculation at any time at the will of the owners he thought this redundancy of circulation the cause of the unnatural depression of the rate of in terest nowv not more than  per cent on good bills and that its tendency was to force the public once more into foreign loans and other speculations by which at no great distance of time another panic might be produceda question by mr young as to the amount of exchequerbills held by the bank vwas refused an an swer by the overnor on the ground tht it was an unusual one and it wvas not pressed but to another whethler the  rest as the surplus of profit is called had increased or diminishedsince the last court the governor stated that it had not undergone any material variationthe govaxriort also stated in answer to a question from mr hammond that the dividend of t per cent then aunounced wvas produced or very nearlv so by the actual profits of the bankmilr blacaulnu addressed the court at somelength compaining of the want of informatiou to guide the proprietors in their assent to the dividend named and he thoiglit also that too much stress wvas always laid on the presumed acquiescence of the court of proprietors to the lithlolding publicity he was proceeding to comment on the system of lecuton of directors and governor of tlhebank as detailed in tleeevidencebefore the committee which he contended was extremely de fective when he wvas called to orderthe queston that the dividend be  per cent was then put ansd carriedmr veanaxo expressed his belief that one effect of the evidencebefore the committee on the bank charter had bcen to raise materially the cstimation in hich the directors previously stood with the public he thought also that twvo points of the higlhest importance to that court as a body had been decided by that committee in the affirmative viz that it was desirable that there should exist in london and its vicinity but one banl of circulation and that tlis trust could be placed no where with greater safety and propriety than with the bank of england they might alsobe leemed to have decided thc question regarding the best mode of conducting baniks of issuethat it wvas indis ponsable to make their notes payable in specie he was of opinion wvith a former speaker mir blackburn that the system of clectioni to the ciourt of the directors was bad he dlid not object to a  house list the effect of which merely was to bring back into office the directors who were out by rotation but lio objected to the practice of filling vacancies by leath or disquea lification by that court he would throwv x pen to the proprietors all suci elections and thus make thent virtually the test of public opinion on the fitness of the individual for so important a tnrst he objected also to the succession to the chair by rotation by which the merest drone among the directors was called upon in turn to fiu it he meant no disrespect they mnust admit that of t men all could not be alike in talent and at all events very inferiormen to those who would be chosen by an lection must occasionally he called upon to preside over that court the chairman he thought should be chosen by the body of dlirectors and if ilew clarter wvere obtained he should advise an alteration inl these respectsmr youo begged to receive any infornmation it mightbein thepowerof the governor to affordrespect ing the progress of the negotiation with the govern ment for a new charter ile trusted that good terms srould be obtained for the corporation and that no coneession would be made wlhich wvas asy material di minution of the privileges already possessed he should consider that the bank must at all events be pernmitted to retain the exclusive privilege within  miles of london of issuing notes and that so long as a national debt existed the management of it must ne cessarily be confided to that corporation he trusted that a special court of proprietors would be calledl as soon as the directors possessed any information of im portance to lay before themthe govenaor stated that no terms whatever had been settled wvith the government and deprecated the pressing any questions at this tinye on the subject to another question from mr young he informed the court that the petition drawnv up last year by wlhichl a continuation of the exclusive privileges of the bank were solicited liad not been presenteda pnormnrton commeiited on the danger that might ensue to the corporation from the governors going out of office at this tine and submitted a proposition that it uvas expedient amr palmer should remain in office another year or for the time necessary to coniplete the arranmgements for the new chartermir weedingc and mr yorc spoke in support of this propositionthc govrnxon felt extremely proud and gratified by the approbation of that court but eic tristed that the proposition would not be pressed he had ahleady continued in office at a great personal sacrifice a year beyonld the usual time it wvas understood that his retiremeint was to have taken place fin october but owing to eircumstances connected with the retiremenl of the then deputy governor lie had remained till the preseit time he had much doubt whether the ques tion of the charter wvould be very soon disposed of lortl althorp had stated that he should bring the question forward shortly after easter bttt when lie sawv the number of important notices on the ordcrbook of the ilouse of commons extenidinginto june lie coultl harly hope that this intimation wvould be carried into effect to him there would result very great inconve nience from remaining in office thie labours of whlich had prevented his bestowving the proper attention on his business as a muerchant he could truly say that it was no sinecure lis place would be supplied by a most able successor mr raikes and lie was sure that the interests of that court wvoudd suffer no injury by his retirementafter some further discussion of no peculiar interest the court adjournie
