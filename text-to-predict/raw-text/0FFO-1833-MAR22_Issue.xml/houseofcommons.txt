repeal cf the bop tax vwould follow as a matter of course and lie had no doubt he should make out such a case as would induce the parlia rnent to repeal enticlv that most odious tax on the agricul tural portion of the country the earliest rctiod in wlhich a tax was levied cn malt was during the reign of wil liam ill since irhiet time the ta had gone on pro gressiely increasing until the nemorable period of theh vara ar w aged against the liberties of lrance wthen tbis tax on the beverage of eghi shimen wvas raised all at once to thz enormous sum of da abushel or  nquartcr this tax wvas undoubtedly a grievance in itself but besides taiking so much money out of the pockets of the people there was another evil connected with it and that was the neccs sity which it imposel upon the government of keeping up a whole army ofescisemen to collect the duty in the county of sorfolk the presentpricc of barley was very low it was vorth little more than t n quarter if it w as nvorth so much and before it could beniade into sralt and brewed into good beer it cost upwards of  the county which lie had the honour to represent was a grcat barley countyno less thanjo quarters being raised annually in it but the malting of the barlev was so expensive in consequenice of die ta as to nialke the price of the prodlice of an acre twice as high as the actual rent paid for the acre this tax w as ruitlous to the agriculturists and he trusted that thc govemnment would consent to a revision the duty was also injurious in a moral point of vicw ani hiebelieved that nothing nwas so calculatcd to brutalize the peorle as this funmnely every rarmer brewred wholesome beer inl hlis hemse and gave it to the servants whom hekept about him but tle expenscs of lrewing were now so great tltat thle

baronet had brought it forward hc felt it to be his duty to support it knowing as hc did how grievously taxation pressed on the lower classes of that house mluch laugh ier he wasconvinced that unless thc hsuse dccmiiicd to repeal some tax of this kind which produced a large revenue to thc governmcnt and thus compellcd thc govemetnt to find somnc ieans of reducing its esstabishment to a level with its income thc session would pass away without the slightest reliet from their prcsent burdens being affarded to the people the existing cstablishments of the country were frasmed upon too large and too liberal a scale and in endeavouring to reduce them within rcasonable lirmits he was prosing himselfa true friend to tlec monarchy and to its legitimate tnterests it had now become visible to every reflccting man that the taxes pressed unfairly and unequally upon the lower ltsscs and that a spirit was rising in conec quence among them destructive to every species of property it wvas thercfore necessary that the house should proceed wiihout delay to counteract that spirit by taking oif sucl taxes as aficeted them most severlyv and if tbere was ore tax whichi aifccted them more cruedy than another it was this very tax on malt which the hon baronet was so ionoantrably anxious to repe a if he had had the hlightest idea that this motion woulb have come under discussion this evenihg he woild have brought down annd read to the house some ottthe letters which he had received from influential persons in the country describing the nanner in which the heayy duty on malt operated in riving the farmers labourers to the toam and jerry shops by preventing them from brewing for them selves and in which it pressed severely upon those parts of the country where the land would only grow barley and oats he had received  suchi letters and their contents were well worthy of the consideration of the house he again repeated that in his opinion it would have been mucl better had the lion baronet deferred this mnotion until the budget had been opened by the noble lord opposite but as the hon ba ronet had not done so he was bound bv a sense of duty to his constituents to give to the motion every suppor in his powerlord althorp said that the point on which the hon and gallant officer had just touched in the conclusion of liis speech w as the point whlich he would press upon the hon ba ronet as the remzon ebr not accedig to his prcsent motion thle hon and gallant officer had declared that in his opiniorthwis motion ought not to have been brought forwsard unti after the budget

in a short timec he should have an opportunity of stating the view which he took of the finances of the country the sum total of the estimates of the year and the amount of reve nue wvhich it was probable would be received it wrould be best to defer till that time the consideration of the taxs which it would be most expedient to take oflilie hoped that the lion baronet would not think him guilty of any dis courtsys w hich lie could assure the hoti baronet lhe had no itltention of displaying towrards fim if hc said that the prec sent was not a fit momecnt to moot the repeal of the

immediate decision upon it by withdrawring shis motion nowr the hon baronet wvould have an opportnnity of bringing it forward on another oc casion before the general statement of the finances of the

into the causes of thc general distress existing among the indus trious classes but he thought that much nod miglht be de rived from thle discussion which must tale place upon the motion there was a general idea prevailing throughout the country that that distress arose ftoin the present state of the currency and the discussion vwas likely to generate sounder notions upon tbat point than those which existed at present in speaking of the repeal of thenimnltulxa tax which in  had produced a revenue of it was impossible not to see that the house cold not dlispose of so large a sum with out looking to the whole financinl condition of the country anxious as gentlemen might be to gratify the wishes of their constittents they must not lool nt the malttax simply by itself but must view it in its bearing on the gencral revenue of the country they might as rell lool at the assessed taxes by themselves as at the malttax by itself and he knew that there were some gentlemen wvho did take that
