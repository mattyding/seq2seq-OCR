london vedybsday february a mr gtadsvoi waited yesterday afternoon upon reri massty at windsor and tendered the resig nation of himself and his colleatgues whichas graciously accepted by the qvsmev the great but inevitable step hia thus been taken with eut delay and without precipitation the memberge the late ministry saw the neceasity ofgiving place to an admiiiistrtion which should be in harmony with the najority of the new eiouse of commous and they have retired with a promptitude which belits their own dignity atd must conduce to the public convenience a conservative government will at once be formed and though the necessity of procuringthereelection of such of itschief members au sit in the house of commnons will occupy someten daysor more afterthe meetingof part iiaiuent thler

competitors for place far outnum bering the places to be flled and mr disrirlt will assuredly feel the same difficulty these are pains all makersof cabinets have to undergo it may be remembered that when mir gzadsrozx completed his administration in the winter of gs one member of the governmuent carried hiagriefs to his constituents naively confessing to them that he thought he had deserved to be talen into the sacred inner eircle of fifteen from which with feelings of pain but of resignation hie found him self excluded we do mot know wrhether any subordinate official of the new government will be thus open and ingenuous in the face of the public but we may with safety conclude that many will share thie sentiment though they may hesitnto to express itmr qladstous zetirefron tlho helnm
