in relation to the vexed question of asphalte wooden or granite payement which moro than ever is engrossing publicattention in the city as elsowhere tho motion was founded upon an claborate report of mr ihaywood the an gineer to the commnission on the subject the preearation of which together with tho preliminary inquiries la rels tion to the matter is said to havo cost the uotporiatiou far towards  ldealing eryst with tho question a to the essuntial rcqniromontsof a good street pavement in a city like london ho argaed that it was uost essential frst that there should bo comparative uietude anti next durability and ecouomy i said uplothe whiole there really wmtr not much difference as to the first cost between gianite and asphalte pavement passin to the consideration as to which pavement was mocteastilr repaired he contrastt the whole granite with theasphalte in that respect renuarking on the ease with which a sink ing in the asphalto was repaired by cutting the sinlkincean out and restoring it over night the sarmo remark applied he said to the lating down of water pipes in a street paved twith asphalte adding that it was most imnpor tant that a street pavenient of whatever matetial com posed shbould he eadily and euetusily repaired as to the wced pavement he said they had hardly yet had auy experince especially as to the comuarative ease of roiit but it wa said the slocks o dood had a ten dtencyto become round upon the question of noise he said there wtras a certain amount of ctatter in asphaltedwhich w did not give on tho ether hand asuhalte wasy far the cleanest pavement if properlb at tended to iut he was averse from gravel or sand being put upodn t or indeed anything except water orn the question of cost he cited tho engineer to the ommission to show that asphialte pavement was a trifle more expeosive than grauite whilean that of safety tho inquiries lnd experience of the efgineer were enormously in favour of wood mr knight concluded by moving that in tho opinion of the commissmisa the report of the engiueer upon thes various pavements indicated that under proper conditions tsphalte granite and wooud mhght continue to be laid as

perss saccustomed to drive in the public streets of the clty zir fricker said there could be no doubt that for horse trafic gasphalto was most inconvenient and lanerous and he thouglt the tinme had arrived for ridiing the citizens of o abomninablo a nuisance t twas a common thing to see four or hve horses dowvn on the aspllite during an ordinarv walk in the city the general opiniion of persons accustomed tu drivo was that aspshalte wtas cruel to hurses ie moved an amend ment to the effect that owing to tho numerous accidents to horses travelulng on asphalttanti thecoise equent stoppage of the traflic it was undesirable to use asphatlte in future for pavemeilt within the limits of the city the subject tnulerwent soene further discussiou in the course of which mr coils referred in
