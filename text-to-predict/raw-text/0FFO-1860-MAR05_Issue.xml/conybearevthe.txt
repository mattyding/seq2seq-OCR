that he had been a director and a member of the finance commilttee from the time of the establishment of the com pany it was the duty of that committee to examine the accounts laid before it by the secretary he believed he knew well the state of the finances of the company did not recollect that the company in  was embarrassed for want of funde on the th of july in that year the com pany was oblged to defer a payment due to the skdton bar iron company til march s and hewas present at a board meeting when it was resolved to obtain such delay the claim was ultimately postponed from march to september  and bills were given for l and  in  ead  bills for over  were drawn in the colony payable at  and  days for work done and ma terials supplied in the execution of the works in the colonysuch bills might have been renewed from time to time in i july  tho company had occasion to adjust a debt due to the st stephens bank which had been running from december  and a bill was drawn for l at five months the idea of issuing debentures was first spoken of at the board in september  applcation was made to the bank of london to lend the company money on its de bentures but they refused unless the personal security of the directors was added after that the companys account was removed to glyn and co but not on account of such refusal glyn and co lent money on future calls on the th of november  the directors ordered the colonal manager to persuade the creditors in the colony to accept debentures in payment of their clalms the directors were embarcssed for money at that tiine it was witness sup pcred a want of money that led the directors to offer de bentures in november  the statement in the report of july that every claim was liquidated every aix weeks was in witness opinion consisteat with the fact of giving bills at  and  days for work done in the colony as a member of a finano committee ha said such a transaction was a closlng of a debt and that a capital account might be said to be closed when bills for the balanha of it were loutstading at lebst witness thought so as to the land of the company mr bullar its counse advised that they had no power to sell or mortgage it nor to deal with the timber on it witness however thought otherwise coald not say how early that opinion wavon bat would not dena that it was as eary as  witness recollected that when the divesting clause in the act of th victoria cap  was first pointed out to mr oony bease the plainmin reexaminatlon by mr mais this witness deposod that it was a common practice rith naiy compaies to borrow money from their bankers that the difficulties of this company wrer very greatly increased by the conduct of theplaintiffinwrlting letters to the newspapers and makiug speeches on the a rs of the company that the company had not only granted  lumbering licenses ever theirland but that they had sold to the government portions of timber growing on itto questions from lord justice kniowr bruce the witness said that when a railway company sells forfeited shares such as these were a prudent person mlghtznaturally hestate and might consider thsat the company was not prosperous to lord justice turnsxsrs questlons hesaid thst thembarrassments of the company on the th oi august i  were solely caused by the agents of the company abroad pressing forward the works beyond what they were authorized to do and that but for such conduct on the part of the agents there would not have been any such embarrass mentthe argumnen for the plaintiff wa in substance thisthat representation were mado by the directors on essential matters connected with the company which representations were untrae and were known to the directors to be untrue or at any rate were such as they could not be heard to say they did nof know to be so tbat the allimportant date wrs the th of aun  the dsy of the first visit of mr conybeare tu the office of the company on which day the reports of deoember  and of

could obtainit at the colonial office and the plaintiffin his afdavit in which he swore that he never saw the latter act util the th of january  that the only question was whether the directors or the company were responsible there being no dispute that the misrepresnttions had been made that in their answer the dtrcotors say that by the report of  they intended to convey to the readers that they held their land by a titlo quite indefeasible and the plaintiff in his affidavit equally positively says he did rely upon the truth of that report and so understood it and paid up his calls inadvancein the full faith that he was making a good lnvestment of money  that with respect to the statements in the reports as to the financial conditlonof the company they wereas

 took place before and up to the allimportant date of the th of august  the day of mrconybeares first visit to the office of thecompany they also read the foulowing passage from the report of the th of july  in which the directors swy the further experience oi the directors leaves them noeason to doubt their belg able to finish the line within the capital and time assigned for its constraction and showed by re ports made to the directors by p r baxter ander chilton that in september and october wrhen mfr conybeae paid off his portions of purohasmoney their report for comply  remained o nwithdrawn although the directors know that they owed thelr bankers no less a sum than and had heard from their colonial manager such news as cnst have convinced them that the line could not be com peted in  a doable palpable deception added to wlich was evidence afforded fromst eir o books that to complete the line no lees than a must be borrowed ona debed trohor the company and the directors it was said tht hga it not been for the injcdecnots and vexatioas conduct of i ra conyboare himsolf al the expecuations of the directors wolid have been reatlcd the case made by the plaintiff himself was sufficient to showy that from first to last lhe had beena fully informed of all that the company could tell him befiore he made any application he says be consulted width his stockbroker and so favourable was that gentlemsans opiion of the concern that th plaintiff invesgated it and came to the conclusion that the purchase of shares would be a profitable investment on the th of angst  he had an interview with the secretary who kes othin back ps he had sworn but gave plintif the two reportb whlch documents at this date contained no mlsrepresentation whatever the plaintiff a bra rister and a man of business conversant withrailway matters knew or was bound to know what were the pro visions of the jointstock companes act when a company is eastablsnede on the principle of limited liablity and although the first visit to the office of tho company took plsce as early as the th of august he msde no payment until the th of seuiember in respect to the shares during this period he had lad ample time to ascartain the nature of the company and not having dons so e filed a bil say ing that fraudulent misrepresentations had been made eo him and important documents concealed the truth bein
