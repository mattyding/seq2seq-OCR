given him no answer before the meeting called at the request of cnlen was held ctilens meeting took place first i am sure it was not held on a saturday bscausewe are then very busy they were all the same men who attended both meetings i cannot be certain that cullens meeting was held first but i think it was dodd called nwon us almost every day he is a guard to the train and he came accord ing as the trains arrived my husband sid he would rather vote for russell and osborne but he could not afford not to have his expenses paid he alvys had s for his ex penses from cach member for going from folkestone to dover if there t a split vote s is always allowed what ever party yen vtot or laughter the reason my hus band did not vote for oaborne and bussell was that mr cauen afterwards said that mr rothschild would have nothine to do with it i came up to london with my hus band  have seen mr gilbert sincs i came up here my husband pointed him out i had heard mr pnttee mention his name at
