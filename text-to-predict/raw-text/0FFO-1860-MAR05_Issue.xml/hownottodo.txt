hownottodo it a brief isatementof the ci cumstances underwhichthenewartilleryhasbeendespatched to chinaor rather to the reld sea for the armstrong guns have not reached the indian ocean yetwill justify in somes measure the suspicions of those who beleve that allis not right yet at the waroffice and the other departments charged with the administratlon of the forces of great britain and that a very successful attempt would be mado to rival the confusion and chaos of the arrangements at the outset of the crimean war if we were again plunged into a contest with any european power whether that be so or not here is the story it was desirable to send the arm strong batteries as soon as possible to the east arrange ments accordingly were made by which the hinalaya was rendered disposable for the conveyance of the foroo to alexandria where other arrangements were cunningly de vised for theirconveyance by railway to cairo andthence to suez fearful of the consequences of too great rapidlty of transit however on the guns or on the troops the autho rities lighted upon the notable expedient of neutrlizing the speed of the himalaya during the western portion of the route by employing the famous old steam barge of her ma jestys indian navy the berenice built at glasgow fns of  tons burden and  horsepower which has been known to go eight knots under favourable circumstanoes to go roundfto suez to take the artilery on board by letters received from cairo dated the th of febrcary it appearthat one battery ra saued in that remarkble craft from suez on the previous day thus it wold appear that part of the artillery force has been very nearly three weeks in egypt and the rest is still there anl if our aly the emperor of the french were not the most magnanimous of men ho certainly might have asked for explanations of the delay perhaps he views wzith pity the weakness of our system which struggles with the carriae of a few guns as if it worn engaged in marching a grand army into ltaly bat that is not all the berenlcs which was to have carried the th dragoons from bombay to suez had never apparently tho least intention of doing anythin of the kind rnd had no notion of doing duty as a troopship on being inspected it was found she had no cookingcoppers for the mens food no tabs no plates dishes or buckets no bedding for the sick and the artiblery officers were actually obliged to fit her out with these articles as weu as they could and to fur nlsh her even with qnartergallerles at suez the officer in command had received no instractions to provide anything of the sort and as he knew the playful coyness which the authorities evince in regard to any advances made by officers on their own responsibility he wisely declined to incur the riskl but the ship is at sea at last and we wish her and her cargo a pleasant andif it were not mockery we would eaya speedy voyage her majestys th ight dragoons were at the latest accounts not waiting at suer where they were expected to beon the contrary theywere at bombay and it was sead that tenders had jstbecri issued for their transport round the cape meanwhile milwards

potts field and lieutenant foxrnxoval of tehe indiaoflceia answer to a question from colonel sykes in the hlouse of com mons as to whether government would takp into con sideratton the purchase of the victoria hotel for the fature indiaoffice sir charles wood is reported to have answeredt that he did not consider a noisy street the most convenient site for a public office we infer from this answer that government has no intention of yurchasing the victoriafotel which we are very glad to hear for several reasons not the least important of which is that in order to render it available for the uses of the future indiaoffice it would be necessary to reconstruct a vast number of the rooms which being designed merely for small dormitorles in ar enormous hotel are at present wholly unfit for official purposes nor is the accommodation in other respects sach as the convenience of the public service im peratively demands if it be true howeverr that the government do not contemplate the ultimate locationl of the indiaoffice in this quarter it is unnecessary to urge objections against it but we confess we are at a loss to re conoile sir charles woods reply to colonel sykes with the fast which has reached us that an offer has been made by government within the last three days for the purchwe oil the hotel with a view to its being appropriated permanently to the busness of the india department we have reasom to believe that this offer amounts very nearly to the sure asked by the directors of the hotel and that it is expectec there will he no difficulty in finally settling the terms we refrain from entering into further particulars until a little more official light shau have been thrown upon the trans action and in the meanwbile we wait with some curiosity to learn how
