cavmayit com  tssiongwe are glad to be able to saythat the tew order reducing the prices of cavalry commissions appears to be promptly appreciated by thoso forwhoso benetit it wars devised the horse guards is no longer without applications for the purchase of cornetoles and not a few ensigns from the infantry are desirous of being trasferred to the cavalry now that promotion in that branch of the service may be expected withcut the outlay of urge sum annd that as we hopo a check wil be put upon the extravagant stle of living which has been unquestion ably one of the principal causes of denuding the servyce of subalterns the letter in which mr sidney herbert advocated tho change is ful of sound sense and thorough knowledge of the real position in which the cavalry servico has bcen placed of late years ho is reduced to the alternativeof abandoning the preliminary examination and the hard work and disagreeable service which are said to be the reasons way rich men of the old class of cavalry offices have not comeforwvard of wteyears or of introducing a new state of things and a new class of officers as regards the means and expenditure the secretary for war says  if we cannot get the men of large means and expensive habits let us lower the money demands as far as possible and obtain the same kind of young officers that we find offering in large numbers for the infantry regiments who wl not object to pass the examnaion perform the heavy dty end go on indian service we hope sincerely that the officer uomino into the cavalry under these newregulations and o the fa th oe an implied enwgement that useless ea renditure is to be discouraged will find themselves able to sustain their position enmederate incomes considering the diference between the two rates of pay they ought to he able to do so for a prudent young mn there is after all a not unimpportant difierence in thel ayear of the ensign and the ligz of the comnet  and we hoce that the offcers at p resent in the cavalry will have the good sense to acquiescethe new state of things and not to seek to maintain a regi mental tone inconslstent with the means of the only class of young men who can now be induced to officer the cavalry corps to fulfil ones social duties and be esteemed as a person of gentiemanlike habits does not necessarily cause a large per aoonal expenlditure a nd in branches of the service officered by more aristocratic families than the cavalry there are several young officers keeping up their position suffi cently well on incomes of exceedingly mooest proportions the influence of the offlcial change of prices upon those actually paid for future promotion will oï¿½ course to a goreat extent involve the success or faiunre of the new scheme we are inclined to anticipate that this influence will be very conslderable and that the usual prices wai be very lttle more than those unsually paid in a good style of ln fantry regiment a cavalry captain retiring under tho old rules

obtained at cavalry price as only worth  and mako the holder pay  more for his troop yon oblige him to pay  which must be made up to him on retiing by the govern ment and you compel him to give more than the market value for a commission during the last tbreo or four sears many youlg gentlemen of moderte means have teen induced to go into the cavalry and their interests are not so unworthy of the attention of the authorities but that one may anutcipate some fair consideration of the rlaims they possess tote allowed to purchase their promo tion by paying the difference between tho cavalry price of thelr present and thoe infantry prico of their new commis sions in another reosect the chsnge of price affords room for a stll further reform of great importance which we have more thma once advocated in these columnsnamely that purchase should cease with the rank of captain it so happens that in dragoon regiments a captains com mnission purchased at tho oldterics is in round num bers worth a majors under o new and a majors ob tained under the old system is equal to that of a lieu tenantcolonel under the new i therefore when a lieutenantcolouel of cavalry retires he major and the cap tain in succession were promoted without purchase leaving the troop and the subaltern steps to go by purchase a good foundation would be made for the intduction of the system of seiecting field officers and the principle whlch we have contended for in our preceding remarks would be sus tained lr sidney herbert is in favour of selection and we adopt his viewvs so far as we bellestheir
