some time before the frnch public and it is evident thatthe one and the other wl come into actual operation without any very material change a businesslike opllons innoew thereforebelngformedin aea of the real result of the recent changes sad we have been at some pains to asoertaln by personal inquiry what that opnon is ikely tobe our readers wmll remember that we are only givlng an account of the views oef rench persons thorougmy competent to form a corzrct judgment and that we are not now expresing any judgment of our own upon the subjectlu tho first place the french manufacturers do not seem to be much afraid asthey at first wereof a compotition with ourown itistruethtalltprohibitions of english manu factured goods are abllshedbut a very high protective duty is for tho present to be mintainet tht protective duty as seb down at  per cent ad raloremc by way of mazimum but it will practically be often higher the raw materil of many kinds of manufactures is not higher in fraca than in egad france can buy cotton at now orleans aswell as wa can in such cases our advantage will be solely in manufacturing power  and if the price of the raw material were half the value of the article a nominal differential duty of  per cent ad valornu wonld bereally a diffierential duty of  per cent on the manufacturing power of the two countrles this fact is of the gresteet importance because the excellence of england is lixely to be in the rougher ancd ceaper kdnds of goods in the price of whlch the cost of the raw material must always be a main element tatdnghis consideration into

aonsvtitue the bst judges eedm to think an exception to this rule the rawv mhral of these is cheaper in england than in frnce wle have fgr more experience than the french have in manufactuming many kinds of them and our superiority in many arpiales isindisptable the better opinion therefore sms to be that a modereso french demand for these may be expectod notwithstanding the high protection for the eriench man fachturer that is still reahnedwe shoud have anticpated that the trade in english mahinery would have beenvaffectd bytsimier causoe eves to a gtreater extent and that a considerably augmented demand for it would have sprung up in consetn uente of the recent changes we have therefore been surprised to hear very competent juldges deny tha such would be the result they thtink that french workrshops will turn ourt as good machines as any which will be sent from england we will net ay that e dissent from this idea especalmly as ie are at present anxious rather to give an account of the opiuions of french persens than to state our on but we onv we shall be surprised if our long experience in machinemaking our cheap iron and good steel are not found to tell very materlally in our favour machine making is a very various trade the seumber of machines which modem industry requires is almost ifinite and in consequence it seems reasonable to expert that the variedonperen oengland which has made herone machines and trained herown engineers and skilled workmen to the eccupation during very many years would give her a great advantage still good french judges say that it wil not and they may he richtas to iron itself in an unmanufactured state the oplinon of the best informed persons we think is that the removal of protection will ultmsately have a considerable effect but that at the present moment it will not ihave much effect iron in france is at the present momemb unusually cheap the constructlon of railways increased the demand for and ratised the price of iran in  and  to an unusual height tne usual consequences followed the supply was much stimulated and the tomporaxy demand for the con stractlon of raluwayshas accordingly diminished thelargest trunk lines of the country have beemtimade and the miltary projects of the emperor have diverted the national expendy tureintolessusefulchannels inconsequence the price ofiron is now below its usual average and athe cost of englush iron wiu not for the moment be compared with the ordinary value of freneh iron but with a value accidentally reduced when however these temporary circumstances have passed away the effect of the eaducmtion of the duty upon english ifon wi doubtless be seen the amount of that reduction it wil be rememberedis very considerable previous to the treaty the dutly was roughly speaking  a ton it is now to be roduced to about  is a ton till the ist of october i and then to  s so great a diminution wil ulti mately it is thought have considerable effect though casual circumstances may postpone the time at which it wil be come apparentas to coal it is believed that the extent of country whieh will be supplied from england will be increased consider ably at present a great deal ofecl ci imported into fraucesome from germany some from belgium and some from england the treaty reduces the duty on english coal by onehalf and the increase of consumption in consequence will be no aonbt important the opinion of the best judges seems to be that the whole of the north of france to a considerable distance from the coast will be entirely sapphed from england but they do not imagine that it will penetrate into the interior or bh imported to te blediterra nean coasts much of these opinions must however neces sarily rest on a conjectural foundation we imow how various are the rates which englsh railway companies charga for the conveyance of coal and that the cost of conveyance n so bulky an artcle is a pricipal element in its market p rice french companies will have the same interest as thenghsh in favouring the coal which their railways will bring to market and will probably vary their charecs accordingly the government also may intebrfere in eh matter and say what the rates shall be this single cir cumstance would ofitself make it rash to give any cousin sive opinion as to the amountb of english coal that will be aold in france the opinion whieh seems generally received is that which we have stated but we must not bllnd our selves to the uncertainty of tie only data upon which it can have boen formedsuch seems to be the french opinion as to the effect of the treaty upon the imports from england into france with respect to french exports to englandtheir anticipations as is natural are more sangulne jhe veryletter of the treaty showe that such would be the most probable result those of its provisions which relate to the importation of english manufactures into france only sustitute high protee tive duties for prohibltions  those which relate to french imports into englandeithcrabolishall dutlesorimposeonly a low revenue duty upon them it is evldent that tho effect of the latter mnst in alu probability be greater than that of the former and suchis the french expeatatlon msnygood judges bellevethat they will obeable to export in timo many of their wines into england even supposing that the eng lish taste would only approve strong wines they say thatthywil be able to supgly a conslderable quantity wehib will be suitable to us fihe soaith of france produces rery many which are strong enough for any one and it is stated that the quantity of these brought to market may within a moderate interval be largely increased and it is hinted that it is easily possible to increase the alcohollo strength of wines by means of a little brandy strong wines therefore they believo they can supply us with and they hope not unreasonably that some of their weak and cheap wines wi also be consumed during the englsh summer to a very con siderable extent the removal of protection from silks gloves c will it is thought have considerable effect though we cannot give any definite account of the extent to which it is expected to gothe french dealers seem hlkewise to anticipate a great in crease of trade in tihe miscellaneous articles of luxury which they mnufacture so neatly and in which their tasis so fine and we apprehend there is little doubt that their con clusion is correct we should not like very conlidently to predict what the result of any changes in trade so consider able as those made by the treaty and the budget would be the course of oommercedependson circumstances sovarlowe that what seem to be the most natural anticlpations may prove to he wholly erroneous but if we were to venture on a definite prediction we should say that the importa tion of small miscellaneous end indescribable articles of luxury from france into england would bathe result which vwill most astonish us hereafter experlenoe teaches us that e miscellaneous trade of this kind is very easily extended becaulse it ministerstothe small wants of an inainite variety of persons in easy ciroumatances who are
