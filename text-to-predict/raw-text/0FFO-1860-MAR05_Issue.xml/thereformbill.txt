desirable ness of increasing tho number of the parliamentary repre senttives for lsancshire and he hoped his lordship would not consider them importunate if they sald that they thought notwithstanding all the merits of the reform bill introduced on thursday that the government had not given the people of lancshire that to which they were fairly entitled with profound regpect for his lordships long constitutional s ervices theformes of lan ire did feel to some extent disappointed with the arrangements which bad been made prior to the pssing of the great bform bill lancashire returned  members thebill of  dlsfranchised znewtoninthe willows and took one member from clitheroe thus re ducing the number from  to l so far as disfranchisment went that clearly showed that there was no great amnount of rottenness in lncashlre at thaf period the bill sub equently created four new boroughsmanchester oldham blackburn and boton with two members each and five aishtenunderlyne roohdale bury salford and war rington with cne member each makng  in all and with two dditlonal members forthe county increasing the total number of members for lancashire from  to  the bill of  was based upon the

censns of  though before the bill passed it was quite true that his enemies obtained the returns for  with a view of estabushing the right of the old small boroughs to be continued noer in  the population of lancashire was only  in  according to the approxima tion of the census obtsined by the government it was  showlng that the increase had been  or  per ent the general increase of the country within the same period excluding ilacashire had only been  per cent and a population which in g was conslderably below that of yorkshire and middlesex was now aboveeach of them and was consequently the premier conmty in point of population indeed the icrease of population had been so remarkable that it had been more than the entire popula tion of seven counties which at present sent  members to parliament and the entire populatlon was more than the actual population of  oounties returning  members to parliament it was naturil to expect that this increase of population had been accompanied by a great increase of wealth and onreference to retmns he found it had been per cent while the general ncremse in the coountry exclud ing lancashire hd beeu at the rate of  per cent in point of fact lancashire possessed oneeighth of the entire population o england and wales and paid oneeighth of the propertytax of the kingdom and upon the same basis snrely it ought to return oneelghth of the  members in england and wales he confessed that he had read his lordships statement on thursday with great disappoint ment because he believed the result would be that so far as lancashire was concerned in the distriu tion of seats the inequalities in the representation would really bo greater after the new suffrge was introduced than they were now about  per cent of the increase which cbe billgavo in the lnumber oe voters would be in lane shire but yet they only received members amounting to  per cent and consequently the disproportion between the population voters and memberswould be more apparent after the next election than they even were before the four onnties of bnclcs wilts dorset arnd hereford with atotal population of  returned  members to parlia ment the present bili proposed to cut them down to  and to increase the  lancashire members to  but the in cremse of the population of lancashire since  had been more than  and consequently much greater than the entire population of the cosnties in qucestion north essex with a county popnlation of  would receive one additional cosnty member and would lose one of its four borough members west cornwall with a county population of  would continue its six borough members and would have an increase of one in the county west norfolk with a county population of  and a borough population of  won d lose one of its four borough members but receive him back again in the county north yorkshlre with a county population of   and a borough population of  would also lose a borough member and gain one in the county and south devon with a county population of  and a borough population of   would lose two of its  borough members and receive only one in the county making a real loss of one it was generally supposed that lancashire had no county population but the doonty popu lation excluding the boroug was h the county population of these five counties was  or only a few thonsands more and yet they were to have  members while lancashire was only to have slx if the borough members were taken the discrepancy wasstii greater the population of all the boroughs in these five counties was only  at present returning  members but hereafter only to return  it lancashire returned members in proportion she would be entitled to  for the county and  instead of  he begged to apolo gize to his lordship if he had expressed himself warmly but he knew there was a feeling abroad that the cotton districts could not select proper men to represent tbem without attempting to argue whether a cotton spinner ever made acod politician ho wished to deny that the people of lanca shirebad uniformly selected as their representatives gentle men engaged in the trade of the district he believed that with one exception this was the only time that two persons engaged in trade had ever represented manchester his lordships colleague hir baulet thompson represented it for some timemr hafd  mpand his lordship himself was once offered a seat for the countymr wxlson continuedenowing his lordships desire to improve the condition of the people and that he was one of the greatest reformers of his age they desired to have him as their representative in the county and he himself should have been glad to have supported him again mr milner gibson in whom they had great confidence had represented then mr gibson was a london man m every sense of the word he re malned with there for some years and would have re mained now but for the course which the right hon gentle man and his lordship took upon the china question laughter old mr cobbett sat for oldham for many years and it was now represented by his son and mr fox neither of whom had any eosuexion with the cotton trade of the county mr frederick peel sat for bury mr grenfell for preston the marquis of hartington and colonel pat ten for north lancashire and two gentlemen counected with the landed interest for south lancashire these facts showed conclusively that the people of lancashire had never been desirous of electing those who were connected with the special tradeof the distrlctunless theyhad other recommen dations which rendered them acceptable to the people he was educated by his father with instructions that he was to look to the noble lord as the greatest lving constitntional authority and he wished to be permitted to retain that opinion he did not attend there to ask the government to give them equal electoral districts nor to ssy tht there should not be boroughs large and small or that the old geographical landmarks which the constitution had set up should be altered but inasmuch as the people of lancashire had made their trade by open competition with the trade of the worldas they were not exempt from the imposition of taxes nor deficient in loyalty they asked the government to revise their bill and give to lancashire that which after due consideration the facts of the case would show that they were entitled tomr j heywdood thought the government might with out inconvenience divide south lancashire into two di visions and he believed there would not be any great op position if they disfranchised clitheroe altogethermr baztey alp hoped that salford would bave an additional member it had a population of  and was quite as imporant as theborough of leods to which the bill gave an additional memberthe clalms of st helens ijiverston darwen and chorley to representation were aso urged and in replylord j russbllt saidi think the best course  an pursue is not to enter into a discussion upon any of the statements which have been made to me at poresent i can only say that the government very carefuy con sidered the measure before they brought it forward both as regards what they ought to propo andwhattey were lkely to carry of course every oneof the questions which have just been raised is calculated to lead to many coniderations our object is to extend tho right of voting as far as possble to a large class of persons and to do something though cer tainly not much in the way of adding to the representation of populons districts in doing that we were bound to consder not only what is best to be done if property and population are taken rls te general basis butalso what can be done in the present state of affairs i can i only say that all the statemen s which have been rade to me shall be duly considered but i cannot hold out any hopesthat we should be likely to carry abill that went much fur  ther than the present bilmr wilsow thanked the noble lord for the audience he had
