foreign rwelligenobfrancefrom our own correspondentw a portilon of the fohowlu appered in or second edi icon of saturday paris friday march   plthe impression of imperfect satisfaction not to say positive dissatisfaction which i noticed yeater day as produced by the emperors speech seems confirmed today i regret to say it but the trath is i knoow few who are really pleased with it people differ in their manner of interpreting certain asasages but they agree in pronouncing the whole disconnectedvagme and hardly masking illhmnour i have however to make an exceptionthe emperor is not the only personage who inan gurates the meeting of the cnaber with an address what ris majesty does in the hall of the louvre wl de morny repeats in the salon of the legislative palacethe following is the speech delivered today by the president of the corps legislatifgentlementhe emperors speech ought to resure you on the subject which interests you mostpeacethe greatest element of prosperity at present that with which a country whose industry and commerce are developed by credit cannot dispense is confidence let us hope that the sincere intentions of the emperor erpreesed both mt home and abroad as they deserve to be will defi nitively restore it and if i were permitted to refer to an additmonal motive for confidence i could find it in the very character of the emperor i might sayin reminding you of a pasage in his speech of yesterday whicn you warmly applaudedthat he will never cease to have the real interests of france before his eyes  he will not suffer himself to be led away and the attacks of hs enemies leave him as tranquil as the ardour of his allies your session opens this time under pacific ausploes i hava not as i had lsst year to make an appeal to the ex altation of your patriotism nor to ask you to support the imperial polcy i addrexs myself to your judgment andto your cool rexson the first question which appears and which wil give place to measures which will be submitted to yon is that which at present agitates the commercial world and which is raised by the treaty of commerce concluded with eng land it has revived all the theoretic discussions between tree trade and the prohibitive system is it no a fit oppor tunity to examine the erinclules with attentionn frce trade may it appears to me be considered as the object to which society is tending but protection ought to be the means of zrriving at it suppose free trade esta buished in a new and poor country what will that country produce i do not deny but that it can develope some fivoured industry by a natural privileged situation but foreign competition would stifle in their bud all those things which it requires in order to prospercapital sldlfulwork men experienced overseers easy communication and a good marketin fact all the condittons which time alone can gvc it a transition consequently is indispensable and to preach free trade to a country which does not yeb enjoy au these advantages is nearly as equitable as to propose to a child to contend with a grown man noow these principles eing laid down can it be pretended that a government ought to protect its industry in an interest exclusive of the manufactarers and to preserve a monopoly at the expense of the consumers of the country far from that the government has quite a contrary duty to perform for the only means of developing the public fortune snd improving the condition of all is to succeed in redacing as much as possible the price of the objects of general consumption wages high in appearance are for them but a relative advantage these are only advantageous inasmuch as they can earn them at a rate in some degree corresponding with the objects necessary for their existence to attain this object it is useful that industry be suffi ciently stimulated in the interior by foreign competition and that the protective duties should be regulated on the strength of those who are at the head of our industry and nqt on the weakness of those who lag behind these i be lieve are the true principles nevertheless this thoory lads its limits in positive calculation the price of every manufactured article is always composed of the same prin cipal elementsthe price of the raw material the cost of manufacturing and that of transport our workmen are as skilful as foreign workmen what constitutes our inferiority is the high price of the ravw ma ierial and means of transport well then these are pre cisely the two obstacles which the emperor meant to remove while remaining in the just meassure oi protective princi plesi find also in the emperors letter to his minister of state a passage which i am happy to submit to you here it isl our agriculture must be improved and our industry freed from the internal itpediments which keep it in a con dition of inferiority at this day it is obstracted by a num ber of restrictive regulations in fact the spirit of our codes of our laws was principally directed to prevent nbuset and by dint of pursuing them it has succeeded in impeding their use this is the most important reform to obtain there is no trie prosperity but with entire civil ilberty and if our couantry has never known how to uco with moderation political liberty it is because it had not begun to enjoy the benefits of the firstlet us express our desire also that the irritation re cently excited in the interior will calm down and cease to disturb the minds of our population the consientious search for a purely political solution ought it to excite com plaints so bitter the members of the clergy whom an excessive zeal has drawn on have forgotten the services rendered to religion by the emperor and aiso perhaps tho lessons of the past vhen the people had before them but the humble and charitable pastor who translated for them the sublime morals of the gospel this gentle civiliza tion of the heart preaching love for your neighbour the pardon of injuries the disregard of worldly advantages then indeed his falth gets fortified but when the priest forgetful of his character borrows mere worldly arms and intrudes on civil and political interests suddenly the gallican meceptibiity is roused and the religious spirit loses all that the spirit of civil and political independence gains and which forms the fund of public opinion in the countryl let us unite our efforts gentlemen to restore calm to the public mind and to give to industry the confidence it meeds for its development let us aid the emperor in his liberal measures let us second his projects let us vote with eagerness the laws relating to all these economical questions and let us resolutely enter with him on a new era of peace progress and libertythe hurricane which raged so furiously in london and paris on monday last was severely felt in the south of france the railway train which left per pignan for narbonne that morning was upset by the violence of the wind near salce the passenger carriages with the exception of one were thrown into a deep ravine but wonderful to say nobody was killed twenty persons were wounded but none dangerously all the electric telegraph posts and wires on the line had been swept away by the wind so that the account of the accident did not reach narbonne until  at night a physician wes imme diately despatched to the relief of the sufferers who were conveyed to salce where every attention was pcid them a goods train was turned over the same day at rivesaltes by the force of the wind and the toof of the stationhouse at yilledaigne was blown offthe seine yesterday morning was as high as  metres  centimetres by the scale at the pont royal all the towing paths are under water and the works of the pontauchange had to be interrupted at orleans and saumur the day before yesterday a marked rise took place in the loire the viunnealso rose at lyons the rhone which for two days had been very high overflowed its banks and covered the ports and a portion of the quays the inundation was caused by the thaw of snow in the neighbouring hills and particularly in those of bugey at montbeliard in the doubs the allaud by the sudden melting of the snow in the snountains likewise overflowed and inundated the lower part of the town but after a few hours the waters subsided the cotorrier dibas rhin men tions a serious calamity which fell on mulhausen and the surrounding communes in the evening of heth ult the sudden thaw which took place in consequence of the heavy rains caused the river illto overflow its banks and the water after inundating the valley and all the lower part of the town of altkirch rushed in an impetuous torrent over the plains of aiulhausen the force of the torrent was such that in a very short time all the manufacturino entablishments situate on the outskirts of the town and the new citei ouvrilre were filled with water to the depth of more than four feet near dornach many of the manufactories were so suddenly inun dated that the workmen had not time to get out to sturn to their homes and several of them in making the attempt were drowned four bodies have already been found

mach   pthe monileus of this morning publishes the inaigural discourse which m de iorny is wont to address to the deputies on their first meeting in parliament and which i was enabled to send you yesterday all france may now profit if it will by the admzirable lecture which the president of the legislative corps has thought it his duty to pro nounce to her representatives but more than any other the clergy will receive vdth becoming thank fulness these lessons of selfdenial humility aind generally of all the moral and christian virtues which are inculcated on such high authority from no one better than from ia de mioray could emanatowirn more torce these line precepts indeed none but he who practises could preach them so effectually he best can paint them who has felt them most  how beautifully does that cunning hand shape the image of  the humble and charitable pastor who explains to the people the sublime morality of the gospel the sweet civilization of the heart the preaching love towards our neighbour the forgiveness of injuries the detaching ourselves from terrestrial goods  these last few words are most comprehensive among other  terrestrial goods they may apply to the perishable nature of railway scrip the shadowy security of obligations the fragility of shares to bearer the evanescence of mining interests the fleeting rapture of reports the vicissitudes of  quotations the alternate joys and sorrows of  differences and in a word the valueless glory of speculation in general these truths have seldom been delivered with more unction and it is to be hoped that those who havehad the advantage of hearing them uttered in the i high place from which di de moray directs thedlebates of the national council will profit by them i as they oughti may observe that no moment could be so pro pitious as the present for inculcating disinterested ness selfdenial and good faith it is the season of penitence it is the same in which a famous preacher chose to impress on louis xv as m de moray does now on the legislative corps the duties of the great the virtue of abnegation c and some of the lenten sermons of massillon are admitted to be among the noblest lessons that ever fell from the lips of uninspired man should the admirers of the eloquent president of the corps legislatif prevail on him to give to theworld in a separate form the touching allocution of i yesterday there could hardly be a more appropriate title for it than the petit careme of m de miornyal de fauoux has after some delay received an answer to his request to present for the emperors approval the election of father lacordaire to the french academy the academy has always had the privilege of communicating personally to the head of the government the result of its elections m de falloux will not however be received in private but tomorrow at a public audience it is curious that he was the presidents minister when the expeditionary army went to rome to put down
