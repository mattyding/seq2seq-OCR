thb carnepalont of auafom our own coiondznmlan feb the milanese have the credit of being among the most fickle versatile and capricious of morta the more i see of them the more i am convinced tna they are indebted for this character to their advemsaries who caricatured  quality into a fault there is an eberance of life in this people which is calculated to drive to despair those of a more eluggish organization who have to deal with them i dont know whether it is owing to their geographical poition in the midst of the lombard plain or whether it be the great mixtre of races whlch hagiven this vitality and sensibility but certain it is hbt the pulse of the milanese beats quickel than that of any other population they are capable of an anmunt of excitement which no other nerves could bear and yet strange to say in the highest of their excitement they maintain a selfcomnd rarely equaled by the moat sober populations it is as if this people had none of the bad instinctwhich are more or less found everywhere else for the more it abandons itself to its impulse the len trace is there of anything resembling rioting dis order and excessif ever there was an ocecsion to wonder at this cidtabifity and selfcommand it was within the last five days of the crnevone or great carnival of dilan as you know owsing to th s pecial dispen stion o st ambrose the towns of spil anad yarese alone

fever with fits of raving mad nes it was as if the last day was in store and a whole town of sardanapaluses had taken the decd elon to make the most of their remaining moments to concentrate a whole life in the few hours and to draln the cup of joy before they met their doom a general frenzy to live and to rejoice seemed to have taken possession of the whole population without llstnction of class and rank and the saturnalia of old rome was revived for high as well as low even in ordinary times the dispensation of st ambrose which affords an opportunity for jilting fent attracts numbers of gay people from all the maighbouring places the presence of the king and is court increased their numbes by thousands it was aegular invasion of strangers who added their share of madness to the common

reminded one of the time when the hungry heroes of magenta pamed through this modem capua intent on making up for the fatigues of the campaignxae two great teatures m tbls general revelry are the veglioni or masked balls at the theatres and he two days of the coraiodoti the veglioni go on iduring the whole carnival but it is in there last lfour days only that they attain their greatest ani mation the lovw prices paid for admission which even for the scala do not amount to a couple of shings place these amusements within the reach even of the lowest classes while the numbers of sellers and lenders of costumes afford every facility for masquerading those whose purses cannot even reach this cheap luxury contrive at any rate to find a mask and wbatever old ragged garments they can seize upon in which they haunt the streets and the neighbourhood of the theatres at night those who are not actors themselves crowd together as spectators perambulating the streets and taking their share in the general amusementwednesday and friday are the two veglioni nights par ezcellence at the scala and a  crption of one of them will give your readers an ideamore or lees of au the others according to timehonoured custom they aie preceded by the theatrical repre eentation comprising the most successful perform ances of the repertoire by  pm the perform ance is over tho culrtain ecarcly let down is again drawn up and shows on the scene a host of mechanics who set to work to prepare the salea for the coming festival the decorations which have served for the opera are removed and the scene metamorphosed into a kind of upper sala closed above with a painted gallery corresponding with the boxes and filled with painted spectators con trasting strangely by their antiquated costumes of some thirty years ago with the dresses which soon are to fill the space below some lustres are placed to illuminate that part of the building the foot lamps disappear and their place is taken by a kind or gallery which overlooks the orchestra except close to the boxes on both sides where the music stands have been removed and staircases are placed to serve as a means of communication betwveen the scene and the pit in this latter the seats are re moved a part of them placed in a semicircle to the right and left leaving only a natrow space along the boxes towards the staircaes the rest dis appear by two trapdoors which open out under the boxes not the least amusing process is the lighting of the gay candelabras which runroundthebodyof thehouse threeoaf thefive tiers are lighted from below by means of three polesting one into the other and drawn out by means of strings it requires no little practice to direct these long balancing machines next comes a general weeping of the place and the unrolling and nailing down of carpets while this process which lasts little more than half an hour is going on the public in the pit has left uot so most of the inmates of the boxes who remain as spectators of tbe meta morphos which is watched for the tvwentieth time with interest those who are not interested in the process can ecreen themselves from the dust by setting down the curtain with which every box is providedthe sound of a trumpet announces that the pre parations are finished another call of the trumdet summons the band and the third is the signal for the admission of the public below the corridors outside as well as the entrance have been for some time full of persons waiting for the signal of admission so that on the great nights the whole immense building is filled in less than a quarter of an hourthe distinguishing feature of the veglione at the scala is that the house is as it were divided into an upper and a lower housethe boxee and the space below the former chiefly occupied iry spectators and the latter by the actors the ladles in the first in ball tollettes and un maked below the women almost without ex ception masked the wjiqle takes thus the char racter of an amusement of the lower in the presence of the hligher classes only a few of the more enter prising ladies from above venture to put on a domino and mix with the crowd below or go intc one of the other boxes while the appearance oi somo mask from below in the boxes ia equally rare except indeed in the boxes of the lower tiers usually held by single gentlementhe coup dcril of tho wvhole is charming au the briiancy of a gala night above with the confusior of a masquerade below but this contrast how ever pretty to the eye seem to exercise a banefiu nfluenco on the life of the whole ft

must not be forgotten is the suppers in the boxes which indemnify somewhat the inmates of the boxes for the dignified part they have to play otherwise in these festivals a discreet cuartain is let down in front of the box screening those inside from the gaze of those outside and converting the box into a snug little supperroom a table arranged so a to fit the shape of the box is fitted in with hooks everything has been prepared in the little cabinot opposite on the other aide of the passage and is brought across by the servants who retire again to come in only when they are summoned by a bell which communicates from every box to the cabinet attached to it the boxes being for the most part smal and narrow these little improvised supper rooms fitted up with mirrcezr and lighted with lamps or candelabra just within hearing of the buzz below but undisturbed by thedrying eyes of the outer world aro cozy enough in good companybat however brilliant or mad the veglioni are only a mild phase in the general carnival fever the real crisis is the two criandoli days on thursday and saturday it is these which give to the carne valone of milan its peculiar and unique charaeter and it is in them that one of the most curious features of the saturnalia of old rome has been preserved rome and milan are the only two towns in italy in which the civli warfare of the coriandoli has been kept up in all its purity in most of the others it has long died out and in the few others where it still exists it is but a shadow a poor imitation of the forms without any of the spiritnowhere but in rome and milan can one tho roughly understand the meaning of this bdlum onzm nrium contra omnnesthis goodhumoured spirit of mischlef which seizes high and low old and young small and great as if puck ruled supreme for the time no one pitying the victim aud all applauding the successful mischiefmaker no one can see this battleroyal between street and balconies th cruish ing supremacy of the attackers in the latter and the arts and dodges of the masses below their passive resistance or impotent attempts at retaliation with out feeling that he is on the traces oe that earlyreua oesween sne patrcians and plebeians of old rome which has left its root in the italian muni cipalities and which takes this harmless form in the yearly epoch of license aul the advantage is on the side of those aboveand this advantage is abused in the most rnthless manner the mass below feeling its inferiority and using cunning the arm of the weak every one merely anxious about his own safety and taking a fiendish delightin the mis hap of hisneighbonr it isthe caricature of that long fight betwen high and low with au its little features of overbearing on one and stoicism or baseness on the other sidethe scene of this most civil warfare is the corso from the piazza del duomo down to the porta orientale about a mile in length the upper half of it which has the name of corao vittorio ema nuale being too narrow to admit two rows of car riages these latter in returning from the porta orientale have to turn into the contrada del monte just by the column caued the leone della porta orientale go on towards the scala and then by the contrada s margherita and the piazza dele mercaut back to the piazza del duomo the space thus specially consecrated to the fight of the coriandol cannot be less than two miles and a half in length but this space cir cumscribes only the battlefeld proper for more or less skirmishing is going on all over the town nay as usual in real warfare these skirmishes if not so intense as the fight on the regular battleground are perhaps more exciting because they are less expected and offer therefore more of the charms of the ima promptu than the general action for weeks past au the balconies in the first floors which are just at the most convenient height had been let at fabulous prices some of those most favourably situated about the lleone the column commemorating some aictory of the milanese were let for not less than grani or sterling for thectwo days it was quite a harvest for the owners for even single windows with smal balconies before them fetched as much as  s io in the plafar which has been newly made before the theatre of the scala and on the piazza del duomo towards the chapter house scaffoldings we rerted decorated with the never failing tricolours for the benefit of those who could not contrive to get something betterthelawful arms in this mock warfare are the gandol lite chalk balls of the size of a pea but in the heat of the warfare it can scarcoly be expected that unlawvful missiles such as oranges and chestnuts should not be resorted to there is a strong ianerdict against them but it is impossible to prevent their use altogether as the case of a french officer laid up in the hospital with a broken nose proves if wild excytement now and then resorts to these mlore ponderous arms gallantry prepares bonbons and bouquets as a setoff to this more unpleasant side of the warfare but it is the coriandoli with which the great fight is carried on and the almost incredible amount of the ammunition used thows better tha anything else the heat of the fight long before the two battle days dawned at every  or  yards all along the line of the cors you would see little tablets hung out bearuig the inscripton of  vembuan ds cosas doli or falbsica d coriandols while on the eve of the first day every open space was used as an ammunition store from which the qufntties of iinerant hawkers drew their supplies during the fight being always ready to brng up re serve agmmuniton to the combatants whose sthores had become ezkausted but those who seri ously intended to go in for the fight took the precoutson r of making provision before hand in the houses the roolas leading out on the balconies had well of hem hepedr o wooen nigh to the eeiling which gave them moere the ap pearanco of granaries than habitable rooms a number of baskets more or less ornamented were provided at the same time to be placed on lowastools on the balconies as well as a numaber of wrooden spoons ladles and shovels which are usd for throwing these missiles what the expenditure of this ammunition is you may judge if i tell vou that  to  pounds for the two days is thought very little for a moderatesized balcony and i know of one where four persons threw not less than  poundsin one of the two days no wonder for in the heat of the fight it is by no means un usual to seize the whole basket and send down its contents into the street belowas an intermediate link between those active above and the passive mas below come in the car rlage and cars which form one of the most pro minent features of the whole the inmates of these latter are the real veterans of the fight the boldest and hardiest eugaging the balconies as well as ex posed to the pamial bashibazouk attacks of the surrounding crowd thoy are the champlons as well as the tyrants of the street doing battle in favour of the people below against those above attracting the fire or rather the coriandou on their devoted heads but at the caine time showering down their own ammunition on those whom they are thus defending usually from four to telve and more young men club together and have a car built on purpose the chief object of which is to have as much space as possible for the stowing away of the bags of coriandoli they are ornaimented with all kinds of fantastic devices representing steamboats rock fortreses gondo ltriuml carh c rs horss vaasc

without which it would be almost tmpossible to face the hail of missiles which the appearance of these cars provoke as no car coud ontain the amunition necessary for such a company reg llar store are kept in different parts of the corso ready to supply the de ficiency besides these cars provided for the fight there are others for the bandsof music which are provided by the champions of the atreet for the amusement of the general publuc but thesa cari whilch form sit were the heavy bodies of street combatants ate only small in nnmber in proportion to the hundreds of vehicles of all sorts and al

like the judte mile in all things get the worst of itthey cannot escape by runiing aa those on foot and have nothing to retaliate with like the combatants in the caraboth days of the coriandeli battle were as fine sand bright sunny days as any one could wih for and they were alone calculated to put eerey one into good humour and make himl ready for the coming mischiief it was known that the king would be on the balcony of the palais bresca just beyond thb canal this naturally added not a little to the general merry disposition trhe regullar battle is from  pm till sunset but long before that time the crowds of idlers were lounging about theo battle ground whife from all sides the population was streamlng towards it by  ofclock the skirmishing had already begunnow suppose yourself disposed to engage in the thiok of the fight wrapped up with the mask before your face and beated in a carriage or ear well pro vided with ammunition it isas if there was some thing contagious in the contact with the ciandoli for you have scarcely got into your car when you seize the beat spoon and firo away at your own attendants and the gazers who are watching your start and suspecting no evil the auccess ofr your first attempt at mischief is already calculated to in crease your good humour which is even more aug mented on your way to the corso the streets are not so crowded as to impede your progress in a smart trot and asyou see the passersby jump aside you shower your ammunition right and left taking a fiendish delight in whiteing a high hat wellbrushed coat or smart bonnet waith every successful shot followed by general laughter your spirits rise so that if you have some distance to go before you take vour place in the piazza dei mereanti your blood isthoroughly up and you have likewise found out the way of expending your missiles with the most success in the piazza dei mercanti your fighting will bo al skirmishing with the crowd whichthrongs all parts of itabove all the archway leading towardis the duomo it gives you a good foretaste of what is to follow lnot threatened and cowed by the balconies above wbich shade the sacred precincts of the municipality the people here have already developed a strong spirit of resistance the cars which passed before you have already given to them asupplyof ammunitionwhichtheyhavo scraped together from the ground or the sides of the cars and which they are using with deadly aim against your face while you punish one foolhardy offender two others have scraped together another supply from the sides of your own car with which they greet you wben you turn round no mrsk protects you effeotually against this chalky dust which in a moment fills all your pores actlng like the bande rillas in the spanish bullfight exciting you to ven geance and retaliation you are in the first heat of the battle and ladle about in blind fury often mis sing your aim to the great merriment of the crowd which is always on the aide of the successful shot the french soldiers you find have quite entered into the spirit of the thing and have be come your most formidable adversaries cunning and bold at the same time pushing up against your car unheeding the showers of missiles vith which you try to keep them in awe and using your own arms against you or else asking you for a voluntary contribution and shying it at you the moment they have got it or else holding up their capes and great coats to catch the missiles you send towards them you are almost getting the worst of the fight when happily your car which has been blocked up begins to move and you escape through the narrow archwaynot without however havingt received the greetingz of some adversaries hidden be hind the pillars you revenge yourself on vour inisible adversaries by sending a shower into the face of one of the peaceful national guatds stauding about the place near which their chief guardhouse standsyou have scaroely got out of this scylla when you get into the charybdis in the narrow street of the borsinari you are relieved somewhat from your adversaries below but you are assailed if possible by more formidable ones from both sides high above your head fortunately for you they are not so well provided wift ammunition it being one of the less fashionable places thus you answer successfully by energetic broadsides to the more orgnized but less effective fire than that you had just now to sustain from below the piazza del duomo brings fresh relief there are balconies on one side only and the stage erected on the other side is too far off to be formidable and yet very useful by attracting the attention of the skirmishers in the streets after leaving the piazza you get into the thick of the fight not large enough to admit of two rows of carriages but broader than the contrada dei borsinari you have equal chances with you adversaries returning broadside for every broadside which comea from above your adversaries in the streets have not mueb time to think of you engaged as they are to defend themselves against the showers from the bal conies thus you proceed fighting merrily until you get to the colonna del leone where the cornor house to the right approaches rather close to the other eide this is the most choice and hottest part of the battlefield and woe to you if you happen to be blocked up for some time you get shovel aud basketfuls right down on your head while the re turning file of carriages which you meet just at this point brings you in contact with new adversaries after passing this point the corso opens out so broad that the fight becomes childs play you go down easily and without much harm t the bastion and return again equally easily until you come baok to this same awk ward nosition and turn into the contrada del monte the rest of the way back by the scala neither so hot as the upper nor so harmless as the lower part of the corso orientale is just sufficiently animated at different points to keep you in breath for the piazza dei mercantlby the time you return to the spot whence you started which will be bout  probably have had enxouh sorougmy exuaustect that you winl gladly go up to some balcony among your acquaintances to partake of the other side of the fight it is quite different comparatively sheltered you feel all the security you can wish for your own person and see in the heaps of sacks of coiandoli ample means of doing mischief to others and henceforth you study how to do this with the greatest effect by degrees you find out how to drop down a whole shovelful with deadlyalm on some temptinglooking high hat a comparatively clean coat a wellsound ing shako the white handkerchief or vell of a gaping countrywoman the shovel hat of a priest you drop down a snall quantity on some unsuspect ing individual and when he looks up you pour the contents into his face you take a special deliaht in bombarding the spectators in the carriages who cannot retaliate and would give anything to throw a ladleful into the triumpets of some of the bands men who pass by but who have taken the precau tion of stretching a piece of gauze across the mouth of their instruments in one word you feel a frenzy of mischief without any danger to yourself and with all the means of harmn others n want of something better you assail your own friends close by when they are least suspectingit and engaged in fighting your adversaries you cannot help it you get as mad almost as everbody elsethus you and the whole corso go on till nightfall when the streets are covered several inches thick with cowriadoli and you can scarcely raise your arm you scrape together what you can and throw down your ast shota wihole basketfulwaiting for themost tempting opi portunityfor instance a
