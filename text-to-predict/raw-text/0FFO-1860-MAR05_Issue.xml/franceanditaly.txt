mlnus of foracar tuiwr paris feb ltorsiur la baroni have the honour to samd you herewith copy of the aespatch vbch ibavo addressed to the ambassador of tho emperor at london and in which maldng mnown to him the opinion of the government of hms majesty on the reply of the vienna cabinet to oar ilst propossls i point out to him the beat line to be followes according to my idea to relieve all responsibilities without depriving any one of hislegitimate freedom of action as aso to get out of a slituion which woald shortly become as dan gerous as itis nowconfused if left toitself and tot chancuo of incidents the moment has then arrived for every one to speak ont and i will now give you without any reserve the views of the emperors government so that the turin cabinet may form its own judgment as to how far it msy suit it to conform thereunto in presence of such serious i may say such solemn conjunctureethe double object which we have never lost sight of and wbich we ultimately wish to attain with the concur rence of sardinia is thisso to manage that on the one hand the results of thewrar may notbe compromised in italy itself on the other hand to obtain tbatthey may in a more or less near future be consolidated by the oscial adheslon of europe or in other words to prevent complications which would give up the itlian peninsula to anarcby and to found a durable state of things by placing it as soon as possible suder the protection of international law the cabinet of tuxrin can assist us in the accoumplish mnent of thls taskl and the success would probably be certain it is also free to adopt a different line but the general interests of france would not aloow the government of the iemperor to follow in it and frankness compels us to say so it is these two systems between which the government of his sardainn majesty has to choose that i am nowv going to consider with you i am convinced m le baron that if the turin cabinet shows itself resolved to consider end make every one con sider the organization which a portion of italy is called upon to adopt as constituting the origin of an historical period without a preliminary termfixed for its duration in the con ditions of order and of peace the very nature of thlgs will overcome many obstacles tht this organization should have such a character in the opinion of all men it is necessary that it should not contain the elements of eventual and probable dsorder either within its own self or in its external relations the govern ment of the emperor for its part is firmly convinced that one and the same cause would produce etiter effect and that it would be rnmistakeably masifest fom the day upon which it should undertake a work eat of proportion to its regular means of influence and of action if sardinis extends her territory too far the work of assmilation would present obstacles which she ought not to overlook she would in fact fmd herself less powerful and especially less mistress of her resolutlons she wil be dragged along se will no longer direct and the impulion which has made the strength and the success of pledmont iu these latter years will no longer emanate from turin it is not at a moment  le baron when the destinies of the peninsula are on the eve of a final solution that the government of the emperor wonld hesitate to express itself with a fraulmess which testifies however to thehvely interest it feels in a friendly and allied cour let us then frankly say thatthe sentiment which brought forwardin cer tainparts of italy the idea of annexstion and which gave rise to tho expression of that wish is rather a manifestation directed against a great power than a well considered at tractlon tiowards sardtnls such a sentiment if not checked at the onset could not fall to fall into errors which it would be the duty of the turin cabinet to oppose could it do so for any length of time without being violently re proached for denying and betraying the cause for which alone it was aggrandizead and armed lnto one can say and what is likely is that it would be exposed to two eventuali ties equally to be deploredwar and revolutlon taking everything into consideratlon al l baron with the firm intention of selecting that solution best suited to the pressing circumstances of the moment ancd of a calmer future it will be admitted that it is high time to come to a settlement that may bh offered to europe with some chance of being accepted and which woild conserve to ssrainla the full exercise of the normal influeence which she has a right to hold in the peninsula sach a combination maturely consldered by the go vernmenz of the emperor is as follows  l complete annexation of the duchics of parma and modena to sardinia  temporal administration of the legatlons of the no magna of ferrera and of bologna wmder the form of a zieariat lientenancy exercised by eis sardinian ms jesty in the name of the holy see  reestablishment of the grand duchy of tuscany in its poltical and territorial independence autonrnmic in this arrangement the assimilation confined to lom hardy and to the duchies of parma and modena would no longer be a work to which sardinia would be bound to de vote all her efforts exclusively  the ttrin cabinet would preserve its liberty of action and mlght exercise it in esta blishing tranquillity in italy while organizing in a compact kingdom the territories added to the hereditary possessions of king rictor emmanuel the vicasat would be in harmony with the municipal spirit which is a secular tradi tion in the eomagnas as with the natural influence which the power must exercise that has become mistress of the greater portion of the valley bassin of the po this manner of settlement would moreover have the advantage of guaranteeing to sardinia the position which is necessary to her in a political point of view of satisfying the legations in an administrative point of view and in a catholic psint of view it would constitute a temperament which we hope wonid finnly satisfy all scruples and consciences such a result could not bo indifferent to france as she could not in principle admita radical dis memberment of the states of the holy father without compensation nor can it be indifferent to sardinia we shall neglect nothing that the other powers enlightened upon the imposlsbility of restoring completely the ancient order of things and of not takiing present necessities into account shall exert themselves to make the pope under stand that such an arrangemrent franldy accepted wonld shield all the essential rights of the eoly see what i have said m le baron of tho necssity of an ticipating the dangers to which sardinia might be exposed if she looked for further aggrandizements is more particularly applicable to tuscany the idea of the annexation of the grandduchy that is to say the absorption in another state of a land gifted with so beautiful and so noble a history and so attached hitherto to its traditions cannot assuredly emanate except from an aspira tion the danger of which it is imposible for the govern ment of the emperor to disown and which it is far from believing that it is shared by the mass of the population that aspiration there mnst be no delusion whatever may be at the present moment i doubt not the correct intentions of the sardinian govern ment reveals on the part of those whom it carries along with it an arriseense of a war against austria for the conquest of venetla and an arherpcnsec if not of revolution at least of menace for the tranquillity of the states of the holy see and of the kingdom of the two sicllies it is impossible to deceive publio opinion in italy or elsewhere and the questions which it is our object to settle would ouly be reopened more embittered than ever the government of the emperor without overlooldng the difficulties which would remain to be overcomo to secure the triumph of the solution to vwhich if the turin cabinet would assent it would devote its most energetio sn aperso vering efforts entertains the confidence that those difficulties would not bs insurmountable certain moreover of ope rating upon a basis of a nature to satisfy completely france and sardinia to pacify italy for a long period and not to hurt in too absolute a manner any of the interests which iurope has the right and duty morally to watch over the government of his majesty would not only not hesitate to promise to take in a conference or congress the defence of such an arrangement but it would proclaim it as imat tackable in its opinion by foreign intervention in this hypothesis then sardinia would be sure of having us vith her and behind her you are authorized to declare this formnally to count cavour do i need now m le baron long details to explain whatwould be our attitude if he turin cablnet free in its option should prefer to run all the risks which i have pointed out while advising it to avoid them the hypo thesis in which the government of his sardinlan majesty would have to rely only on its own forces developes itself so to say naturally and it would be painful for me to dwell upon iti

explsaaionc which the emperor had commanded me to accompany the propositions which emanated from the government of her britnnic mafjesty i have abstained from returning with the ambassndor of austria to judgments the sincerity of which i in no wise contest but which are too far removed from our manner of viewing the matter to render it nasful to attempt to rectify them ihavopreferred topayhomageatoncetothe sentiments of moderation which have animated count eechbarg when wishing even to reproduce the very terms whlch i had em ployed he has declared that if he deplored the diver gence of opinion of our two courts as t o the practical vicu of the combination suggested by lord john russell he clung nevertheless to the hope of which i had made myself the interpreter when i lid it down that if the diffe ence of prlnciples could and in some cases oughit to leaf to different judgments it was not necessary that thereslt should be when the honour of either side was afe disastrous conflict and these so far removed from the in tentions both of france and austria although it wam coupled wlth the assurance that austria would do justice to the motives which command the two powers to abstain froma an armedinterventienincentralltalythat declarationwhich i admit shuts out all adhesion on the part of the cabinet of vlenna to the use which we may make of the latitnde which it concedes to us but it arises from thlsand i have pointed this oat to prince mettenich who has made no sort of objection to the justness of my reasoningthat the government of the emperor has now ti povrer to examine the fourth of the propositions of her britannic majestys principal secretary of state for foreign affairs it can especially with a degree of liberty which it did not possess before the exchange of these ex planations discuss the mode of solution which that pro position impliesthis solation agrees with the prlnciples which form tho basis of our ilstitutions and aa i had the honour to write to you on the th of last month we should not be in a position to dispute their efficacounmes if they were applied to other countries we acknowledge on the other hand that the wish of the population has manif sted itself in italian affairs with great authority ana it is their vwish which we ourselves have taken into consi deration when we honestly made known to austria the difficultles insurmountable in our eyes which the liberal execution of the stipulations of villfranca and zurich would encounterwhat then in this state of things is the aim or rather what would be the result of the proposition of the cabinet of london to call forth a fresh expres sion of this wish with the assent of france and eng lsnd in such a manner that this manifestation would re ceive from the previous adhesion of these two powers a force in some sort legalired and regular the government of the emperor has deliberately examined the situation which would be made for it in this eventnality and it has remained convinced that it could not succeed in set ting free its moral responsibility unless the prin ciple of universal suffrage which constitutes its own legitimacy became also the foundation of the new order of things in italy on quite another field the participatlon of france would be a manifest inconsequence to which its government could not expose itself now what we are forced to consider as an absolute necessity england without opposing what the governments actually established in central italy equally acknowledged with us abstalnefrom advising them to adopt we know besides that these governments would not lend themselves except with a sort of repugnance to a fresh manifestation which they con sider to be nseless and of a nature to throw susplcion on the value and the sincerity of preceding manifestations the considerations which i have just pointed out place us in the necessity of carefuly weighing the consequences to which our unreserved acquiescence in the proposition of england might condulct us to our eyes one certainmethod alone can have the right to substitute a new principle of stability and order for another principle hallowed by time and the respect of peoples but if we have the right and the duty to claim for ourselves the free exercise of our doctrines we do not recognize it as our right to impose them on others and we holdit onthe contrary to be noleis imperative a duty to leave them the liberty as well as the responslblllty of their own opinions and their own actionswill add m le comte that the harmony which it is our lively desire to maintain between ourselves and the govern mentof her britanmioldajesty could notneverthelessprevent us from establishing the fact that our respective positons are not exactly the same in fact the course of events during the past year has thrown us into the necessity of sustaining the weight of a war england on the contrary has been able without harm to her interests to remaint in an attitude of expectation god forbid that i should pretend that england ought to show herself indifferent to the happy or unhappy results of the experience to which she invites us to assodate ourselves bet i shall say no thing but what is conformable to the nature of things in admitting that if this experience happened either to be wrecked in italy ltself or to provokle a european cris england would always be free to withdraw into the post of simple observation this tasl assuredly wouldbe lees easy for france and vro have the right without wishing to oppose ourselves to the wishes of central italy and still less to dictate a solution after consultlng nothing but our own conveniencewe have the right i say to take into our previous conideratlon much more than england has any need to do so the clements of internal order and of external peace containad in the different solutions which may bo offered for the great problem which holds at the present day all minds in suspense the government of the emperor m lo comte in the name of tne services which it has rendered as well as in the name of the interests which are not exclusively personal to it thinkis it has some claim to give some advice to sardinia and its honesty commands it to preo ciso in some degree the amonut of support which it would be possible for it to give under this or that combi nation illusions in so serious a matter would be dangerous for italy and compromising for france  to dissipate them therefore is not an intention to restrain the liberty of italy it is simply to uphold that of france and free her action preliminuauy in anticipation of eventualities il whlch her interests would imperiously command her to keep away from complications from which tho would have vainly endeavoured to guard
