and mr bagsiawe jun appeared in sup port of the motion for an attachment and insisted that therevesting order was clearly a breach of lord cranworths  prohibition inasmuch as it was a dealing with the fund otherwse tnan was necessary to give effect to cooks pur chase deed lord eldon had enunciated the law with respect to prohibitions in the case of  iveson v harris  ves wherein his lordship had declared that such write could notbedisregarded by other courts even although they might have been improvidently issued it was not the province of an inferior court to question the legality of a wrzit of prohibition granted by this court nor could the court of chancery permit a breath of doubt as to its jarismr commisdoner law appeared personauy to resist the application and commenced reading a very lengthy state ment in writing of au the proceedings relating to cooks claim in the various courts of law and equity butthe loed csaxcsoro intezposed and said the court was anxious to come to a conclision in the matter and thought that a great portion of the learned commissioners statement was irrelevant the prohibition was the main feature in the present applicationmr commissioner lawt continuedand although ad mitting that it had been his intention to apply the surplus fund in queston in payment of the debts under dysons second insolvency he denied that he had committed any breach of the prohibition it had been declared by the court of queens bench that the insolvent debtors court had authority under the d section of the aot of the st and d victoria chap  to act judicially and not merely minoisterially and to decide upon an applioatlon for a re vestingorder o waoere the heir executors adoinstra tors and assigns of an insolenrt debtor there wan s a whimsical obsurd it in the wording of the writ of pro hibitlon and with respect to the phrase to give ewiect to the deed of the th day of july  he thought the chancelor must have meant that the nesolvent debtors court was to give legal effect toathe instru moent ad consequently to make inqeuiry as to the considera sion if that had not been his impression he certainly should have had the deference for this court to have walted until some person interested in the fund had aplied to have thewrit of prohibition rescinded should howeverlordships bold that the revesting order was a breach of the writ of prohibition he was ready to undertake as quckly as possible torescind the order and to place matters in te same position as theyo vere in previou to the making of st the l ord chancellor had declared that the inolvent debtors court had judicial authority under the before mentioned statute and therefore if he msr lw had erred he had erred in good companythe lobd cssceunose inaulred whether mr lawwas deielrtouns oft

consent and asked mr mians whether he wuld give such consentmr maltas replied in the negativethe lord chancellor said that being the case the court had on the present occasion only to oonsider whether or not there had been a breach of the writ of prohibition the law was quite clear that so long as the wrt remained undischarged it must be obeyed fuy admitting as ho did that the learned commissioner had in all other respects dis charged tho functlons of his office in an exemplary manner yet he could comeo to no other conclusion than tkat in maklng the revestling oder he had infringed the wrib of pro hibition by it the insolvent debtors cout was piohibited from dealfng with tha fnd in question except s was no cessary in order to give effect to the deed of the th of july i this declaration mplled that the deed was a legal deed and prevented any dealing wioth the fund except so as to give effect to it as so worded now the purgport and intention of the order of the learned commissioner reveeting the fund in mrr sturgis as provisional assignee under dy sons second nisolvency was learly to set asido cooks deed of juty i and therefore a toamfest infingement of the prohibition if however the commissioner would rescind chat order the court would not think of direting an ato tachment to issue and therefore upon his giving anunader taking to that effect no order would be made
