opening op ma nnew westrinsmsbridg after the lapse of nearly a century old westmirster bridge has at length ceased to give its accustomed accom modaaton to carriage traffic the finished half of the new bridge was opened for the passage of vehioles and heavy traffic on thursday and at present the entire width of the old structure is used only by persons on foot on horse back or those compelled to draw trucks or barrows there xreros some expectations that the throwing open of this portion of the new bridge would have followed immediately ater the queen had passed over it but it is nderstood thatthee first comisoner of works taking her majestys osure on the eubject the queen expressed an opinion ihat it would be better to defer any proceeding of that hind nntil thewholework was completed at recent the newrrad way provided bears by no means an inviting aspect on one side there is a wooden hoarding istead of the handsome pierced parapet and balustrades which have yet to be sup plied ad on the other ride there is the dllapidated masomny of the old bridge rising at the crown to a height of  feet above the roadway of the new bridge the whole has of necessity a temporary and nnfinished appearance which is greatly increased by the absence of footpaths on each ride of the bridge it would have afforded no gratification to her majesty to he driven over the bridge in its pre sent state but when finally completed the noble and magnifcent structure nearly twice the width of the widest bride over the thames will deserve what it will no doubt obtan the ceremony o a royalinauguration as

first of theypublic to cross and immediately upon an opportunity being afforded a crowd of boys started from either end racing each other to see whieh should be the first to reach the opposite side the tace was a very exciting one and afforded great amusement to the lookerson on wednesdazy night the new bridge was given up to foot pas sengers but since that time it has been devoted excluslvely to carriage traffic two broad iron tramways are used by waggons and heavy traffi but the omnibus drivers con stantly avail themselves ofthe faciltyof draughtwhich they afford to their horses cabs an lighter vehicles going quickly have sufficint rdadway for two lines between the tramway and the temporary sides of the bridge steps will be im mediately taken for proceeding with the remainder of the works another section of the bridge equal to onehalf of the old one is next to be tiken inbhand it will be that part adjoining to the new one just opened this half of the old bridge will be cut away and foot passengers alone are to have the use of the remainder untmi the second portion is finished alter which the foot passengers will be shifted to the new structure and the work of removal of the
