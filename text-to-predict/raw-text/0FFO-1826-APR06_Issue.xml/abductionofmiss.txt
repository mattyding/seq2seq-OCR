evidentlyproceeding from thesame sourcethey cannot i imnagine have received the sanctipa of tr turner or of his daughter for i know not how to believe that he would unnecesearily expose her to publie comment or tbhat she would approve the publication of statements that are untrue be this as it may your sense of justic will i am confi dett induce you to publish this lettithe true character of the trenssction described in the news paprs is widely different from any account that has ap peared alany of the newspaper statements are as far from the truth as they can be without being wholly uritrue and many of them are utterly falseit is obvious that in my present situation i cannot enter into a detailed reply to the statements in question it is pro bably a knowledge of this circumstance whicl has induced a publication of them it was thought a man who was abroad and who was threatened witl a serious prosecution might be uesrepresented and libelled with impunity besides motives of delcacy in
