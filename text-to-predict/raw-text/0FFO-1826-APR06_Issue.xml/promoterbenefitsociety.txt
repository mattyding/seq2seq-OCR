individuals or to press his opposition to far he did not state to the pblic what he would state nowthat when he applied to sir jaines macin tosh the chairman of the company to kriowwhat proportion of thefi shares had been disposed of heareplied that he believea half the number were purchased although he must have ben well aware at the time that he considerably oer rated the number was this the conduct of a iean of inte grity and honour  he who had beeis a judae in indiato act so unjustly in this transaction what wozld not such a man be dapable of stating  several voices lele called uponfr steele to brinfor wrdd his objections in formsir jaies macintosh would not have trouibled the meeting but that the strong remarks which had just been applied to him called for a few woids vwth respect

indivi dual tlieplaard which helhad posted through the town would one day rise up in judgment against him and he would live to repent that he hadever pnenned and published such a statemenl its object was to influence popular opinion and foedisturb the course of justice hear hear wvith respct to his statement that he sir j macintosh had wilfully umisstated the numbier of shares disposed of he had only to say that mtr steele whom he had never seen before that time applied to hin to be informedas to the affairs of the company ard to know the amount of sbares which had been sold to tne public these questions were put to him when he was engaged on other business and he was consequently taken by surprise he thoughtthat ir steele alluded to the number of shares taken wbich hesir j macintoslh under stood to be  thouh it afterwards appeared that only  were paid for anda h answered his question accordingly mr steele would icap but little benefit from the manner m whicli he had spoken of mir deacon and mr shawimir steele denied thathehadraflectedonthosegentlemen sir j maacttoshbe it as it may he would rather fall in company with such men than to rise with their calum niator one word more it was said that the resolutions passed at the former meeting had been successfully refuted and the question was whether mlfr steele had advanced any thing in bis handbill which should change the opinion of thc share holders as to the conduct of the directors did mr steele suppose that his kind fair and gentlemanlike handbill would have the eftct of altering the vote by which the conduct and proceedings ofthe company received the thanks of a nume rous meeting  mr steele obiected to that vote because it was carried by numbers  but he left it to the sagacity of that gentleman to discover in what other matimer than by a ma j ority the sentiments of a public meeting could be ascertained except that he might maintain  i had all the sense al tehough you nave all the nurnbers laughter in coneuding he could not but state his strong impression that mr steele in bringing forward charges against the company was influenced by strong personal feelingsof dislike to alr farren who first promoted the concenair steelet avow itsir j iacantoseiso then  mr stede would have this meeting pronounce an opinien against directors merely because he owns that he has a personal enmity to mllr farren a very pretty admission truly nr kerlle stated that he believed the cause of the dis like which ihtr steele had so candidly avowed arose out of certain monej transactions between the parties mr steele had app or proper accommodation to lllr farren which had been declined on the patt of that gentleman and tbat was the cause of a termination of their friendshipnmlr steele denied that lie had sought an aecormoda ton from mr farren altough he admitted at bills had passed between themsir j macirsosethe main chargc against tbe directors appears to be that they had reserved  shares at il premium to compensate the projectors and managers for teir time cost and labour but mfr steele had his eyes open when he agreed to this yet he came here today to repeat his complaintmlr gsnerewhat i conmplain of is this that fr farren should have s on each share when only  instead bf  have been actuauy disposed of he should be content with a less sumsir  macintosh  thie remuneration to the pro moter of the company was expressly made independent of the number of shares which nisht be eventually disposed ofairsteele said that he was aware his objections would have been borne down and he despaired of convincing the meetinghis enele bore testimony to the zeal and labours of the directors he had himself as one of them attended  days successivelymr hankey then addressed the meeting he regretted that the plan originally laid down had not succeeded and he traced the failure of the concem to the state of distress which had so lately prevailed he was happy to state that his confidence in the gentlemen wbo had conducted the affairs of the company continued unabated and he was sorry that the respectable individual who had put forth the handbill reflectig on the chairman and directors and tending to excite the passions of the public at a time when their prejudices were epsilyarousedhadso far committed himself as to act with somar keuls here stated that his steele hiadtapplied to the comnpany for the lean of ll on the security of his shares but that the directors bad refused to comply with his request re afterwards obtained the loan of  in anothes quarter and yet he would seek to destroy the security by means of which he had been accommodated rearmir hexty lefevnx e thought it a great injustice on the part of any individual to advance charges which could not be provedcertain resolutions wvere then moved and carried and thanks having been voted to the chairman the meetinm sedarated
