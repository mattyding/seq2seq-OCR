parcels booked at his office end in trusted tohim to be forwarded to different parts of the world the office and all the avenues leading to it were thronged long before the hour appointed for the examination by persons whose notice was attracted to the cuse by the pubiicity which it received through the medium of the press it will be recollected that o the apprehension of ltancaster a nmabe ofpawnbrokters duplicates for a great variety of property pledged by him were found in his possession and the asseim blage of pawnbrokers yesterday according to notices served upon them to produce this property added not a little to the increase of thie multitudesir georger farrant thc magistrate in whose hands the case is took his seat at two oclock in the private room the regular office being occupied by mvr dvyer the sitting magistrate fer the day in going through the usua business but so oppressive was the crowded state of tnis apartment that aflr dyr exchanged places with sir george farrant and hlee latter magistrate to hear lancasters case in the more extended space of the public office the first part of the proceeding gone into was to submit to the inspectionof all persons whoaadbooked and loet pro perty throngh the steampacketoffice all ibe articles pro duced by the pawabrekers in attendance and the latter hav ing exposed the different descriptions of property the office at one time had the appearance of a general sale room the pro perty consisted chiely ofmale and female wearing apparel for the most part new a v ariety of shawls silk handkechiefs and stoekings pieces of linen for shirting watches shoes c a host of sufferers by this steampacketoffice pressed forward to exaine the varios arstes hut in no one instance was any of the propertyidentified athough there were many persons present who had lost property of a simiar description but not those identical articesthe priuner lancaster being placed at tho bar sirgeorge farrant read several letters which had been writter by prsons indiffieret parts of the country and who had seen tle case stated in the newspapers describing a great variety of property and its value which had been lost to them in pass ing through the steampacketoffice sir george falautast next asked if there were any persons present who had lost property througb those steam people  a number of voices answered in the affiriative and there came towards the bench in succession about  persons each to state his tale of wo and detail the particulars of his loss it would be useless to go tbrough the whole of those cases they all bore the samne complexion and amounted to thisthat each complainant booked his parcel aid for booking carriage insurance c at this unlucky offce and that from the day of such booking up to the present day not one of the parcels had been seen or heard of byany person who had a rightful claim to see or hear of them in some cases a great length of time has elapsed since the booking of some ofthe parcels spoken of one gentleman stated that a packace containing a quanti ty of ladies dresses of considerablevaluehad been entereelat this steaming or rather schemoin office upwards of  months ago to be forwarded to montrel in canada but it has never reached its destination nor is it likely it ever will in august last a box containing valuable property addressed toa miss chamberlain at boulopnesurmer

having determined to remove from lon don and settle at fareham near portsmouth he packed up all his little property of cltes c together with all his own wearing apiparel amounting in the whole to

at fareham the nextday that was on last lriday week and in two days after he went down limself to farehain expecting to find hispsoerty arrived before him but from that time to the present aie sriiaking every inquiry in his power he has heard or scees nothing of the package the consequence is that he has lostall his little stockc in trade and is literallv left without a shilling oran

having declined to have any thing more to do with the casesir george farasut saidfor his part he could not see what use a solicitor could be of to him there was already a case upon wvhich he must be sent to take his trial namely the case of mr addisons parcel found in his desk broken opmn his reexamination was merely to investigate other charges that might be brought forward the prisoner then applied to mr harmner wvho was in the office for his legal assistance but air iharmer declined in asmuch as he was retained for charles abbott the book keeper to watch over his interests in the
