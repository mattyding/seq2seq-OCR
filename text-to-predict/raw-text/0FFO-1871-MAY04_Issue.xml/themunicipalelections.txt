thb municipal elecrioas ia frantoerrom oun parislan correspondentlle municipal elections wvhch were held yester i day throughout france with the exceptioin of paris anld its suburban communes possess under present circumstances an especial importance they may bytheirresults exercise a considerable influence upon events upon the policy of tho government and as a conseqluenico upon the destinies of france in order fully to comprehend the importance of these elections it must be borne in mind that in france the municipalities in the person of their mayors and their adjoints whlo act as their deputies possess functions which in various ways extend beyond the sphere of munici pal rights and interests the mayors are not alone chargred with the goveriment of tho commune but to a certain extent they exercise powers for goneral anid political order theyarein certain cases junlicial oflicers whose duty it is to interrogate prisoners immediately after their arrest they are the repre sentattives of the central authority for the execution of laws decreesand orders they presile at all elec tions of whatever nature  they draw up the lists of electors they have the chief power in the relief of the poor and in the admissions to the hos pitals they regulate the recruiting operations the dramwin up of statistics and the distribution of taxes aid finally and it is one of their most dan gerous powers they dispose of the local armed force of the national guard tho police agents aid on certain occasions of the gendarmerie the afairc or inbis absence the adjointt or ip the absence of both the senior miunicipal councillor unites in one personi a triplo authoritya purely municipal au thority a judicial authority and to a great extent a political and military authority from this state ment it wiu be readily understood that the central government has good reasons fer de siring that these manifold functions should be entrusted only to men in whom it has con fidence or at least from whom it may expect that they will at least obey its instructions and wiiu not paralyze its action they are its dele gates if it cannot rely iupon them it becomes unable to govern such is the vicious state of things which the first revolution and the empire have created in france it is the strongest link in the chain of ceintralization which all governments since  have exerted themselves to lengthen and to strengthenthis confusion of various powers in the hands of the chief of the french commune doos not permit the executive power to hold aloof from the elections of municipal councillors which are always more or less under the control of the afairc but that which rwas true under the old law which conferred upon the executive power the right of nominating the mairesand wlich evoe allowed it to select them from outside the electingc unicipal councils be comes still more true under the new law this law singularly liberal when it is considered that the iqirc is the representative and the agest of the executive power in the commune entrusts tho ap poiutment of ilfaires to the municipal councils the maire will therefore be chosen by a double election such is the basis of this new law and thus it would have beeni voted by the assembly at versailles but that ni thiers interposed to introduice an exception to wrhich the majority were only induced to consent against their will and upon its being made a cabiniet question that exception confirms the right of the executive power to appoint the maires of towns whose population exceeds  inhlabitants i need not dwoll upon the fact aud ni thiers was enabled to say truly that the assembly was more liberal than himself it will however be perceived that a thiers ha asserted the right of choosing in the great towns the representative and delegate of the central authority it seems to himn that if deprived of that power it would be impossible for him togovern andin fact iritli aireshostile to the governiment in cities lilke lyons marseilles tou louse and bordeaux all actiomi of the central autho rity might be checked thwarted or even violently resisted but that relates to their functions and it is their functions which require revision they re quire to be restricted to simple municipal affairs and then the electioli of the amaimrs and the complete ad ministration of the commune could be left aliklo to large and small touwns these ideas wmhichl form one of the essential points of future decentralization prevail in the assembly thusthe municipal law which it has voted is bu a provisional and transitional law the liberal spirit in which it has been conceived could never be mnore evident for if ever there was a time wvhen it appeared dan gerous to grant real independence to the communes it must be at the present moment when we see france plunged illto immensurable misfortunes through a civil and social war carried on in the name of the communal independenceof parisit is easy to explain why the versailles go vernnment is desirous thait the results of the municipal elections sh ould not represent a further menace towards it wve shaul shortly have the elections for the  vacaut seats in the assembly it is an important number one sufficient ontirely to change or at jeast seriously to modify the majority in the chamber tho great influleiice of the maires at elections in france is known in some places that influence is decisive in all they may by means which al men are not disinclined to use materially affect the re sult of the voting witlhout desiring in any way to interfero iu the elections the executive powel may certainly wishl that the electoral colleges shoald be presided over by upright men obeying rather patriotic feeling than party or sectarian instincts the united wisdom of all france wiu not be too muchi to save france the first act of wisdomi on the part of frenchoen certainly wouid ho not to ab stain from voting as so many parisians impra dently did at the general elections of february and theoconservativenmajority is so considerable that there can be no doubt that the municipal elec tions will be in the main favourable to the governm ment
