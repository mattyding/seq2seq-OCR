london phursday may  in tlle house of commons the greater part of the sitting wvas occupied by a debate on the wo mens disabilities bill and in moving its second reading mlr bright based the demand for it on the natural desire of womenwho bore equal burdens for equal legislation and their belief that thoy couild only obtain it by the possession of votes jae mentioned the trades union bills as an instance of the change which came over the house when a new class was admitted to the sufirage and as an in stance of unequal legislation for the sexes he re erred to the rules of lawr regrulating the custody of children of the ultimate success of the bill he spoke most confidently chiefly because it had been accepted by all the great towns in the kingdom and tie went on to discuss vith some show of contempt the arguments of his opponents after the conces ions the government had made on this question and the votes its individual members had either given or refrained from giving he maintained that they could no longer oppose the bill and called on them receiving a cheer of assent from mr glad stone to make it an open questionmr eastwick supported the biu as completing the representation of intelligence and property and as enabling womea to obtain their fair share of edu cational aud social privileges he did not treat the change as one of great importance because it would only affect a minority of womenridiculed the argument about unsexing women and laid special stress on the impulse the passing of the bill would give to the enfranchisement of women in our asiatic dominionsmrbouvesnue moved the rejection of the measure and by narrating some disgraceful scenes at a recent municipal election in mianchester enforced the armu ments which he had urged against it last yearthat to be mixed up with the turmoil of contested elec tions would injure the purity and modesty of women and that it would give great annoyanceto the great majority of wvomen wsho did not want to ote on this occasion howrever he declined to discuss it on mr brights narrorw grounds bnt urged that it rould obliterate the distinction be tween the functions of the two sexes which had been recognized from all time and that to concede electoral power would involve the ultimate con cession of legislative judicial and administrative functions he asserted too that the majority of women were opposed to the bill quoting the ex perience of the united states where the question was rapidly sinking into discredit and women were petitioning against it and maintained that womens interests were protected not by the posses sion of the franchise but by the iustitution of the family the argument however oni which mr bouvirir dilated with most force was drawwn from the ultimate aims of ir jacob brights sup porters and this he iuustrated by quotations from mr mqll whom on this question be regarded as a sophist and a plagiarist from mr thomson a socialist of owens school and from mr conorevr the bill was a first step towards upsetting tho foundations of society and particularly the institu tion of marriagemir scoupmfd in seconding the amendment said he should not be so adverse to the representa tion of property onvned by women but he was irre concilably hostile to the requirement of personal attendance of women at the pollingbooth he protested against the tyranny attempted to be ex ercised over parliament by sooieties with paid secretaries and characterized this particular move ment as one got up by ablebodied women sug gesting amid much laughter that the female petl tioners in favour of the bill should be required to forward their photographs along with their simna tures in order that their sex might be identifiedmr gladstone began by stating that the govern mnent as a government had no opinion on this ques tion and individually though he admitted that there was a presumptive argument in favour of some change he was not inclined to accept this bill until he was more convinced that it would be a satisfactory settlement mr scottpxilds argument against the personal at tendance of women at elections was insuperable at least until we had put an end to the turmoil of elec tions  and he agreed heartily with mr boovearis dissent from mr mlws sentiments on this subject and the revolutionary views about marriage to which the bill tended if any bill were passed mlr gladstone was of opinion that it must include mar ried womenif they possessed the electoral qualiica tion and he suggested for discussion the italian law which allowed married women to vote by delegation there was no grievance as regarded the upper classes but in the lower classes there was a growing increase in the number of self dependent women admitting too that there were many points on which the law bore unequally against women and did them less than justice mr gladstone said he should be glad if it were found that the law could be altered with safety and advantage to societylord j awxneis remarked on the difficulty of understanding which way mlr gladstones speech wvent but inferred from previous experience that he would very soon be voting for the measure he him self was in favour of it and aryaued that if women were allowed to tote at municidal elections they might safely be trusted with the parliamentary sutragemur b hopr opposed the bill not only as an tagonistic to the best interests of women but as likely to deteriorate from the character of our legis lation by imparting to it a spasmodic and hysterical tonedr plaayphn congratulated the supporters of the bill on the change in mr gladstones tone and maintained that wlhere the burdens were equa sex ought to make no lifference in privileges responsibility would prove a rapid political educa tor of women as of the working classea and he urged the advantage of having the opinion of women on such matters as the contagious diseases actisr waild huir who also supported the bill took much the same view andmr h james made a spirited and effective speech against the bill and the principle of equal political capacity of the sexeson which it is founded married women he poiated out would have a vote under the bill women would demand a seat in parliamentand peeresses a seat in the other house he protested especiauy against the increased undue influence which would then be given to menfor instance clergymen anid canvassersand expressed the regret with which he had listened to mr glad totzs speech the inost powerful arguments against the bill he pointed out were such as most men would shrink from urging but he dilated with much force and energy on the objections to placing women in a position not ordained for them by naturemir newdegats also opposed the bill which in tome way or other he made out would facilitate themachinations of the jesuits andi on a division the bill was thrown out by  to the fires bill was read a second time and there was a short conversation on mr mmauons local legislation ireland bill which ended in its ad journment for a mouthseveral other bills were forwarded a stage and the house adjourned at a few minutes before  oclock
