faseating government mr reald amp suggestedi the alteration of the words repeal of the mnalttax to  modification of the malttax as he feared the community would have to wait a long timeo for a repeal as repealors howvever they ought to protest aggainst the bill for instead of preventing any monopoly in the sale of beer it would create a monopoly under which it would be imnpossible to have a cheap drink retailed to the labouring man an amendment was moved aiflirmsing that tliecham ber believed that mtr bruces licensing bill was capable of improvement in passing throughi comnmittee of the house
