ithe comimune and the siegethe following appeared in oir second eaiton ot yesterday n gtfromt our special coitrstondsnparis maiy the commune are much troubled by the pro voking ealmness of the verailes party their ovn actions and method of procedure will so little bear tho light of calm discussion that every kind of means is pursued to amuse the public and keep up a salutary condition of excitement flaming placards cover the walls dilating upon tho assas sination of sundry national guards who are sup posed to have surrendered as prisoners of war and to have been murdered in cold blood i remarked this morningthat some lover of truth had taken the trouble to walk from street to street and scrawlc mensoige across the printed account and it is not improbable that so scandaloas a want of respect towards the communiie will cau forth animadversions and indignant protests in the qfflcied of tomorrow cluserets arrest produced a feeling of curiosity rather thaii of surprise nve have learnt to realize the fact that our re ptublic aims at spartan institutionsthat failure is surely followed by disgrace that disgrace is only the precursor of imnprisoniment the government is bound to feed the public with highlyspiced dishes and the question now is where to find suffi cient spice properly to leaven the mass  after lullier bergeret after bergeret cluseret a committee of public safety has this day been orga nized under the auspices of araud vleillet ran vier gerardin and felix pyat and ive kniow that the establishment of such a coummittee must carry with it the frequent arrest of generalsinlhief there was a rumour about the boulevards last night that dombrowski and his stafl had been arraigned before the tribunal of the htel de ville to answer for their acts and no one was the least astonished or thought the fact improbable a slight feeling of dis satisfaction only being apparent at the continued secrecy of the acts of the ruling body the national convention of  coasidered itself trammelled to a certain extent by the wishes of the sovereign people supposing dumouriez or custine to have been arrested it was thought necessary to bring forward some kind of accusation at least against the pri soner but the march of civilization has shown such details to be superlluous those men who pulled the strings of public affairs during the terror were bound to act somewvhat in the light of day in contrast to the system of leftses de cachet which preceded them  but the commune of  has no more analogy with the commune of  thanthe gathering of the jeu de jaitme has with the assembly at present sitting at versailles the actions of ultrapolitical bodies have ever run a risk of becoming ridiculotus un less accompanied by a judlicious admixture of the terrible there is a depressing wanit of a tragic element about the government wvhich now reigns supreme it isf impossible to thrill the public mind to a satisfactory degree on the subject of timo numerous arrests when we know that the state prisoner consigned to miazas or the conciergerie with a certain pomp will ia a few days creep out ofthe back door and quietly reassumo his position upon the official bench bergeret was seized and thrown into a dungeon tlere to meditate over his supposed crimes with a mysterious something hang ing over him which might mean cayenne or even death a few days later a huimble paragr ph in a dark corner of tha qfficiel informed us of his release no specific charge having been brought against him and a couple of days more saw him reestablished in the exercise of important functions reeking little of the cloud which had momentarily obscured his brilliancy wvithout some shadow of a scaffold or rattle of a tumbril it is impossible for these too often repeated stageimpeachments to produce their effect and hue wesease to care whether cluseretbe arrested or uot numorous causeshis arrest he is supposed by some to have maui fested an intention of betraying the commune for a sum of money by others to have shown a want of energy the real fact being probably that the recent failure at issy demanded a victim and that the best victim was tho minister of wvar it appears that two nights ago the fort of issy was ou the point of being surrendered to the soldiers of versailles  thlat in consequence oe the persistency of the late bombardment midgy the commandant had displayed symptoms of a desire to leave the mass of ruins to its fate wlhen general wroblewski appeared upon the scene iu time to relieve udgy of his command and to give orders for the rapid mounting of a few guns on the high grounld behind the fort to atnswer the batteries of chatillon and basmeudon wroblewski exas perated at what he was pleased to call an act of treachery threatened to resign his com mand if the important ground of issy were not immediately confided to trsusty hands general eudes was thereupon established as com mandant of thie fortwbich has in reality ceased to
