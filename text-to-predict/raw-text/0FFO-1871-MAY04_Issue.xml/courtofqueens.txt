cotusel for the company relied chiefly on tho deci sions of tho house of lords in two cases in the last of which the case of  brand v tho hammersmith railway comipany in  thea claim for compensation was for injuries canoedi to hiouses by vibration resulting from the use of the railway and all the judges except mr justice blackburn were in favour of the claim  and in each cape in a house composed of three law lords one law lord lord cairns in the o uue case lord estbury in the other concurred with the judges hut the other two law lords lord chelimsford and lord colonsay were of a different

way in which it was possible to in terpret the lauguage usedt by the majority of the house of lordts consistently with the terms of the statutes was by sup posing their meaning to hsaye been that thinugs which were merely incidental to the land or property taken or injumiously affected were not the subject of comn pensation h ut ins the present instance the court bad not to deal with anything
