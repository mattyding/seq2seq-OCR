gave notice on the th tiltthat the board without waiting for the completion oftho inquiries into the efficiency of the existing sohoolz andi into the social and religious condition of the whole of the metropol s do undertake forthwith the establishment of a limte number of schools in various districts of the town where the deficiency is already ascertained to be great and where there is no doubt that large provision for public elementarv educatiob must hereafter be made by the board that the statistical inquiries committee be requested at once to recommend to the board ten or more distrlcts which appear to the committee to be suitable for such immediate action that application be made to the education depart ment to send the necessary requisition to this board to establish schools in the districts thus recommendedhe pointed out that if the board waited until all the infor matbon which it sought was in its hands it would have to wait a loug time while the difficulties with which it would have to deal would be iucreased by the delay besides he did not think that the collectors of information regarding the social aud religious condition of the metropolis should be hurriej for as londo was not under one municipality and had not beeu dealt with as a w hole before the infornia tion to be obtained would be of a most valuable cha racter and he protested against its being hurried the information in tive divisios had been tabulatedthe city chelsea southwark wvestmiesterand fiosbary and he enumerated somo of the facts elicited to show the neces sity for more school accommodation in chelsea the popu lation was about t the children between the ages of three and  were  there were  schools  of which were private adventures providing accommodatiou for l leainog  children to be provided for in faosbury accommodation was needed for  chsldrenin southwark  were without schools ia these places he said there would be little difficulty in find ing spots on which to erect schools as the necesity was apparent and he was anxious that the board should at once proceed to face this wvork for it would be far better for the members of the board to begin to do the work with a few schools than to wait until they were over burdeued with tasks with a ligiter task before thent to commence witb the board would be able to solve a great many difficult problems which beset them in theory whio they debated at that board but which would he believed disappear when they were practically at worr qeardr barry seconded the motion and referred to the criticism to which the board hail been exposed from its iuppboed want of action earlier he said some ofhi colleagues had felt tiis criticism but though he had mumh respect for public opiuion he con fessed he cared little for grumbling which was unjust end he held that it was better for the board to bave delibe rated at commencing than to have rushed on to some false path he considered the motion proposed by lord sandon to be what the board wanted by indicating the means by which the board could proceed toutatively and he was ex aeedingly anxious the board should so proceed he had no doubt the education department would assist the board and the board had every prospect of their assistance for the department had nuot been found tied up in red tapeas many had expected to find itmr green suggested that the first paragraph of the motion should be withdrawnthe rev wyx rogers sunported the motion as it stood nud strougly urged that the iboard should at once commence with schools of its own and these be maittained shoudd be model schools for the whole of the metropolis he hoped to see these mnodel schools swallow up many of those schools which were doing a  very mild sort of work the boardshould at once set itself to do this work and do it without  any finessemr w hf satarrr alp saw in the proposal the means of grappling with great difliculties and he agreed with lord saudon in tho general views he expressed that in thus cona lnenciag its work the board would be lightening its labonrc in the futuroprofessor huxley argued that as the returns had not been made it could not be said the deficiency was ascertained to be great and he supportedl lr greeni in asking for tho withdrawal of the first clauseur gover held that there was sufficieut inforauztiou before the board to show that the children were in the streets for the want of schools and the board could very weu go on with the work of preparing a comprehensive sys tem based on the information it would receive from its oeusus at the same time that it was providing to some ex tent for the crying wants of our population he urged that both works could very well go on togethermr scrutton supported bis greens suggestion for the omission of the first clause of the msolion and mr hep nvorth dxxox supported the motion as it stoodthe debate was continued and at last the motion was carfied entire with a few verbal alterations such as  pro viding  in place of  establishment and  localities  for  districts alterations to which some members seemed to attach grave importancea letter signed by sir f sandford from the lords of the council was read expressing their lordships pleasure at re ceiving the information that this board had obtaiaed the returns and giving the powers asked for in a resolution some w eeks ago to collect other lformation their lord
