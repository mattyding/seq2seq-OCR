wvith them remains unchanged but thle difficulties of such co operation are vitally increased and it ran only continue possible by the associations giving assurances in word and in deed which wouldi not have been thought necessary a short timne since of strict impartiality between the different parties in the churelh in the meanwhile these who are like myself distressed at recent occurrences will in all prbbltrather seek to do our duty to the church of england by wiork in her behalf which weill not compel us to share the responsibility of any public body than in active cooperation with such
