canterbury to nppoint a company to rnake a revision of tho authorized version of the scrip tures and he having joined that company made bis first visit to the bible societys noblo hlildings he then looked ahout hib and he felt that after having taken so responsible a step as lie had described it was hardly right that he shoulmi much longer be a stranger there but that lio should become a friend
