billon the order of the day for the second reading of this mr jacob brighlt observed that wrhen the question of the removal of the electoral disabiltiis de wromen was first broacht before the house in  it was regalrded with feelings of curiosity and probably most of those who re mained to hear the debate did so in the expectation that they wrould get souse amusement froms it when the bill ofwhich he was about to move the second reading was last year submisitted to the house its opponents somewlhat under estimated the amount of parliamentar support it would receive tney had no idea that in a house of betveen  and  it would be read a second time by a considerable majority sach however was the fact and when it was borne in miud in connexion rrith that fact that tnere wero  members of the present parliament who had at one time or aniother given their sanctiona to the principle of the bill he thosght he might state that they now approached the iiscussien of it with a feeling that they had a subject beforo themu as serious and import ant as any which had ever occupied the attention of the house or country he had no mneans of knowing whether the erouse would read the bill a second time today but if he might judge of the future by the past ho ould say if they did not read it a second time today they wouuld do so at no distant perod whatever measures had been gene rally supported by the lfge parlisinentary boroughs bad found tr eir way to the statutebook tbhe nreat toewna haa recently decdeod in favour ef household anirage for me sandathey hald now decidedl not with entire unnmiy bwith a remarkable approach to it in favour of this bill for giving househild suffrage throughout the country without any distinction of sex edinburgh andl birmingham leeds and brighton oldhsam and siheffield halifax and bolton had given an undivided vote in favour of the bill he would not go into the general question of unequal legislation as between mean and women he believedl the house pretty woll understood the whole subject womena asked for the parlisamentazr suffrage because they bore in common with men the bardens of the state and because they believed they had a constitutional right to influence the making of the laws which they had to obey the great and oppressive inequalities in the laws as between the sexes sup lied them with a practical meotive of the very strongest kin to endeavour to obtain the franchise from a know ledge of the fact that only these who coutld influenuce theleisative body had any chance of getting their grievances redressed two recent cases might be quoted as illetstrating the state of the law between mant and woman one was the case of a grandchildl of lord mountcashella child taken away from the guardianship of its mothecr by its father the case was most severely commentedl onsby thejudge andthe coutrt would have liked to give a decision entirely opposed to that it gave he did not say that the child instead of being the propcrty of the father should be the property of the mother but in a matter of this kidnd there should be some jnst decision anti if there was any choice certaiinly the child shiouldl go to that parent wrho would beat do a parents duty by it another case came before the courts the other day and the question was whether in this free countriy a widow had any right to bring up her child in the religion she professedl the father was a roman catholic he mother a protestant and the child was eight years of age the father had left no instructions as to the rligioniwhich the child shouldi be trained  but the relatives of the dead fathe absolutely coetroiledl the mother who was obliged to have her child brought up in the roman catholic religion althoughi she herself enitirely disbelieved it women had discovered that whenever a class ofpesn hitherto debarred froim the houtse were adite witn the political pale a very decided change soon occurred in the legislation affectiimgthem until working men got votes the house had looked with considerable euspicion on trades uniions and wvouldi gladly have suppressed them but naow they had legislated for them in a spirit of justice and pro bably even of geserosity he did not believe this change was owing to the fact that working meon could now meet them at thei pollingbooth and there assert their powers ho attributed it to a much better motive when working raen were enflanchised the house had beeni compelled to look at every question wvhich affected them andl wvere likely there fore to arrive at more truthful and just decisions if womnen bad the franchise the house would get to knew theiroiions and feelis and leislation affecting them would be mnore successfu had hecy possessedi the franchise would the womens property bill have met the fate it dide it passed thathrouse and reached the other chamnberwhere the voice of justice was not always heard unless its de mands wvere in harmony with the supposed interests of those who assembled there what was done with it the peers destroyed the bill and created another duiring that process the government so far as he recollected were in active anid did skot lend the slightest assistance to the ad mirable bill sent upby that house he did not blame the government they were overweighted with business having three timnes mere on their bands than they could possibly get through they must chioose what measures they could gvattention to and must do the work of their mastersthese owlho made andclould unmake them to sup pose they could give attention to the interests of the un enfranchiised was to isuppose what was impossible that bill came back with the principle knocked out of ita thing ofahrede and patohes very good for the lawyers but very difficult for any one else to understand and to this hour iconfiscation of property at marriage was the law affecting womnenin thiscountry the goverrnment had been obliged to take up the suxbject of university tests especiatlly duiring the last two secasinos the object being not to enable non conformists to obtain an academrical education but to enable them to enjoy certain emoluments they could not otherwise reach  butt how svas it with women  a struggle was going on amnong women for a higher education at ediniburgh uni versity some halfdozen yosng womaen of great ability high chsracterand industry desired to become quaulfed asmedical practitionersnot seeking emoluments and houours but simaply thie edlucation which suchinstitutions were supposed to give  but nobody came down to that house for their relief  no great parts was set in motion the government was silent while halfadozen women were heroically fighting their own battle against a highclass trades union in that city hear hear in the course of the discussion on the bil for legalizinig marriage with a deceased wifes sister several hon mensbers referred to what was said to be the opinion women entertained of that measure the hon member for boston mr collins had readl a passage fromi thle phines suffrage joeusnufl to show this that journal though conducted by a woman was as ably conducted as any journal in the kingdom hear hear and maore than any other paper represented the feelings of women wotmen were not satisfied with that sortl of irregular repro sentatiodl in this house what they said was that if their opinions were of alny value if their condition was to be studied at al they ought to express their riews by the consituiona mehodlthrouhs the pollingbooth precisely as men did with a conscieujions desire to lessen infanti cide the hon member for slalfordl mr charley had in troduced the infant life preservation buil if it affected any one it affected women and it was natural they should consider it these women suffrage societies were becomning viglance committees whichx watched the ltislation of the house with regard to women they agreed with the hon mermber for salfordi in hs object but they differedl from him in regart to the means by which he pro posed to attain it they had presented a memorial to the home secretary against the bill and they had sent it to every memnber was it not of some use to hon members to see the criticisms of women upon the bill and if it were was not their demand a reasonable oue that they should be allowed to expisess their opinions at the pollinobooth  if political disabilities ought to exist at all it woufad be more fair to place them on men than on women  if either men or women should he without votes it ought to be men  anid his reason for that opinion was that men had ten timues the maeans of influencing the legislature of coy country apart altogether fromnvotes they had physical strength combative qualities opportn nities of meeting and the almost entire control of the press the platform and the pulpit  they were the masters of all the great professions in this country they liad the com mand of the puxrse and when all tlhese things wereo con sidered it appeared to him that hon members sitting on that side of the house who had always been so favour of representation couldl hardly enter the lobby to vote against this bill without feelings of discomfort alnmost akin to shame among those who opposed the bill last session were the right hon member for kilmarnock mr bouverie the noble lord the member for haddington shiire lord eleho and the hon member for north war wiokshire alr newvdegato and if he couldi have selected his opponents he would have picked outt these three mecm bers who so far as he kcnew had never lifted a hand to im prove the political position of any human being the noble lord and he thought the right hon member for kilmar nockwere conspicuous figuresin that motley group whiobhiits miserable discontent at ene time betook itself to the cave of adullam mi bouverie was utnderstood to deny that he was one of thie party referred to these men hathe unhappy reputation of having tried to perpetuate the political degradation of their countrymen but they were sin lly reeated from the names of his oppsonents lie sihouldl expect that they would bring forwara arguments drawn from prejudice rather than fromn reason  and ho foond that the arguments whichi dii service a few years ago in opposition to the extension of the fran chise were disinterred as it was said that men did not want the franchise and rmen were prodluced who did not want it so with respect to women now  but during this session there had been presented to parliamnent in favour of the bill  petitions to which oco signa tures were attached  and ifl meetings of varying charac ter but many of them crowded bad been heldl in support of it in the united kindeom h ut mainly in scotland andengland it was saidl that the franchiseo would be a curseto women  hut it might be assumed that women were the best judiges of that and there had recently been presentedl to the prime minister a memnorial in support of the bill signed by womnen and beaded by the names offlorence nightingale harriet martineao miss carpenter and seve ral ladies of title he now came to the pedlestal or pin nacle argument which was that women stood in too high it position to be subjected to the dirt and mire of politieshxt everyein in this worldi had its hater sideincluding reli gion literature and art and we did not attempt to exclude women from them on that account those who uised this pin cadsl were niemberda of aristocratic famiilies and belonged to that privileged order in which women stood on highsoial pinnacles hut he advocated the cause of womea who did not stand on auylpinnacle whatever the cause of those who less powerfully sarmed by laature than man and lees fa voured bv law had to do the rough work of the world in the face f obstacles more formaidable than ever beset the pathi of man he did not underrate the importance of adding  or  per cent to the constituency but what he regarded as serious was thoe aeglect of this demand for en franhisment because parliament could not legislate suic cessfullv for a community with so largo a portion of whiceh it had no relation if the bill passed no demand for a dis soluttion would come fromn women who woild know that from that time the questions in which they were con cerned would assume a different aspect because they would have votes at the next election the present govern ment in its first session enabled women to vote at municipal elections  an enwinent meioiber observed to him at the time  that vote means the otlher and the public had maaslu their minds that it did last session wvomen were enableg to vote for members of school beards iand to be membersofthem too as they were in several places as womenknown to them and as thley had been encouraged to present thomeelves to omstitueucies it appeared to impossible for a government wnhich had gone so far to justify itself in preventing women froin voting onice in four or five years atparliamentary elections last year the government being neutral on this questioo the elouse passedi the acoosa reading of the bill bye large majority andl then there came over the scene a remarkable change which he naever could understand  buxt there was al panic and in a state of pause men ulways saw that which did not exist there was set to work machinery whichx moore than once he bad seen employed to upse just deci sions  and on that occasion this result wras achieved he cared very little abouit the partyaspects of this bill but if as was alleged the political power of women wouldl be con servative it was a question for the grave consideration of the government whether they would make it maorei con servative by promoting its closer alliance witk the conservas livepry last year the home secretary did not conceal hutrahe attempted to avow that if hoe had been left un fettered he wvould have voted for it the solicitorgeneral votedfor the bill and had spmoken warmly in its favour be fore his constituency the sohcitorgeneral forlirclaudvoted for it and the secretary of the poor law beard was asup porter of it the secretary to the admiralty votedafor mr ti resolution in favouirof the enfrancbisementof women thereowere other members of the government whohad niever availed themselves of any opportusnity of voting against thebill the attorneygeneral had not done so theo vicepresident of the coune cihwho hadl admitted women to the mxembership of school boards woulid hardly be likely to  so  the undersecreitary at the hoos ofice cuta theseoretary to the treasury had not voted against it and without inferring tbat all these were in favour of the bill he must conolude that there was something favourably sus picious in tho fact that they had not voted against it the great principle of the liberal party was that taxation and repreentation should go together aad with so many mem ber of the government favourable to the bill and others not hostile to it it would not be a very unlikely thing that they should on this occasion leave this an open qoestion and allow the house to dispose of it free from their induence parliament had made tho homo tho political nits do not etit maintaindisabilities inthosehousesbereft of the father and where the support to be derived from thepresence of manwas not tobo found cheers the hon member concluded by moving that the bill be read asecond timemr eastwick in seconding the motion said that he had no opportuniy of speaking last yer although his name was then as now on the back of the bill he was surprised at the extreme and even dangerous importance which some attached to the enfranchisement of the compa ratively few womea who possessed the qualifications which entitled men to vote and whose claims hadl not been voluntarily sarrondered by marriage our com mon law looked upon husband and wife as one and we might therefore set aside all married women even those who enjoyed the income of property settled on them selves withont the intervention of trustees if we did so and also eliminated all womnen except unmarried house holders and lodgers qualified as males were required to be and took the remainder only the number of female voters placed on the list according to the besi information he could obtain would not equal onefifth of the number of voters added by the last weform bill the peril of this addition if there were any was still further diminished by the fact that women were not turbulent corrupt and revolutionary like men and that any changes they might introduce would be of the mildest and most beneficial character if the passing of this bill were to involve a disso lution we might as well have one about the encroachments on the thamesembankment the enfranchisementof women did not involve their entering parliament for the clergy possessed the suffrage but could not sit in parliament and had never agitated for the privilege as to tho enfran chisement of a small minority of women altering the cha racter of the whole sex with au respect for the speaker whothe force of folly could no further gowhat physiological or psychological alterations had the ex tension of the saffrage made in men thousauds were indifferent about tho possession and use of their privilege and many women would be as indifferent though more con scientious perhaps than many men when they did vote themanicipalanatieeducational franchise had doaenothin to detract from the feminine softness of womenor to disturb their rle in lifes great drama as wives and mothers women meddled neither more nor less in politics than they did in tho days of margaret of anjou of queen elizabetb or of those contests when a beautiful duchess canvassed for charles james foxe some few high spirits entered the political arena then as they mizhb do now but the vast majorty eontented themselves with elevatin and depress ing their eyebrows as the roman ladies didtheir thumbs for or against the combatants  and so he thought things would remain the question arose if the measure were likely to be so inoperative why press it at all  the aoswer was that it completed the representation of property and of intoluigence the intelligent views of women were no more to be ksrezrdod than those of moen  and as it was our coustitutional theory that property ought to be repre sented there was no reasoa why it should not be represented when it was in the bands of women who discharged the duties connected with it and were therefore entitled to its privileges women ought to have such a political status as to enable them to obtain an equal share of educational eudowment and other social advantages which were at present denied them the lion member for sheffield last year spoke of many women as being but fair savages  the reason was that the unfair savages men took the hons share of education  aed the same unfairness pre tailedio other matters to imply the inferiority of womuen by withholding from them the suffrage was detrimental to their character whether that inferiority be or be not wholly and absolutely true and an illustration of this was to be found in the results of the policy of the spaniards towards the indians in america the popular prejudices as to the inferiorityof the indianewere uanintentionally but effectually favoured said a distinguished french traveller by ordi nances speaking of themn and providing for them as minors long habituated to contempt and pity they came to regard themselves as inferior beings  and their selfrespect could be restored only through a series of efforts as prolonged as those which had humbled them had been continuous for these reasons he supported this bill but he also thought there was a special roason why this country should be the first to adopt the enfranchisement of women that reason was the immense influence which the example of england must exert upoa the  millions of asiaties in india among whom with a few brilliant exceptions woman had been degradod to a state little better than slavory low could we expect that indian women would be emancipated from the imprisonment of the zenanah or admitted to the full privileges of edaucation so long as we continued to pro claim the inferiority of women in this country  if for no other reason he should support this measure as a blow dealt at the slavery of women in the east and as a reply to the demand of the chinese government that schools for female education should be dissolved cheersmr bouverie apologized for intrading himself as an opponent of the measure and said he abstained from giving notice of opposition almost up to the last hour in the hope that some other member would come to the front he was unwilling to put himself forward in a matter which in terested a great number of his countrymen and country women but the house would do him the justice to admit that be had always had the courage of his opinionsa merit not always conspicuous in ministers or members the hon member for hdanchester who had been a comparatively short time in the house was not avware that he had ever supported a measure for the extension of the popular fran chiseand coupled his name with the names of those who put themselves in opposition to their party upon the reform act of s his lion friend the member for lianchester ought to have taken the trouble to ascertain what were the facts before he went out of his way to attack a gentleman sitting on the same side of the house if his hon friend had referred to the division lists he would have seen that he had always given his vote in favour of the extension of the franchise and though he eri ticized the bill of  his suggestions were accepted by the government hear hear but his hon friend raised a question of a different kind by the bill he had introdcued and argued as if it werh a mere complement to the measure he had himself passed two years ago contending that in logic the house of commons was bound to confer the parliamentary suffrage on women because it liad eutrested thens with the municipal fianchise ifor his own part he believed t
