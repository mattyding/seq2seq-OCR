provision in the rules of the fundit most be remembered that the manu who bed the right of dealing with the prticular fund had himself consti tuited i by his subscriptionis  it would be his to dispose of in any way he pleased except so far as he was restrained from doing this by the act of parliament and the rules lia lordship could not bring himself to doubt that the father having this fuind to dispose of for the benlefit of his children there being no restriction to chil dren living at his death bad made this provision bosi fide for the benefit of his daughter by procuring for her amarig and a marriage settlement he lied provdded for her benefit in the best way possible and in a way not con trary to the rules of the fund the court ought not to be alsked to find restrictions to prevent a mean who had created a fund from dealing with it as he thiought bestlord justiceo mellisr was of the same opinion it seemed clear to him that the whole object of the father in making the settlementwas to benefit the daughter then the questioa was had he power to do this under the words of the rules  the rule said that the money should be plidedor paid for the benefit of the children of the ent scribr  therefore it was not necessary that the money should lie actually paid into the hands of the person whowas to be benefited was not this really anl applicationof the mousy for
