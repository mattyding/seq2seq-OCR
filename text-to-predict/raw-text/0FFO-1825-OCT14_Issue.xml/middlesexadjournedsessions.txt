said there were many topics contiected witht the present case upoti which he might dwell and which would press very heavily upon the prosecutors but a�two of their ownwitnesses had negatived the alleged assault and as he had a host of witnesses to depose to the same effect he would not waste their time by entering upon them btit would confine himself to the question of the assault and upon that qeistion if any faith whatever was to be placed on the in sttactinns he had received he must say tbat the present was the most imputlent and unwarrantabc prosecution that had ever been brought

to the same fact bue the chairman intimated an opinion that it would not be necessary to examine them and mr barry therefore dedined ealling themmr allev in reply contended that he was entitled to their verdict as thepatrol were acting in obedience to the or ders which they had received he was willing to adniit that these orders were very improper for the liberty of the subject ought not tobe in the slightest degree encroaclhe upon and where theoffence was of a bailable kind bail ought to be imme diately granted buttlien great ahllvances ought to be iade tbr the conduct of gentlemen who tok uponthemaelves theirksome dutics of the nagistracy without receiving or expecting any remuneration for the same the hatuitan in summing up said the case involved circumstances which lie could not conscientiously pass by un noticed he would allow that when peaceofficers were act ing in the due execution of their ofice and for the purpose of uplholding order atid decorum they were justifiedl in calling for the assistance and support of any bystanders and this court would always tupport them in suci cases to the utmost by punishing those whb refused to aid theni but if instead of thus actingthey were guilty feany harshness or unnecessary se verity towardsany of ffis majestys subjects they must expect no countenance here as respected the statement that the ma gistrates would not
