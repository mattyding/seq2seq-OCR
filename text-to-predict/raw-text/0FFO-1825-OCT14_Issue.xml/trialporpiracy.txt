thec existing laws tue counsel for the prosegcution replied to this objection and thie court hiavinig deliberated thereon his ho nour the chiief justice delivered the following opinion  wle know that thie courts have long since disregarded the subtle grounids uponi which the old cases rested as to the competency of witnesses  that they have endeavoured as far as possible and consistently with existing authiorities to let the objcction goto thle ctodit rather than to the comipetency of a witnless we adopt this principle in its fullest extent anid convinced thiat it is both expedient and salutary as tending to the attainmnent of thle great ends of jusjtice  slhall proceed to considter the objection takeni to the conmpetency of this witness ile is a slave and it is contended that being a slave his testimony by the usage of the other courts of ja elicatuare in this island cannot be received this opinion was suipported by sobme position for which i in vain required that authority should be cited it was urged that by the practice of othecr courts such testimony is rejected as affectingthie remutest interest of any one who claimis to be free  bui tthis is tgoo broadly laid dowvn a mere claimi to freedom would niot be rufllcientthec party miust be actually free i well rememiber the case which has beeni cited for i presided itt the court of kings bench and conunmon pleas bno the occasion whlen the court rejettcd tileevidence of a free mian relating to a fact which occurred whilst he was in it state ofslavery and i hand the miisfortune to diafr from my learned associates upon that occasion  for i could not recon cite the principle withi any noation of ju�ticc or of reason that this mnan being free shiould he deemned by law competent as evidencee of a fact whiich occurred yesterday whereby the ilifi of a fellowvcreature might be taken away but being a slavethec tlay before hiis evidlence is to be rejected upon thie tmost trivial question of property belonging to a free nerson anid arisinig dutring the period of hisi servitudle wve hiave no latw whereby the evidencee of a slave is rendered inadmissible in re gvard to free persons in our couirtis of justice but it is the usasge of these courts and thierefore there is ll the force of the law to reject it  aind it mnay tius be accounted for swhen our courts were first established our slaves were savages from the coast of aft ica their want of reason and undermanding rendered them as the samec defiects would have renderedi any artier iniida nompetent as witnesses that objec tion arisinig front itieir barbarism has by the received opinion atidt the practice ofthje court been aittached ever since to thie servile conidition  altioughi by the progress of christianity anid of eomcquent civilization the forceof that objetcion lit weakened  and we now see that it is safe anti esqisdiett anid just that eachi an impediment to the investigation of truthi and justice shiould he remoevedunider thiose precautions sand safe guazds whichi the peculiar constitution of our society requires we at once adnilt that the unifornsand solemn decisioins of a court are binding uponi tbe practice of that court  but it may not be contended that teliy ate binding tipon any other milde pendlent court of judicalture it so hiappens that the com missioners now presiding are thie jutdges of the court of kings benchi andl commnon pleas where our minds are ha bitiiated to tte rejection of the evidence oif a slave as affecting in the remotest degree the interest of a free person but it has been the pleasure ofhis majesty to name other persons as liia commissioniers who are strangers to the colony to its courts anid its customst to whomi the praetice of another court which practice is a deptirtose from the grand principles that governi the rules of evidence as bintding uipon this must have appeeared as tiideed it does to mne a very strong attempt to invade their reason and thecir judigmenit i will also put a casec niot so happilyindecdas it has been put by the attorneyv general but still disposing of the question under the atutlto rityo this commission thec couirt can assemble only in this islind but it miglit have beers the pleasure of his mta jesty to autlhorize the commissioners to hiold the court in other islands alsoin dommiesc for instanice in dommiesc thie evidence of slaves under certain regulations is admitted as affecting tfree persons in thleir common law courts is this court titen to shift its practice according to thec shifteing laws and usages of the several islands  surely wqe must be governed by one prevailing comprehensible siysteni founded pon the law of the realtis of england but it has been said in argumetit that the word slave is unkniown to the law of england i ain not preparedl to adnmit that it was not only known to the law of england but was also visited with thie disabilities of the servile condition  but asinong these disabili ties we do not fincl his incompetency as a witniess in d bkickrones commentaries we finid thiat the slave or bondlm man not being liber et legcilis tonom was not alloiwed to sit on juriesbut we search in vain
