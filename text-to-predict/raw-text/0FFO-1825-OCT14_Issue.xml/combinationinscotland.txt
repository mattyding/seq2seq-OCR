combiaationi n scotlandfrom thc giqor chronicle the operations of the only combination in the west of scot land that has gained any tempornay benefit by their exclusive measures have at length reached a climax wc havc mnore than once expressed an opinion that the operations of the combined colliers woul soon bring the house about tbeir ears tht central government that sit at westmuir having deemed it proper to issue a decree to the various colliers within their jurisdiction to mnake a fresh demand of an addlitional d per cart of coals the operative colliers of the pits on the banks of the iilonkland canal immncliately set about fulfilling thc instructionrs of the frand committee emboldened by suc cess against ilr danlop the leaders seemed never to have dreamed of any other oppositicoi to their legislative mandlates fortunately however they hati to encoiniter men of ecidtled energy and public spirit the messrs dixons of calder iron works tkese gentlemen set the arrogant or tiers of the rmock committee at lefiance and when the unrea soable demand was muade upon them they warned cverv col lier in their employ wio was dissatisfietd with their raesent ternms to quit the works iunlsater tihe colliers beloniging to thiree of the coalworks were so prudent to withdraw their de nmands  but the colliers who work at thecoalpits at the vil lagc of faskine having been so infatuated as to persevere in ondeavouring to carry into ecet the injunctions issued from headquarters their employers proceeded to eject every one of them and their families from the houses thev occupied in the village and following the exaimple of the duke tf lhamilton they wiselyresolvedto replace them by new workimenlast woek presented a singulqrscencat the village there was a complete rooling outof the combined and nothing was to beseen btttthe packing up offiurniturc and te removaloffaniilies thisbeauti ful and roman tic spot truly represcnted the picture of th cdesert ed village and many were the regrets of tu poor wives and children at leaving so pleasant a residence and so good em ployers the ecenle washowever soon changed the labourers on the banks of the monkland canal anti at the iten wlrorks seizzd the opportunity ot breaking in upon the combination and this deserving and excluded classinimediately volunteered to occupy the places of the refractory colliers for their pro tection a strong body of men were procured from glaseow and the neighbourhoodl they re principally men who have been in the armytg and have served in thte peninsular campaigns and are of the most determined hravery nd courage they went up osaturday and have since been judiciously stationed round the country the he neighbourhood of ihe coalworks they patrolc ight nd day anit on the icant alarm they can all bear upon one point they have got one of the houses in the village converted into a guardroom they have a fine assortment of lirearrms and it was a novel sight to meet with heroes who had fought at waterloo vittoria or scaled the walls of san sebastian and badajoz quite busy preparing ball cartridgex and all the necessary preparations of war for the protection of the peaeceful workmen as the coal pits are situated close to the canal it is apprelrended that the colliers might attempt to cut tue banks and thus deluge the pits with water and drown the new workmen these places are therefbre particularly well guarded anrd if seccssarv ar rangements are matde for bringing the dragoons in a fewn mi nutes from liamilton the nev workmrn and their familiesi are fast pouring into the villaite

fortunately although tlilcitshad eon closed the mlessrs dixonls hatd suth a sisck of coal ancl itontone as placed them beyond the power of the combina tion these gentlemen deserve the greatest praise for their meritorious efforts to break down a confeseracy which is doing infinite mnischief to the best interests of the country the men employed at the iron works are quite enthusiastic in speak ing of the kindness of their enoloyers the discharged col liers were only allowed by the comittee to work four days in the weekthecy durst not patt out more coals than what amounted to five shillings a
