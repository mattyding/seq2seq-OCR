jaaicarom the royazl gale of the th novtoa thursday milr hamilton brown in offering the bill to repeal the ltegistry act considered it a duty he owed to every individual in the island for even when it paissed in the whtei island with one voice exclaimed against it it was a most expensive obnoxious and oppressive measure without being of the slightest utility the hon member who at the time opposed it prophesied what would be the result and which vas now come to pass the house had been sedticed into the measure by the hypocritical pro mises fromh home that no further interference was contemplated by governmenit in our local condition and he would show that go vernment did give such a pledge by stating that a registration not emancipation of slaves vwas their only object and the island there fore passed the bill as apeaceoffering butthatpledgehad not been kept and thereforetbe assembly would be fully justified in repeal ing this bill thc hon member then read frqnm the message of his grace the governor to the house in  the following passagehis grace has been further instructed to declare it is not the emanlcipation but simply the registration of the slaves which is now suggested and to disclaim any intention on the part of his alajes tys governmsent thereby to propose their emancipation this ex planation has become the more necessary as great industry baseeri exertedand which could only have proceeded from ignore or mis chievous misrepresentations to blend these objects together and it is fit that the pleasure of the prince regent acting in the name and on the behalf of his mlajesty should not be misunderstood on so es sential a pointnow aix speaker that was the soletan pledge that was given that no other measures regarding our slave population sbould be agitated in the imperial parliament by the discussions which have rcenay taken place iii parliament they have forfeited that pledge and we are absolved fromanylonger continuing this obnox ious and useless billthe hon cinmber thern adverted to the hypocritical mneans re sorted to by mr wilberforce to get the measures cartied in the co lonies by making the slave trade the cloak to cover his real in tendons but he had now shown his cloven foot and it therefore be hoved the house to defeat if possible his iniquitous designs and the first step should be to getrid of this troablesome bill which cost the country  every thitrd year and was utterly useless for there never had been a single negro imported iato the island since the abolition he hoped the house would remoisttae against the proceedings at home with spirit and firmnness he hoped indeed that though the island was a small body it would show on this oc casion that it possessed a great soul cries of  hear him hear himmlr blyth made some comments on the biu which was sent from england and said that the registry bil was the most obnoxious act that ever had passed that house and he hoped it would be repealedmlr whitfield hoped the proposed bill would pass the house una niinouslythey had had now  years experience of it and had found it a most oppressive act it would never have been carried in that house but for the pledge given by his mlajestys mlinisters that they would not in future interfere in our internal concerns that pledge they had broken and the house was no longer bound to continue the registry bil the honourable member said it would be unne cessary for him to take up the time of the house on a measure the policy of which was so very obvious it could no longer be ques tioned from the conduct pursued by the fanatical party at home that they meditated the destruction of these islands shall we then assist in such destruction by adopting measures attempted to be forced upon us through their instrumentality hie hoped not and should yote for the billmr hyslop followedon the same side and observed that the registry bill was forced on the island under the idea that the slave trade was stiu carried on after urging other topics in sup port of the bill he concluded by giving it his cordial supportthe bill was then presented read a first time and ordered to be read a second time tomorrowthe following remarks on this subject are extracted from the jamaica journal of the th of novemberwe heartly congratulate the country on the change in our pro spects in respect not only to this offensive law but to the general system of our politics the repeal of the registry act or which amuntas to the same thing the refusal of the house to pay its at tendant expenses wiu convince muinisters if they are to be con vinced by human agency that although we may bend a little yet there is a spirst a heart in jamaica that not only dares to stop whenits enemy foolishly imagines that he has vanquished resistance but that can also rally and become the assailant and will back the ground it had lost the registry act was a concession to the british parliament granted upon certain conditions those con ditions have been violated and parhiament wil now be tanght that good faith must be kept with us as well as with other contracting parties and that we are not quite silly enough to be their dupes although we may not be strong enough to resist their bayonetsve wiulay before our readers in a few words the circumstances under which the registry act was passed the abolition of the slave trade after a long struggle was made the law of the empire the colonial legislatures consented to pass acts inflicting the penal ties of fdlony on traders in slares but the abolitionists had been too long accustomed to a single topic to change it readily for another and indeed they liad a natural afiection for that line of action and thoughlt which had gained their celebrity and away from which they were extremely ignorant and totaly insignificant ino wonder that they continue to harp on the same string and that their fertilefanciesfertile only in poisonous weedssaw a slave ship in every vessel that sailed the ocean and a receptale for slaves in every creek and inlet in the west indies  our labours said they  is incouipletewhile there remains the mnstremote possibility of the planters hiding among their old gangs new importations of slaves once put on shore there are no means of detecting the crime or of bringing to punishment these menstealers negroes are or may be landed in a corner hurried up the country divided amongst the estates and thus the slave trade be kept alive in spite of the prohibition of parliament it was in vain that the colonial laws in aid of the abolition law were referred to they were denied to be efficient and their framers were insulted by the insolent denial of the integrity in which they had framedi them in reply to the fears cxpressed by the wvest indisns that emancipation was tde ultimate object of the friends of africa it was repeatedly and confidently asserted that complete abolition was their sole end and aim that they conceived all the evils in the islands to be caused and perpetuated byperiodical importations of negroes and that should such fresh importations be effectually stopped all the restumight safely be left to the colonial authorities and to the slow but sure march of civilization the british parliament had passed the abolition law almost unanimously the excitement was still alive and it was to be feared that the parliament in the fervour of their philanthropy would not refuse to overstep the con stitutional boundariesof their powerif urged by our enemies to such ameasureasbeing absolutelynecessary to complete and perfect their work the dread itselfof the interference of the british par iiament gave that interference full effect our assembly preferred to yield to alr stephens reasons for a registry of slaves rather than to the authority of the imperial government ourassembly found less degradation in submitting to the dictation of a igaersblspam phleteer tlran in waieingthe interposition of parliament which per haps never would have been attempted that mr wilberforce and mir macaulay and mr buxton and mr stephen and the noble earl bathurst will rage and storm when they hear of our legisla tive proceedings that they will call us all the bad names the abo lition lexicon can supply tbenm with we think we have good reasons for expecting but that they will enlist the commons and the lords of great britain in their preposterous quarrelwe have no fear and even if they do our rights are so fenced round by immemorial custom and positive lawand above all by the plainest policy that not a breach nor an unguarded posture lddl be found whereby to intro dluec their eursed elensents of confusion so long as the house of as sesably are faithful to their trust
