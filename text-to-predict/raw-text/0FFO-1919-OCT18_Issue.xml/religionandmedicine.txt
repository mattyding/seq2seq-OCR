e  o m e dcnereligion and medicinespiritual healingwaomf a co i swondsntst luke the beloved physician is commemo rated in the churchs calendar today he has always claimedi the homage and affection of christendom for the pecial grace of his writings while the title conferred on him by his greatest patient the beloved physician has beenendorsed by the humblest reader of the new testament iledical men have held him in special honour as their patron saint and as a correspondent recently reminded us in the columns of the times there is a guild of st luke onsisting of medical nen and women which has its annual service in st pauls cathedral on his festival or on a day as near to itas circumstances allow this commemo ration of the evangelist and physician by nedical practitioners suggests several thoughtsit may remind us of the intimate connexion between that which is physical and that which is piritual iihumnan life spirit soul and body describe the tripartite nature of man each is necessary to the fullness of his man hoods powers we need not be concerned to discuss theexactness of the distinctions which are madeinthis descriptionofmans nature and instead we arecontentto speak simply of his body and soul butone thing is clear there is so intimate i connexion betweenthe psychical and physical in man and their mutual influence is so constant that they can never attain their full vigour if either fails in its true functions it therefore becomes absurd as florence nightingale once pointed out in a letter addressed to benjamin jowett to con sider man either as a body to be  improved or as a soulto be improved  separatelyif we accept this account of man i a mate rialistic theory of human life must give way to a larger conception of its meaning and pur pose men have their part in two worlds and they possess capacities which make them at home in both yet body and soul may not be conceived as separate faulties moving in different spheres and with rio relation to each other they are intimately connected inter penetrating each other moulding and affectinig eachother with unremitting persistenbe it is impossible to speak of their frontiers they cannot be separated from each other body is nt more espential than spiiit inour concep tion of a man and his i cfe h histianity has always insisted on this truth recent years however there have been attempts to make this association the bn of claims which cannot be admitted without care ful examination what is known as spirital healing is acqurnngincreasing prominence in certain circles it is a revival of a cult which has had great influence inthe past many claim that christianity gives it a new sanction and supplies new powers for its exercise gifta of healing  are mentioned in the new testament and we are told that they were exercised to the great gain of the faithful but it is difficult to be certain what these gifts were they aredescried by men whose scientific knowledge was slight and who had no pretence to that accuracy of observation which isdemanded in a true diagnosis or in describing the processes of recovery from disease we may readily accept their testimrony that many people re covered from sickness and were rostoted to com plete health through the piower of the spirit which came  without measure to believers in those days of courageous faith and eager hope but in no sceptical spirit the suggestion is made that mapy of these records pf spiritual bealing mightbe described by modern scientists in other terms than those which trace their origin solely to a supdrnatural sourceconcurrently with these revived claims of ipiritual healing the medical profession has advanced in mental and psychical treatment to the great relief of hiiran suffering eypnotism suggestion telepathy psychical healing now be long to the repognized vreatment of medicine but they  claimi to no supernatural poxwers their methodaareconfined to what is justified by science it might thereforebe urged in contrast with spiritual healing that the treat ment controlled  by medical science is nbn spiritual and  that the practice of medicine must necessarily be on a lower plane but physicians rightly protest against such a viewthey may with justice declaro that careful inquiry into eases of alleged spiritual healing has yielded no endence of sny cure of organic disease or of any morbid symptoms other than those of nervous instability they may also assert with truth that in not a few cases weak persons are made the victims of ignorant fanaticism by those who claim to possess  gifts of healing but these facts do not exhaust the grounds of their protestthe distiiction between spiritual healing and medical treatmnent would seem to condemn the latter as purely materialistic as if those who practised it neglected or disregarded the highest elements in human life for this reason it is good to be assured that medical men while realizing and because they realize the dignity of their calling and the inimmnse powefs their science places at their disposal desire to con fess their faith in the divine spirit and to declare that they seek for their profession the high spiritual sanctions which men may claim whq devote themselves to the alleviation of suffering and the promotion of sound health among their fellows
