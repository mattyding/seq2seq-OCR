there are many people who do not wlih as wetl of the health of the ovsrnmnentas you seem to doat this gathering laughter it has beem a great delight to me to visit sheffield ps king on behalf of the government i epressed yesterday the gratitude tho atiat fecig towards this great centre for thbp incalculable services wbich it rendered to the empire and the world at one of the most critical peilods in the history of our land no organization tontributed more materially to the triuinph of sheffield than the organization i have bad the lplesure ef visiting today cheersi e promised last night that i would today say a few words oan the question of public expenditure and as my time is very short i prdpose to gotstraigbt ahdat once to the considera tion ef that allliportant problem last night i talked upou the question of production now i am fgoing to say a few words about economy the firsthintg i want to say is that i beg that these two estions should not be regarded as rival stunts theyare not they suppement each other without production there would be nothing to economize upon and on the otber hand it does not matter how much you produce if you spend too mueb your production is in vain therefore i beg every bodyfand those teree in cconomyshouldalso put in a wordfdrproduotion aild those interested ia pro ductin sbould keep an eye oneconomay you bave got to bave both in order to save the stateit lsnot merely the publib expenditure the nation must economize for some years we learnt that lesson during the war i am afraid that we rushed rapidly to the conclusion that tho tiine had come for spending the yation must save add by the nation imeanuthe public who constitute the nation i say the govern meut is the biggest spender of course it has more to spend and as the government is naturally the most conspicuous spender it should set an example it is an example for everybody throughout the community to followthat of economy until the country is safe and secure then you can revise your ideas after wards i am not going into much detail for this reason the place to eiamine public expenditure la primarily the eouse of commons cheers i trust thewrouse of commons will do it not vaguely not by levelling wild indefinite charges of extravagance but by examining where the money is spent making sug gestions wvhere savings can be effected and listening to what has to be said on behalf of a government department when they explain why either is pre muature or eould not be effectively accomplished for reasons of public safetywar a euge thiprovisationiet me say at once i am not going to say that there has not been a dngle concern here or there in the jast area of governmet expenditure during the war that might not have been managed better that would be a fatal claim to put forward war is a huge im provisation and that is the firsb thing that everybody has got to get into their mind what does that mean youihave only to think of that in your own business if you had without warning to increase your business if eenfold to find a new man to manage and direct youm concern there would be a few mistakeshere and ther some man might fail you here or another miglht fail you thereit is inevitable and not goi to say that where the expenditure of the couiry suddenly aps up fifteenfold there are not bound to be thigs which night have been done better the time was vital the time was s vital in wpr as it is in dckness hear hear a moment lost might never be recovered thereisa tling to be gob that is wantd for the purpose of supporting the troops in the field and when time counts to such an extcut you cannot always reckon upon the expense and if you said i will wait a fortnight to get a cheaper article the opportunity might be gone for everthe test questionthe test question by which the government wm stand or fall is whether viewing matters broadly the government can do more to save the temporary expenditure am coming to the normal expendi ture jater onwithout imperilling greater and more permanent intersts fxenditure can be divided into fwdeadsithe petnenhtexpnditude which is irreducible and the temporary expeniditure which marks the passage from war to peaceyou have not reached peace hear het you are en the road to it now i am going to deal first of all with permanent expendituretntftiture years if any man barbours the delusion that when things return to the normal it is going to be anything like the ays when i was chancellor of the eichequer chedrs which you must all view with regret laughterand if anyone believes tbat we are going to get back to the days of tho is id inonietax let me at once dismiss that from his ialnd and tor the sake of his peace of mind not only from his mind but from his memory those days ar not coming back the public debt is up from  millions to very nearly  millions i used to make pro visioni for something like  millions a sear to pay the tnterest ou the sinking fund your rate of interest was low xow yot hsve to make proviqion for about  mtlions per year that is p rmanent expeditrme yoii may bring the army and the navy to the scale at which theywerebofore you may even reduce them and still the expenso woild be greater why the pay of the soldier esverv muc higher the pay of the iailor is very much higher an rightly so cheers there is no class of the community that more thoroughly deserves recognition and appreciation in that respect tlte cost of living has gone up and the cost of the army the navys and the ain force will begreater even at the fame llgurvenathe same applies to esucatioit if you leave education where it ws and heaven forbid that we shoaldthere is no worse economy for the country thamv thatit is like the farmer who does not use fertilize o sve his purse for he wil be in the bantrupthy court very soon the cost of eduication hasgone up i see rates are going up aiido course that is the fault of the government laughterfayi just poltut whythey are going up every offical of the corporathon has to get higher pay laughter i beg youm pamilan svhy should they not thehave to ivfe cheers an naturally halltrved officials do not give you much r eturn ny more than halfjtarved ffelds do your teachers your police and your wortn all their pa is up and the result is the rates arenp because the general cost of living is up the same thing wil pply tof the norl expenditure of the country that is permanent i do not want you to allow yourselvesto he permsuiaded byo stunthunterst into the belief that you will ke tfieexjsnditure of the counatry for years amid years into the position itwe before the wa rsubsidi gone and goingi cofge therefdre to temporary expenditure temporary expenditre is in the main due to the army and thu xavy there are subsidies like the bread subsidy the railway subsidy and the coel subsidy the bread subsidy mast disappear ioon hear hear the railway subsidy is a questib purely of distributing it among the rates now the trausport act s through rates have been pre paed and they have been considered by a proper tribunal the coal subsidyhas gone thxse ubsidies are going going gone laughte and  heers i there fore cme to the army and navy these are rtspan sible for the bnormslly imigh expenditure now let us deal with that lot u tbreat it really as sezsible people why are they igher  because your troops ehad to be kept there untk thepeace was signed large mbeh of themaud shlpshad to be kept jih commission very largely for te same reason therp are peoplewho talk as it the moment the joy beltstarted ringing on november ii sstlii sioal for everv soklier to fling down s rifle and sav tam off what would have hadpened i do you think we would have had atreatrof peace like that we have if that hadhappened  cheersyou had to keep a sufficient foreetbere to make it clear to the enemy that if ha did not sign we had the means to compelling sigoature what folly it would have beeh after faur years of horrible war after the terrible expenditurein human life and trawure that we shoald throw the whole nf that awav in order to save erenhundredsoot millions of money where we ad already spent thousands of miliiowrs wehad to keep the army we hadto keep the navy until we hadatheignature upon our treatyo peace and until it became perfectly clear that it wts not merely a siniature but wassmething that was enforceable cheers there is only one treaty of any p cgroquenpe which remains to be signe thtvj is tturkey there is delay it is att ibntsble to the fact that you canniot settle thedetiny of turkey unti lt is known whetheer theunited states ot america is going to sharehow shall i putt  laughterto shire in the burden of eiyilization outside the states laughter and chees sa af his excellency the ainbassoap for america will not minnd my saving so i am rather glad thattbey bavebeenbrnght face to fwre with it therewere people in the states whpo said look at this grealu grabbing briih impire  herever they cant get a piee of land there it is laughter now i think evesthese people rpe e at least the maiorit are resling that we h undetn king a great cvitizlngdutyat great comsto pvown countrysgbiut tt mt of our stpilbngteit was a task it a mission wvhich proldemce had as to ur rac and which we are discharging  dferent yarts of te world and wve begthe menof our kith and kin in america to join vw in that task cheers unless they do i do not know wbatis wing to bappcn to parb of the turkish empire ve cuand thereaoe  fraace cant undertake it a aud therefore peope who hao been living under th thadowof  great tyranny for centuries who are trembling with fear at this moment who are appealing with uplifted bands to america to give their help in protecting themi hope that appeal wil hiotb in vain cheers this would needs look an impertinetce upon the part of a british mliinister had it not bn for the fact that we are etting tg the limit of our stregtb and it would not be wise for us to go fairther but until america riiakes iup her maiid weca ttmake the treaty and tbo suspense in the eetthimeait of the turkish ques tioa is attributable to tbat lmportant postpneinent that involves expenseand iow i am explaining to yqu why there is still considerable expenditure in respecttof the army and ot the navy which although of atepnporarycharacteris undoubtediy iery buriden some to the taipayers othis ecountry tut it would be the heiglt of uwisadom to disarm until that problem is settled chemre it is vital to the british empirc it is vital to the world that it should be eettled properly and settled promptlyin spite of that fact i should like to show ybu what has been done the measure of cost is the size of your army and of your navy we have demobi lized since the dav of trlumphin the navy the army and the air porce of men cheerthat is a gigantic figue a very rigantic figure and insistentlylet me say that we not only demobilized them hut e succeeded with the help of the man facturets of the country in placing a per cent of these soldiers cheers by the end of the yesri make you a prophecythat by the end of the year s per cent of the onocriptkd soldiers will have been returned to theirthome cheers you will have a volunieer army but you can return them all by the end of the year there are many of them in turkey and in ether partsnot in russia iaughterso lthat by the time tho conscription has expired there not be a single conscript who will not have been returned so that the pledges that the governmentavatthe last election in that respect wfill be re aemdin thle letter and in the spirit cheersfalse ecooiyuntil that proces i completed abnormal expendi tuie but r claimon beha of the departments hich have got it in aharge that they are under taking that duty with promptitude with decision with fearlessness with prudence and if anyone thinksotherwise there is a place for them to call this departmeiit into actount  parliament meeta next week i shall be glad to hear in what respeot they think matters are to be improved if they make any suggestiona which ae valuable we will accept them if they are under any delusions we will clear therin up laughter economy mean catting down of unneosary and unproductive expenditure to cut down our reproductive expenditure is sham economy is false eogonoyin the housing scheme the development of the resources of thi country mintransport in educationthere you are impoverish ing the country instead of enriching itby cutting down beyond whnat is productivethese are the few words which i wanted to utter with regard to economy i have pointed out to you that as far as temporary and provisional expendi ture is concerned the government have done every tlhing in their power im the boldest spirit to cut down expendlte and all i wvantto say now in parting is this i have to thank you in sheffield for our kindnets to me i wiu not conceal that i irve been gratified ancd encouraged by the fineness of your repeption cheers the task of a minister and especially of a prime minister in these anxious diysls a trying one hear hear and he needs all the hlp that is fellowcountrymen can give him cheers lest he be overwhelmed with his responsibili ties i was driving along a road the other day and i saw as i came to a hill a noticeboard bearing the words  please slacken the reins in going up hill and i thought at the time that i wished they treated ministers as they treated horses but when we go up the hill there are men who tug at the mouth pull and prod and tighten rather than slacken the reins the burden hs heavy the bill is a very steep one it needs all the muscle all the brain it needsal the heart it needs al the inspiration vwhich is in imanill the inspiration that he can get from his fellowvmen and from above it needs all that to enable him to get up and carry the weight with all that help i trust to qee the country overcome all its fficulties loud cheersa sheffield degreetribute to younger the un iversitiesthe prime minister had a warm welcome from the students at sheffield university when sir henry hadow the vicechancellor in the absence of the chanceuor conferred on him the degree of doctor of laws in reply mr lloyd george saidi thapk you for your very kindly and cordial welcome  find myself gradually without an effort of my own becoming one of the most learned men in england i have already won the degrees of some of the greatest universities in the land and r am sure thlreis notoneofthese gentlemen over thereanxious students toiling hard laughteralthough there are jseigns of worry in their facesrwho dos not envy thaenarkable ease with which i win one degree afterti i have lbad the honour of receiving a degree of the oldest university in the land and today i have the plere of having a degree conferred upon me by one of the youngest universities in the land i hconour both and feel grateful for the distinction which both universities have conferred upon me in fact theyhave leard of xny learning beyond the eas and i have had two or three degrees from foreign univeisitias as well soti feel exceedingly leamed at the present moment laughterit is true that you are a young university and this univesity owes its fouhdation to the civic spirit and the energy of the people of sheffield they have good reason to be proud of it it has ahleady made a mark it had the inestimable advantage of the leadership for some time of bne of my ablestcolleagues in the ministry jfr fiher cheers a man whose great attainments and whose distinction are well knowvn throughout the land i feel i owe an apology to sheffield andto the uiniversity of sheffield for de priving the institution of the advantage of his leader ship but in spite of the great services which he rendered in this position le has rendered a still greater service in the wider sphere of activity which is provided for him as the head of education in england there he has already left a mark upon the educa tional history of this country thai great measure which he constructed which he piloted irith the skill of an old parliamentarianhe knew allthoso devices au the arts of parlaamentary management and he succeeed in puttingthiough the house of commonsand placing on the statute book of the reahn a measure the full advantage and magnitude of which will not be realized probably for a whole generation but you have been singularly fortuate in securig as his succeor sir henry hadow we all know what deep an impression he thad ahleadt made in the north of enrland and thst he brought vwth him a reputation for schblarslp for organization andwhatspecially interests mefor music in factitwas his musicalshall i say proclivities that brought him and myself into contact that was at the time of the national eisteddfod in wales and therewe enjoyed together some of the gteatest music that it has ever been my privilegetolistentobut i am not an impartial judge when it comes to talking about welsh music r am glad even from that point of view that be is here yorkshire bas for centuries enjoyed a primacy in musie some of you may bave read tbe itinerary of giraldis cambrensis at the time of the crusade he noticed that wherever the peole went the people sang in parts and he said there is no other portion of this kingdom where they sang in palts except in yorkshire that was l think the th century or was it the th at any rate it was a long time ago and we can hardly check what hd said nbw i think he said about yorkshire that tbey sang in two parts but when they came to wales they sang in just as many parts as there wrere people present laughter i am bet quitesurs what sort of judgment that is on their music i am glad from rthatpoint of view thbt he has come to a county so famed forits music that in itself would be a great acquisition to the develop ment of that sdae of the genius of your peoplea glorious part is the waryou referred to the  great wairone of those episodes of human historyof which we can hardly realize the size the universities of this land have made their cohtributions thex played a gloriouspert in thatmljbty evrent and ty baveall paid aheavy price i was told as i camne in tbat threo orfour hundred of the students who bave joined the university since the war have seen service i con gratulate theoi ou having passed througb tho terrors of thagreat war and i thinkthey must feel proud of te part they took of the srvices rendered of the dangers they faced of the cause they fought for of the contribution they made to this great march en the poad to bigher things in the bi fry of humanitythe contribution of sheffield was not merely a con tributior drawn fro the ranks of its students anditsstaff on the fighting side at made a real contribu tion on the side of tie privision ofravv materials a essential part of the work of inningtbe war i understand that the university tbrougbouttbe war wss the headquartersof a munitiocs omnmittee in sheffield and that the staff of the university aidedin the organiztiobn of that verybody knoiws the pjart tat heffield played in the equipment of our army idd when the u versity took sucb a leading part in the activities of sheffleld thon one pan appreciate whata valuable eontribution tlhe university mbade towards assisting us to win tbc triumphswhich we gained in that great cofict i only want to add otie word because i feel as if i had been talking the whole time sineo i came to sheffield thereby i am reiqiting vmry badly thoe hospitality of your peoplq and i have another speech to deliver later i am delighted ith the success of this university i anz a believer in these young universities it was khappy inspirmtion tbat started them toughout the bind i cannotw tell you the bucioltvhich my owittle country has derived from these young universities it has mnade a differencewhich cap hardly be appreilated in walus and i think that the same thing is felt by all the gruist citiesrld centres whfere universities of shis charactercontfinud at foot of next colrnmnhave been founded during this generation or during the last halfcentury sheffield naturally as the great centre of ironand stebl ias devoted a good deal of its energy to that branch of applied sciemie which is concerned witht that industrv and it has already made a great mark in metauurgical research the future ot our country depends very largely on the success of experiments of that kind iunless we keep right in the van of progress in that funda mental industry england will suffer severely in the race therefore the service which the university of sheffield has rendered to the industries of this country is incalculable and i wish them wel in that jarticulai branch of their work but a university cannot live on that alone it is the intellectuil centre it leads the population which surrounds it to a higher culture that is the great task of all these young universities iam glad to knw tbat shefield is thorougbly realizing tho importance and the aspect of its work as well as the other and more immaediately practical part of its enterprise under the guidance of your vicechancellor and the assistnce which he is getting from bis able staff i have nio doubt at all that tho university of sheiel will be one which is worthy to stand among the great orld famous institutions of the land i thank you from the bottom of my heartin
