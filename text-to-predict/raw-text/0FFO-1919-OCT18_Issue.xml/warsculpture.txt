 war sculpturememorials at the royal  academyagain the royal academy are to be con gratulated for putting their galleries to a good use in an off season the present exhibition of war memorials has been chosen by special com mittees appointed by the ra and its aimi is to provide a survey of modern work for the benefit of all those who have to choose war memorials of any kind the scope is large and includes woiks and designs that have sme direct reference to war or should provide some definite suggestion for the treatment of a war memorialthus one large room is given up to models of sculpture and we wish that it were possible to speak highly of them but the truth is that they are not inspiring the war has not taught us the art of sculpture as who could expect that it would  we have not yet learnt as so many sculptors in all countries on the continent have learnt that sculpture is an art of expression that the allimportant element in it is the music of form and therefore our sculptors are seldom able to combine figures with architecture in a beautiful or coherent or even plausible whole you have realistic modern soldiers flourishing their swords at the base of a monument on the top of which an armoured knight on horseback flourishes his spear you have drummers drumming and singing at the same time gunners and their horses and guns within an ace of tumbling down a tall pedestal on to a lioness with her cubs below you have a mural tablet with good lettering but a curiously photographic bas relief you have in fact many incongruities all arising from the fact that sculpture is prac tised with little principle and not much passion here and there is something more moving a single figure of a woman in bronze by miss m morton to be placed on a plinth  is simple and expressive the large memorial pane by miss winsor  is striking in its proportions and rhythm the model of a memorial tablet by mr arnold wright is accomplished if a little scholastic but the whole effect of the sculpture is to make one hope that most actual memorials will take another formrolls of honourluckily there is and has been for years a great improvement in letterinlg in england a p roof is the inscribed slate slabs  and  executed by the municipal school of art at leicester it is right that a revival in the art of memorials should begin with lettering for that is the commonsense part of memorials and a few years ago it was utterly neglected as a glance at most of our public statues will show if once we demand good lettering our sense of design will be heightened and we shall demand commonsense and beauty in other things there is also some fine writing on rolls of honour as on the roll by mr graily hewitt for ickham  but the decoration on these still lags behind mr clausen does not seem to have been quite at ease in his memorial design for a tapestry panel  it is inferior in all the qualities of design to his painting with the same motive jwhich was hung a year or two ago at the academy mtr sims has done better in his  dawn   at least it is more interesting on paper mir clive gardiners design for a triptych  has an interesting rigidity it is primitive but not archaistic but there is not enough life or nature in the central figure the memorial cross by ir j armi tage at coulsdon in surrey to judge from the photograph  is simple and well designed siir edwin lutyenss war memorial for spalding looks in the drawings a very simple and happy cloister and ought to give ideas to those who wish for a memorial of the same kind  and  also the model of the great wyar stone being erected now by the war graves commission in cemeteries abroad is all that one could wish quite simple and well designed in all details we need for our memorials the simplest possible forms since we have to reiearn the whole art of design from the beginnmg
