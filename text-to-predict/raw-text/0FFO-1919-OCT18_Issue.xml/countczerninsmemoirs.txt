he has drawn of the arch duke francis ferdinand of count tisza of the german emperor vad crown prince and of many other notable figures in the tcorldwar  x the hallmark of austrianismcount czernins recordcount ottokar czernin of chudenitz and morzin was born in  of old bohemian slav stock by temperament and training he ranked in his brief day a asn accomplished representative of that motley product of the hapsburg dispensation which until the dissolu tion of the dual monarchy was known as the austrian  bureaucracythis fortuitous concourse of german italian croatian czech and polisb elements was united not by any common national consciousness but solely by a sense of personal allegiance to the throne the members of this close corporation have been described as perhaps the only austrians  who ever existed for some years before the murder of the archduke francis ferdinand and later after the accession of the emperor charles the hopes of the younger generation among them were bound up with the fortunes of count ottokar his present memoirs which shed the first authentic light upon austro german relations during the worldwar are especially valuable in that they also exhibit the last phase in the partnership between the  austrian  system and the hungarian tra dition as impersonated by the fanatical count tiszadestined for ballplatzdespite the disabilities of his caste count czernin in his public career showed that he was not merely  ui comte comme un autre in diplomatic stature he was not either as envoy abroad or as minister at the ballplatz the peer of count aehrenthal or even of count berchtold any want however of profound natural intelli gence was abundantly compensated by his mental agility which his german critics dis missed as  coquettishness but which acute observers like m take jonescu who knew bim well more accurately diagnosed as  ron blardise although he never attained to the mephistopheian cynicism of the marquis di pallavicini the veteran austrohungarian ambassador to the porte his dealings with king carol and subsequently with king ferdinand of rumania his intrigues with members of the reichstag and his passage with m clemenceau argued him to be sufficiently devoid of sernple eis intercourse was polished his manners were charming he possessed a strong sense of humour and almost he might have eirned a reputation as a wit when the old emperor frannis joseph nominated count czemnin to the austrian upper house he remarked that this young man had much to learn but that he was no fool the murdered archduke franeis ferdinand had freely designated him as his future foreign minister when he should himself have succeeded to the throne it was this circumstance that induced the emperor charles upon his own accession in  to install count czernin at the ballplatzat the outbreak of the great war count czernin was acting as austrohungarian minister at bukarest where in  he had superseded prince fuirstenberg who had failed to prevent rumanias entry into the lists against bulgaria his own efforts to cajole rumania into obeying the dictates of vienna were destined in  to prove equally futile although beyond his nussion to reinforce the balkan flank of the central powers by securing the adhesion of rumania count czernin had no direct hand in the events immediately attend ing the outbreak of war he was not surprised by the storm from the very first he discerned quite clearly the scope of the struggle this war he repeatedly declared to his rumanian acquaintances  will be a war of extermination if we are vanquished there will be no more austriahungaryan inevitable doomtoday looking back upon the last five years count czernin pronounces the downfall of tho dual monarchy to have been quite in evitable even if there had been no warthe sands had run out for autotriahungary authors italics even amnong the few statesmen who in the summer of  hoped for warlike tschirschky for instance there can have been none wvho after a few months had not regretted and revised his views for they too did not contemplate a worldwar i believe nevertheless today that even without this war tho dissolution of the monarchy would have set in and that the ser bian outrage was in any case the first symptom of this processthe archdcuke eirapparent francis ferdinand fell a victim to greater serbian aspirations  but these aspirations which aimed at the detachment of our southern sliv pro vinces would not have been lulled into quies cence if the monarchy had ignored the murder on the contrary they would have continued in creasingly to assert themselves and would have strengthened the centrifugal tendencies of other peoples within the monarchyjust as a flash of lightning at night illumines for a few seconds the landscape so too the shots fired at sarajevo showed up the prospect it became manifest that the signal for the dissolution of the monarchy had been given the bells of saraimm which began to toll half an hour after the murder somnded the death knell of the monarchy there is of course no means of telling in what form the dissolution of the monarchy would have been effected if war had beentcontinued on p  coltn  count czzernins memoirscontinued from page  column averted certainly in a form less terrible than that which resulted from this war probably too the process would have been slower and possibly it would not have dragged the whole world down into the whirlpool we were fated todic we were fice to choose the manner of our death and we chose the most terrible withott ourselves knowing it we lost our independence on the outbreak of war we were transformed from a subject into an objectwhen once this fatal war had been started we were powerless to end it the conference in london had pronounced sentence of death on the eimpire of the hapsburgs and a separate peace would not have afforded a death any easier than that involved in holding out by the side of our alliesherr von tschirschkyias the above extract shows count czernin definitely assigns to the late herr von Â£cschirschky und bgendorff then german am bassador in vienna the part of the tempter from a long conversation that count czernin had with count tisza a few months after the outbreak of war he derived the impression that herr von tschirschky had repeatedly exceeded his instructions count czernin adds that it lay in the german ambassadors whole tem perament and nature to intervene in our affairs with a certain vehemence and notalways in the most tactful manner in order to wake up the mlonarchytherecan be no doubt whatever he con tinues that the keynote of all herr von tschirschkys private utterances at this time was now or never and it is certain that the german ambassador declared his own opinion to be that at the moment germany was prepared to support our point of view with all her moral and military power but that it appeared to him doubtful whether this would continue to be the case if we pocketed the ser bian rebuff i believe that tschirschky in par ticular was thoroughly convinced that in the immuediate future germany would have to fight out a war against france and russia and that he considered the year  would be more favourable for this issue than a later date in the first place because he believed that neither russia nor france would be ready to strike a blow and secondly becauseand this is a very impprtant pointbe was convinced that he could and would draw the monarchy into war on an occasion such as this whereas it appeared doubtful to him whether the aged and peaceloving emperor francis joseph would draw the sword for germany on any other occasion when he miight find himself less immediately the object of attack thus he vwshed to use the serbian incident so as to makesure of austriahungary in the decisive struggle this however was his policy and not bethmanns this i repeat is the impression conveyed by long accounts from the lips especially of count titza which have been confirmed to me also from other sources i am persuaded that tschirschky in the form and manner of his bearing widely overstepped the limits of his sphere of activity isvolsky was not the only one of his kind i conclude this to be the case from the fact that tschirschky was never in a position to make an official declaration in the sense of urging war but appears only to have spoken after the manner of diplomatic repre sentatives when they are anxious to correct the policy of their government according to their own ideastschirschky no doubt communicated his instructions correctly and loyally nor did he keep back or conceal anything but an ambas sador achieves more or less according to the energy with which he backs up the instructions of his government and the private opinion of the ambassador isin certain circumstances not easy to dissociate from his official view at all events the former will influence the latter and tschirachkys private opinion tended to strike a sharper note   to be continued
