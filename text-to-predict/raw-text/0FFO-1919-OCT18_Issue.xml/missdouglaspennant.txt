who subsequently resigned and colonel bersey she de clined the position of commandant because she did not think the wpaf wouldbecome a going con cern a workable proposition she had a clear indica tion from general livingstone that the wvjraf was not going to succeed unless she worked under him and vis this what general livingstone said that the wvtaf would break down unless it was worked under
