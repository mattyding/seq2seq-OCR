visit to sheffield he examined the question of economy and the national expenditure the exammna tion was hurriedthe prime binister had a train to catchand not very informing he foreshadowed the early

doing bis best though mir lloyd george found a more sentimental form in which to make his appeal he likened himself to a horse pulling a heavy burden and asked that the reins should be slackened in

sympathetic cheers he soughtthe chief points of the speech were as followsi want to sk that production and economy shall notbe regarded as rival stunts they arc not they supplement each other you bave
