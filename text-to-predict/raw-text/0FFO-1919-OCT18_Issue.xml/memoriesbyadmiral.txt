and writing out from dictation the lcrds prayer and i rather think i did a rule of three snum before that time for seven years i had a hard life mfy paternal grandfathera splendid old parson of the foxhunting tvpewith whom i was to live had died just before i reached england and no one else but my maternal grandfather was in a position to give me a home ho was a simpleminded man and had been fleeced out of a fortune by a foreign scoundreli remember him well as also i remember the chartist riots of  when i sawq a policeman even to rny little mind behaving as i thought brutally to passing individuals i remember seeing a tottering old man having his two sticks taken away from himn and broken across their knees by the police on the other hand i have to bear witness to a little phalanx of  splendid police who then wore tall hats and tail coats charging a multitude of what seemed to me to be thousands and sending them flying for their lives they only had their trunebeons but they knew how to use them certainly they seized the band and ismashed the instruments and tore up theirflagsi share lord roseberys delightful distaste and wild horses wont make me say more about those early years these are lord roseberys delicious wordsthere is one initial part of a biography which is skipped by every judicious reader that in which the pedigree of the hero is set forth cften with warm fancy and sometimes at intolerable lengthhow can it possibly interest anyone to know that my aimpleminded materral graxdfather was driven through the artifioes of a rogue to take in lodgers who of their charity gave me bread thickly spread with butterbutter was a thing i othervise never saslsnd my staple fod was boiled rice with brown sugarvery brown other vicissitudes of my early yearsuntil i became gunnery lieutenant of the first english ironclad the warrior at an extra ordinarily early agemay be told some day    i was promoted from commander to captain largely through a lord of the admiralty by chance hearing me hold forth in a lecture to a bevy of admiralsihms vigilant portsmouthi october  r goscben and llilne left at am i stayed ad went on board vernon torpedo school hip at ii had a most interesting lecture from commander fisher a promising young officer and witnessed severpi experiments the result of my observations was that in my opinion the torpedo has  great future before it and hat mechanica trainin in he near fui re be essential for oficrs made a note to speak to goschen about young fisherthat was in  more than  years after young fisher was instrumental in making this prmiciple the basis of the new system of education of all naval cadets at osbornethe daniell selli remember so well taldng a  riso  out of my exalted company of admirals and others the voltaic element which all lecturers then produced with gusto as the elementary galvanic cell was known as the  daniell eell a bit of zinc and a bit of copper stuck in sawdust saturated with diluted sulphuric acid anid there you were  a bit cf wire fron the zinc to one side of a galvanomneter and a bit of wire from the copper to the ther sideandround went the neesdle as if pursued by the devilthere were endless varieties of this  daniell cell which it was always considered right and proper to describe  now i said  sirs i will give you without any doubt whatsoever the original daniell melluat that moment disclosing to their rapt and inquirng gaze a huge drawing occupying the whole side of the lecture room and previously shrouded bya table eloththe lions with their mouths firmly shut and daniel apparently biting his nails waiting for daylight t anyhow thats how rubens represents himi very nearly got into trouble over that  cell admirals dont hke being  soldi should have metationed that antecedent to this i had been commander of the china fagship i wished very much for the mediter rsnean flagship but my lifelong and good friend lord walter kerr was justly preferred before me the pacific flagship was also vacant  and i think the admiral wanted me there but i had a wonderful good friend at the admiralty sir beauchamp seymour afterwards lord alcester who was determined i shonld go to china so to china i went and as it hap pened it turned out trumps for the admiral got softening of the brain and i was told that when he got home and attended at the ad miralty i was the onlv thing in his mind the only thing he could say was  fisher  and tlhis luckily helped me in my promotion to post captain  after commanding the pall a in the mediterranean under sir geoffrey hornby i was selected by admiral sir cooper key as his fag captain in north america in com mand of the bellerophon and i again followed sir cooper key as his flag captain in the hercules it was in that year ibegan the agitation for the introduction of lord kelvins compass into the wavy and i continued that agitation with the utmost vehemence till the compass wasadopted after that i was chosen by admiral sir leopold meclintock the great arctic explorer to be his flagcaptain on the north american station in the lnorth ampton then a brand new ship he again was a splendid man and his indness to me is in forgettable le had gone throuh great hard ships in the arcticonce he hadnt washed for  days he was like a rare old bit of maho gany  and i was told by an admirer of his that when the thermometer was  degrees below zero he found the ship so stuffy that he sdept outside on the ice ir his sleeping bagi was suddenly recalled to england and left hiim with very deep regret in the west indies to become captain of the inflexiblethe warriori was appointed gtnnery lieutenant of the warrior our first ironclad in  when i was a little over  years old i had just won the beaufort testimonial senior wrangler and that with a transcendental certificate from commodoreoliver jones who was at that time the demon of the navy gave me a  leg uptho wtarrior was then like the in flexible in  and the dreadnought in  the cynosure of all eyes she had a very famous captiin the son of that great seaman lord dundonald and a still more famous commander sir george tryon who afterwards went down in the victoria she had picked crew of offioers and men so i was wonderfully fortunate to be the gunnery ueu tenart and at so syoung an age i ton veryell except for skylarkrng in the wardroom for which igo into trouble there was a deat old geyheaded paymaster and a mature doctor and a still more mature chaplain quite a dear old saint these with other willing epirits of a younger phase i organized into a peripatetic band the parson used to play the coal scuttle the doctor the tonus and shovel the dear old paymaster used to do the cymbals iwith an old tin kettle thie other instriuments we made ourselves out of brown paper and we perambulated doing our best the captain came out of his cabin door and asked the sentry what the noiso was we were all struck dumb by his voice the skylight being open and we were silent the sentry said  its only mr fisher sir so he shut the door the com nmander sir george tryon wasnt so nice lie sent down a message to say the gunnery lieutenant was  to stop that fooling   how ever this only drove us into another kind of s sprt we were all very happy messmates they kindly spoilt me as if i was the baby i never went ashore by any chance so all the other lieutenants liked me because i took their duty for them one of tliem was liko nelsons signalhe expected every man to do his duty i was his bosom friend which reminds me of another messmate i had who the witty first lieutenant said nlways reminded him of nelson not seeing the faintest resemblance i asked him why vell he said  the last thing nelson did was to die for his country and that is tho last thing this fellow would do   it may be an old joke but id never heard it before and it was truean inspectionabraham johnson clhief gunners mate my first lirutenant was a wonder  when tho admiral inspected the warrior abtaham johnson came to me and said he knew his admiral and would i let him have a free hand  i said  all right   when the ship was prepared for battle the admiral suddenly said  iu go down in the magazine and began going down the steps of the magazine with his sword on abraham was just under neathl down below and called up to the ad mniral beg pardon sir you cant come down here dn the fellow  what does lie mean   abraham reiterated you cant come down here the admiral said  wnhy not    because no iron instrumnent is al lowed in the magazine said abraham  ah   said the admiral unbuckling his sword  that fellow knows his duty this is a properly organized shipitis seldoni apprecintedit certainly was not then appreciated on board the wvarrior when i was her gunnery lieutenantthat this our first armourclad shipofwar the warrior would cause a findamental change in what had been in vogue for somnething like a thousand years for the navy that had been founded by alfred the great had lasted till then without any fundamental change till canie this first ironclad battleship there is absolutely nothing in common between the fleets of nelson and the jutland battle  sails have given way to steam oak to steel lofty fourdecked ships withl  guns like the santissima trinidad to lowlying hulls like that of the first dreadnought guns of  tons instead of one ton and torpedoes mines submarines aircraft and then even coal being obsolete and unlike nelsons day no human valour can now compensate for mechanical inferiorityirom the warrior i went to the gunnery school shnp the excellent and it was during these years that some of my  manias  began to display themselves the result being that threo times i lost my promotion through them it had fortuned that in  when starting the scienco of underwater varfare as applied to the ocean i met a humbleminded armourer whose namo was isaac tall and for many years we worked together he devised amongstother inventions nn electricallysteered steami vessel that could tow barges laden with b i mines which were dropped automatically at i mclci a distance apart as absolutely to destroyl all hostile mines in a sufficient area to give a passage for battleships small buoys were automatically dropped as the countermineswere dropped to mark the cleared passage i that invention simplicity itself stil holds the field for clearing a passage say into the baltic not one single man was on board the steamn vessel of the barges carrying the counter mines    in  i took out a pro visional patent for a sympathetic exploderand strange to say it is now coming into play in a peculiar form as a most effective weapon for our usei bave remarked elsewhere how the first lord of that date did not believe in mines ortorpedoes and i left for china as commander i of the china flagshipthe bishops eggcorning home from the china station in  i was commander of the old battleship oceanshoe was an old wooden line of battleship that i had armour bolted on her sides wihen we got into heavy weather tho timbers of the ship vould open when she heeled over one way and shut together when she heeled the other and squirted tho water inboard and always we had many fountains playing in the bottom of the ship from leaks some quite high at singaporo the chaplain left us he couldnt face it as we were going home round the cape of good hope at the stormy season so i did chaplain when we put into zanzibar on the east coast of africa i heard there was a sick bishop ashore from central africa who had been carried down on a shutter with fever i went to see him to ask whether he could take on next day sunday and give the crew a change  hei turned out to be a splendid specimen and had given up a fat living in lincolnshire to be a missionary i found him eating boiled rice and a hard boiled egg on a broken platewe gave him a good feed when he came on boardbut i am telling the story because his sermon was on prayer he gave us no text but began by saying he had been wondering for the last halfhour what on earth that tling was overhead between the beams on the main deck where we were assembled of course we knew it was one of the long pump handles for pumping the ship out with the chain pumps a thing of past agesall the crew had to take continually to the pumps she was leaking so badlyand  there  he said  im a bishop and instead of saying my  prayers ive been letting my thoughts wanderand he gave us a beautiful extempore sermon on wandering thoughts on prayer that hit every one in the eye i believe he died there in central africa a polished english gentleman with refined tastes and delighting in the delicacies of a cultured life a missionary had come preaching at his country church and had made him ashamed of his life of ease so he told mecaptain of the inflexiblethe inflexible in  was a wonder she had the thickest armour the biggest guns and the largest of everything beyond any ship in the world a man could crawl up inside the bore of one of her guns controversy had raged nund her the greatest naval architects of the time quarrelled with each other endless inventions were on board her accumulated there by cranks in the long years she took building a german put a new type of gas into the engine room which was lovely and no smell so bright so simple  but when it chanced to escapefrom a leaky joint it descended and did not rise so it got into all the double bottoms and nearly polished off a goodly number of the crew there were whistles in my cabin that yelled when the boiler was going to burst or the ship was not properly steered and so on so to be l aptain of the inflexible was much sought after as each name was discussed by the board of admiralty it got butted that is to say it would be remarked  yes hes a splen did officer and quite fit for it but and then some reason was adduced why he should not be selected he had murdered his father or he had kissed the wrong girl  lord northbrook who was first lord got sick of these interminable discussions as to who should be captain of the inflexible so he unexpectedly said one morning do any of you know ayoung captain called fisher   and they all having no notion of what was in lord northbrooks niind eand i being wellknown to each of themhad no  buts i so he got up and said wellthat settles it ill appoint him captain of the inflexible i was about the unior captain in the biggest ship however thb iriflekible brought me to deaths door as i was suddenly struck down by dysentery when ashore in charge of alexandria after the bombardmenit i had arranged an armoured trainwit i hich we used to recon noitre the enemy whowere in great strength and only a few milesoff the officer who took my place in the armoured train the day after i was disabled by dysentery was knocked over by one of the enemy shells and so it was telegraphed home that i was killed and quen victoria telegraphed back for details and very interesting leading articles appeared as to what i might have bcen had i lived lord north brook telegraphed for me to be sent home immne diately kindlyadding that the admiralty could bmld another iflexible but not another fisher as i was being carried on board in a brief moments consciousness i heard the doctor say  hell never reach gibraltar   and then aad there i determined i would live when i got home lord northbrook appointed me head of tthe gunnery school of the navy queen victoria asked me to stay atosborne and did so every year til she died and this in spite of the fact that she hated the admiralty and didnt much care for the navyi kept on being ill from the effects of the dysentery for a long time but lord northbrook never let go my hand when all the doctors failed to cure me i accidentally came across a lovely partner i used to wvaltz with who begged me to go to marienbad in bohemia i did so and in three weeks i was in robust health it was thepool of bethesda andtlis waltzing angel put me into it for it really was a miracle and i never again had a recurrence of my illness chapter xinelsonlord rosebery may have forgotten it but in one of our peregrinations round and round berkeleysquare i lived next door tohim he remarked to me what made a deepand in effaceable impression on methat he felt sure ouie of the great reasons of nelson being so in the hearts of his  countrymen was the con viction that he had been slighted by authority and even so after his death unquestionably his brother admirals were envious he was kept kicking his heels at merton on half pay in momentous times and so poor as to necessitate his getting advances from his banker he was cavalierly treated when he was told to haul down his flag and come home after the battle of the nilelook at the battle of the nile it was an incomparable battlebut it only made nelson into a common or garden lord when the battle of cape st vincent which was prae tically won by nelson made sir john jervis into an earl    battle of the nile perhaps in this cursory view of nelson onei may be permitted to seize on what appears to mne the central incident of his life which so peculiarly illustrates his extraordinary genius for war his audacity his imagination his considered rashness   i think myself the battle of the nile is that incidentfor this reason that it has been recorded in writing what actually occurred to lord nelson and to the french admiral at the very same instant of timeeach having at his side the very same officer in each fleet it was sunset nelson was walking the deck with the navigating officer of the fleetthe  iaster of the fleet was his technical title the lookout man at the masthead reports seeing on the horizon the mastheads of a mass of ships at anchorit was the french fleet in aboukir bay nelson instantly stops in his walk and orders the signal to the fleet to make all possible sail and steer for the enemy heis remonstrated with both by his own officers on board and by his favourite captain of the fleet at going in to fight the french fleet without any charts if he waited till the sun rose they wculd be able to se from aloft the shoal water and so steer with safety slong side the enemy nelson answers his favourite eaptainthat ifcthateaptains shipdoes get on shore as he fears then shell be a buoy to show him where aiiyhow one shoal is trou bridge did get on shore and he was a buov nelson went in the french admiral blew up atmidnight in his flagship the orient and casabianca his aaptain and his son are the theme of a great poem the boy stood on the burning deckthe french admiral was walking up and down the deck with his master of the fleet when his lookout man at the masthead re ported on the horizon the topmast sails of a number of ships the erench adiniral stopped in his walk as abruptly as nelson and at the very same instant tht nelson stopped inhis walk but he said its the english fleet but they wont comne in tonight tliey have no charts   so he did not recall his men from the  shoreand in the result his fleet was destroyed and the one or two shipsthat did escape unider admral dumnanoir were captured and naoleon wrote but for nelson at the nile l would have been con queror of the world or words to that effect and yet nelson was only made a coimmon or garden lord for this great battle and spent two years on the continent kicking his hfees about to ass the time before returning to england imagine he wasnt wanted i think lord rosebery was rightnelson being slighted has led to his greae appreciationwhere are the sailorsgainven a greater slight  a slight he feels morewhen he looks down from his monument in trafalgarsquare does he see anywhere those splendid captains of his  but let alone those captains of hisdoes be see anvwhere a single admiral  not one and yet who made england what she is those splendid sea heroes are in very deed englands forgoten worthies   yes nelson looks down from his isolated column and looks in vain for hawke dundonald howe hood rodney cornwallis benbow  and great multitude wvhich no man can number  all seamen of deathless fame fight single frigate actions cutting out the enemy s ships from under the giins of forts sending in fire ships and burning the enemys vessels thought to besafe in harbourunder the guns of their fortsdoers of imperishable deeds  l death found them fighting we have heaps of statues to everybody else indeed such a lot of them that they reach down as far off as knights bridge but wbo knows about quiberon one of the greatest of sea fights  and if you mention hawke your friend probably thinks only of his worthy descendantthe cricketeran old woman eating a penny bun asked a friend of mine called buggins when she was passing through trafalgarsquare  what are them lions aguarding of   buggins told her that her penny bunwould have cost her three pence if it hadnt been forthe man them lions were aguarding of     when i see the duke of yorks column sill allowed to rear itsfutile head and scores of other fifthrate nonentities glorified by statues i thank god im a sailorwe dont want to be in that galley  i began my sea life with the last of nelsona captains through nelsons own niece and fitly i think say mylast word in asking the nation to do justice to nelsons trade  this country owes allsho has to thesea it was the sea that won the late war aid if wed stuck to the sea we should not now be thinking of bankruptcy and some of us imagining carthage i wewere led away by militarist folly to be a conscript nationi and it will take us dall we know to recover from it we shall recover for england never auccumbsthe endl i there are statues of franklin and of robert falconer scott in vaterlooplace buti neither of these displayed his heroism in naval action they were eacan peaccable oeekersbut what on eartb god accrues from going to the north and south poles i never could understandnio one is going thero when theycan
