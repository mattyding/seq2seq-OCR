i b irving deadan inheritance ofa italentwe regret to record that mr h b irving the actor died last evening at his residence in cumberlandterraoe regents park after a long illnesshenry brodribb irving the elder of the two sons of sir henry lrving whose family name was brodribb was born in london on august   and went to school in london and at marlborough college he went up to new college oxford in  a tall thin pale youth very negligently dressed a capital talker not without a touch of his fathers saturnine and sometimes mischievous humour especially during his last year when he had diggings overlooldng the university church his luncheon parties were occasions on which there was less talk of oxford  shop  and more talk of the wide world than coild usually then be found in undergraduate society he had an active brain and he worked it hard in several fields reading modern history in which he took honours reciting at common rooms calverley was his favourite author for this purpose studying keenly if casually crimino logy and of course acting for the ouds his performarice of decius brutus in julius cesar and still more of wentworth in straf ford were at least good enough to persuade most of his contemporaries that he was going to be a great actorapppxenticeshipsir henry irving is reported to have said once one of my sons cant act and will the other can and wont he that could and wouldnt was laurence who was then studying for the diplomatic service the other was hlarry whether he could or not may be left open for the moment but in his earlier years after leaving oxford the will was rather a case of  he wdl and he wont or the poor cat in the adage he read for the bar seriously and was called by the inner temple in  he went on the stage professionally under sir john hares management at the garrick in  theu he left the stageonly to go back to it three years later this time he seems to have made up his mind to  go through with it for he served his apprentice ship in mr ben greets company where he met miss dorothea baird who in  became his wife still he was not merely an actor hle was engaged in writing a life of judge jeifreys which was pub lished in a very clever if rather wilully partial study but henceforth his profession was that of actor and his other doings were his parergabetwveen  and  he worked hard playing shakespearian and other leads on tour it was at sunderland where his father had made bis first professional appearance that harry irving first played hamlet and smaller parts under george alexander at the st jamess then charles froh man engaged him for the duke of yorks and had not had him long before he cast him for crichton in sir james barries famous play the admirable crichton the performance was not perfect but it was full of distinction character and style and if sir henry irving had indeed said that harry couldnt act this was enough to disprove the chargethrowing off the cloaka further step forward came with his playing of hamlet at the adelphi in a performance full of grace and beauty though youthfully overloaded with not rigidly selected ideas his ambition properly grew he formed his own company with miss dorothea baird by then famous for her rilby as its leading lady toured in britain and in the united states and in  took the shaftesbury theatre where he appeared in several of bis fathers most famous parts from the shaftesbury he wento the queensa where he gave an evermemorable performance of dr tejli and mr hyde and then came an australian and south african tourcold critics had said of his father that he was a better i character  than tragedian cold critics insensitive to the penetrating charm of his person ality and the almost inevitable a interestinkness  of his selfexpression on the stagesaid of mr r b irving that he could not be truly  human it may have been so it may have been that his intelect was too keen and too selfcritical to allow him to be a great histrion in any case it became increasingly evident that the proper  line  for his subtle intelligence his sharp fantasy and his sympathy with the macabre was not to be found in shakespeare but in certain forms of modern comedy the time came when he was able to throw off the cloak of his father which had provedas such inheritances will doto be at least as hampering as it was august the war among other causes prevented his tenancy of the savoy theatre from being as highly regarded as it deserved here he foun authors to supply bim with what he needed and what with deliciously extravagant nonsense like the asgel inthe house and creepy plays and plays of crime he kept bisublic constantly amused or thrilled later he felt it to be a more urgent duty to do war work directly than to continue acting and it was while he was working in a government office that his health broke down never to recoverhis interest in crime and criminology grew with his years he was one of a small band which used to meet regularly at the house of the late mir churton couins to discuss murders old and new and apart from the life of jeffreys a few very interestinf studies in theatrical history and onc or two thoughtfuland outspoken lectures on the drama and the stage all harry irvings writings were concerned with crimes and criminals they make fascinating read ing since his power of analysis was equal to hir gift for telling a story man his memory held almost as much wide and curious learning in the subject as did his wellstocked library shelvesmrs irving who left the stage while in the prime of her powers has since won distinction in courageous and indefatigable labour on behalf of poor mothers and children and their son laurence did excellent work in the raf during the war their dnughter elizabeth who is  years old is a student at cam bridge
