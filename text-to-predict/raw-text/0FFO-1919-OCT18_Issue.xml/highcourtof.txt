after the investigation colonel bowden was promptly and fully exonerated frdm that very serious accusntion the court did not wait for the issue of its report before announcing its decision on this one pointin july t the court issued its report and in his his lordships view that document clearly con tained certain criticisms which were unfavourable to colonel bowden with respect to matters of thei administration of the battalion the court obviously thouht that some matters called for exnlanation buton the question of misconduict with mrs devereux there was no doubt the court said that there was no reflection upon the character of jrrs dlevercux or upon the behaviour of lieutenant colonel bowden that appeared in the report several omcers had given evidence before the conrt that mr devereux had made grave complaints the evidence in connexion with this branch of the inquiry became notorious it was perhaps more fully re ported thnn the testimony given on other matters it vas widely reported in the london prems is well ss in powerful newspapers which circulated in derby qhirethat was in  the plaintiff remnined a mem her of pnrliament and in december of last year the genernl election took place and the plaintiff stood as an independent candidate in parliamentary elee tions the character of a candidate was vital no man who had been convicted of sexual misconduct stood a chance of suecess and men who were under usinicion of sexual misconduct stood a poor chance of sucessthe defendant bourht three copqes of the report of july  nnd with hts blue penefil mared varioup mnssiures in it the defendnnt with his blue pencil had emphasized all the isrte of the renort whichoulid tell aainst colonel bowden tnd had put nt the side stars to indicate those parts he bad omittedto mark with his blne pencll the ene passage which wns vital to the plaintiffnamely the passace  that there was no reflection on the charactpr of mrs devereux or upon the behaviour of colonel bowdein i on paqe ii of the report these words aptpeared the disrrepancies between the evidpnce of the officers to whom mr devereux complained and of mr devereux himself though difficult to reconcile are not entirely unintelligible having regard to the lapse of timethe defendant had underlined the words  officers to whom mr deveretux complained and had drawn n circle in blue pencil around the word com plained it made the word peculiarly conspicuous then on the left side of the print the word was written in blue pencil why p  the defendant handed the report to a mlr land at a time when that gentle man wtas undetermined whether he would vote for the plaintiff or notto consider the question of defamation it was necessary to consider the circumstances it was clear that the defendant was anxious to defeat the par liamentary candidature of the plaintifl hbe his lordship entertained no doubt that it was for that purpose that the defendant got the three copies and underlined the passages with his blue pencil it was to carry out that design that he selected the bluc pencil marked copy he his lordship could not accept the defendants explanation that he desired to emphasize the plaintiffs vindication by the court the circumstances indicated the reverse the de fendants meaning was that there could not be a complaint without some ground for it in the cir cumstances of the case he bis lordship gave the word  why p  together with the blue pencil marks uo other meaning it was significant that the de fendant was anxious to get the document out of cir culation as quickly as possible the court ought not to be too anxious to infer a defamatory meaning on the other hand actionable defamation could be committed as well by indirect as by directnmeansa query as a lsbxrhis lordship then referred to ritchie v sextoui  the times lr  e lt  and lionel barber v deutsche bank berlin london agency  the times lr   ao  and said that a query might constitute an actionable libel he hnd come to the conclusion that the defendant had defamed the plaintif the plea of qualified privilege set up by the pleadings had failcd but even if it had not failed the defendant in the circumstances was guilty of actual maliceon the question of damages his lordship referred to the following dictum of chief justice best in de crespgigny v weuesley  bing  p if we reflect on the deree of suffering occasioned by loss of character and compare it with that oc casioncd by loss of property the amount of the former injury far excecds that of the latterhis lordship continuing said that although the publication was a limited one the accusation was serious if it stood either as an accusation or as a suspicion it would probably exclude the plaintiff from public life hiis lordship
