will themselves take stepstoreduce prices to the public and eliminate the profiteer the first step in this direction was in connexienwith the sale of fisb fruit and vegetables in five midland couities where as the result of conferences with the trade a scheme was adopted for limiiting gress profits on the sale of all those artieles the essential feature of the sebeme is that in every shop a list ofprices of every article o ered for snp has to he exhibited these prices represent a profit which can in no case exceed such a figure as the divisional food comnmissioner after consnltation with the trade and with proper regard forthe interest of the consumer considers to be fair and reasonablegrocers aed drapersin the grocery trade a very large proportion of artieles sold are already controlled and are not herefore within the scope of the profiteering act but the grocers federation is now considering the advisahility of vohlintarily drawving up price lists for uncontrled articles and

for houseletting did niot come within its provisions neither did premium for telephonesthrpe subcomipittees were inquiring into the bespolie tailoring trade but as far as he knew there was no trade scheme in the airdeing with private procedure mr mctusdy saihat supposing a person was dissatisfied with the price charged for say an article of furniture he might say that he wa satisfied that the price chargpd was gossly unfair and that he was prepared to take the case hfore the local tribunal but a person wasnot always qite eoconfident as that ee might hbave great doubt as to whether the price was reason able but have no evidence upon which he cotld proceed before lthe tribunal that was a matter in which he mr mecurdy could be consulted and if it was of common interest to the public the ministry would take steps to investigate the case similarl it aretailer considered he had been charged too much byhis wholesaler and although the goodsmighthave been supplied on credit terms or there might be an account unpaid there was no reason why he should not in confidence giveto the investigation of prices committee which was not a criminal court informa tion as to what he considered was too high a price in his particular trade information of that kind would assist them and the committee might enter upon an investigationas to possibie further legislation hedid not imagine that time was likely to be given in the comingsession for an amendment of the act parliament would want to see how the act worked and then in a few months time tho question would arise whether it should be allowed to expire or be extended so far as investigation work was concerned the setting up of committees to ascertain prices and costs and to inquire into the operations of trusts and combines the government intended to bring in legislation this autumn tb make that workpermanent it wasonly in regard to proflteering tribunals and transactions that the actwas temporary but he had no doubt it would be extended beyond the original period of six months
