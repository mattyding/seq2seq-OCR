pointedout that the war createda aaargeamount ofbusiness connected chiefly with war work which had made canada ricl but en tie othei haad her assistance to the empire had brouht a i tremendousdebt the net result hoxvever was very much in favour of canada wolis people hadbnen fairly frugal dtuing the war and had saved a great deal ofmoney aswas indi cated by the banik returnis to them was payablea great proportion of the interest on the money raised bycnada forwar purposes as this interest would remain in the country for reirwestment they did not feel  much anxiety with regard to the interest on canhdiandebtheldabroad either in greatbritain orthe united states if great britain were in a position to repay canada the net amount owing for oud supplies canadawould be in a very satisfactory coiidition as regards exchange because she cold then inturn pay the united states whichhad a large balance againsther created to a considerable etent by the provisinofrawmatefials nsuch is steel required in making siiunltions   we have had sir john aird went on a good average of crops and pniceis but i do not think canad ians are nowany betterthan british neople as to extravagant  expenditure what would help canada more than anythinand the same might be saidof everybodyis ecoiiomy and efficiency effi ciency is atthebottom of it all ifwecan bring that about and go od producing succrops as we havebeen producing we shallbe able to increase iour export trade very largely that is all canada needsan increase of its export business not only withthe motherland and other parts of the enmpie but with foieign countriesefficiency be repeated is the kbynote it does not mnakeso much difference how many hoursa man works if he can produce in eight hours going hard as much as in  hours idling so much the better it is in efficiency we are in danger of falling down both in thes country and in canada as com paredw with the uinited states and other lands i am hopefulthatthe labourileaders will see things in this light and make the rank and file seethem if labour and capitpl do notcombine for a common object then other nations will get ihead of us especially the germans who are willing workers and seem to be anxious to restore their country   mixed races paobnrzssir john expressed the hope that next year many new settlers would come to canada from great britain western canada was already getting a considerable number from the united states these americans made firstclasssettlers they understoodwestern farming conditions were used to the climatic condi tions and could endure them and as a rule brought money or what was equivalentlive stock and im plements this class of american immigrants had become good citizens as arule but canadians would on the whole prefer to see english scotch and irish come to canadaand not to have as large a foreign element in their population asthe united states had one of i the advdntages  great britain possessed  in settling labour ttoubles wathat shewas able to deal entirely with her ovnpeople the united states were notand had the negro problhmtoo oflate yeats there had been an improvement in the class of british settlers in canada  the day of the  remittance man was past which was a goiod thing for every body the man who came to canada must make up his mind that if he was to progress he must work it must be remembered that while the soil of the united states hadbeen pretty well brought under cultivation that of canadahad as yet only been scratched   we have large quantities of raw materialtimber paper steel iron and coalwhich we are sending to you flow yes conada is shipping to great britain a good deal of coalandstelcoals to newcasue i besides quantitiesof cereals livestock and dead meat we practically control the nickel output of the world a third great mine hasjust been opened also we are one of the biggest silver producing countries e have had our labour troubles this year but wethink they arefairly well settled though we mayfeelsomeeffectfro them this winter in belgium and northern france sir john had been struck by the fact that though  placeslike vimy ridge and  the chemin des dames might never be iestored  minor battlefields showved fewer traces of the war ttann might have been expected from some ofthem crops bad been takenthis year ie believed belgium would recover much more quickly than once seemed likely particularly if she got the ftst inz demnity the belgianswere working hard and like the dutchmade kqbd use of their waterways  is there any reason easked whygieat
