the new agepresident on the coming daysthe brsop of pnzmooouani in closing the morning meeting said he should thank god for that congress to his dying day they had met at a time which was the most momentous in the history of the cou ntry and in the history of their church they had come to the congress in some degree burdened with the sense of it zan he wished to indicate the frame of mcind l which they would go away they had realized as members of the church of england their fellowship it was not that differences of opinion differences of profound conviction had been m any degree suepressed but he ventured to believe that in that congress as compared with some of those of days gone by they had learned to look on those dffferences in a new spirit they had tried to see the truth not by way of negation but by way of affirma tion no school of thought in the church now would venture to claim a monopoly in the future they were coming with their convictions and experience to look upon their very differences not as points of exclusion but as complementary aspects of that one supreme touch which they were all out to seek below all that had been said below all the difference of our views that had been expressed there had been preeminently a great and glowing and he was sure an abiding sense of their fellowshupthat congress was in a certain sense a microcosm of the church of england and it was full of promise for the days to come it meant that all schools of thought of true men and women belonging to the church were returning to a realization that fiast and foremost they were members of christs body brothers and sisters in one family and soldiers in one campaign the second thing he thought they had realized in that congress was the immensity of the task with which they had been entrusted they had listened almost in trembling as the speakers had described to them the need of the worldhe flimsi ness for example of the league of natibns apart from the christian conviction of the peoples con cernedthe immense forces of evil which were still rampant in the worldsurveying the prospect east and west they must have felt that the church of christ was con fronted with a task compared to which even that of the first century was small there was not only the task abroad but the task at homethe industrial difficulties of our time they must purge themselves of the temptation to suppose that the church was merely a society for the promotion of social reform they must bring to bear on these industrial problems the supernatural force of an available god for the truest way in which to help the world was to be otherworldly themselves m understaniding that eternal hife which was god as given to us in jesus christ the difficulties were tremendous for our democracy in some degree stood at the parting of the ways they asked in fear and trembling whether democracy wtould concentrate on merely material matters or would rise higher and look beyond the things which concerned this life if democracy was to take that larger and greater view it could only be through the society of jesus christthey would go forth from the congress burdened with the sense of that colossal task but thrilling with joy that they belonged to a kingdom which could not be shaken if they were true to the call the most high might in his mercy be pleased to uso them if  years ago the world could only be renewed by a sacrificed and risen christ it might be as they remembered that they were his body that in our day the world could only be renewed through a crucified and risen church they would go forth from that gathering with a sense of the immeasurable resources at their disposal that god had made avail able for them it had been good for them to be there and they would go forth better equipped than they had been to do his will and full his calgospel of the spiritits appeal to the worldtodayat the morning meeting in the de miontfort hall the subject for discussion was the spiritual re sources of the church and papers on  the gospel of the holy spirit were read by professor a hlicneile and archdeacon gresiord jones of sheffield pnovzsson mcnina contrasted the christian pente costal idealchristianity as it was intended to be and as it once waswith the present positionas we look on the two pictures be said we are tempted to say that christianity is dead and gone that the spirit is for ever quenched and pentecost an unreachable glory of the far past the warthat nightmare of fourandahalf yearsraged for the most part between christians christians are divided party against party class against class sect against sect and the spreading flame of enthusiasm and seal the missionary energy which ought to be daily adding multitudes to the lord seems to have flickered out like a cheap candle so we are tenipted to say and yet if pentecost is a bare event of the dead past it means that god the father is dead and the risen christ is dead and the eternal spirit is dead it means that there is no love left in the world no self sacrifice no strong sense of duty and we know that that is a lie in old pagan rome things were done daily so hideously cruel so unutterably filthy that we dare not name them and they were done easily naturally witlniut a twinge or qualm of conscience by individuals and communities as part and pareel of ordinary life cruelty and ilthiness and many other crimes are still found amongst us but every one knows that they are wrong they are done in secret and visited with coidemnation if discovered the normal life of all mankind who have emerged from actual savagery is on a different plane fiom that of ancient fome and it is the spirit of christ out poured at pentecost that has made it so we can today eive and walk and think and pray in the new world of the spirit and we know some people who do christianity is not dead its white heat is still burning at the heart of the world and the call of thegospel of the holy spirit is an ever fresh call to throw ourselves into the fire to burn awav from us all that is not divine and to start out again to warm the worldpower of the wind of godthe aacccoasxa of sunmnrr said that it was impossible for us to transfer ourselves mentally into the experience of the early church without coming to two convictions first that the experience of attrac tive fellowship of joy of moral power was the one thing most needed today and that by means well within our reach a renewal of this experience was eqnally open to us in our own time again as the earlier sessions of the congress had so amply shown the air was ful of high ideals againthat was theirtroublethere was a lassitude a hesitancy a hang looking out upon the church it was as though some noble airship destined for a majestic flight re fused to ascend the mnechanism was perfect the engines were in order all was in readiness yet abe clung to the earth yet still the unshakable as surance under which they met was that there was the gospel of the holy spirit the good news of the wind of god waiting to change us and to lift us according to our needsif the church were but lifted by the wind of god there was no ingle problem industrial internationalor religious that would not at once find its proper solution a reunited christendom would at once come forth with the conmmonwealth of nations as its inevitable firstfruits there was no rimnler proof that we re mnade in the image of god  than was afforded by that marvellous marconiapparatusot the higher brain by which our own spirits when sensi tive enough could receive messages or wave currents from the spirit of god the urgent matter for our selves and ior mankind was that we should developcontinued at foot of next columnjand discipline this wonderful apparatus lor better and more fruitful results than we bad yet achieved it was so easy it was to many of them so unworthy t iouow the bidding of sir arthur conan doyle or sir oliver lodge and to prostitute the marvellous innermechanism to less noble ends we could all of us i suppose in varying degrees he said  make contact with other spirits wandering spirits as the apostle called them just as in the region of our affections we could only too easily indulge in wan dering loves but this was precisely what st paul tells us not to do the higher the more delicate the faculty entrusted to us by god the more it must be consecrated and disciplined this wonderful spiritualistio gift committed to us is designed for union with one only the spirit of the living god our shame lies in this that we develop it so tardily could we as a church privately in our own chfambers or colectively in such moments as those afforded by silent fellowship or common prayer or most fruitful of all by the holy sacrament itself really work our prayerfaculty with true submission to it proper extent the most joyful and amazing results would be seenthe sacramentsthe rav dr gut warmiu vicar of bradford and bishopelect of truro in a paper on the glory of the sacraments at the same meeting said lifo is fuul of sacraments the sacramental principle is woven into the very stuff of human experience sacramental acts occur and recur in the ordiniary circumstances of every ordinary day some are colourless some have a beauty all their own most may be prostituted to evil uses but even the com monest and least insignificant inay be hallowed and glorified by the souree from which they come the spirit in which they are enacted the purpose to which they are put and the end which they achieve so it is witlh the sacraments of the gospel christ was truly man and the incarnatibn meant under standing of all human needs and human aspirations a religion withou sacraments would lac one con stituent of human experience the water of holy bsiptism and the bread and wine of holy communion are things common pnough in themselves their glory lies in the fact that christ took them and used them and they became sacraments of our redemption the chlurch by its very nature and character is and must be distinctive from the world the sacraments are at least badges of that distinctiveness long use has sometimes made the invitationin the holy conm munion but a meaningless formula and today thehorrid harvest o£ a worldly and inconsistent church has endangered our welfare as it endangered the welfare of the pharisees of oldthe hioly communion is thle most comprehensive means of grace at our disposal snd therefore it rightly used the most effective it is christs divinely nppointed means for realizing his presence and appropriating the blessings vhieb belong to itcison goujdoe said it had become clear that the place of the sacraments in historical catholicism was substantiallv their place in primitive christianity the old prejudice against the close association of the material and the spiritual was obsolete the invisible must be maniested through the visible the doctrine of the church was beginning to come into its own rot only with churchmen but with nonconformists also in the sacraments there was an instrument by which they could claim their
