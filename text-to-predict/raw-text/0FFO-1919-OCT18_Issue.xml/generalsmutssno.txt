general smutwss  no i discomfiture of thenationalistshertzog evades theissuefrom olr own corespondentcape town sept  by mailyu have already learnt by cable of the nwastely wvay im which the prime minister efcetced the disconilfiture of the nationalists in the house of assembly at the conclusion of tlhe short session called for the purpose of praying his majesty to ratify the peace treaty oni behalf of the union throighout the discus sion on ratificntion the nationaist members had iet on demanding a  yes  or  nto  answer to the question whether in the prime ministers iewt the union had or had not the right to form a republic they evidently imagined that  eueral smuts who had laid so much stress on  tlle cnhanced status of the ujnion would find himself in an impossible dilemmathere was a certain degree of nervousness  even among a section of the unionist partywhen the answer finally came  absolutely and decisively no the nationalists were com pletely nonplussed the prime minister then proceeded promptly to put the boot on the other leg by asking mr hertzog for a direct reply to the question whether his party did or did not intend to make separation the principal plank in their platform ll the nationalist leader eould do at the moment wazs to resort to a somewhat lame evasion  his party he said was a democratic party and he must await the decision of its congress on such a pointa few days later in the city hall at cape town mr ehertzog endeavoured more suo to disguise evasion in a cloud of wordssince the question of the british connexion he said had only become a practical question a few months ago there was nothing about it in the partys pro grammine of principle therefore it was open to individual members of the partyto have and express their free opinions on the question as a matter of fact however the members of their party were as food as unanimous in aiming at an ultumate free and induepcndent south africa separated from great britain there was no doubt at all about it it was a fact which could not be denied not only so but it was beyond dispute that the ideal of aimling at a free independent south africa was the strongest in spiration of the peoplein their aim at progress and developient whoever robbed them of their ideals would givea deadly wound to the peoplegeneral smutss demand therefore amounted to shutting the door for ever to the realization of a truly free south africa that was the price general smuts proposed for the privilege of working with tbe governmnent and on that he came to the demand that the question of the british connexion shonid never bc raised again at the price of these two con ditions could a sisgle nationalist buy the privilege of wvorkiing wvith general smuts mr hertzogs wayone would imagine that having got so far the nationalist leader veould have declared definitely and specifically that cooperation was impossible but that is not mr hertzogs way he proceeded to say that  if general smuts had confined himself to tho practical question that the question of secession should not be pressed in the immediate future it would have bcen quite another matter that would have been a reasonable request the advisability of which might have been discussed by the afri kander people in view of the interests of south africa but as he had not put that question no answer would be givenons land the dutch alinisterialist organ at the cape not unnaturally took this city hall speech to mean that mr hertzog had  banged bolted and barred  the door to nationalist and south african party cooperation the pretoria miniasterialist paper de volkstem takes a different iew m hertzogs own words this journal observes despite their surface meaning indicate on a deeper view that general smuts and he may still cooperatethe real explanation of this difference of interpretation is simpli that the inevitable alternative to successfu  toenadering  that is a reunion of the sap and the nationalists is a fusion of the sap and the unionists and the transvaal members of the sap are anxious at all costs to avert such a solution the easiest way is to shelve the republican issue without demanding from the nationalists an express renunciation old christian de wet blurts out the truth in a letter to ons vaderlacd in which he says the english flag must be gbeyed until the nation is saved from it but woe to hirn who loved that flagit is impossible to believe that general smuts will have anything to do with such a policy of political dissimulation he realizes too clearly what this sort of thing led to in  when men like de la rey and beyers persuaded themselves that god was working in them by means of faithlessness and treachery to brinig about separation and the chief object of his present tour in the back country is to compel the nationaists to accept the clear issueselfdeterminationb yoeorne oct mr hertzog ad dressing the congress of the nationalist party of the free state here today claimed that the nationalist deputation which went to paris had obtained a concession in black and whitethis he said was morc than general smuts had obtained inasmuch as mr uoyd george had said that the south africans ruled their omn national destiny in the fullest sense of the word and had the right to decide their actions both in peace time and in war time if they had the full right of selfdeter mination general hertzog contended they had the right to separate from the throne without great britains consent and moreover the british govemn mnent would not dare to deny them that righthe denied that there was tay racialism in south africa if the nationalists were looking for reunion with the south african party they could get it by placing their necks on the executioners block but he would not advocate a union which would cost the moral life of the nation cheersthe congress passed a resolution fully associating itself with qeneral hertzogs policyrcutcr
