prime ministerschallenge a free hand forthe commonsby our parliamentary correspondentit cannot be doubted that the eouse of commons will take up the challenge which the prime minister threw out to it in his speech at sheffield yesterday he declined to go into the question of economy in detail on the ground that the proper nlace to examine public expenditure was the house of commons this is sound doctrine and it will be a notable advance on recent practice if the govcrnment act upon it in the spirit as well as in the letter the test wiu come when mlinisters are asked for the necessary facilities to enable the house of commons to cut down expenditure and enforce economy a general discussion will not meet the case at all if the house of commons is to accept the responsi bility of checking the national finances it can only be on condition that the departments present revised estimates of expenditure in the current year and that members are given full power and a free hand to overhaul them in detail such a function would be better dis charged by strong estimates committees than by the whole house and the effacement of the government whips would have to be insisted on no less than the production of all relevant documents and the appearance of such witnesses as could give useful testimony no matter what their position in the official hierarchyif the house of commons is to be the final tribunal it must have the facts at the moment members are as much in the dark as to the detailed financial position of the nation as the general public will assuredly be after reading the prime ministers speech yesterday all that the government have allowed to be known fince mir austen chamberlain warned the house of commons  weeks ago that if the government were to continue spending at their then rate it would lead straight to national bankruptcy are the fouowing appalling figuresexpenditure to oct £ revenuef£deficit to date£currency note issue on oct  £national debtnearly £ what these figures mean can be judged from the fact that the amount of the currency note issue is only a little more than £ under the highwater mark that was reached on april   when the amount was £ the interest on the national debt is something like £ a year or at the rate of more than £ a day that is the first charge on the revenue and it is the root fact in the situation which should never be forgottenthose who had hoped to hear from the prime minister a detailed account of economies actually made will be disappointed he declined to contemplate any substantial reduction in the permanent civil service estimates it is of course common ground that the sums allocated for education and agriculture could not be better spent but it should be pointed out that the permanent votes including pensions amount to £ wbereas the total esti mates grouped under the civil service and revenue departments reach the colossal total of £ they include the following itemsministry of labour civil resetuement and de mobilization departmentbread subsidy£loans to dominions and ailies£ railway agreemnentsoothe coal subsidy to which the prime minister referred in his speech yesterday never appeared in this yeafs estimates at all on the other hand he made no reference to the costly un employment donation possibly for the same reason which prevented him from reporting the state of the housing programme
