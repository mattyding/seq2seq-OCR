irelandland acts comissiondublin oct at the sitting of the land acts commission yester day the president made a statement in reference to questons which had been put tohim by mr clancy xlpwhethertheywouldhave sittings in thb provinces and allow the expenses of witnesses to the first yes if they had reason to believe that the witnesses could attend more conveniently there than in dublin they would iequire to be fuirnshed with a list of them as to costs they had power to award them and they sug gested that five of the strongest and most important witnesses should be selected sad if they funfilled two conditionsif they appeared to be witnesses to truth and if their evidence wa relevantthe commission would allow their costs they would then hear any application that might be made in regard to other witnessesmr clancydid i correctly understand you to say sir that the witnesses called by us should be witnesses of truth the presidentthey should appear to us to be witnesses of truthilr clancy hesitatinglywell sirthe presidentdoes that stagger you p laughtermlr clancyif the evidence appears to be relevant i think that should be enoughthe presidentthat must rest with ushlir harrington suggested that it would be more con venient if the landlords witnesses were called first as they all knew it was the landlords who had asked for the commissionthe presidentdo not go into that please we do not know anything about thatmr campbell said he had repudiated at the opening of the inquiry that he was there carrying on a contest with the other side and he was quite prepared to do what was most convenient for all parties concernedhe president suggested that it would be more con renient to take the learned counsels witnesses first and he replied that he was quite satisfed and would have his list ready on tuesday the president then directed mr campbells attention to the tenth subsection of the act of  and asked him to explain what was meant byd other considerationsmsr campbell said that in a case in which a price was paid for the interest of a tenant beyond other com petitors for some consideration apart from the inherent value of the land that would not be conclusive evidence but if the landlord were abe to show that the person who had actually made the purchase exceeded the solvent price by a sum which represented some special advantage to himselfthen the landlord would be able to take as evidence not the actual price iven but the ce which an ordinary competitor in the mariet would haprepared to givethe secretary read a letter from mr bomford assistant commissioner in which he asked permission to supplement his evidence by stating how he dealt with buildmgs he had allowed  per cent on the value of buildings which he believed varied from the custom of most assistant land commissioners when he found buildings in excess of the agricultural requirements such as a shop mansion or buildings for the require ment of anotbei holding he allowed only the increased letting value of the baldingmir campbel referred to observation made by the president as to cases being brought forward which were nader appeal and stated that in the asses from  to  vwere second term cases which were sabject to appeal it would be impossible for himn to illustrate defects of which they complained in the present system without referring to themthe president said the proper course was that when counsel were mentioning cases subject to appeal they should inform the commission of the facmr campoellas far as i understand  per cent of the new cases under the pink schedule are under appealthe president said they could not have cases discussed which were subject to appeal and might be thought to be affected prejudicially in consequence counsel sould say whether the cases were under appeal and the com missioners would then consider whether they should be discussedthe examination of subcommissioner peet was then resumed be explained his mode of estimating value and stated that he made no allowance for occupation interest and never heard of its bein done in the case of bog land which in its original condition was worth is per acre but by drainage and reclamation which cost w per aere was now worth s per acre s per acre was alowed as deduction to the tenant and s went to the landlordto dr traillhe thought that a larger abatement was given in cases settled out of court and heard that abatements had been given since on account of bad timesit is stated that the average abatement was only  per cent in cases settled out of court and that in cases settled in court it was something like  in one case and as much as  in the county court what do you say to that witnessi think the rents fixed by agreement were cases where the original rent was not excessive in com parison of course various districts differ very much u this respectis it your experience that attempts had been made by the landlords to get tenants to sign agreements out of court this is the inference intended that is not my inference i think you will find that the cases settled out of court were those of quiet reasonable people who did not care to go into courtdo not you think it would be a dangerous thing to infer that imurovements allowed in l had been ex cluded in  because they were not endorsed on the notice we have no proof pro or con with regard to that in the case of two estates he had in his mind the agent on finding the position of affairs at once stated that the allowances should be madein reply to mr falkiner witness said that for the past five months ho had acted as sole laycommissioner the previous practice was that two lay commissioners should go out together and where they disagreed they sent in separate reports and the legal commissioners aceepted one or other during the last five months he had never had a difference with his chairman as to valueto mr harringtonhe found sometimes that several improvements on the land were not given credit for to the tenant because he had not claimed them at first in the second term casesthere was an impression that it was not necessary to claim improvements which had been scheduled in  iu some of those cases the a t had consented to allow the improvements but v e he objected no allowance was made with respect to poorrate on holdings under ï¿½ the result of the fixing of the judicial rent was that the landlord got an allow ance fur what he had to pay statutethe president ssked the witness what he thought of this suggestionthat there should be no endorsement of improvements ont either side but if the landlord or agent had any ground of objecting to have a fair rent fixed he should so state by notice if he had no objection the lay commissioner shoulld go upon the land and then and there from unnsvorn testimony come to the best conclusion he could and report it on the pink schedule then let either party have liberty to appeal to the head commission whnere there was an objection let it be determined in court by the assistant and the legal commisioners if it was determuined no fair rent was to be fixed there was an end of it and if there was to be a fair rent let it go on as indicated the witness replied that that would fully carry out his views as to the difficulty of getting a distinct list on either side of the improvements or allowances which were necessary in gowng before the appeal commissioners the greatest difficulty they seemed to meet was where the agents lived at a distance and were not much in touch with the tenantsmr charles butler a land agent of  years ex perience farming  acres and a court valuer since  was nexrt examined he defined as fair rent as what from his practical kunowledge of land he thought the tenant should be able to pay far it a competition rent would he an unknown quantity and he allowed nothinlg for occupation interestmr byers an assistant commissoner for  yeas was the next witness be had been a farmer and was specially interested in the cultivation of flax he valned the land as if it were tenants property and allowed nothing f or occupation interest be gave statistical information respecting the condition

to irish members of parliament requesting them to sign a mzemorial to mr balfour of summoning a suecialmeeting of parliament says there will unquestiiblybe distress in some parts of the country with this distress it is the duty of the irish government to deal personally he bas confidence in them and he sees no reason for relieving them of their responsibility he is convinced that any system of state aid calculated to deal with the causes of recurring periods of distress must in order to be effectual be preceded or at least acompanied by a sistem of organized local effort as a member of the congested districts board he has learned tbat schemes and suggestions for the improve meni of the most imnpdverishd districts largely fail of their purpose unless the cooperation of the beneficiaries is secure and unless these have teen brought to take an enlightened and active interest in their economic salvation  there is no surer way he says to weaken the spinit of self reliance than by inviting large and undefined sections of the people to rest their hopes of material improvements onx an appeal through their re presentatives tg parliament for reiefcoork ocr at mallow board of

per cent of the cropse s thedctbavipg been dqkstoye qpp cent ofthe people would be destitute should be rescinded he had he said made may inquiries and he found that the harvest was not at all a bad one and a great many people said it was a good one the hay crop was so arge that the loss of a portion of it would do no harm as regards the potato crop though he had an extremely good one himself he was afraid that throughout the union the crop would be a light one but if matters were as bad as represented m the resolution the guardians could not get a contractor as they had to supply them with potatoes for the next six months at a low price the language of the resolution passed was too strong and was not the plain simple truth mr creagh in seconding the resolution said the govern ment had independent means of ascertaining the truth of the stateraents in theresolution andiftheyused thtse means they would discover that the guardians by their recless statementsweretryingto humbug them in

the pro duce of seven acres of oats mr barry the mover of the original resolution said that as regards the corn crops he might not have been quite correct in his representations but he tuxderestimated the loss of the potato crop after a long discussion the resolution was rescinded and the following motion on the subjcet was unanimously adopted i that the attention of the government be called to the urgent necessity of at once taking steps to prevent distress on account of the great loss by the potato and damage to the hay and com crops consequent on the bad weather at a critical time
