agriculturecrops and lave stompleasart autumn weatherhazy mornings and sanny afternoonsprevailed over maost of last week it was hardly to be expected that at this season of the year the high temperature and brilliant sunshine experienced in many localities at the beginning of the week would continue accordinglythe drenching downpour of rain that occurred on wednesday accom panied by thunder and lightning was not un looked for but fortunately the remainder of the week was fine the storm was very general over most of our eastern midland and southern counties in many localities of which it served to bring the total rainfall for september up to more than the average despite the fact that there had been little precipitation since the close of the frst week of the month such harm as the storm did was chiefly where corn stacks were caught in tho process of threshing the sheaves getting such a soaking as to necessitate their being spread out in the fieids to dry autumn tillage work continues to progress without check and unhess there shouid j e any long spell of wet weather it seems quite likely what when winter sets in all field operations will be well forward wheatsowing has commetcffed under favourable conditions and may be continued for the next couple of months if any marked extension of the wheat area should take place not only in this but in other countries the extra demand for seed wheat at the rate of about two bushels per acre i a requirement not to be overlooked in any estimate of the consumption during the cereal year which is nor a month old it is quite probable that in england alone excluding the other parts of the ijnited ingdom four million bushels or  quarters will thus be required the root harvest has commenced with the lifting of mangel and farmers will probably be well advised to push ahead with this work while the weather remains fino and open as either excessive wet or frost is detrimental to the successful securing of this valuable crop the country retains an amount of vardure which is unusual at the beginning of autumn but a few frostssuch as would not now be unseasonable would speedily spread a brown mantle over the at present delightfully green pastures there is nothing to lead us to modify the adverse view we have taken of the potato crop throughout the season in a typical district of lincolnshire where lifting is now in progress the crop is not yielding up to even the pour anticipations that had been indulged in the tubers are generally smallandinthelocality referred to not more than four tons per acre are

crops in ireland this season has been made thesubject of a series of inquiriss the results of which are published in the fakrmes gazeue izn most cases several reports are obtained from each county and the method adopted is to describe the vanous crops as if over average average or uncler average hom the reports as thus obtained we have preparedthe following tabular summarxo obtain ono uniform basis of comparison wecthe most unsatisfactory feature in this seasons results is undoubtedly afforded bythe tuber crop but as we have recently had occasion to show the irish cultivator is relying less upon the potato crop than he used to do neither flax nor wheat shows up well but the total area under these two crop does not much exceedo  acres and is about equally divided between them this year ireland has a smaller acreage of wheat than either wales or scotland and there are  english counties each of which grows a larger extent of wheat than the whole of ireland the area of wheat in the county of lincoln alone represents nearly four times the whole of the area cropped with this cereal in ireland the barley and mangel crops fall but little under average oats are a good average turnips are above average whilst the wealth of produce upon the meadows and pastures of ireland this year is exceptionally great taking the crops all round and bearing in mind the leading position occupied by the cattlebreeding industry iu ireland it is probable that  will establish its claim to be remembered as a good seasonjourintal of the royal agriculturalsocietythe country meeting held at manchester under

course of a paper on  the value of plant roots as tillers of the soil mr robert h flliot advocates the use of certainl coarsegrowing deeproot ing plants whicb by the free development of their rootsystems will gradually bring the soil into a fine mechanical condition and thereby render it susceptible of a higher degree of cultivation he writes from uraccical experience both in india and in the scotch lowlands and provides several concrete illustrations of the method which he favours after nearly a quarter of a centurys practice in laying down land to grass in almost every known way he feels convinced that ex cepting where from large applications of farmyard manure the humus of the soil has been well maintained it is more advantageous to lay down to permanent pasture after first sowing the land with a mixture con taining much cocksfoot yarrow chieory bhrnetand kidney vetch this would bo ploughed up after three years a crap of turnips or a green crop taken and the land then laid dowin to permanent pasture with the mixture most suitable to the soil and climate it would be instructive to ascertain how ths method would result in the case of soils different from those upon which it has so far been triedfield experimenters have often been puzzled by the absence of any additional yield of crop when farmyard manure has been supplemented by dressings ofartificial fertilizers the latter indeed have sometimes been proved in such cases to have absolutely depressed the yield several investigators in germany hbave been working for some time past with a view to ascertaining the cause of such apparentlv abnormal results and in a paper entitled rtecent experiments in denitrifica tion  professor inervllle describes and discusses what has been done in this direction the phenomena in question a ppear to afford yet another illustration of the manysided activty of the microorganisms which have become familiarly known under the general name of bacteria thre experiments described appear to leave no doubt that just as certain bacteria have the power of effecting the transformation in the soil of crude nitrogenous matter into soluble nitrates a form in which nitrogen is readily taken up by plants so others which exist in dung have the capacity of acting as denitrifyimg organisms attacking and decomposing the soluble nitrates aud dissipating the nitrogen in the elementary form hence the addition of nitrate of soda to land that had reeeived a dressing of dung might easily result in no consequent increase in the yield of crop nor is this loss of nitrogen confined to the most readily avail able sources of that element such as nitrate of soda for it is met with to an almost proportionate extent in suphate of ammonia and in organic manures fresh straw as occurring in litter seems to greatly favour the process of dentrification for it has been proved that as the age of dung decreases so does its denitrify ing capacity diminish experiments are described how ever which show that certain commonly used artificial manures such as kainit sand superphosphate of lime have the power of greatly intensifyig and prolongig the denitrifying action of dung wen fresh or com paratively fresh dung is applied to a crop and especially to a cereal crop it firequently causes the plants to assume a pale yellow unhealthy colour a result for which a rational explanation is now forthcoming in view of our recentlyacquired knowledge concerning denitrification is it possible to suppress the denitrify ing organisms in dung or at least to reduce their numbers  this is a question of high practical import ance and so far as investigation has gone it appears that the denitrifying bacteria can be largely destroyed alike by frequently turning dungheaps so as to induce rapid fermentation oxidation and a high temperature and by the addition of certain substances the most effective of which has up to the present been found to be sulphuric acid and sulphate of copper denitrifica tion undoubtedly offers a promising field for further investigationmr bear contributes a concluding paper on  the food supply of mauchester in the course of which he deals with the animal produce annually consumed in feeding the population of a great city he traces to their sources the immense quantities of beef mutton and pigmeat wvhich all the year round are findig their way into manchester the abattoirs and meat market the cold stores and the foreign animals wharf are described and illustrated other municipal bodies may be interested in learning that the work undertaken by the markets department of the manchester corporation is so judiciously done that out of a revenue of nearly � in b no less a sum than � was r aid over in aid of the public rates beef arrives on the hoot chiefly from ireland and vales live calves are mostly from the great dairy county of chester sheep and lambs largely from yorkshire and many other counties pigs mainly from ireland many of the anirnals are sent to the public abattoirs but there are still about a hundred private slaughterhouses in man chester and salford though fresh licences have for some time ceased to be granted frozen mutton and beef chilled beef tinned meat andbacon arrive from various countries beyond the seas and  tons of meat reached manchester by the ship canal in  ireland sends most of the poultry though at certain seasons russia hungary and germany figure largely france and italy send considerable numbers of turkeys and the former country contributes also chickens pigeons and geese frozen chickens of fine quality are received from australasia in cases of about a hundred each most of the poultry and game arrives by rail but last year  tons of poultry and rabbits were sent up the ship canal an enormous trade is done in eggs the chief source of spply being ireland followed by ger many france italy russia denmarklandcsanda large quantities of english eggs arrive from ferefordsbire and lincolnshire the eggs mostly reach the city by rail but  tona passed along the ship canal in  and it is calculated that this weight alone represents about  eggs the bulk of the milk supply is furnished by cheshire and derbyshire though some is received from staffordshire and lauca shire and a small quantity from shropshire it is estimated that the total annual supply is nearly  galons the people of manchester aloneexcluding salford and suburbsconsume about  gallons per head per yer and as the average retail value is d per quart their annual milk bill is not less than � it is noteworthy that producers and consumers prces for milk appear to approach each other more closely in manchester than in london though ranking next to the metropolis asa centre for the distrlbution of provisions generally it is quite possible that as regards butter alone manchester may claim the premier position with respect to danish and swedish butter if not for irish also there appears to be no question upon this point but london is the more important centre of the trade in english french and australian butter the consumption of butter in lancashire and yorkshire is greater than in most other parts of the country and it is perhaps greater per head thau in any other part of the world this being due to the high wages eamed by operatives and their families though it is said that these consumers demand the highest quality mr bear advances two arguments that do not agree with this assertion  in the first place danish butter said to be most in favour in the two counties is only secondrate and strikingly inferior to the finest produce of private dairies or wellmanaged creameries in the united kingdom or normandy again those who have been engaged in efforts to improve buttermaking in the north of england are emphatic as to the hindrance caused by the general likng of so many consumers for strong and salt butter heavy arrivals of irish butter take place during the summer and last year the ship canal conveyed cwt mainly from ireland a large trade is done in margarine about  pachkaes of from iewt to lcwt each beig received weedy in manchester vis hull and grimsby

which is a result very different from that of last year wben there was a balance of  per cent in favour of over average yields several reports speak of the beneficialinfluence of spraying in reducing
