mr morley at arbroathon suturday mr j shiress will qc mr morleys predeceasor in the representation of the montrose dis trict of burghs was presented by the electors with his portrait aud was afterwards entertained at dinner in acknowvledgment of his services to the constituency the presentation ceremony took place in the new pablic hai which was well filled mr morley occupied the chairmr morley saidmr shiress will did not enter parliament at a very happy conjuncture of political planets never was there rougher or stormier parlia mentary weather thah the weather during the ten years that hlr will represented theso burghs rough weather tries men but  am glad to be able to look back upon mr wills conduct during those difficult drys he stood firm from first to last there was nothing of the weak kneed politician about him cheers his batkbone was all right laughter nothing of the armchair politician and he carried his musket as steady as if he had been a veteran of  years standing cheers i had the pleasure of knowing mr shiress will during a little portion of that time from the olympian altitudes of the front bench where serenity and repose reign laughter and during that period i came to the con clusion t at he was exactly the kind of man that i would like to choose to go into a difficult battle and a difficult campaign with cheers we never had a man in our ranks wita less about him of that tire some kind of personality which the french deseribe as a bad sleeper there never was a man in the house i am looking at it not from the point of view of local duty bat from the point of view of parliamentary duty so free from the restlessness which besets some men even liberals for self advertisemenb cheers he never spoke unless ha had something to say and unless he knew somethig of the subject he was one of those steady faithful and honouruble men the existence of whom in the conservative camp and in our liberal camp makes party govermment possible cheers it is an encouraging thing that we have met to day to do honour to a man of that stame and i should be expressing my mind imperfectly ia i did not recognizc that he had behind him inspiring him no doubt a steady and a stanch constituency hear hear mr shiress will was your member for ten years before that you had a representative who sat for  years before that you had a representative who sat on for  years so that the montrose burghs for a neriod of  years only had three representatives making an average of  years apiece i think that speaks well for yon and it speaks well for the burghs i have not calculated in what year exactly the next year period will expire laughter but you will see when the tume comes cheersexprovost lamb brechin presented the portrait which was painted by mr robert gibb rsa it represents hr will in fullbottomed wig and gown and bears an inscription that it wvas presented to the learned gentleman by his former constituents in the montrose district of burghs hrespective of party in recognition of services rendered mr will in acknowledging the gift remarked that not the least of the pleasures ie had in looking back to the ten years during which he had represented the constituency was that he had left no enemies be hind and that both political friends and political enemies had joined in paying him this complimentthe complimentary dinner to mr will took place later in the day in the white hart hotel arbroath hr h francis webster president of the arbroath local association presided and vwith him on the plat form besides mr will were sir john leng mlp captain sinclair mipand mr jwcrombie mp the general company wns representative of the various burghs formding the montrose parliamentary groupthe ilman proposing the health of mr wil d scribed him as as man who had fought unflinchingly for his party and for the principles which that paty main tained on imperial questions he was eloquent re sourceful and ready in dtebate while ho was unwearied in his care of local interestsmr wrnn in responding exipressed special satis faction at the presence of so many of his political opponents at the same time he hoped the electors fully appreciated that they had broken the record with their present member and he hoped they would stick to mr morley with bonds of steel cheersexprovost japp montrose proposed  the houses of parliamentmr morley who was loudly cheered saidi cannot but thank my friend provost japp for the kind and even more than kind terms in which he has referred to my connexion with these burghs which gives him the ground for coupling my name with this toast he said truly enough that i croased the border but he went a great deal too far when he baid that i conferred any honour it was the other way  no no yes gentlemen i was cast out laughter at the other side of the tweed the tyne was an unlucky river in  and all the honour and kindness was yours assuredly not mine i am not going to make an election speech i know that i am m the presence of those who do not particularly wish me to be where i am and who would be very ha pyto see me put out if they got the chance laughter i have no quarrel with them for that but there are difficulties in a southerner coming to a country with its own customs laws and may i say without offence prejudices huar hear bat all i can say is that though my own shortcommsg have been many i have received from my new scottish friends nothing but unlimited indfness and unbounded indulgencethz house of lordsi fecl that the provost has given a testimonial to my general liberality of mind bf coupling my name with this toast because i cannot give an unqualified expres sion of approval or sympathy either for the heouse of commons or the house of lords for the house of commons as an institution i of course have the greatest reverence but the house of commons as at present constituted abounds in defects cheers as or the house of lords ir the language of the queens speech i am glad to be able to inform you that the relations between the house of commons and the house of lords are most harmonious laughter and cheers the most absolute and implicit confidence reigns between them the hereditary branch of the legislature and the elective branch vie with one another in a desire to meet one another to make concessions to swallow what we hadl rashly and improperl thought to be convictions and principles andal that is no doubt touchin andthere are as you well now in the modern political discussions a school of one chamber men and another school of twochamber men some are for one chamber some are for two chambers now both these great schools of political speculation are at present i think satisfied because the two chamber menhave the comfortand they sleep peaceably in their beds at night when they reflect that they have got two chambers and yet things go on just as if there were ouly one chamber hear hear that is all illustration which i am sure wmll be used byandby when the political controversy which i certainly will not touch on tonightwhen that political controversy comes up for public discussion of course if the house of lord for which i am now returning thanks laughter were a mere court for registering the aecrees of the house of commons even then we could not be more free than we are today from all quarrels collisions and deadlocks which ace as we see in other countries the bane and the mischief of the two chamber system of course i could easily pursue that topic much further but tonight is not a proper occasion other occasions will no doubt cometee hiouse of commonsnlow for the house of commons s nerfi al changes in manners and i think in costume laughtet have taken place but i really think that the qualities upon which the strength and the worth and the value of the house of commons dependi beheve those fundamental qualities are unchanged under the benignant firmness of mr speaker the proprieties of debate i should say in my  years experience have rather improved than gone back the spirit of fairplay which has generally not always mor in all cases but the spirit of fairplay which has generally marked the british house of commons andci daresay it marked the english house of commons before england became great britain laughter england became crest britain by adding scotland and the other partnership laughterbut the same spirit of fairplay which has always marked that parliamentary assembly at wvestminster i think still am sure still prevails checrs there is the same faithful observance of those honourable understandings for the transaction of business between men ofall parties with out which the machine of party government and i would even say of parliamentary government cannot be worked it was said by some gcanlemei who are here tonight that if you lowered the suffrage and made the house of commons more democratic you would lose all those elements of what is called culture in the house why we have got in the house of commons the most emineht greek scholar that this island possesses we have got two of the most eminent and accomplished historic authorities and i will undertake to say that there are no three men in the house of cpommois listened to with more intexest and morepleasure than those three learned and accomplished men the leader of the house of commons who belongs to this part of the island with the taste for metaphysics which i have always beard belongs to this part of the island laughter is a brilliant writer and abounds in speculative ingenuity therefore do not let it be supposed that the house of commons has gone back even in those pointsmior points in my viewof which we were warned that all culture and knoiwledge would by and by be squeezed out i once in a rash moment said something against government by masters of arts i said that i did not think that the most desirable form of government but i was reminded when i next appeared axiongst my friends in the house of commons that there is no place where masters of arts have so powerful a positionbecause in the last cabinet of which i was an unworthy member out of i house of commons representatives no fewer than nine bhre the stigmpa of masters of artj laughter the present government represented culture as we au know but on fit occasion i think i could show it is not quite so well off for masters of arts as we were but the house of commonsthough these are principles and aims i do not sympathize withthe present louse of commons is a place where you see men at their best both wvhen they are talking and when you see them in the inter course of the lobbies i hope it may be so for many a hiouse of commons to come it certainly has been so in nl the houses of commons i have known three four or five of them you will nd there the widest information upon all subjects that come before a great legislative and deliberative assembly you will fmd apart from spurts of party passion from time to time the besb and most patriotic temper and those are wrongand i am sorry to see critics in the press speaking in that tonethose are wrong who endeavour im any way whatever to belittle or degrade the house of commons whether it is a tory house of commons or a liberal house of commons cheers when i think of what a place the house of commons is i really wonder that my friend your guest of tonight mr shiress wil found it in his heart to leave ustue pleauirs of panliasuestary lifehe has drawn an idyllic picture tonight of sauntering through the lobby hand in hand i think he said laughter i have gone through the lobby many i suppose thonsands of times but i am not snre that i have gone  hand in hand  laughter  but i wonder n some ways that he having once tasted the delights of the saunters through the division lobbies could find in his heart to leave us i recollect the legislative proposal called the home rule bill in the year  there were  nights of that and there were many miles of these idyllic saunterings laughter how ever that may be i think we wvil hope that mr shiress will will have as many saunterings as he likes in the lobby upstairs where the committeerooms of parlia ment are cheers it is an illwind that blows nobody good and the rnwind that took my friend from you was not an illwind to some people of modest meritmodest meek meritwho would otherwise at this moment have been like the peri in the poem beating their wings in vain at the gates of the parlia mentary paradise for my own part i do not knowi am not quite surewhether it was a good exchange of a good sturdy rankandfile man in which we are a little deficient at presentwe are a little deficient in rankandfile men laughterwhether it was a good exchange a good sturdy honest rankandfile man for one of those luckless gentlemen who are called nominal leaders by noninal followers laughter i have said that indoors inside the house of commons though there have been superficial changes i believe the foundations remain where they were of course there is an enormons new demand made upon members of the house of commons new expectations and there is an enormous amount of what is called outdoor and extraparliamentary speaking and you see at this moment an awful example laughter mir pitt that illustrous minister so far as i can malke out only madeit is a hundred years ago sinee he was prime ministermr pitt i believe only made one outof doors speech in his career and that was a speech which the world will never forgeof three sentences only laughter i wonder what this host of gentlemen who are good enough to report our utterances to the publicwhat they would have made of a prime minister who only made one outofdoors speech and that only three sentences i wiu not tell you what those sentences werethey were very fme noble sentences but that is a matter of history i have said thab the country wiu certainly have to think twice or thrice before it lends an ear to any of those hostile utterances used of the house of commonsarltamxntarny governmentthere is no doubt that in some other countries par liamentary government is undergoing a severe strain rather severe when a prime minister has to go out and fight a duel with a member of the opposition which happened the other day in one of the european countries but so far as i can tell we are sound in this country in our allegiance our deepest allegiance i wonder that it should be questioned evenour allegi ance to government by an assembly popularly elected and the wider the elective body is in my judgment the better hear hear i would like to teol you of a passage which i read the other day in a letteri think at was of count cavour that faraous minister who achieved the deliverance and unification of italy there has been in my time no greater minister no greater benefactor to his country than cavour in our generation what cavour said was parliamentary government has its inconveniences like other govern ments but with all its inconveniencesit is worth more than all others he said he was sometimes impatient with oppositions but when he camo to think of it he congratulated himself upon these oppositions because they forced him to explain his ideas better and to redouble his efforts to win over their general opinion  believe me he said and be kind enough gentlemen of both parties to mark this  the worst of chambers is more to be preferred than the most brilliant of ante chambers we hear many things now said which might seem to show that that conviction which cavour expressed and which is an old conviction that sprang first of all in these islands is being weakened i do not believe that it is it will be an evil day if it ever should be and i feel very confident that this part of the island at all events will lend as i have said no ear to these disparagements of the house of commons just as perhaps in another part of the island they may be invited by other personsnot by meto lend no ear to the disparagements of the hereditary branch of the legislature i thank you for the cordial way in which you associated my name with this toast i hope that my friend mr shiress will who has broughtus all here together today will come among us agaiu hear hear anld i trust thaf whatever may happen in the parliamentarv fortumes of these burghs you wil always remain as you have proved yourselves today willng to receguize honourable poisical service honourable parliamentary eervice and as you have been good enough to associate me with the toast i hope i shall not fall short i will not say of seine of your expecta tions but of the good opinion which provost japp has been good enough to express cheers
