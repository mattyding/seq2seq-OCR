austriafrom ourb own cobresiondentvlinna oct the vienna municipal council has again attracted a share of that public attention which it nearly monopolized in the palmy days before the antisemite burgomaster dr lueger had achieved the height of his ambition and when he personally led his followers in many a hotly contested engagement the rathaus has once more been the scene of one of those discreditable scenes for which it has acquired a wellearned reputation the only difference being that this time the liberal opposition adopted the anti semitic method of blocking the way by persis tence in the use of unparliamentary language at the last sitting the second viceburgomaster apparently considering it high time that the party should remind the public that it remained faithful to its principles brought forward a motion protesting aaainst the action of the government in recently appointing a dispropor tionate number of jews to fill higher jadicial positions in austria this was alleged to be a striking advance on the progressive jndaicizing of the judicial service which was already seriously felt by the population it woulld lead to an increase in those instances in which jows would sit in judgment upon christians notwith standing the fact that experience proved the jew to be almost entirely incapable of under standing and sympathizing with the moral re ligious and national sentiments and views of aryan nations the viceburgomaster then pro posed that the government should be called upon to provide that no christian should be obliged to give evidence before a jewish judgeal member of the liberal opuosition ventured so characterize this motion as stupid mean and baseepithets which he repeated several times dr lueger at once excluded him from the sitting as well as two other councillors who joined i his protest this decision led to a general uproar ijncomplimentary terms were bandied between majority and minority and at one moment the spectators in the gallery be lieved that it had come to blowsa consumma tion which was however averted by the ultimate withdrawal of the three town councillorsthe fate of the agitator in office almost invari ably excites the commiseration of the charitable born for another element he is neither happy nor successful in the position to which he aspired and which he can neither enjoy nor utilize this is now the condition of the antisemitic majority in the vienna town council having absolute and uncontrolled power in its sittings and over the resources of the capital they have no oppor tunity for exercising the talent for obstruction that helped them into office and have nothing to extenuate their lack of administrative ability or their failure to realize the promises lavished at the hustings they are likely to have a heavy reckoning with the shopkeepers of the eaiserstadt for the damage done to trade by their treatment of the gas question and the disappointment of their other supporters will not be diminishad by the reversal of the parts played respectively by the antisemites and liberals in the corpora tion indeed it is not impossible that the posi tion which the antisemites won by means of reckless agitation and obstruction may be recap tured by similar methods aided by the mistakes of those who now hold office in the present state of public feeling in austria a fighting party how ever small has a distinct advantage over one that adopts merely defensive tactics which is now the case with dr luegers followers not only in the municipal council but also in parliament this is decidedly an instance in which a standstill may easily be turned into a retreat
