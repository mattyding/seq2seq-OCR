latest intelligencesir george white on indianfrontier policyrzom  coruespondtstsimla oct speading at a farewell dinner given in his honour by the members of the united service club last night the commanderinchief eulo gized the gallantry and endurance of the troops engaged on the frontier more especiallv the sikhs on whom the brunt of the fighting had hitherto fallen referring to the present cam paign ho saidthose who merelyaccept the fact that we are engaged in what they call one of our usual frontier wars without taking the trouble to dig down into the why and the wherefore are too apb to attribute these wars to mistakes of policy and maladministrationof ourrelations with the tribes maen and they clamour for wiser heads todirect us but the history of all times has shown that civilization and barbarism cannot exist conter minously and at the same time peaceably as inde pendent neighbours the savage will not subject himself to the restraining influences which enable communities more advanced to live at peace this is more especiallythe case among our border tribes who pride themselves on their individual liberty on obeying no order and on being no mans servanta the younger and more turbulent spirits turn a deaf ear to the wiser graybeards and will not restrain their aggressive proclivities in the interests of the tribo at large the tide once turned gathers strength in its flow and at length carries all before it in its onward course not even excepting those who in the earlier stages offered wiser counsels but who now ride on tho crest of the fanatical wave to avoid being carried back by its after ebb and swamped in tbat ocean of persecution which awaits those who have been lukewarm in the cause of the faiththe quarrels in which we are now engaged and which are costing us untold gold are none of our seeking but being in them we hope to bear ourselves so that the opposer may beware of us for some time we hear a great deal of abuse of the  forward  policy but look back on the history of the world and you will see that by fates inexorable decree civilization must advance and savagery recede history does indeed present a few lamentable instances in which barbarism has conquered civilization but that civilization had become effete and i hope that in this company at all events there is no englander little enough to wish so terrible a realization of his theories as regards englands great and beautiful civilizing mission in the east the causes of the advance of civilization are not far to seek the pressure of constant watchful ness becomes intolerable when in presence ofpeople who respect no engagements and who may be in friendly intercourse with you in the morning and advancing in thousands before night armed and prepared to murder and ravih the commanderincbief continuing said that this was no fancy picture but what had actually happened within the last few weeks on the frontier not on one point but on several he instanced the afridi rising as a case in point so long as we had on our border  of the most turbulent and finest fihting interial in the world unrestrained by civilized government and fired by fanaticism we should never have peaceo be relied upon but must stand always armed and ready bvr year that the existing condi fions obtained on the frontier we must expect the tribes to be better armed and therefore arrayed in greater strength against us the curepeared to be to pursue a policy of closer control and disarmament greater crises than the pre sent might have to be faced and there were many particulkrs in which our armaments were insufli cient and our preparations imperfect the ex pense however of constantly maintaining a state of military preparedness was enormous and the cry of bloated armaments had a paralyzing effect on military efficiency all the same indias socalled bloated armaments were leaner than those of any other nation in anything like parallel circumstances the commanderin chief concluded as follows i am no jingo those with whom i have had the honour to be associated in the government of india would perhaps testify that t have been as anxious to steer clear of causes of war as any of mny civil colleagues but thouh we may do all that a paramount power may do to avoid giving just cause of war we now know better than ever that we cannot safeguard ourselves for  hours from its consequences and as long as circum stances compel us to allow religious fanaticism and race hatredpassions which make earth a hellto go armed and uncontrolled within striking distance of us we should be living in a fools paradise if we were to restrict expenditure on the means of countering aggression instan taneously wherever it may dresent itself what i have said represents my own opinion only but ina constitution such as ours where illogical hut timeserving compromises play so important a part and where real public opinion is some thmng widely apart from its expression in a party vote it behoves the government of india to exercise its rule over the dangerous elements which are included in and border on this great empire strongly and on the principles that are applicable to them and not by compromise or inapposite comparisons writh communities w ho have qualiied for the laws under which they live by centuries of civilizationsir george whites speech was
