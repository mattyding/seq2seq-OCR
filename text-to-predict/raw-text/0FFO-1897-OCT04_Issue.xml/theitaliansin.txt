the itaijians in africa  nox our owl coilespondznromf oct the semiofficial opinionc which it may be well to state is rather the personal organ of the marquis di rudini than that of the ministry as a whole devotes this evening a long article to tho african question as the subjoined extracts will showv the article is of some importance more perhaps on account of its tone than because of the statements it contains strangely enough its publication coincides with the absence from rome of the marquis visconti venosta minister for foreign affairs who is understood to have exercised a wholesome and moderating influence upon the marquis di rudini dring the recent deliberations on the african question there is reason to believe that up to the time of the foreign ministers departure from rome in the middle of last week no decision had been taken by the italian government with regard to hassala although the reported suspension of the sudan campaign had excited some apprehension in official circles wlhile it might be invidious to attempt to determine precisely the personal responsibility for the present utterance it may be said that on internal evidence the inspiration would seem rather to have come from the premier who authorized the issue of the notorious green bools on zeila last year than from the practised diplomatist who preside at the italian foreign officethe article begins by stating that the two knottiest points of the african question were the frontier negotiations with menelik and the evacuation of kassala on the first point it declares  nucertainty can no longer exist nor discussions arise nor delays be feared italy has loyally accepted the boundary proposed by mlenelik and considered best calculated tv main tain the safety and to facilitate the defence of her interests now and in the futureif communication with abyrsinia wrere as easy as with european states continues the article the last word on this subject would be said within a week but two rmonths are necessary for an eschange of communicataions with the fegus therefore a little patience is needful besides before italy definitely retires within her new frontier she is in duty bound to arrange for and guarantee the future of the native tribes hitherto under her sway but the inevitable delay changes notbing in the real con dition of the question  the step is taken  there is no turning back the war is liquidated the government wil be able before parliament to boast of having faithfully executed iis will sic the first point is clearly positively and decisively settledalthough less exensive the second issue that of kassala adds the pruldinian organ was of a charcter no less delicate and difficult the acquisition of kassala was fatally easy and was perhaps the greatest blunder of italian colonial policy the only justifcation for so rash a step was the advisability of enhancing the presige of the colony by militar successes and of seconding englanld in furthering the wvork of civilization but unfortunately the defeat of adows inter vened to cool so ardent andacostly nintoxica tion and rendered kassala useless and angerous to italy therefore the goverment decided to abandon the place and entered into negotiations with englanci for its retrocesion to egypt since the substitution of england for italan rule would in addition to relieving the latter of a neavy burden have constituted a formidable bulrk for the protection of the western frontier of erythreali it is known continues the omnim thatwhen our firm intention to evacuate a announced in london the xnglish gcernient although recognizing our right madw repeated requests for delay these were granted because the courtestowards a friendly state harnonised entirely with the hope of advantage for uis but in end asrecently put to this uncertainty alo the italian occupation of lasla wrill cease at latest on december  we do not know and none can foresee what may happen in this interval lut just asitaly will not agree in any circumstances whatever to prolong that interval so she will not be induced to shorten it neither by parliamentary considera tions nor by diplomatic wheedling nor by military threats by precipitate action wo should run the risk of compromising or losing the advan tages which compensate us today but which would be too enticina for the morrow we do not know whether qngland will push forward to kassala this year should she do so we should the day afterwards with the greatest honour with draw the tokens of our possession should she not do so we should do whatever might seem best according to circumstances but we would not protract by a single day the duration of onr sacrifices and of our perils thus the other point is settled thus the second knot is loosenedwe understand that all this will not please those who meditate an african policy at variance with that of the ministry but we hold that the ministry will obtain the applause of the majority which impelled it in this direction by expressions of its will and strengthened it with expressions of confidencewhile the foregoing lucubrations hardly err im point of courteous phraseology or sin by excess of coherence they leave no doubt as to the general tenour of the decisions by which the marquis di lrudini intends to secure the plaudits of his majority it is however characteristic that advantage should have been taken of the foreign isters absence from trome to secure the insertion of sulch an article in the semiofficial organ on this account and in this connexion it may nob be out of place to record the exact words used by the marquis visconti venosta with regard to kassala during the debate on the foreign estimates last july  the intention of the gtovernment he said is to cease the occupation of kassala as soon as pos sible but in leaving kassala we cannot allow it tofall into the hands of the dervishes the abandonment of kassala ought not to be the abandonment of that policy of friendship which inspires our relations with england there can be no question as to italys right to retire from kassala when and how ine will but in an nouncing her determination to retire at all costs on a given date the marquis di pudini might with advantage have profited by past mistakes and have instructed his organ to introduce into its language a little more of the diplomatis wheedling to which it so scornfully refers
