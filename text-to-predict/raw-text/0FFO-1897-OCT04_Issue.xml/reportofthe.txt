report of the west indiacommissionthe report of the west india royal cora mission was issued on saturday together with a subsidiary report by dr mforris assistant director of the royal gardens at kew and contains diagrams maps and appendicesiunder the instructions conveyed to the conk missioners in tbe covering letter from the secretary of state for the colonies which accompanied the royal commission sir ienry norman sir david barbour and sir edward grey were requested not only to take into general consideration the condition of the sugar industry in the west indian colonies but to ascertain especially the causes of the present depression of thi sugar industry whether they promise to be temporary or permanent whether they pro ceeded wholly from the continental system of granting bounties to continental sugargrowers or whether they could be traced to independent causes such as extravagance in management imperfection in processes of manufacture evils resulting from absentee ownership the com mssioners were also directedto examine whether if the sugar industry were proved unable to maintain itself there were any fair prospects of other industries successfully replacing it which could supply employment for the labotring population they were instructed that it was of great importance to ascertain what effect the total or partisl extinction of the sugar industry would be likely to have upon the condition of tho labouring classes and upon the revenne of the colonies concerned and they were invited to state whether the eolonies would be able to pro vide the necessary cost of administration in cluding the extra charges for relief likely to be thrown apon their exchequerswithout snbvention from the mother country if it appeared that subventions would be necessary the com missioners were instructed to report npon the probable amountsthe answers to such comrehensive inquiries have involved an exposition of the industrial and to some extent the political history of all the west indian islandsfor a considerable period and the bluebooks just issued contain matter of unusual interest the report of the commissioners is divided into three parts part i deals with goneral questions affecting the economic condi tion of al the west indian colonies part il deals with each colony iu detail and shows the very great difference which exists between their several conditions part ill contains the con clusions drawn from a consideration of the wholelfirst with regard to the causes of the de pressiou of the sugar industry the commissioners reportalthough in recent tears cane disease has shown itself in some of the islinas your majestys west indian possessions appear to be practically as well suited in the present day for the production of sugar molasses and rmn as they were in former times and the unpro fitableness of the industry and the resulting general depression arc due solely to the fall in the prices of these commodities and in a special degree of course to the great fall in the price of sugar which is by far the most important of them how great this fall in price has been will be clearly seen by the following figures statement showing the average prices at which refinedand unrefined sugar were imported into tbe united eingdom in each of the last  years deduced from the declared quantities and values of the imports fur nished to the commissioners by fir a e bateman of the board of tradethis great iali in the prices of sugar has rendered sugarcane cultivation unureftable for the time being and we are unable to end any good grounds for holding that any material rise mn price is liely to occur in the immediate future as a matter of fact the prices for  have ranged much below those of sny previons yearconcurrently with the fal in the price of sugar there has been a heavy fall in the prices of molasses and rum the value of dlemerara rum has declined from s fd rer gallon in  to is old per gallon in  and the value of molasses which in barbados a few years ago was as high as c a gallon and in antigua not much lower has now falen to c a galon or even less this depreciation in the byproducts of sugar has contributed appreciably to the present depres sion in the industryafter aiing figures which show notwitistsncd ing the all in price an increase in the produc tion of sugar n the lat  years from  tons in  to tons in ons in  the report proceedsit will be seen that there has been a great in crease in the total production of sugar and to that increase which has been acmompanied by a progressive economy in production must the fall in the price of sugar be maimiy attributed the chief increase has been in beet sugar which is illeged to be the dominant factor in regulting the price m the present day the production of beet sgagr has been stimnulated by the grant of bounties and withi the past year germany and austria bave doubled their bounties on the export of sugar and prance has very largely increased hers the bounties vay in amount at the present time from about � los a ton in france to t s and  s on raw and refined sugar respetively in germany the total pmduction of uropean bountyfep sugar i is estimated to have beeii more fan  per cent of the total production of sngar of all kinds dealt with in the great markets bf the worldthe production of sugar in the united sites of america is increasing and not onlv has the industry in that country the protection afforaed by a high import duty but some of the state legislatures of the union also offer a bounty on the produetion of beet sugar there is reason to doubt whether the production of cane sugar is likely to be very greatly extended in the united states but the beetsugar industry may attain very lae dimensions and some authbrities think that a time wll come when the united states will lroduce all the sugar wlhich they consumein the united states countervailing duties have quite recently been imposed on bountyfed sugar in addition to the very high import duty which is levied on al sugar and there is some expecationthat this change will increase the demand for cane sugar and raise the price of sugasr produced in the west indiesit seems to us however that the result of im posing such duties on beet suga imported into the united states may be the substitetion of beet for cane sugar in markets which mow take cane sugar and that for this and other reasons the effect on the price of cane sugar due to this cause is not likely to be so con siderable or permanent as materiady to affect the problems with which we have to dealjudging by the course of events in the past it might be held that as the fal of priee in  was followled by a rise so the fall of  might equally pass away but unfortunately the conditions have mot remained the same germany and austria as we have already stated doubled the rates of bounty in august  and france increased them by an amount varying from � s to l s per ton in may  it is impossible therefore to argue thabt as there was a recovery from the depression of  there must bea similar recovery from that which exists at presentafter the intention to increase the germoan and austrian bounties was announced the price of sugar fell by mnuch more than the amount of tbe increase and since those bounties came into operation there has beena slow but continuous fall in price which must have dis  coumted much even of the large addition to the french bountythe immediate result of a failure of the sugar industry would in the opinion of the com misbiones bea great want of employment for the labouring classes and the rates of wages which have already faulen would in all probability be still furtber reduced the public revenue would fall off and the goverments of some of your majestys posessions would be mnable to meet the absolutely necessary public expenditure including interest on debt while additional outlay would have to be incurred in providing for the popula tion by emigration or otherwise and the general standard of liring would be reduced to a lamentable extent in every oolony which is largely dependent on sunarislands which are likely to suffer most in such a eontingency are barbados antigua st vincent st mittsneris mioutserrat and probably st lucia  but none of them would esape except grenada british guiana would also suffer severely and the problem to be dealt with in that colony mnight prove to be cne of az ona difficult jamaica itrinidad have other resources and the export of sugar from dominica has already been largely reduced and now contributes less than onesixth of the value of the total exports from that islandin british guiana and trinidad the necessity for keepieg faith with the east indian immigrants and of repatriating those of them who had a right to a free passage to india and wished to take advantage of that right might involve a lare expenditure which under the circumstances must fall upon the public fuds as it would be imnpossible to levy the cost from the sugar estatesthe remedies whichmight be adplied to the existing state of things are classecd under three headsa the restoration of the sugar industry to a con dition in which it can be profitably carried on b the substitution of other and profitable agri cultural industries for the cultivation of the sugarcanec the adoption of subsidiary measures which may assist in preventing or alleviating the strain which is nbout to be experienced by the colonies in question such as greater economy in public expenditure the pro motion of emigration from places where the population is excessive aid generally the encouragement of all measures having a tendency to mainmiin the wellbeing of the population of these remedies the first is tne only one that would completely avert the dangers which now threaten your mjestys west india possssions any other measures that might be adopted could only be slowly a pplied and must in some cases at least be found in the outcome to be partial and inadequatethe discussion of the first of these remedies occupies the greater part of the report under this head the probable effect of the abolition of bounties is first discussed the commissioners concur in the opinion that the abolition of the bounty system is of course an object at which to aim and express the following viewthe benefit which the british empire as a whole derives from any lowering of the price of sugar due to the opceration of the bounty system is too dearly purchased by the injury which that system imposes on a limited classnamely your miajestys west indian and other subjects dependent on the sugar industrynor must it be forgotten that the system of giving bounties has introduced an element of uncertainty ito the sugar industry which has helped to shake its credit the evidence giver to us has been unanimous in asserting that the industry in the west indies has no credit and though the fact that this industry is no longer generally profiable would be sufficient to account for this yet there exists also a fear that bounties may be increased and cause prices to falltill lower this apprehension must prejudice th ccredit of such estates as are now being worked at a profit and in the event of a rise in the price of sugar taking place would materially interfere with the revival of credit rhich might otherwise resultbut the commissioners also make this im portant expreasion of opinionit has we believe been argued that the reduc tion in the price of sugar which has resulted from the bounty system is such a source of gain to the british empire as a whole that it would not be right for your majestys government to initiate any measures to bring about the abolition of that system in that argument we do not concur by far the greater portion of the fall in the price of sugar which has conferred so great a boon on the consumer is not duo to the existence of bounties and would not be lost if they were abolishedthe fall in the price of sugar is mainly due to a lowering of the cost of production of both beet and cane sugar andin so far as this is the casethe abolition of the bounties would not affect the price some british industries possess an advantage over their foreign cor aetitors twg to the low price of sugar in the ujnited kingdom but the difference between the high price in foreign countries and the low price in england is due far more to the high internal taxation and prohibi tive customs duties levied in the former than to the effect of the bounties in lowering the price here the amoutt of the bounties varies from � b per ton in germany to � los per ton in france but the internal taiation in germany is fq per ton and in francer per ton with surtales on foreign sugarthe commissioners are of opinion that under any circumstances the days of very large profits on the production of sugar have gone by andin those portions of the west indies which are unsuited for the establishment of large fac tories equitped with the best machinery end which do in iou clm ate and the supply of labour possess special advantages for the producton of sugar even the abolition of the bounty system ould probably fabl to restore the indestry to a condition of permanent prosperityeven assuming the abolition of bounties it would be impossible to forecast the effects on the west indian industry which may in time be brought about by the maintenance of the present protective policy of the united states of america the united states affords the best and the natural market for the west iudies and if that market should be closed or lost to west indimn sugar the colonies must suffer severelythe principal remedies proposed by the west indian sugargrowers are the imposition by her majestys government of countervailing duties on bountyfed sugar with the alternative of direct bounties to be given to west lndian sugar both theso proposals are discussed as reaards the grant of bounties the commissioners are in accordwe have considered whether it would be expedient to recommend the grant of a bounty on sugar produced in the wvest indies and find ourselves unable to recom mend this coursethe adoption of such a measure would entail the levy of special duties cn west indian sugar in the united states which is at present its chief and best market as the government of that country has already imposed countervailing duties on bountyfed sugar it would also at once rrise difficulties m connexion with sugar produced in india queensland iauritius fiji and other british possessionsit has been suggested that the difficulty which might arise in connexion with the united states market could be obviated by giving the bounty only on sugar exported to the united kingdom the amount of such bounty to be effective in maintaining the west indian sugar industry must be high enough to include compensation for the disadvantage in freight under which west indian sugar comes to the british as com paed with the united states market in addition to the s a ton which we have been informed is the least rise in price required under present conditions to maintain the industry the total amount of the bounty therefore could not in our opion be less than � a ton and would in tie case of west indian sugar alone lead to a charge of at least � a year we do not see how this bounty could equitably be refused to india or to any other part of the british empire which produced either beet or cane sugar and in that case the charge apart from the possible indirect consequences of introdgeing a system for the grant of bounties wrould he altogether out of proportion to the advantages to be gainedit must also be borne in mind that past experience in other countries has shown that bounties when once given are nob easily withdrawn and that they have a tendency to defeat the object with wbich they were granted in consequence of which continual pressure arises to have them increased the grant of bounties on cane sugar exported from british possessions might stimulate production to an extent which would cause a further fall in price sufficient largely to neutralize their effect on the industry and pressure would then be brought to bear with the object of having them raised it would be difficult to resist this pressure if it had been accepted in principle that the sugar industry in the west indies ought to be supported by the grsnt of bountiesas regards the imposition of countervailing duties sir david barbour and sir edward grey have come to one conclusion and the chairman sir henry norman records his dissent from them in a separate note appended to the report not withstanding the very grave dangers which all three commissioners perceive to threaten the prosperity of the west indian colonies in the event of a failure of the sugar industry sir david barbour and sir edward grey do not recommend the imposition of countervailing duties on bountyfed sugar the following are some of their objectionsthe imuposition of countervailinz duties would have the effect of excluding beet sugar to a greater or less extent from the united kingdom and of causing its place to be taken by cane sugar but in view of the great extent of the market in the united kingdom as com pared with that of other markets open to beet sugar end of the fact that countervailing duties bave beenimposed on the same elass of sugar in the united states of america we have little doubt that the supply of beet sugar to the british mirket would for a time at least continue to be large beet sugar wvhich enjoys the benefit of a specially high scale of bounties such as beet sugar produced in france would probably ba sent as far as possible to those countries in which counter vailing duties were not levied whilst the beet sugar on which the lowest bounties were paid would flow to the british uarket west indian and other cane sugar sent to the united kingdom would bave to compote with raw beet sugar on wbhich would be levied a duty of � s a ton and it is quite possible that the imposi tion of a countervailing duty of � hion raw beet sugar might not raise the price of sugar by so much as � s a ton if it raised the price of sugir by more than that amount raw beet sugar produced mn germany would be in a better position than before and its pro duction would be stimulated though the german reiner would no doubt lose the special advantage which he at present enjoys if it raised the price by exactly � s a ton german beet would be in precisely the same position as at present for reasons aready stated we hesitate to express a decided opinion as to the actual rise iq prces that would follow the imposition of a counterviling duty but it seems to us thatthe rise due to this cause would not exceed � s a ton andmiiht be considerably less the burdenof the countervaeig duty on say raw beet sugar of german origin iwould in all probability be distributed between thel consumer and the producer  if so thoe rise in price would be less than � s per ton and though the producer of bountyfed beet sugar might get a lower price than ie receives at present it is not clear that theyoductioa of such sugar would fall off or even thatthe present rate of increase of such production would be seriously checked a rise of price such as might reasonably be anticipated from the imposition of courtervailing duties would not ccordidg to the representations made to us in evidence place the west indian sugar industry in a satisfactory position the different witaesses who hate given evidence do not agree as to the increase in price which would make the industry profitaba some thought that it would require a rise of price of � or � a ton to have the efect the witnesses whom we examined in trinidad and who had practical experience of the working of wellequipped factories thought that a rise of os ner ton would make the business barely profitable in ritish guiana the necessary rise was stated at s per ton with a countervailing duty of s a ton on raw beet sugar produced in germany the rise in price might be sub stantially less than s a ton whatever the rise might be it would stimulate the production of csne sugar and bring into operation a cause tending to reduce priceswhilst therefore we think that the imposition of counltervailing duties on the import of bountyfed sugar into the ujnited kiingdom would cause some rise in price and benefit west india sugargrowers we consider it impossible to predict precisely what the amount of that rise wiould bewhether it would be permanently maintained and whether the effeot of the duties would be such as to enable wfest indian cane sugar thenceforward to compete successfullywith beet sugar in the british mirketthe levy of countervailing duties in the utnited eingdom would also probably involve the imposition of similar duties in india and in some of the colonies of australia both of which countries at present receivesulelevyof countervailing duties on bountyfed sugar might raise serious didleulties under the operation of the most favoured nation clause in commercial treaties with foreign nations and it vwould not be to the advantage of the united kingdom to encourage any laxity in the interpretation of that clausein view of all the foregoing considerations namely the loss to the britishl consumer that would result from any rise in the price of sugar  the incon venience to trade that would be caused by the imposi tion of countervailing duties  the uncertainty whether any such measure would permanently save the sugaradustry in the west indies  the inexpedienoy of raismg uestions connected with the interpretation of the most avoured nation clause which might have the efect of weakening its force  and finally the danger direct and indirect of departing from what has hitherto been considered to be the settled policy of the united king domwe have been unable to agree in a recommenda tion that such duties should be imposed at the same time we consider it to be our duty to draw attention to the precarious condition of the sugar industry in the west ndies to the very serious consequences to the colonies which must result from a failure of that industry and to the fact that the levy of countervailing duties is practically the only remedy pressed upon us by the witnesses we have examined which rests in the hands of your majestys governmentsir henry normnn on the other hand has come to the conclusion that no means brought under the notice of the commissioners seems to afford  such a good prospect of helping the sugar industry in the west indies as the imposi tion of countervailing duties adopting the other views of the report i differ from my colleagues he saysin their objection to the imposition of counterv iling duties on bountyaided sugar brought into the united lingdom and i would urge that duties should be levied on such sugar to an amount equal to the bountv that has been paid on it by any foreign governmentthe interests that are affected by the decline of the sugar industry in the west indies are of a momentous character  and i think the british public hardly realize the ruin that must follow a collapse of that industry such a collapse would seriously affect even the west indian colonies wbich have other industries to fall back upon tuch as trinidad and jamaica but british guiana with nearly  people barbados with andallthe vwindward and leeward islands excludinggreuada and dominica and perhapsmlontserrat may be said to have nothing to export exeedb the products of the sugar cane the inhabitants of those colonies would therefore be without the means of purchasing imported articles of food or of paying taxes the bulk of which are indeed derived from customs duties levied on imports or from excise the planters must be ruined many others who hi ve drawn mcomes from sugar properties will be seriously affected the tradesmen artisans and labouring classes will suffer privation and probably become discontented and restlessand the revenue will be so crippled as to render it impossible to carry on the governmeut even on the most economical scale in any condition at all approach ing to efficiency nor will it be practicabln to meet obligations for interest on debt or to provide for the rehef of the poor or to maintain the hospitals and schools or to pay the police force  while in guiana and possibly in trinidad there would be a demand for the repatriation of large numbers of indian coolies to meet the cost of which measure funds would not be forthcoming already some of these colonies labour under a deicit and this deficit is probably inereasingit must be admnitted that if countervailing duties are levied and have the desired effect the people of the united kingdom will have to pav more for their sugar than they do at present perlaps to the extent of a halfpenny a pound but it has to be borne in mind that the people of this country have been for many years purchasing sugar at a much lower price than tbat which prevails in other european countries and that while they have enjoyed this advantage their west indian fellow subjects have been brought to the brink of ruin owing to their not obtaining a remunerative price for their sugar it wrould also as suggested in the report be possible to apply the duties raised on bountyaided beet sugar to purposes which would be beneficial to those efasses whlich would be most likely to feel the pressure of a rise in the priee of sugari am aware that i am advocating a measure which is sure to meet with severe criticism and opposition but i feel bound respectfully to submit my views as there seems to be no measure except the imposition of countervailing duties wshich is likely to save a con siderable group of british colonies from serious disaster or prevent obligations falling on the mnother country whuch will be very onerous and very difficult to meet in a satisfactory mannerthe commissioners concrar in the opinion that the sugar industry is the main staple of west indian existence and that its present depressed condition is not due to rhe apathy or mismanage ment of west indian sugargrowers but to circumstances over which they have no control the commissioners take the following view of certain special obligations of the mother country towards the islandsthe black population of these colonies was originally placed in them by force as slaves the race was kept up and increased under artificial conditions maintained by the authority of the british government what the people were at the time of emancipation and their very presence in the colonies at all were wing to british action or to the action of other european nations for the results of whosepolicy the united kingdom assumed responsibility on taking possession of the territories in question  we could not by the single act of freeing them divest ourselves of responsibility for their future which must necessarily be the outcome of the past and of the present for generations the great mass of the population must remain dependent upon british inffuence for good goverment and generally for the miintenance of the progress that they have made hitherto we caunot abandon them and if economie conditions become such that private enterprise and the profits of trade and cultivation cease to attract white men to the colonies or to keep them there this may render it more difricult for the british government to discharge its obligations but will not in any way diminish the force of them we have placed the labourinz population where it is and created for it the conditions moral and material under wshich it exists and we cannot divest ourselves of responsibility for its futurethere is slso another consideration which in our opiniou ouhtgh not to be overlooked the distress which is begidniig to be felt by the population  the difficulty in which some of them are already or may soon be p laced of finding a livelihood  the still more certain dficulty of providing for their government and education will be due to the failure of the sugar industry which is in turn partly due to the protective policy of other countries and to the bounties which some of theam grant on the production or export of sugar to some extent at say rate these bounties and this policy have made sugar cheanr outside the countries in question a resut by whicht british consumer has gained very largely whilst therefore it is unfair to say that the cause of the depression in the west indies is due to any act of the british govern ment we cannot overlook the fact that the british people have been reaping great benefit from orecisely that set of circumstances which has been actor in bringing the west indies to the verge of serious disastercertain measures of relief of which the total cost amounts to about pooo are proposed the report is finally summarized as followsfinally we beg leave to submit the following sum mary of our conclusionsa the sugar industry in the west indies is indanger of great reduction which in some colonies may be equivalent or almost equivalent to extinctionb the depression of the industry is due to the com petition of other sugarproducng countries and in a special degree to the competition of beet sugar produced under a system of bounties it is also affected by high protective tariffs and by the competition of cane sugar the production of which is specially encouraged by the governments concerned the cruses of the depression may be described as permanent inasmuch as they are largely due t the policy of foreigacouatries and there is no indication that that policyis likely to be aban doned in the immediate futurec it is not due in any considerable degree to ex travagance in management to imperfection in the pro cess of manufacture or to inadequate supervision consequent on absentee ownership and theremoval of these causes wherever they exist would not enable it generally to be profitably carried on under present conditions of competition in many places in tbe west indies sugar is not manufactured according to the best and latest processes but even the estates which have introduced the best machinery suffer from th depression and we have little doubt that the latest machinery would be much more generally employed but for the general and apparently wellfounded conviction thatc with the assistance of sch machineri fa businescould not be profitably carried on in places where large actories equipped with the best machinery cannot be established owing to local causes it is doubtful if the sugar industry could under any circumstances be restored to a condition of permanent prosperity except possibly in loealitieswhich enjoy very special advan tages in soil climate and labour supplyd the depression in the industry is causing sugar estates to be abandoned and wvill cause moreestates to be abandoned and such abandonment is causing and will cause distress among the labouring population including a large number of east indian immigrants and willseriously affect for a considerable time the general prosperity of the sugarproducing colonies and will render it impossible for some and perhaps the greater number of them to provide without external aid for their own government and administrationc if the production of sugar is discontinued or very largely reduced there is no industry or industries that could completely replace it in such islands as barbados antigua and st kitts and be profitably carried on and supply employment for the labouring population in jamaica in trinidad in british guiana in st lucia in st vincent and to some extent in mdoatserrat and nevis the sugar industry may in time be replaced by other industries but only after the lapse of a con siderble period and at the cost of much displacem
