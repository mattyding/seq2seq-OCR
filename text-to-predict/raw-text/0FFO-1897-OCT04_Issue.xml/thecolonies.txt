the coloqesthr rxepoir or tehe west india commissionthe publication of the report of the west india commission places at the disposal of the public a series of documents of most unusual interest the bluebooks in which it is presented contain not only a very important expression of opinion upon the present condition of the west indian colonies formed by competent judges after full examination of witnesses on the spot but add also a contribution of permanent value to the recorded materials of wlest indian history the investigations of the commissioners have been conducted on so systematic a method their inquiry has been so thorough ancd searching the presentation of their evidence is so full and the conclusions of the report are drawn up in so just a spirit of impartial observation that no one who is interested in west indian affairs can fail to appreciate the great iimportance of the informa tion which hzs been rendered available forgeneral use facts have at last been collected of which the authenticity is assured and the government and the public are placed in a position to come to aome wellinformed conelusions as to the extent and causes of prevailing depression in the west indies and as to the steps which the obligations of a great country contracted nder somnewhat peculiar circumstances towards these special colonies render it necessary or desirable for the imperial government to tako in alleviation of a very critical positionthe conclusions of the commissioners will not offer pleasant reading to those who are disposed to take a sanguine view of westindianprospects there can be no question in the light thrown upon west indian affairs by the repert of the very grave difficulties which most of the colonies are called upon to confront their resources in the majority of cases depend mainly upon the maintenance of the sugar industry the sugar industry under present conditions is threatened with extinction and without help the majority of the west indian colonies must in the event of the destruction of their mcain source of income lapse into bankruptcy followed by administrative barbarism their large negro population left without means either of subsistence or of emi gration can hardly be expected to tolerate such a condition of affairs in silent submission riot and anarchy must ensue and the scandal would be such as evidently in such an event to necessi tate imperial interventicn at any cost the urgent question which the report sets itself to answer is at what cost this position can by reasonable prevision be avertedthe period of depression wifii which the report reals more particularly is comprised in the last  years during which time the manufacture of beet sugar on the continent of europe has been rapidly developed under the continental system of giving bounties on exported sugar and protect ing home manufacture by a heavy customs duty at the present moment theexport bountypaid by germany which is the principal competitor of the west indian colonies is � s a ton and the protective customs duty is � a ton the export bounty paid by france is � s a ton and the protective customs duty is  in both countries an excise duty e valent in amount to the customs duty is paid by the sugargrowers but the absence of competition secured to them by the protective system enables them to recoup themselves handsomely in the price of sugar charged to the home consumer the average price of fsgar on the continent is from d to id a pound dearer than it is in eng land and the cost of the continental system to the consumers of france germany and austria calculated on the consumption of those three countries combined reaches a total of � a year the amount paid in bountv as nearly as it could be calculated but based on figures collected before the late increase in the rate was for the three countries combined �c a year the gross cost of the continental system to the tbree principal countries named is on this basis � a year but the amount of the excise duty collected from the sugar growers must be deducted it amounts to � a year the net average cost of the system to the continental taxpayers is �oo a year of which as has been seen the sum paid in bounties is a relatively sall fractionbearing these figures in mind the figures given inthereport become moreinstructive during the period with which the commissioners have elected to dealthat is the period in which the continental system has been in full operation the report shows that the amount of sugar pro duced in the world has risen from  tons in  to  tors in s and that prices have fallen from s per cwt in  for refined sugar and s for unrefned to s per cwt for refined and to s for unrefined sugar in  mr morris in his subsidiary report notes the fact that in the principal sar producing colony of british guiana where production is carried on by the newest improved methods the cost of production has fallen in the same period from �d ls d a ton to � and in some exceptional cases to � os d per ton in round figures we get therefore the striking fact that the quantity of sugar produced in the world has been doubled and that the cost of produc tion and the price have been halved in the course of the last  years if these results were evenly distributed over the whole ares of sugar produc tion the west indian industry should be exactly where it was and the immense benefit of reduced price to the consumer be all pure gain tinforta nately this is not the case the production of west indian sugar has not kept pace with the production of the world althoughit has increased it has not doubled in the period named and it is only the more advanced sugar growers who have sulcceded in literally halving their cost of pro duction others have reduced it but not yet to the necessary figure the only part of the sum which is in full application to the west indian sugar trade is the halving of the pricethe contention of the west india sugar grower is that this is the result of the bounty system of the continent the commissioners come to a different conclusion their view that the results which have been quoted are not altogether due to the � annually distributed in the form of sugar bounties by the principal sugar producing countries of the continent is sum inarized in the following paragraph of their reportby far the greater portion of the fall in the price of gugar which has conferred so great a boon en the con sumer is not due to the existence of bounties and would not be lost if they were abolisned the fall in the price of sugar is mainly due to a lowering of the cost of production of both beet and cane sugar and in fo far as this is the case the abolition of the bounties wrold not affect the price some british industries possess an advantage over their foreign comnpetitors owing to the low price of sugar in the united kingdom but the difference between tho high price in foreign countries and the low price in england is dae far more to the high internal taxation and prohibitive customs duties levied in the forner than to the effect of the bounties in lowering the price herethe report shows some signs of the difficulty in which the comnmissioners found themselves placed between a just consideration of the interests of the british consumer and of the west indian sugar planter and while on one side of the case the arguments are put forward with much force which tend to prove that the abolition of thecontinental bounty system would haveso srmall aneffect in raising price as to exercise little or no influence upon the prosperity of british industries depending upon cheap sugar on the other side in view of th deplorable prospects nder present conditions of the west indian sugar industry the commissioners are unnnimousupon her majestys government to obtain if possibe the abolition of tho bounty system even at the cost of some sacrifice if that sacrifice did not  involve evils out of all propor tion to those which it is desired to removethoe figures of west indian exports quoted by the report sbow that of a yearly total of � worth of produce exported by the colonies � is derived from the products of the sugar cane the commissioners are agreed that nder present conditions there is very serious risk of a large number of sugar estates being allowed to go out of cultivation and they plainly represent the consequences to the colonies of the diminution which would result in the principal staple of their trade the report enters jgefuly into the prospects of develppin gssidiary industries but comes to two somewhat depressing conclusions the first is that while an abolition of the continental bounty system if it could be obtained will not suffice to ensble the westindian sugar industry to be carried on with assured prospects of profit nevertheless the maintenance of the sugar industry is at present the only means of providing for the financial equilibrium of the west indian colonies the second is that while every effort should be made to substitute other industries for the one upon which the colonies at present chiefly depend it remains doubtful whether ny industry or series of industries can be introduced into the west indies which will ever completely take the placo of sugarthe recommendations of the report divide themselves accordingly into two categories those designed to render possible the present existence of the sugar industry and those designed to promote the creation or to en courage the development of other industries which may at some future period place the in dustrial condition of the islands on a safer basis by supplementing sugar as a source of produc tionin tho first class of recommendations the to main questions which present themselves for dis cussion are the imposition of countervailing duties by the british government on bountyfed sugar and the grant of direct bounties to west indian sugar the commissioners are agreed in rejecting the proposal to male a grant of direct bounties to west indian sugar but with regard to the imposition of countervailing duties there is a differerce of opinion between them sir edward grey and sir david barbour cannot re commend the adoption of this means sir henry norman on the contrary is of opinion that countervailing duties should be imposedthe great difiiculty of foreseeing the effect of the imposition of countervailing dutiesis acknow ledged by all three comnmissioners and there is a curious discrepancy which serves very well to illustrate the nature of the difficulty in the esti mte made in two separate portions of the report ofthe probable cost to the british consumer of the adoption of such a policy it is assumed in the report signed by all three commissioners that the cost would be perhaps � to the community but sir henry norman in the note in which he embodies his recommendation that countervailing duties should be imposed states as part of his argument that if counter vailing dutieshave the desiredeffect the  people of the united kingdom will have to pay more for their sugar than they do at present perhaps to the extent of a halfpenny a pound  a half penny a pound on the british consumption of b a head for a population of  of persons represents � the difference between � and �q is important it has also to be observed that if the imposition of a countervailing dqty caused the price of sugar to rise a halfpenny a pound this would represent an increase of � s d per ton the countervailing duty upon germnn sugar would be � es a ton if the imposition of a duty of � us at the customshouse could have the effect of sending up the price � s d in the market the result to german sugar would be a premium of � ss d upon every ton that came in assuming a rise of even a farthing a pound which is the smallest that it is possible to collect from the consumer there is still between � s d and the duty of � s a substantial profit to be reaped by german sugar if the british government were to decide upon the imposition of a countervailing duty if the imposition of a countervailing duty did not raise the price it wrould have no effect at all as regards the west indian industry and would have for its sole result the inconvenience imposed upon british importers by the requirement under wvhich it would lay them to bring more capital into their business for the purpose of paying duties in advance indeed the evidence which is snnmarized by the report goes far to revolu tionize some current ideas upon the effect actually produced by systems of bounties and counter vailing duties each increase in the continental bounties appears to have been followed by a fall in price greater in amount which must of neces sity have injured the industry that it was in tended to protect german sugar with a bounty of s d and a price of nearly � per ton two years ago was distinctly better off than german sugar with a bounty of s and a price which fel on the announcement of the new bounties to � s the argument applies in an inverse sense to countervailing duties and the inference suggested is that neither of these systems in truth produces the result espected from itfailing arreement on direct means for giving snbstautialand immediate relief to the west indian sugar industry the report recommends certain special measures of relief of which the effect will be felt no less in the subsidiary in dustries that it is desired to encourage than in the main industry of sugar here the commis sion is on clear ground and it is in this direc tion that the element of hope in the west indian situation may be looked for the immediate remedies unanimously recommended by the com mission are calculated to cost about � it is more than probable that a verv much larger sunm may have to be expended in the interests of the west indian colonies and that the applica tion of these first remedies in a tentative form may open the way to the assisted development of colonial resources on a much wider scale but there is a great difference between the proposal that the british taxpayer should lay out adefinite sun with the hope of definite returns and the certainty of fulfilling certain definite obligations and the recommendation that he should take upon himself a burden of several millions a year for an indefinite period with an equauy in definite prospect of the results to be achieved the first proposal is in accord with the policy already put forward by mr chamberlain of dce veloping our national estatesa policy which has its dangers but has also some decided morits the second proposal will hardly commend itself to any large section of english opinion
