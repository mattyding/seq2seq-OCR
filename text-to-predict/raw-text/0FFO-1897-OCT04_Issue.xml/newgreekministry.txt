delyanni is becoming more accentuated m delyanni is issuing a manifesto disavowing m zaimis and the rest of the majority some prominent members of the delyannist party declined to join the new ministry they inveigh against m zaimis for having as they allege betrayed the delyannist cause the rupture between ii zaimis and m delyanni is complete  delyanni wrote several letters to the former

m delyannis attitude in the minister j crisis in athens it is suchas to convey the general impression that he is guided by personal considerations in any case he is acting as if he did not realize or altogether ignored the judgment of foreigners as a matter of fact m ielyanni is regarded outside his own country as the enile ollivier of greece but at all events the latter sought retirement and oblivion when it became evident to what extent he had been the evil genius of france  delyanni on the other hand seeks to recover his lost position in greece and outside by thwarting all efforts to form a bministry in which he would not be the guiding spirit if not the visible chief mwhat he apparently vants is a cabinet just itrong enough to hold its own until it suits hin to take office himselfdomertic affairs in greece directly concern only the greeks themselves but in the ecite mnent of party agit tion it should not be for gotten in athens that mi delyanni vwill never again have the remotest prestige abroad in the opinion of thie outside world the bulk of the responsibility for the late war rests with him it is only shared by the king in a much smaller degree when  delyanni returns to office if ever he does so he will find his task in all matters of foreign policy infinitely more difficult than it was before indeed it would be impos bible to imagine anything better calculated to delay the recuperation of greece than  delyannis return to powver in all probability the king is aware of this and possibly if m delyanni himself really knew what a bad impres sion is produced evverywhere by the obstacles ho is piecing in the way of the formation of a ministry be would make up his mind to remain neutral even if he wrere not disposed to give the nlew government his supportpais ocr m francis charmes who considers it a special piece of good fortune tat  zaimis has been able to induce general smolenski  the only greek officer who displayed a real military spirit during the last campaign to join his cabinet says in tonights dibats that m zaimis is  in contestably rendering a great service to his country and that all good citizens ought to forget their differences and rally round him all the darker after these words of welcome are the adjec tives in which m charmes paints the character and estimates the rle of  delvanni that fatal man who after having in  led greece to the edge of the precipice flimg her into it in  with a heedlessness an ignorance of europe and a personal infatuation of which history perhaps offers no other example  m charmes adds the scandal of his conduct would become such if success followed it that greece would lose thereby moraly more than she lost politically and in a military way on the battlefields whither she was driven by m delyanni m charmes goes pitilessly on with a clearness of invective which is a little startling in the utterances of so measured a writer  delyannis strange lust for office in present circumstances he thinks in explicable although nothing he says would in a way be more fitting victor hugo would have called it expiation than that he should desire at any price to put his name at the bottom of a treaty disastrous for his country this strange desire he calls squarely  a senile ambition  m charmess article is sympathetic with the fervour of a pessimism which scarcely ventures to specu late as to the possible fate in store for a country so wanting in men and so perverse
