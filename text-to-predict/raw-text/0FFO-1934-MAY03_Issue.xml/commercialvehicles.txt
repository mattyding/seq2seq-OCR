the proper effective and just administration of the actthere were  applications before the court of varying characterthe first case was that of mr eric roy taylor contractor of barking for whom mr norman letts solicitor stated that the business was that of transporting industrial machincry foodstuffs and furniture from tilbury and other london docks to various places in and around london and as far afield as mtanchester and southamp ton he was employed by a number of chemical erngineers to transport machinery mainly in case of breakdown and had to undertake journeys at all hours in emergencies the business had grown from a turnover of � a month in  to � last month he asked for discretionary licences for two vehicles to be acquired five already owned and hiring allowances to cover emergenciesvidence was given on behalf of the railwav companies of the facilities they provided at the docks for the transport of saoods thence to any part of the country there had been a very considerable falling off of traffic in recent years through competition of this kind and in order to facilitate the transport of goods the railways had an agrcement with a road transport company by which urgent requirements were met idle railwnay wagonsmir pereira for the railways opposed the licences for discretionary vehicles in view of the prescnt position of the railways there were thousands of idle wvagons on the railways waiting for traffic and there was no need fqr any further facilities there were  or more other operators in the londonarea who would no doubt be glad of any traffic the appiicant could not deal withlicences wefe granted  for the vehicles in possession and onetobe acquiredwhich r robinson said were justified by the growth of lhe businessvr r a finn sydney morse and co applied for licences for r v norris limited of bow road for vehicles in possession and for hiring allowances he said there were in associa tion six companies which between them estab lished a network of road serviceslondon to axminster and bournemouth and the south coast and as far north as manchester and brad ford as well as nottingham and norwich in due course there wouid be an application for the six companies to come before the authority as one concern mr rosnson said there would be no need for  hiring allowance  licences as the evidence showed that when required in urgent cases the vehicles of one company could be used for another on this the railway opposition was withdrawnan application was made by the owner of one vehiclc acquired in september last and therefore long after the appointed day on a promise by harris lever and co furniture manufacturers of tottenham that he should be given part of the transport work he had been working for them ever since taking furni ture to different parts of the country evidence on behalf of the gwr opposing was that up to  their business from this firm was � a year and was now only � for the lner it was stated that they formerly did business to the extent of � a year which had been lost mainly by the competition of road transportafter further evidence the authority said that this seemed to be a type of operation which was undesirable because it would be likely to encourage return loads at very low rates his decision would be reservedthe film transport company applied for licences for  vehicles already in possession and discretionary licences for three to be acquired it was stated on their behalf that their business was the rapid transfer of films machinery and apparatus connected with the cinernas to al parts between birmingham and london and was a class of business which the railway com panies could not possibly handle the applica tion included  general merchandise  as busi ness desired to be undertaken
