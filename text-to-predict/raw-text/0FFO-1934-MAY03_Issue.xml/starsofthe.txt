stars of the monththe evening sky in mayfroni our astronontical correspondentthc diagram shows the brighter stars that will be above the horizon in the latitude of london at tl oclock al the beginning at  oclock in the middle and at  oclock at the end of the monih the time in all cases being local or in other words at places away trom greenwich the greenwich times to which the diagram applies arc later than the above by the amount of the longittde if the place be we st of greenwich earlier by like amount if it be cast if the diagram be turned so that thc horizon the observer is facing tshown by thc words round the circle is at the bottom the stars he then has in front of him will be found btetoeen the lowvest point of the circle and its centre which tepresents the zenith or point immcdiately overhead and the heavens to his right and left hand will bt found in the corrcsponding positions in the diagramthe arrows show the direction of the apparent motion of thc stars throughout the night around a point near the star polaris as centrethe time given in these notes is that of the grecnwich meridian and is not in acord with the system ofsumnmer time now in use the latter may be found by adding one hour to the times hcre givenvisibility of the new mioonthe mloon will be new half an hour aftcr noon on may  and since on the th it will not set at greenwich until halfpast  which is an hour and  minutes after sunszt it may be seen on that evening about  hours after con junction the circumstances so far as time is concerned are similar to those surrounding the new moon in mlarch when several persons in england saw the liotirold crescent on alarch  the whole disk being made quite apparent by earthshine between halfpast s and  oclock in the evening of mlay  the crescent may be seen in the tvilight a few degrees above the horizon in the aorthwest with the horns pointing upwardthe planetsmercury comes into the diagram in the last week of the month its position on the th being shown it will be above the horizon at greenwich on that evening until about a quarter to  oclock which will be an hour and threequarters after sunset so that it is quite possibc i that the planet may be visible to the naked cye about that date though it will be at altitude only deg at  oclock and the twilight sky may be bright greatest elongation will not be until junc  but mercury nvill then be less bright than it is tiiis month and thc interval between its setting and that of the sun will be only  minutes greater so that there mav be as good a chance of seeing the planet this month as nextjupiter continues to be a bright object of lhe night sky being visible between southcast and south in the early evening when the sky darkens it is moving slowly among the stars from left to right and comes to a stationary point when it wvill reverse its motion on june  observers with telescopes arc advised by the rev t e r phillips to pay special attention to the region of the red spot and south tropical disturbance where small changes and circulatory movement of spots continue to occur the socalled dis turbance is a marking that originated at the bcginning of this century and has since grown so that it now nearly circumscribes the planet as a beit and a series of small spots which call for obscrvation more in the unoccupied space between its endsvenus and saturn are objects of the morning sky venus rises about  oclock in the middle of thc month but later at its beginning and carlier at its end this vill be more thatn an hour before sunrise in all cases but as davwn occurs early relative to sunrise at this time of year thc bright background of tlhe sky may make the planet inconspicuotus it rises north of the east point in the latter part of the month saturn on the boundary between the constella tions aquarius and capricornus rises in the eastsoutheast about halfpast  at the beginning of the month and half an hour after midnight at its end advantage may be taken of the short opportunity thus afforded to scrtitinize the planet lor a possible outbreak of spots such as occurred last year mars which is in conjunc tion vwith the sun on april  rises less than half an hour before that luminary throughout maysaturni in the april number of the journal of the british astronomical association the historv of the white spot that appeared on saturn last august is told by mr b m peck of birming ham director of the section that deals with that planet accompanied by his deduction of a rotation period from the observations as there were three independent discoverers besides mr will hay who with herr a weber of berlin saw the spot at about h mn on august  it is evident that the planet was receiving its due share of attention at the time the spot lasted with some change in shape and dimensions tip till september  the behaviour of thie following end which at tirst seemed to be tihe most stable and reliable point being very erratic about august  from all the observations thiat he has collected mir peek deduces a rota tion period of  hours min sec that may be considered final with alternative solutions that give rather larger values the period generally adopted hithierto has been  hotirs min sec derived froni observation of a spot that appeared in december  and lasted about a month that like the spot of last year was ort saturns equator so that we have no further information as to whether there is an equatorial current or whether ditierent latitudes on saturn rotate with varying velocity as has been surmisedthe activity on saturn was not limited to this single spot but at teast three other spots and bright streaks followved from one of these spots that was first seen by observers at flagstaff arizona on august  and lasted until september  a period of  hours min sec was derived but the data are too meagre to make this zi satisfactory determinationoccultationsobservation of the times of occultation of stars by the nmoon is

elsewhere and from conti nental sources les erudite matter is dealt with in other sections where it is related that two hundred and sixtynine small planets were discovered during the year  which is con siderably greater than the number in previous years but the zeal of the observers appears to be misplaced for many of thesc seem to be bodies that have becn discovered in former years but lost

international cooperation in astronomy as the subject of a complete and able addrcss mentioning among much else as illustration of international good fccling that in  when there was trouble between denmark and holstein thc society was able to induce lord palmerston to makc rcpresentations to thc danish governmcnt that it would be to the advantage of astronomy generally if the observatory at altona should remain undis turbed he also related the facts about the esta blishment of the present existing international astronomical union that came into being after and perhaps as an outcome of the great war and described the organization of the sections of its work in detaila new cometa comet of the twelfth magnitude the first of this year was discovered by mr jackson of the union
