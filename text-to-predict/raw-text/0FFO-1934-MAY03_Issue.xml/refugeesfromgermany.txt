the governing body met at lausanne in decernber le said that in some quarters there had been a fundamentalt misunderstanding of the purpose of the high commissioners olffice it was decided at the beginning that the functions of the office should be the conduct of negotiations with governments helping to coordinate the work of the private organizations and personal cooperation by the high commissioner in the etforts ot the private organizations to secure funds in each of the three fields of their activi ties thev were able to report substantial progressin seereal countries here they were tem porarily resident thie legal status of the refugees had been more clearly defined governmlents had been induced to postpone or soften admini strative regulations which would have made the lot of the refugees more diflicult and in sonic cases countries of potential permanent residence had been persuaded to lessen the restrictions on emigration the targe fundraising bodies with which it had been his privilege to cooperate the central british fund and the american joint distribution commnittee in conjunction with the americanpalestine campaignwere pressing vigorously their etlorts to raise ï¿½ and  respectively a great part of the funds of these organizations would be utilized for the retraining and settlement of the german refugeespermits to worka burning question in all countries the high commissioner said was that of permits to work it was realized that in the present economic crisis it would be impracticable to ask govern ments to give general facilities to work to the refugwees in the different countries sonic of thle states represented on the governing body how ever had given permits to a number of refugees possessing certain qualifications or organized in cooperative groups to establish themselves lt was an error to represent that the refugees wvere simply a burden on the countries in which they had taken refuge those who had been permitted to establish a business or industrv had brought employment to a nttmber of persons in the country and in some cases had started importan new industriesthe intellectual refugees constituted a pecu liarly difricult problem it was estimated that the number of academic persons displaced was ap proximately  and of these somewhat less than half had actually emigrated the refugees who belonged to the professional group probablv totalled more than  while more than  students had found it impossible to continue their studies in germany approximately  had emigrated unfortunately nearlv all the academnic places vwhich had been found for the refugees were of a temporary natureconcerning retraining mr mcdonad said that the haluz a worldwide jewish youth move ment destined particularly to prepare young men and women for agricultural life in palestine had opened special centres in many countries for the training of refugees from germany altogether  persons were receiving agri cultural training outside germany through the organization in england  refugees had been placed in agricultural schools of the local authorities at st albans and manchester more than  had been apprenticed in technical workshops and trades and a number of refugee doctors nad been admitted to english and scottish universitieswith a view to obtaining in a years course a medical qualification that would enable them to practise in parts of the british empire broadly it might be stated that the larger number of the refugees wbo were of an age at which retraining wvas possible had been or were being prepared for new vocationsthe work of the settlement of refugees in palestine had proceeded steadily and sutccessfufly and every month some hundreds of persons made their way from germany or their courntry of refuge to palestine and were absorbed in the economic and also  the intellectual and spiritual life of the country in conclusion the high commissioner said that the dreadful con gestion of the refugees in a fewv centres had been relieved but the number of exiles from germany was calculated still to be between  and the following figures which must be taken with all reserve indicated
