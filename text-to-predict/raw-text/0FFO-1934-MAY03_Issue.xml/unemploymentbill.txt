funds provided for the discovery expedition committee and as to the future programme of that committeethe noble lord said that the comnnmittee was set up to organize discovery and research expedi tions in those seas frequented by whales its funds were obtained by the revenue from licences and duties on the whaling industry in  the fund had about � in hand in spite of the amount that had been spent early in that year the secretary of state for the colonies informed the committee that it was his intention to suspend the operations of the com mittee the committee was rather startled and organized a deputation wvhich so far prevailed on the secretary of state that he consented to the equipment of another discovery expedition which was organized last year the committee was left however in entire ignorance as to his mitentions regarding the further application of the fund except that it might be applied to other purposes of development in the colonial empire thatcourse might be right if the money had been raised solely from our own countrymen but it was raised just as much from norvegians and others who engaged in whaling the chair man of the committee received last autumn a sudden notice of dismissal and he lord olivier hoped their lordships would be told the reasonsthe earl of plymouth undersecretary for the colonies replying said that the position was that great britain could not ratify the international convention until the necessary legislation had been passed and an inter departmental cornmittee was appointed to consider the precise form of such legislation that committee had now reported and a draft bill xvas now receiving the consideration of the government with regard to the discoverv committee itself it had been in existence in its present form for  vears and was initiated with the object of obtainine inrformation on which to base regulations wvith regard to whaling and sealing operations mr darnlcy had rendered great services as chairman of that committee and in this case the term dismissal  was not correct he retired from the government service about a year ago but remained chairman of the discovery committee for some months it was however considered to be of the highest importance that the chairman of that committee should be directly connected with the colonial oflicewith regard to the financial side of the question the charges on the fund now appre ciably exceeded its income the diminution of the fund was such as to make it prudent to review the situation generally and especially the question of retaining a part of the fund as a rcserve for the general purposes of the falkland islands dependencies the programme of the discovery committee had not been materially interrupted although some small economies had necessarily had to be put into operation the fund was not regarded as exclusively reserved for discovery investigations it was considered to be too early now to come to a final decision as to the detailed disposal of any balance of the fund which might be left over after provision had been made for the objects to which he had referredlaw reformlord chancellors speechthe lord chancellor in moving the second reading of the law reform miscellane ous provisions bill said that english law embodied a large number of maxims whichletad served tlhe country well but which from time to time nceded revision as unsuitable to modern conditions the committee set up last january to consider the matter had reported unanimously in favour of the revision of two of these maxins and the object of the bill was to give eftect to the committees suggestionsit was a rule of the common law that if an injury had been done to the person or property of another an action could not continue after thz death of the person to or by whom the wvrong had been done the great number of motorcar accidents now happening had made the revision of this maxim an urgent necessity if for example a driver were killed in a collision due to his own negligence the rights to com pensation of those who had been injured in the accident came to an end by his death and the liability of the insurance company ceased the committee declared that they could see no valid reason why a mans estate should not be liable to pay compensation for wrongs committed by him in his life they adlded the recommenda tion that such a claim for compensation should only be valid if made within six months in order that the winding up of the estate might not be indefinitely delayedclause  carried out the recommendation of the committee regarding the law in relation to the right to claim interest on debts and damages some people took advantage of the present state of the law by defending actions to which they had no real answer t he committees report on both these matters was unanimous and these re forms were long overduelord danesfort said that the hfouse and the community would be grateful to the lord chancellor for bringing in this billthe bill was read a second timeimperial maritime policyplea for consultationwith dominionslord mottistone asked his majestys government what stcps they proposed to take in order to call the dominions into consultation with a view to formulating a common maritime policy for the british empirethc noble lord said thsat this was a matter of real urgency because the british mercantile marine was rapidly losing way cornpared withother countries a maritime policy for the whole empire was not only desirable btit attainable referring to subsidizetd shipping the noble lord said that in south africa not long before the present south african government came into power an agreement was come to with ltwly tinder which the italian governnent paid a suh sidv of � a year and tile union govern nment � a year in order that italian shipsnmight carry south african produce that was a most extraordinary position to have arrived at seeing that the empire depended on maritimepower to a greater and greater degree it was extraordinary that one of our dominions should enter into this arrangement deliberately to reduce the volume of our mercantile tonnage while in the event of trouble it was our fleet that was theonly one which cotild protcet those ships in this partictilar case he gatfiered the venture had not been at all suieccssftilanlother case wals that of nev zealand which had an old shipping line that had bcen carrying goods and passengers and mails between tlhat dominion anld the west coast of the north american continenit the united states had come into the field witlh a line so largely sub sicdized that this otd british line miight be driven otf the sca the high colinmissioner to new zealand permitted hiin to tell their lordships that this subsidy which was niot a direct subsidy but at mail subsidy amounted to thie fantastic figure of �o a letter clearly they could not allow that sort of tlhing to go on and do

having made britain cease to be an island vieved in the larger aspect of imperial defence all that had happened in thc way of miodern invention especially in regard to air powver renidered sea power to britain more not less essential than it was before that beinig so our mercantile mairine strength must be maintained he understood that the government were symipa thetic to this motion his criticism of the present government wvas that they lid not always realize that they had been put there to take action and swift action here was something which wanted doing and which must be done he knew that most of ih dominions wvould agree to his sug gestion but even if there uvere any difliculty the government should at once set up some body through which a start could be madelord joicey said that it was muost important that they should carry out lord mottistones suggestionslord melchett said that it was inmpossible for british shipping to compete against foreign subsidlized ships were they going to allow british shipping to be driven otf the seas by semibankrupt countries vhen this country had a surplis  this question wvent right to the verv root of our island economv because it

essential to bind the empire together bv every meanis possible to protect it and to protect its com municationis this country had not got un reasonable or difficult people to deal with in the doniinions and should be able to come to an agreement witth them if she could not do so there was possibly something wrong with her method of making agreements he hoped that the government woould act promptly and effcctuallv in this matterlord marley said that he hoped that any empire policy that was adopted would not be such as to engender feelings of hostility in other nationslord templemores replylord temiplemore captain yeomen of the guard replying said that he could give no specific answer to the noble lords question because the government had not yet formulated their policy the government were most anxious about the seriousness of the shipping situation he could only say with regard to the specific question of consulting the dominions that as soon as the president of the board of trade and the govemment had formulated their policy the dominions would be consulted in every respectthe nvorkmens compensation coal imlines bill which has passed through the commons was read
