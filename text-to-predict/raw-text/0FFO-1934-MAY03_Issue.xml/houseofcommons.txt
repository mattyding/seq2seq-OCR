any re commendations of the committee with respect thereto and the report shall be laid before parliamenthe said that the house would be pleased that at last it had an opportunity of dealing with certain classes of persons who were outside un employment insurance and who many observers of social matters thought ought to be included in the bill the proposal to increase the limit to � had largely in mind the clerk of today who often was subjected to difimeult conditions members of that profession almrost irrespective of conditions or of security ot tenure were highly desirous of coming within the limits of the billwhen the blackcoated worker became tinem ployed in many respects he was in a worse position than the manual worker who was roughly sure of his unemployment benefit and who was not so much troubled with the need to keep up appearances when the clerk or the professional worker began to look seedy his chance of getting cmployment again was under mined he mr lawson would however rather place the reason for including the � a year worker in insurance on thc fact that taken as a whole hc was a good life and that it wouldgo towards securing and cementing the principle the government wished to operate in the billwith rcgard to domestic workers they were on more controversial ground hear hear but as good lives they should be members of the insurance fund the same arguments against their inclusion were used in the case ol health insurance in this country the stattis of the domestic servant was tndervalued inclu sion in the schemec would raise that status would make it easier to organize domestic workers if need be and would provide some security to the middleaged personit should bc possiblc to give the statutory com mittee power to give scrious

was that their case for inclusion under the unenmploynient insur ance schenmc should be thoroughly investigatedsir b peto barnstapte u said that before they included the blackcoated workers under the schemc they ought to consider very carefully whethier that step would be to tileir advantage clerks who were good at their work were generally fairly secure in their jobs and were not liable to much unemployment nor was thereuilich evidence at thc present time of any great amount of unemployment among domestic servantsmr maxton andpoliticiansmr maxton said that he supported the nlew clause thc greatest advantage of this conecs sion was that it woould inclide members of the house of commons under the unemploymient scheme it vould give hon imembers an oppor tunity of cxpericncing tle operation of the un employment insurance system instcad of merely talking about it he would be very interested to follow the efforts of lady astor in her endeavours to prove that she was not a married woman anomaly laughterthc operation of this provision would be one of the greatest educative influences for the legis lators of this country laughter he would not go into the diflicult subject of good lives and bad lives but it must be obvious that a very large proportion of the mcmbers on thc majority side of the llouse as politicians could not be regarded as good lives laugilter hc did not think that the question of genuinely secking to be there could be brought in question but he doubted very much whether a large tiumber of those who now sat in that hotuse wotldi ever have an opportunity of working at this crafti c could imagine that if this provision vwas ccarried some lion mcmbers wotild stronigly object when thc nmeans test investigator came round to their homes and that mr k night would object if he was pushied into a work centre latigltter he also questioned whethier thc oflicer in charge of the centre wvould not have an equally strong objection when he had had the hon member in the centre for a week laughter these were powerful considera tions in relation to this proposed new clause and he hoped that sir h betterton if he had not considered them before would regard them as a powerful reason for agreeing to the clause laughtergovernment replyministers undertakingsir h betterton ntinister of labour rushcliffc u said that he was glad the clause had been moved as it would give him an oppor tunity to state what he conceived to be the object of a national insurance scheme his object was that this scheme should not merely be solvent but that it should be as far as possible a wide comprehensive scheme embracing largc numbers of people who did not already fall within it he could confirm from his own corre spondence and experience what hon members had said in the course of that debate many of these men would be only too anxious to come into a scheme such as thisl what he had said in regard to the first category applied equally to the others there w ere obvious difficulties but he did not want to examine these difficulties because he wanted these categories when they came before the statutory committee to be examined on their merits it was one of the great advantages of having this committee as a permanent statutory body that they could refer to it cases such as thesehe had heard representations made that the scheme should be so enlarged as to make it a matter of voluntary contribution for classes who were not now included he expressed no opinion on the merits of such a proposal it might be that such a proposal would be one that should be submitted to the statutory committee the proposal had been made that with a great con prehensive insurance scheme like this it ought not to be beyond the wit of man to devise an arrange ment under which those who had been in it a long time at a certain age should get a benefit either by way of a bonus pension or some otber advantage by reason of the fact that thev had made so many contributions again he tfered no comment on the proposalhis reason for asking the house not to accept the new clause was this under the bill as dravwn they had already allotted to the committee certain specific duties which they had to do at once a report on the finances of the scheme considera tion of the question of insurance in agriculture and consideration of the question of borderline cases he did not want to overload the work of the committee by making it a statutory obligation to go into this and other questions at once but he would give an undertaking that thcse matters would not only have his most sympathietic con sideration but he would do all that he could to ensure that as soon as possible this and any other relevant matters should have the full consideration of the cormmittee and the house would then be in a position to pass an opinion as to whether this class or the other should be includedlabour and the guillotinemr n maclean glasgow govan lab said that the difficulties to whicli the

mittee was the body which should consider themmr curry bishop auckland lnat said the question arose whether the bill as now drafted gave the statutory committee the power to introduce these people into insurance if and whien they were able to do it and whether some amendment of the bill would not be necessary to give them the power if they thought such action desirablemr petherick penryn and
