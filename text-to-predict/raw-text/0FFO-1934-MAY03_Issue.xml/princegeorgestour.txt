w ater the high commissioner as to the reception he wvould receive when he landted in south africa were not only fulfilled but were surpassed by anything he had iniagined lcheers the prince continued the first weeck was spent in capetown as a gucst at government house nvhere the kindness of the governorgenerat and lady clarendon at once made me feel at home to many of you here capetown in the suzmmer needs no advertise ment from mne to those who have no experience of its sunshine and nmountains and sea  can only say that they can never be forgotten and much increased the enjoyment of try stay tcheers while i was there parliament was in session and i was very glad to meet many members of the government tnanv governmcnt officials and rany ot its inhabitants i arrived in south africa at a fortunate moment when there were distinct signs of returning prosperity i noticed that this was having specially good effccts on the fruit industry which could not however have reached stuch a hight pitel of efficiency had not the fine points of production and marketing becn very carefully studied bv packing the fruit in the most scientific way it reaches its destina tion in as perfect a condition as possible cven after a journey to this country of many thousands of miles to give you some idea of the growth of this industry in  there were  boxes of citrus fruit exported from the union whereas in  nearly  boxes were seni overseai was also very interested to see that wine growers had such a large acreage under vines and that there was a very good crop this yearfrom capetown my tour took me castwards along the garden route and if anything could add to the enjoyment of the finest scenerv in the union it was the way in which i and my staff travelled for my railwav joourneys through the country the south african railways spared no pains to provide every possible con venience and comforteven to a piano and gramophone in nmy saloon the transkei inaturally found most interesting as this was the  first extensive native reserve l visited the warml reception i was given at unmtata by the nativeswho turned out in thousands to meet me was alll in keeping with that wellknown spirit of loyalty which is inbred in the native races of south africa it was on my way north to bloemfontein that i first saw south africas sheep vcld and some of the finest sheep country in the world there i was able to niert some of the farmers who told me abotut the privations and losses they and other farmers of the orange free state had suffered owing to the drought  admired the courage with which they carried on through their bad times and i wvas very glad to hear thar due to the good rains things were improvingi entered natal on leaving the orange free state and at pietermaritzburg i attended a most impressive gathering of zulus who arrayed in picturesque headdresses and carrying oxhide shields danced for over three hours without any signs of exhaustion i have the happiest recol lections of durban where i saw something of eterv form of this citys many activities the enthusiasm of the exservice men was vcry marked here as it wvas everywhere i visited throughout south africa andl i was glad to see that through their organiations they still kccp up old friendships and stick together to help each other out in difficult timesthe iransvaal was the last province of theunion i visited during the two days i was x in pretoria i inspected the new special service battalion consisting of unemploved consider ing that this battalion had only bcen in training six months and had been recruited mostly from the farming districts its general turnout and smartncss on parade were exceptionally goodi should also like to mention how struck i was by the smart appearance of the various guards of honour mountedat the different places i stopped at the transvaal where in a peculiar way the new and old south africas meetthe africa of modern industrialisn and the africa of agrcultural developmentwasl particularly interesting and  only wish l could have stayed longer and that my tour could have included visits to other districts in the provincegoldmining activitymy most vivid impression was of the extraordinary activity in johannesburg and all along the rcef there the goldmining industry is going from strength to strength a progress well deserved because of its intensive organizing effl ciency and because of the immense service it renders to the whole of the union in providing markets for agricultural products it one realizes the demands in food atone of some o mine workers one can then understand the import ance of this industry to the farmer there is however another branch of mining in south africa one flourishing in the past but now going through difficult timesthe diamond industry this industry has my sincere sympathy but i believe things arc slowly improving and that as world depression disappears kimberley will once more be called upon to meet the increasing demand for diamonds during my tour through the union i found my short visit to basutoland extremely interest ing meeting native chiefs and watching a native gymkhana i had no time to visit swaziland but i was able to meet delegations from that territory at the high commissioners house in pretoria later i spcnt a day in bechuanaland with their limited resources drought and cattle disease have severely affected the native terri tories i was glad to hear however that the population both european and native had made the best of their troubles and were making a determined effort to surmount their difliculties i travelled through bechuanaland to southern rhodesia no one i am sure can travel through the two rhodesias without admiration of the marvellous energy and vision of cecil rhodes no one can stand beside his grave on the matopos without respecting the understanding and foresight which led to his plans for northern expansion his spirit lives on in the land that he made and loved so welli found it everywhere as f went from bulawayo i through fort victoria and umtali to the capital salisburyi had a most enjoyable tour through southern rhodesia and i noticed a distinct feeling of confidence in the outlook of its inhabitants it must however be somcwhat dishcartening for the farmers there to realize that though they can grow an abundance of all kinds of agricultural produee it is difficult to find a market for their goods beore leaving this colony i spent a day at the victoria falls which is one of the wondersof the world i was glad to find everything is being done there to stop any undue encroach ment on naturc or anythfing likely to spoil the surroundingsnaturally i was much interested in the copper mines of northern rhodesia these mines should in time prove of much assistance to the hinter land of this territory by providing markets for he ujtivator i visited the now capital at lusaka anti was glad to be able to lay the foundationstone of the government buildingsbritish enterpriseafter spending one nighi at elisabethvillein the belgian congo where every kindness andihospitality was shown me by the commissaire of the katanga province i
