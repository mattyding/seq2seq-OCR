the wanderingscholarsexiles in britishsanctuaryone years workby lord rutherford of nelsonin the conviction that the universities form a kingdom of their own whosc intellectual autonomy must be preserved my distinguished colleagues formed the academic assistance council one year ago and the royal society provided accommodation for the councils offices the occasion was the displacement of our fellow scientists and scholars from their university positions in germany but the problem with which the council is faced is wider and deeper than that presented by the need for assisting these gernan teachers its ambition is to defend the principle of academic freedom and to help those scholars and scientists of anv nationality who on grounds of religion race or political opinion are prevented from continuing their work in their own countrythe series of political revolutions in europe since the great war has created a large body of wandering scholars many for instance among the russian or italian einigris have unfor tunately through the absence of organized assistance by their university colleagues lost the means of continuing their scientific careers but there are many whose talent and experi ence could still be effectively used and their number has been tragically swollen during the past year by the expulsion from academic posi tions in germany of persons possessing pacifist or internationalist convictions or lacking that strangest of qualifications for the life of scholarship  aryan  genealogiesto incorporate the services of these wandering scholars in the other universities of the civilized world is more difficult today than in the middle ages when the  communities of learners  were less hampered by administrative fornalities restrictive endowments and incipient nationalist tendencies medieval scholars could migrate to other districts and the  universitas  moved with them the same catholicity of spirit has been fortified by the present crisis in both our ancient and our modern universitiesresearch gueststhe universities of great britain have re sponded generously to the councils suggestion of inviting the displaced scholars to work as re search guests hospitality has thus been ex tended in this country to  of our university colieagues the multicellular london univer sity has received  cambridge university has not only given hospitality to  but its indi vidual colleges have contributed over � to the councils funds oxford university has welcomed  guests manchester university has invited  and by local efforts raised a special fund for their support almost all other uni versities and university colleges in great britain have opened their commonrooms libraries and laboratories to temporary research guests and several have raised local assistance funds the british university teachers have contributed liberally to the academic assistance council and the staff at the london school of econo mics have taxed themselves voluntarilv of a percentage of their salaries for three yearsin spite of this encouraging support from the universities the councils work has been seriously hampered by lack of funds the council has received slightly more than � during its first year including a grant of � from the central british fund for german jewry almost all that sum has now been ex pended in maintenance grants to displaced scholars within great britain or the british empire at the rate of � per annum for a single person and � for married persons the council is therefore not able to give assist ance to manv distinguished university teachers who are now faced with destitution and the abandonnment of their scientific careers and what is more serious it will not be able to renew its research grants for a second year to the scholars in england and will then have to abandon them in a world where even the oppor tuinities of temporary refuge are contracting only if it uses funds not otherwise available for the british universities can the council avoid injuring the economic interests of the universitv teachers of this countrv or weakening that great body of sympathy in the colleges wvhich is the inspiration of its activity and the condition of its successalthough prevented by lack of financial re sources from doing as effective work as it could the council has been able to assist the continiua tion of research work of great importance in the annual report of the council issued todav records of the work of the scholars and scientists in this country show they have made several notable discoveries even during the short period of their residence as guestsgroup schemeisthe council has received gratifying reports of the excellent results of this collaboration between english and german colleagues both in scientific and literary subjects and also in the arts indeed the opportunity of productively organizing group schemnes of research both in the natural sciences and in the social sciences for instance in conmparative law with the ser vices of distinguished german scholars is one that only lack of funds has hindered the council from usingtemporary subsidies for maintenance and research however form only the emergency policy of the council temporary fellowships are useful in saving the scholars from scientific sterility in giving them the opportunity of strengthening their qualifications by further publication and the acquisition of new languages and in giving them the active cooperation of their colleagues in discovering permanent positions but they are justified only in so far as they assist to selfsupporting existence once morethe council in cooperation with other coni mittees and organizations is conducting a world wide survey to discover openings in which theservices of our colleagues can be used again the reorganization of the university of istanbul which has provided posts for more than  the formation of the  university in exile  in new york and the projects for the reorganization expansion or creation of university institutions in russia persia and brazil showv that groupsettlement is possible but the bigger part of the permanent solution depends on the individual placement of persons in appropriate situations wvithout injuring the professional or economic interests of other university teachers research workers or graduates the council is in active communication with correspondents and in vestigators in various parts of the british empire russia china japan south america and other countries and has received many invitations which will lead to the permanent absorption of several scholars and scientists it believes that as the academic distinction and scientificqualification of the wandering scholars become known the problem vill solve itself the great need is to maintain our colleagures for the next twvo years in research positions which will allow them to preserve their scientific equipment vhile this process of diffusion and absorption takesplace  gthe council s rappling with an intricate problemr in germany  university teachers have been displaced so far only  are known to have found even temporary places elsewvhere and of these s have found academic refugc in this country the council is not merely a reliet organization striving to save the scientists displaced bv political revolutions for in the middle of one ok the greatest crises in the history of the universities it is deternined to preserve a respect for the basic traditions of academic freedom the security of learning and the integrity of sciencethe council tfeels that it has made a successful start in its work and is deeply encouraged by the magnificent response from the british universities it is con vinced that it wvill receive from a nvider public than the academic the syrnpathy and financial support without which its achievements will be frustrated but with which the international authority of science will be demonstrated the british nation will have proved its loyaltv to its proud heritage of toleration and academicfreedom will have been strengthened against the perils nvhich beset it in so many parts of the wvorld
