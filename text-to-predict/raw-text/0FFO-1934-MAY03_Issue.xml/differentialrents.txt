court yesterday when application was made by the corporatiort against mr j r jenkinson secretary of the leeds federation of municipal tenants association to obtain possession of his housethe history of the dispute goes back to the beginning of the differential rent scheme when notice was sent out to all corporation tenants to terminate their existing tenancies and enter on new ones at different rents from april mr h r mcdowell solicitor of the town clerks department in making the application said that the housc in question had becn occupied by the defendant on a weekly tenancy at a rental of s d a week inclusive of rates the houst was built by the corporation and completed on december   the corpora tion asked for an order for possession together iwith rent outstanding to the atnount of � s d this being a decontrolled house said mr mcdowcell the corporation are entitled to determine the tenancy and if the notice to quit i is not cornplied with they are entitled to askfor an order for possessionptoceeding mr mcdotvell said that the house was built under the financial aid provided to local authorities by the housing financial pro visions act  thle government subsidy under that act had been such as to enable tenants who had occupied houses built under it to be charged a considerably less rent than the actual econonmic rent it had liappened in many cases that persons who could well afford to pay thc full economic rent had bcen living in houses built under this act at less rental thc corpora tion thercfoic formulated a schemc under which those persons who coulct in fact afford to pay thic ftull economic rent shiotild bc askcd to pay it thc amount of the subsidy moncys thus released it was decided shiould bc used lor the benefit of persons who owing to thcir straitened circum stances were perhaps hard pult to it to pay even thc subsidized rent that involved of coursc the determination of the tenancies of practically the whole of the corporation houses and notices to quit in order to do that were served on all the tenants concerned but at the samc time it was intimated to them that it would be open to them to apply for a fresh tenancy on the new terms which were stated the scheme had been carried out with the full knowledge of the minister of healthhe mr mfcdowell submitted that the reduc tion or withdrawal of the stibsidy was the only result whici could accrue from any breach of the regulations governing the subsidty and that did not affect in any way the relationship bctwvcen thc corporation and the occupiers of thte house as landlord and tenantsjudge wvooucocisupposing the local authority were making unrcasonable charges what machinery could be invoked mr mcdowelllf thev were charging an un reasonable rent i tlhink they would stilt bc entitled to determinc the tenancy of a particular tcnantmr mcdowell concluded the simple point on which i take my stand is that this is a de controlledhouse the tenancy of which has becn determined by notice to quitmr g raymond hinchelifte for mr lenkin son said that his submission was first a certain resofution on april   authorizing the notice to quit was idltra vires and therefore anything donc under that resolution was invalid second there was no provision in the housing act for giving public assistance by way of tent relief thercfore the schemc as outlined was illegal he was going to submit that the noticc to quit was invalid and inoperativecontinuing mr hinchcliffe said it was beyond dispute that the house in question was built by the leeds corporation in pursuance of theircontinued in next columnpowers under the housing financial provisions act  the defendant became the tenant of the plaintiffs on january   and between that date and october  the defendant had paid rents which included rates varyina from ii s d when he first went into posscssion to s d which he paid in october  and had continued to payhe position before februarv  when the scheme was first brouaht to ilie notice of the tenants was that all the corporation tenants were receiving the benefit of thie government subsidy and each tenant was paying a similar rent for the particular class of house he was occupyingthere were a number of housing acts after the war when it was recognized that workingclass houses could not be provided at an economic cost unless they were heavily subsidized by the government the subsidy vas fixed at � a year for  fears but later amended to � s a year the amount of the subsidy in respect of mr jenkinsonws housejudoa woodcocki cannot see at the moment any breach of any duty on the part of the corporation in merely serving these noticesmr hinchcliffeno my contention is that the resolution authorizing the notices to quit is void and therefore anything done under it is void also the corporation can onlv do that which is authorized by parliament inr the pre scribed mannerjudge woodocceand you say they cannot pass such a resolution as they did pass
