such confidence in their information that they employed someone to go to poland with a view to catching the persons bringing the stamps here they selected a man known as mlarklham of whom the jury had heard a good deal but whom they had not seen such men it was obvious had to pretend to be the accomplices of the people they vere trying to catch moreover in markhams case he was a man with a criminal record although not a very bad oneafter an absence of an hour and a quarter the jury returned into court and the foreman said he was afraid they were unablc to agree on a verdictthe judge told them
