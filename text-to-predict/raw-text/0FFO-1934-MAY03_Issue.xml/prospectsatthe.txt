prospects at theschoolseton and harrowfrom our special correspondentthe eton and harrow match is a national institution and the prospects of the two elevens always arouse interest more than once in the last few years harrow flattered their supporters and last july their hopes rose high at one period of the game but more than a quarter of a century has passed since their last victoryelon start this season with a n a boyd as captain and four of last years xi available boyd himself is a reliable lefthand opening batsmnan dixon a steady righthander and pilkington and villiers are both sound the latter of the two possessing most of the lefthandcrs strokes a wicketkeeper is wanted and tlherc is an apparent lack of bowling k h r johnson and h birkbeck who headed the batting and bowling tables the previous year but failed to regain their places last season are still available and it may well be that the lefthand bowling of the latter will prove more than useful to eton this seasonharrow have j h pawle a free hitting batsman with a strong defence and great com mand of strokes especially on the off side as captain he has only to find a wicketkeeper and there is more than onecandidate for the posi tionand an opening pair of batsmen the three principal bowlers m a c p kaye medium paced righthand a h duveen who bowled three dramatic overs against eton and b d carris both lefthanders are again available with pawle himself c a stogdon p studd carris and e t pelltam to form tbe backbone of the batting harrow is in a most promising position s strange a mediumpaced righthand bowler wvho gained his  flannels  in  but failed to retain them should strengthen the sidewinchesters great weakness last year was lack of variety in the bowling h h baid h d wrcnch k b scott and p g foster who between them took nearly all the wickets are again available and should have bencfited by a seasons cxpcrience  n grover a free hitting batsman has to find a wicketkeeper in place of his predecessor a w e winlaw and two opening batsmen he is fortunate in having alt the other batsmen including j davies scourfield wvho showved most promising forn in his first season last year when scoring  against etonreptownd s captain a p d montgomery wil find i bhard to fill the places of d f mendl and c d beaumont two of the best school cricketers of last year but he is fortunate in having the services of p c ashton a fast medium bowler who wlas so successful against malvern and of d w foster mediumpaced who bore the brunt of the bowling last year with beaumont the batting will need strengthening as l a barrett and ashton who were both high up in the averages owed much to inceom plted innings and miontgomery and foster lack experience the juniors are so well looked after at repton however that little anxiety necd be felt as to the batting strength of the sidemalvern have the makings of a side left from last year in a h brodhurst and p h willisdixon who each took is wickets during the tern al a c s cope s f g tolkien and w l morden the wicketkeeper cope and tolkien are both sound and reliable batsmen and the others can make runs but j c evans p c leeson and a s rogers will be greatly rmissed leesons  not out which enabled maivern to score  in under two hours being the outstanding feature of last season malvern as in the case of repton are seldom if ever short of battingrugby have m m walford who has been the mainstay of the football and hockey teams to succeed j a gemmill in the captaincy of cricket he is a sound batsman but has not improved to the extent anticipated with his lcft hand bowling there are three other old colours in r west a fastmedium rightband swing bowler wvho makes full use of bis height d f c steel who at lords last july assisted a s duncan to put up a cenlury in eachi innings against marlborough and e s boyes an unorthodox but improved batsman west too can make runs some of the vacancies may be filled by p kershaw a j m chadwick r f ltmb who has the wrists of a racketsplayer and d f waugh steel iln probably be the wicketkeepermarlrlgh under b d napper had a very successful season but failed to do them selves justice at lords where none of the bats men settled down g e hewan who succeeds napper has some useful batsmen in m n har bottle a promising lefthander j d l dick son and a c fletcher the wicketkeeper but it wlill be difficult to replace l h waddv and g al alston who have been so reliable for two seasons in opening the innings so far as the bowling is concerned  c n westwood may well develop into a danecrous legbreak and googly bowler and p m whitehouse who has an easy action and dickson with a sharp turn from the off are both medium righthand a little strengthening of the battine and the dis covery of a lefthand bowler would make mlarl borough a really good elevencheltenhamn were a better side than thcy showed at lords though they did not appear to advantage in their school matches beaten by rugby mvarlborough and haileybury they vere saved by time against clifton they are fortunate in possessing a prmising wicketkeeper and useful batsnman in a h norris and old colours in a j arengojones s c manneus j s foster and j a s pigeots in addition to e d r eagar eagar who captained the colts xf last year at lords is a uscful batsman with plenty of strokes and should develop into a good mediumpaced bowlercliftoni have f m n heath as captain for the second year and with six of the young eleven of  available including a h ander son a greatly improved wicketkeeper who takes the faster bowling very well should develop into a good side it took them sonmc little time to settle down last season but the advent of e k scott whose egbreaks proved so effective in the later nmatches turned the tide scott who was only  should have at least two more years in the elevenhaileybury are in the happy position of having b r darewski a mediumpaced left band bowler who took ncatlv  wickets last year and seven others remaining from the sidc including b r m hayles one of the best school wicketkcepers of last year there is varietv in the bowling in c p and p k mayhew p nv gale and a m hayfield all of whom can make runs r j purdy a steady hardhitting batsman will probably open the innings with r m childs the youngest member of the side who played the best innings of the match at
