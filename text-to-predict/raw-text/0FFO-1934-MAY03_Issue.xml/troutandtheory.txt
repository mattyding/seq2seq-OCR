trout and theorywherefores of flyfishingfrom a correspondenfwas there ever a sport so provocative of theories as flyfishing for trout  some one may be tempted to answer yes fly fishing for salmon but speculation is an unsatisfying exercise without some measure of agreement on first principles and the very foundations of salmon fish ing are unsolved riddles nobody yet knows for a certainty why a salmon fly is seized or what that strange invention represents in a salmons eye thus denied a foothold the theorist may as well  with a blush retire the methods of angling for salmon have in truth been established by trial and error down the ages and their local variations transmitted as runesthe way of a trout with a fly on the other hand is just plausible enough to en courage theorizing we may assume that we know what a trout fly is meant to imitate and why the trout accepts it if and when that happens even so it will not be long before we are fishing in deep water theory alone is at times an un truthful guide comparing artificial flies even the best of them with the miracu lously delicate and diaphanous creatures which they copy so clumsily one could reasonably feel that a trout must inevit ably be impressed not by the resemblance but by the difference theory alone then might demonstrate unanswerably that no trout could ever have been cheated of its life by a manmade flythat flyfishing for trout must be as mythical a sport or as disappointing as chasing the snark that would not be quite true yet surely the wonder is not that so few trout are caught but that any are the thought may yield some small comfort on a bad dayit is not as if the most trout were killed by the best imitations the rela tively accurate copies which are fished dry take heavier fish but the number of these is as nothing compared with the victims of wet flies which often have only a distant resemblance to nature in the nlorth and the west the fish there may run small but the size of a trout is not necessarily a function of its age or worldly experience and the belief in the educated trout of the chalk streams is i only one more theorveven dry flies made to represent the same insect may be of very dissimilar patterns a designer of aeroplanes who is also the author of that strange book  an experiment with time applied his observant mind some years ago to the devising of dry flies which some think are the nearest approach to the living originals yet invented to those who swear by them it is puzzling that friends continue to plv their older patterns and as destructively as any disciple of mr j h dunne uses his though their theory is evidently all wrong in practice it serves well enough results in the same way justify a local theory that the troui in a certain water which tends to be cold like a fly with  a bit of red in it  because it looks comfortingly warm by what intellectual process under water that idea has reached the fish is not explained but it may be that trout themselves entertain theoriesthe daily  rise  of the trout is familiar yet how mysterious wvhat governs the time of day wvhen their lunch hour begins and its duration  some times it is all over in a minute or two or it may not be observed at all the usual theoty is that the  rise  coincides with a hatch or hatches of fly but the syn chronization is frequently imperfect who has not seen a nver halfcovered with somnolent flies at midday and no takers presumably the weather has something to do with it the influences of weather and the state of the water on trout and salmon have furnished the material of a whole book compiled from the experience of many skilled anglers unfortunately the skilled anglers were not all at one about anything their un reconciled theories were almost as numerous as their contributions to the book ttwo men walked out together from an inn one morning they separated and began fishing half a mile apart on different rivers when thev returned each learned that the other had killed a trout in his first  minutes on the vater and for the rest of the day had moved nothing their experiences were thus oddly similar but not so their explanatory theories that evening for  theories  one should perhaps read  guesses and that may very well apply to the most part of fly fishing
