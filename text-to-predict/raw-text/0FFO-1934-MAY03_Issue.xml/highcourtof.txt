of another assur ance company nothing further should be paid to him and when mr wicks left he knew perfectly well that he had no claim against the defendant company at all from that day to this however he had used the question of renew al commissions by saying  if you dont pay mel will do you incalculable harm having resigned from the company the first thing he did was to say that he wanted to get from the company renewal commissions he said that there was on the files an agreemnent to pay him such commissions and that there were letters to that effect but when asked to produce them he said that they had disappeared whenever i he was asked for a document in support of his claim he alleged that it had been stolen the defendants said that there never was an agree menr to pay mr wicks renewal commissions after he left the companycounsel read an extract from a letter sent by the plaintiff to the secretary of the defendant company and asked whether it could mean any thing but this
