found an attraction in the colour laughter why are our colours in wvest worcestershire redp because at the timue wie adopted them in  your colours in birmingham were blue laughter and it wtas because in our viewi the poisonous literature that emanated from the smaller town as it was at the time laughter was printed in blue that wo decided to adopt red and we have stuck to redand speaking of red i may perhaps be permitted to make this observation because i know that some of those intellectuals iamongst whom i can never hope to number myseulaughter are talking of the red flag as being the latest device in freedom and in progress i have in my possession a photo graph of a map made in queen elizabeths reign of the country that is now called russia and there is wvritten in latin across tbe

on which i must speak to you this afternoon i want to thank every one of you here for those most beautiful and moving presentations which you have thought fit to make to me today nothing has helpedl me more during the last three or four years than that trust and con fldence which all the people of my native country have shown in une chers you believed jn me before anyone else did which is notalways the ease and fortlat lean never he too gratteul there was a time in my public life when few of my critics realizing that ihad come up frol the country believed i knew how to read there was a thue when a lad in london and may her name ever be hela in honour wvas heard to observe  is the new prime inister what you call an educated muan  laughter and cheers i do not complain because it is difficult for people where there are nmore omnibuses and cinenmas to realize that we in the country have a way of doing our own reading and thinking our own thoughts i trust that i have given vou no cause to be ashamed of your own man  o  and cheers wbatever maybe my fate in the years to come all here who ktoiw me wiiu believe mue when i say that i have no greater desire than to get back to worcestershire and to be left alonenow there is one matter of public import ance about which i must take this opportunity of announcinig the lovernments intention and it is a matter of no little interest to a great cotmmnercial community such as finds shelter in birnkingham for several years successive overnnments have been perturbed both about the price and the supply of electrical polwer in the countrv the complaint is not uncommon that in the course of time if matters are left to go on as they are our industry mill fild itself handicapped in inany directions because our rivals wil find themselves in possession of a cheap supply of electrical energy in all the many uses to wvhich that energyv may be put it bas been pointed out that already there is a great disparity in the amount of electricity consiumued we use in this countr  units a year ler head by the population in canada the consumption is v units  in the lnited states emnbracing as it does immense areas of agriculture the consumption is  units and in special areas such as chicago it rises to over output and costthis disparity is very striking thouglh i caunot go so far as those enthusiasts wvho think that you can secure either industrial elilelency or may i add civilization by increaising electraical power or that yoa can describe either in such termus yet there is no doubt that electrical poweer does offer both to the industrialist and to the domnestic user very great advantages and if electricity could be supplied nmore cheaply then the possibilities of its use may be extended in a thousand directions exaggerated speeches on this subject have been mlade as they have bec niade on other subjects in itself cheaper power will not revive industry manufacturing costs in power are but a smiall proportion of their total costs what we have to look at is this consider the total exipenditure of the country on electricity whether for light or power and conlsider the savings that might be mnade over the vhole body of consuiers if the sourceof that light and pow er can be materially cheapened eflar hear on a conscrvative estimate of growth the consuimption of electricity in  years tinie should be not less than  units per head with this larger output the cost of course would be reduced even under present conditions but it should be possible so to reduce the cost in the immediately succeeding years that within  years the saving to the country should run into many millions it is of the greatest mnoment that abundant power should be made available wherever required that it should be derived fromik ample sources possessing adequate reserves and that through interconnexiion any existing or any newv industry may rely absolutely on obtaining quickly and without delay whatever power it requiresnow w e have to ask ourselves are we using today the national resources aud oppor tunities of thle country to the best advantage  this question was fullv exnamined sip or seven years ago by a very strong commission under the chairmaniship of sir archibald wvilliamson nowv lord forrest and the authority of the very represcitative committee is indisputable nd they reached the conclusion that the existing system of generation iu this country required radical alteration they condeniled our parochial practice of generation and dis tribution and they laid it donvn as an axiom in order to ensure a cheap suiplv of electrical power all consumers in industrial districts ought to unite in takinig their amply from a comumon system hear hear the reason is niot only that in the larger stations you have the better and more economical machinery and accumulativo economies due to largescale production but what is miore important by concentrating the demand from a large area and supplying it from a few largo stations you obtain the fullest use and benefit of youir machinery electricity is not a comnmodity xvhich can be stored on a large scale it must be generated as required a plant workine in isolation lias to stand idle luring certain periods and what is technically called the improved load factor becomes a question of vital imporitaice and that improved load factor can only be obtained by combining demands from large areastiie wilwiauisox comluttelnow it is very easy to talk about and even to make sweeping charges but in an old country wiith industry already very highlv and in most cases elliciently orgaiiized it is not so ensy to effect big changes without undue disturbance and that you wish to avoid the strticture of the electrical supply industry rcsults largely front the fact that we in this country were pioneers we started when electricity was used onlyfom light wvhen its future for pover was unforeseen therefore w e started with separate and often very snall areas often far too small and separate under takings it was riot until the beginuing of this century that legislation provided for power comnpanies to operate over larger areas and though those havo been muost useful they camne into the iield too late to achieve all that was aniticipate the williamson committee therefore made certain recommendations that tho country should be divided into suitable areas and that the whole business of gencra tion should he tnidertaken in each of those arcas by a single authority created for the purpose in order to make possible this rc organization legislation was passed in parliamentit was by the coalitiou government creating a body of electrical commissioners whose duty it was to settle tblie right areas and the reration of the joint aut loritiestie comissioners have nowv been nworking for about six years not without success they have mapped out the country into thu proler areas they have set up some authori ties notably in london hut the difficulties of reorganization by districts have proved very grat and tuie present government decided to reexamine the whole position we had as a matter of fact taken this natter into counsideration in those niore leisurely days when we were in opposition wve have appointed a small committee assisted by lord weir lord forrest and ir hardmnan lever to eaamine together with the ministry of transport and the electricity commissioners the present position they reported to us that there were  publie utility generating stations in great britain and that number was nowv increased most of them very small last year  of those stations were responsible for more than half of the total output and the remainder dealt with less than half of tho output between themthus while some of our stations aro tho finest in tho world wo have an abnornal number of small stations producing at an unnecessarily high cost xhear hear thero is a startling difference in the cost of generation between a large efflicit station and a amall local concern let me give you some actual figures fron the returns of i° the best i have the wrorkinlg cost per unit exclusiveof capital charges varied in those different stations from  of a penny to lod and iid and the amount of coal usedto generate one unit varied from sib to lolb and over moreover although most stations are now in frequency there are still i nonstandard frequencies which cantot be interconnectedgovernxment proposalsas a result of the conclusions formed by this committee we have formulated proposals which will be introduced into parliament in the next session we have for our object the improvement of the system of generation of electricity in this country and may i emphasize tho important point that the generation of electricity and its distribution to the consumers are separate processes which present a series of separate problems as compared with distribution the generation of electricity is a scientific and engineering rather than a commercial problem it requires the best commercial brains to run electrical undertakings at a profit bub the problem of the actual production of cheap electricity given the demand is an engineering onewhereas the problem of distribution though it has its engneering aspects is primarily comnmercial it is not enough to have cheap electricity available there must be a good sellmig organization ready to meet the oppor tunity the requiroments the idiosyncrasics of the actual individual consumer who is the man whom ire want to benefit even also to extend the use which consumers make todav of electricitvin short to apply all the skill and energyvpeculiar and necessary to the sale of electricitv the distribution of electricity in this sens is already in the hands of many competent organizations on a large scale the power companies and the big municipali ties on a smauer scale the distribution companies and municipalities are today con sidering actively the needs of the consumers in their own locality the great need in dis tribution is to reduce the cost and to make easy the formnation of new authorities whether municipal or otherwise to undertake the supply in areas which are not yet covered the act of  siniplified and cheapened the obtaining of parliamentary sanction we doubt that very much more is re uired here during the last five years  urders were issued for new or extended areasin generation however as i have already shown the process of concentration of all the demands on large modern and efficient sta tions properly interconnected is proceedingvery slowly and we are sure that in the i interests of the electrical industry and of the nation legislation is required to expedite the process we propose while strengthening thc powers of the minister and the commissioners to set up executive power with boards covering tha whole country for tlhe purpose of estab lishing interconnecting lines andecoordinating in large areas both the existing large moderm stations and others which are and will be required when i speak of a board i do not mean a nationalized authority i do not mean a government department what we have in mind is a board managed by practical men closely in touch with the indu§try on the lines of such an authority as thhe mersev docks and ilarbour board or the port of london an authority where the common services necessary to an industry are carried out under the direction of practical men vho are con nected in some way or another with soine aspect of the work this new board will raise its own capital and will work on ordinary commercial lines when it has earned interest and sinking fund on its capital any surplus will be returned in respect of reducing charges to the undertaking whom it is supplyingpowers of thie boardnve do not consider that any government subsidy will be required but hi order to enable so largc a venture to be carried out success fully and to see it through its early years it will be necessary to extend to it a govern ment guarantee similar to that which has been given under the trade facilities act to imany fruitful enterprises cheers they will construct necessary interconnecting lines so that the municipaliiies or companies whose stations by reason of age or size are inefficient will be able to close them down and obtatn supplies from the board at a cheaper rate thelarger stations will continue i trtlst to be operate by their present owners or by com panieg or municipalities xvho may build others in the future but thev will work to get her under the board for the production of a common supply of electricity rhich the board will purchase and make available to all the distributors the details of the scheme will of course be embodied in the bill when it is introduced later in the house of commons the board wrill work on commercial methods but will be armed by the necessarv powers as a last resort to bring everybody into line cheers it wvould be impossible to co ordinate the large areas unless those differences in frequency to wvhich i have already referred were removed and part of the business of the board viu be to secuem that the change over from nonstandard to standard fre quencies shall be made in al the areas as they are coordinated i am aware that the necessity for this standardization is not uni versally accepted it is of course true that firom the point of view  of a nonstandard area so long as it can remain isolated the ad vantages of a change over are diminished by the expense and inconvenience of the change but taking the country as a whole and remem bering the rapid growth which is confidently anticipated in the use of electricity the bene fits to the consumers and the manufacturers of electrical plant in having one standard of frequency so that all areas can be intercon nected and all productions standardized are i am advised very greatit will be part of the duty of the board to effect at its own cost statidardization iu all areas as thev are connected and this expenditure we are advised will be more than covered by economies in generation incidentally the activities of the autbority in the standardization of frequency and the construction of main transmission lines will materially assist industry i am not a believer in the making of xwork just for the sake of saying that somebody is being empldyed the proper use of capital is to find remunera tive employmentchearsand in so doing to create the demand for labour this elec tricity scheme we believe wvill be remuncra tive and will find work in the electriml in duslry and in the allied metal trades we are satisfied on many grounds that action by the government is required in order to free the electric supply industry from the restric tions which have been the creation of ao many small and disconnected generating stations we believe that the scheme we propose will do this with the least possible isturbaitce to the existing arrangements the coordination ne propose is directed to the single purpose of securing that electricity shall be generated in the most cflicient manner and once this cheap supply is assured owe believe that the iiicreased concentration of elidcient distribution will secure that overy business and householder will be able to get the electricity that lie requireswce do not put this scheme forward as the salvation of the cotutry or the salvation of industry wve take advantage of the geographical compactness of industrial britain we oeordinate it ive exploit it every year we delay such a national advantage it will become more difricult and more oxpen sive to effect it ouaht to have been doiie years ago hear hear it may be a nettle that ve are grasping but ve shall grasp it firmy in the belief that in the competitive world of niodern inidustry we cannot afford any longer to nieglect the sound technical organization of the sources of power cheersold names recalledi apologize for having detained you so long but i have one more word to say a toast has been entrusted to me that i shall find the greatest pleasure in giving to youit is the toast of the midland unon of con servative and unionist associations i think it is good for us members of parliament selfcomplacent as we often are when we arrive safely at westminsterlaughter believing that we are there by ourov unierits and not by the efforts of anyonie else to realize what the midland union has done for us and did for those who went beforei cannot forget on an occasion like this the names of many of those no longer with us who worked so hard so loyally in the old days to help to make this great organization what it has become y ovn father forniany years cheers lord phmo uths father and his father cheers and the inte dake of norfolk were connected witlh it for many ears and sir james rankin orked too for it for a long time and i do not think that any of us whose memorics go back would wllingly forget the name of our old friend mr j c shaw cheers who worked for it at the time of the formation of the union until comparatively recently and it is a soureo of great plcasure and satisfaction to lue to see my old friend harry pratt cheers holding the position that he does a position he holds by reason of his superlativo merit i feel in proposing this toast as all of vou mu t feel that we are drinking the health of nnd the long continuance of an organiza tion which is to most  of us like our own family the midland union as i said at the beginning of my speech embraces a happy band of brothers in the counties under its mgis long may the blidland union flourish long may it be abloe to show the splendid record which has been its on dur ingthe last generation a record for high adventure in the political world for success in fighting for moderation lx the hour of triumiph and in short for all those qualities we would most desira to see in the political organizations of the country i wviu couple with the toast the name of the earl of plymouth whom we nil rejoie to see treadingin the footsteps of his father and performing in the high position ho holds in the coantry the duties that appertain to that position in the admirable way that he does cheersloud plyoomresponded to the toast
