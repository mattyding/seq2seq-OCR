i the selfits fullest liferrom a correspondentthe shortest word in the language re presents the most mysterious of all facts save the fact of god wvhen a man says i think i feel i know i am he shovs that he is aware that he has a life separate from au others he is one and the rest is some one or something else he is conscious of a unity of experience wvhich is his alone and as long as life lasts he w ill remain none other than himselfthis consciousness of selfhood belongs to evely man and it is expressed by the  i  which is so constantly in our speech and the centre of our experience a mere animal is not a self it canniot refer its actions to itself but is driven by its momentary impulses and has no unity of consciousness a man on the other hand is something more than a collection of different powers of perception emotion and will he possesses selfknowledge and is able to recognize the moral value of his emotions decisions and desires his self is a cosmos with its separate powers brought into a definite relation to each other but that self can never come to its full growth until it lives in relation to other selves and to the external wrorld which conditions human life a man act ing in the full freedom of his nature re sponds to external reality w hether by sym pathy or opposition and nmust have deal iogs with other selves for without these his own self cainot be developedour first concern should be not our selves our desires impulses or fears but the things and people outside us in so faras we think olly of self we become egoistic i selfcentred or morbid all that we mean by  i  attains its true development as we bring it into contact wvith those who are  not i ulysses declared  i am part of all that i have seen anid the self attains a fuller and nobler life in proportion as it goes otut and responds to what is ideal not merely in this of that activity of life but the ideal of the whole self it is be cause this ideal is never found in the things of time and space nor in the per sons with whom we have to do that wve are driven to the conelusion that the true self has its part in spiritual reality and that human personality cannot find its full activity or attain its true end apart from that which is supernaturalthe clhristiani self finds its ideal in the person of christ it reaehes its fullest freedom and vigour in so far as it makes that ideal its controlling force that this ideal can become operative in experience is plain from the witness of st paul and all the saints of christian history in deed this is so direct a fact of the apostles experience that he declares of himself  i live yet not i this implies not loss but gain to the self no one is more his true self for no man does i stand for so strong active and true a personality as the man whose self is energized and con trolled by the life of faith it creates a deep unity of life and a true harmony between the inner and outer between the i and the not i a modern psychologist has suggested that the perfected self not only morally but in all ways ceases to be aware of its own existence because it is continually enriched and satisfied by the fullest contact with other selves the christians experience of the life in christ endorses that viewbut none of us has attained this entire correspondence between himself and the perfect other sel he cannot claim to be in perfect harmiony in himself we are all conscious of discordance in life so that it seems natural to speak of self as if it xvere made up of various selfs fre quently at war with each other popular language witnesses to this experience with its references to the higher and lower self of a man its judgment that a mans coii duct may be unworthy of himself or that it springs from a source higher than him self as the man reflects on his experience he is conscious of a constant loss not only of what belongs to himself but of what is himself by submission to evil he has forfeited what is the essence of selfs lifebelief in a life after death is a witness to a mans conviction of the value amid potentialities of his selfhood buddhism which looks to nirvana as the highest end of man is necessarily accompanied by a low view of personalitv if as in maho medanism and some eircles of christian thouight exterior delights and pains are emphasized as the end of effort a mans true self is inevitably degraded to be re garded as the victim of fate or as radically evil it is a like blunder to regard the ilf as something to he repressed and mortified for its owni sake the truer method is to regard the self as possessed of possibilities of infinite progress and as proceeding to its true life when it goes out and receives into itself as the only life congruent to its owvn that hisgher self which for christians is the life of cod in nian the life of the incarnation this is the assurance of st paul in bis declaration i live yet not i but chlrist liveth in me and throiughout the centuries thc apostolic vwitness is endorsed by men and women uillike the apostle in anything except in their participation of that life by which the self has attained true royalty
