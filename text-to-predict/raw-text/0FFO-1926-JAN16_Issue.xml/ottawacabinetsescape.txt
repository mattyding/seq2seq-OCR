gressives voted with the conservatives mr campbell mr lucas mr carmiehaelmr boutellier and lr fansher all the other progressives voted with the govern ment including miss macphail who in the debate expressed her lack of confi dence in the administration the two labour members messrs woodsworth and heap and the two independents messrs bourassa and neil also voted against the amendment mr chaplin the conservative member for kent who is ilu was the only member absent from the division the vote was taken after midnight and a long and boisterous demonstration by the liberals followed the announcement of the resultthe two most notable speeches in the last hours of the debate were those of mr cahan one of the new members from montreal and mr boivin minister of customs mr boivin contended that if the meighen amendment were carried the house must not only be adjourned but prorogued and a new session called by the governorgeneral at which a new speech from the throne must be presented the object of this con tention was to meet the conserva tive promise that the house would notbe dissolved if the no confidence i amendnient were carried it is believed that the argument had effect with thei majority of the progressives who are resolutely opposed to a dissolution of parliament and another general election i mr cahan mnade no appeal to the pro gressives and expressed the hope that no member of the conservative party would offte such gifts and inducements to thatgroup as wvere offered in the speech from  the throne which had been prepared i with the deliberate object of securing progressive support for the administra tion so far as he understood the wishes of his constituents it was that he should devote himself to two sets of grievances those of nova scotia  and the west because the prosperity of mlontreal depended upon the prosperity of the eastern and wvestern provinces the country was watching the progressives in order to know whether they could be influenced by the inducements held out by the govelnment and if they accepted them the group would sink to a low level in the estimation of the people he ridiculed tlie contention that parliament must be dissolved if mr aieighens amendment were carried declaring that the argument would not be accepted by any two years student of constitutional practice in any uni versity in the dominion what would happen if the amendment were carried would be that the prime minister would resign and leave the governorgeneral free to call on thb leader of the opposi tionmr kings intentionsapparently the govornment will en deavour to go on with their tuajocity of three which would have been only two if the eioilservative member for kentl had been aable to take part in the division an immediate attempt will be made to secure a seat for mr mackenzie king the prime ministerfor the last hours of the debate the galleries of the house were crowded and many hundredswere unable to obtain admission few left until the division had been taken amd the interest in the proceedings was intense although as the debate neared its close the expectation grew in both tho house and the galleries that the government would have a small majority there has been no more interesting debate in the history of the canadiau parliament and no vote in vhich the government has been upheld by so small a majorityit is doubtful whethler the counttrv is impressed by the mnanceuvres of either party there is some feeling among the conservatives that advances have been made towardl the progressives which willcreate an onerous obligation for any i conservative government and make it difficult to give effect to the main featurcs of the policy which was pro claimed at the general election criti cism is the more outspoken because all the maniceuvres have beea futileno one believes that the government can long survive and it is doubtful wvhether it can get through the session in street and club comment the pro gressives are commonly denounced as mainly concerned about the sessional indemnity the allowance of  Â£ but it is only fair to admit that the speech from the throne was practi cally a declaration of progressive principles and politics while it was natural that there should be an alliance between progressives and liberals rather than between the progressives and the conservative partyconimenting on the
