inistry to whom mir baldwin was able to pay tribute for their labours for the natibnal cause and for their loyalty to himselfrepresentative as it was of the industrial life of the miidlands the prime minister considered the gathering a suitable one before which to expound in broad outline the details of the governments electricity scheme for the first time it wvas obviously not an occasion for too many technical details but mr baldwvinv was able to give a fairly comprehensive idea of the main lines upon which the government inteads to proceed in the newv electricity billinir importance made it necessary for him to read the greater part of his speech and his audience listened wvith the greatest interest though possibly many of them would have liked himi also to dvell however briefly upon other politi cal issues in his first speech during the parliamentary recessstandardizationthe main purpose of the new bill clearly will be to set up the new execu tive board with powers covering the whole country a general cheer greeted the prime inistef s announcement that the new authority is not to be a govern ment department but one managed by practical men closely in touch with the industry on the lines of the port of lon don authority many of the technical questions wili obviously be left to the board itself for decision but the governm ment has already accepted the view of the weir committee that the standardi zation of frequency must be a necessary feature of the scheme mlr lbaldwin admitted that the necessity for standardi zation is not universally accepted and he agreed that so long as a nonstandardized area could remain isolated the advantages of a change over were diminished by the necessary expense and inconvenience but the aim of the new govern rnent scheme is to  anticipate the rapid growtlh in the use of electricity and it therefore insists upon one standard in order that all areas may be interconnected it will be the duty of the board to construct the necessary interconnecting lines so that the muni cipalities or companies whose stations are inefficient will be able to close down and obtain a supply from the board at a cheaper rate the larger stations will continue to be operated by their present owners working under the board for the production of the common supply of electricity wvhich the board wiill purchase and make available to all the distri butorsthe mistakse of the  electricity bill by wvhich the commissioners were net given compullsory powers wvill not lie repeated for the prime mlinister made it clear yesterday that while

from the state or the municipality to the new board during its early life but the govern ment plan imposes no contribution on public funds the board will raiseu its own capital and will work on ordinary commercial linesand the prime mtinisters statement that no government subsidy wvill be needed was applauded if neces sary a government guarantee under the trade fatcilities act will he giyen

creation of many small and disconneeted generating stations and the scheme wvill be comnireaded to parliament as one that will do this with tho least possible disturbance to existing arrangemelnts hie
