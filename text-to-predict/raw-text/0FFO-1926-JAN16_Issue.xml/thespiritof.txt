the spirit of servicemr ba ldwin and the juniormiembersthe prime minister was given a remarkably enthusiastic receptiou by the junior members of the party organization wvhom he addressed subsequently in an adjoining room he told them it was difficult for them to realize at their age what a real potent help they were with their youth and their enthusiasm to those who for the moment had to bear the brunt of the day which would be theirs before many years all of you lie conthiued belong to what will be called the postwar guardianthat is to say there is hardly one of you who was not a child in the time of the great war again it is naturally impossible for you to realize to the full extent some of the worst features of the great war perhaps if any feature is tho worst featurec amnong the thousand that are bad and evil it is this as i have often laid stress on before tho war took from us the wlhole of the flower of the man hood of this country which would today be between the ages of r and  just the very age when a man is at his very best for thecoiiduct of the business of the country the l politics and local government of the country the education of his own children and every thing else that makes for the permanent good of the country the fiation to that extent is weakened and there is no single cause of the difficult times through wlichl we are passing more responsible for these troubles than tliat because it means thlat not only are we reft of them but we have to carry on tho daily work of the country without their help many of tbose whlo are the least fit to do it the older people will have to carry on in spite of the necessary loss of a certain amount of vigour and elasticity untih such tinie as they can be released and have the help of the younger generation when it comes alolgin any case we have a horrible hiatus of perhaps  or  years during xvhich everybody wlho cares for iiis country has got to work double shifts it will not be until all of you in this room are in middle age that that will be rectified by the natural processes of re generation that is whly we so rejoice to see such large niumbers of this risinig generationi a generation that will lhave to take over in duie time from us our responsibihty and oar labours wlio will have to enter wlho are enterinig oni tho cares and responsibilities of life with the full sense of what those cares and responsibili ties mean who show by their early attach nient to affairs of state and to certain lines of policy in affairs of state that they care and that they mean to take their part in fighting for the betterment of their country that is why as i said ve do watch you aud tour histitution of this fellowship of the junior imperial leagule not only w ith the syrmpathly wvhich would be natural but with such hope and expectation that great thinigs for the country will come of it you often hear it said today that the responsibility from the great wvar rested on the shoulders of the old nien a catch phrase and a cant phrase therc is no truth in it all the responsibility from the great war rested on all of us of all ages and in many countries and there is no differ enice fundamentally betveen the older and the youngerthe policy of serviceor is there a difference between different classes the real difference amongst men is betwveen those who are prepared to give rmore tlhan they get and those who wvant to get more than they give cheers and that difference is found just as much between muen whether they be dukes or greasers or anywvhere in between you get the men who vnit to serve in all ranks of the state and you get the men who want to have in all rnks of the state it always seems to me that the kind of con servatism and ulnionism which i believe in and which can triumph is that which has for its fundamental policy the policy of service to the country and hi that sacred service there stand shoulder to shoulder men of every class of society as there always will i rejoice to think that consciously and possibly uncoln sciously some of the younuger of you are taking your staud early in life on the side i believe in with every fibre f my being the side whose policy for the working out of whose creed can alone bring our country through these difficult days of transition and make her a country of which we can all be proud and which may be an example to the wlhole world wve are going through an extraordinarily diffi cult time but all the same although there is much that might depress thosc wvho look only on the depressing side of thingb there is a great deal to encourage for i believe there niever was a time when there were more people in all ranks of society in tlis country wlho are resolved to do what they cau by their own service and their ownv example to lead their country into those paths of selfsacrifice of care for others into the pursuit of peace and  canmot think that those forces properly coordinated and welded together cannot in tle end control the rude forces of disorder the forces of lhate and the forces of destruction between people and be tween classes you julior imps have a great future before you because you wlil live to see probably the end of these uncertain times in which we are living now i believe you will ilive to see a ical unity of the nation in theachierement of which you wrill have plaved no mean part and you will have lived to see our country recovered from the vounds which she got in the great war colntented happy and strong setting an example to the vhole world setting an example to her own people per haps when that time conies you wvill be able to spare a kindly word for those wvho have worked in these difficult days cheersi after tea the prime minister left birningham by the  london train from snewstreet i
