city electricitypricesdiscontent amongtraderscall for cheap lightelectrie light bills in the city of london should be rather lower this year it is understood that the two companies on which the supply chiefly dependsthe city of london and the charing cross companiespropose to reduce the secon dary charge for electric light as from january  the secondary charge is that which comes into operation after a certain standard of consumption has been passed such a reduction will no doubt ae welcome on the old principle that batlf a loaf is better than no breadkut if the relief should be no grethan is intimated it i unlikely that there will be any alleviation of the discontent elt in the city with the high prices to which it is subject this discontent has been fully expressed in the times where at many periods of last year to go no farther back protests wcre made both in letters and in other ways the burden of the complaint eas been and is that the cost of electricity in the city is very high comparing un favourable with that in neighbouring boroughs and in the county generally and on the other hand that the amount paid in dividends ad carried to reserve during the past six years by the two supplying companies is excessive and shonld have been shared in part with the consumers in the form of reduced pricesin face of this widespread opinion tho snall reduction in the secondary charge which is expected to operate with the new year will not be received with much grati tude the argument is that at least it should operate as from october  last and that further the maximum price of d a unit compares badly with the d charged in the xieighbouring borough of stepneymost of the recent wardmotes found in this question their principal subject for dis cission and the majority of them passed resolutions to the effect that prices were too high and tliat reductions should be made o cover the last quarter of  at some of the meetings an additional resolution was carried advocating the promotion of a short act of parliament to enable souie neighbouring ighting authority to bring its mains into the city stepney was probably the authority that was  particularly in mind for mr deputy sandle stated at a court of common louncil a few weeks ago that stepney would be willing to sutpply the city at d and ld and was already supplying nnothar borough on those tcrms while it contributed a sub stantial sumn out of the profts in relief of its own ratesciiages lin stepsnrit is not surprising that city consumers should look eastwards with longing eyes one wellknown flrm has made no secret of a comparison it has drawrn between its actual bills for electric lighting and the amounts it would have paid if it could have got its supply from stepney the difference in three years would have amounted to £ the figures being as followv the chargeof d and d a unit in the citv is contrasted nob only with that of d ana id in stepacy but with d nnd id in edin burgh while it is admitted that edinburgh may be favourably placed for securing cheap power opinion in the city insists that the disproportion between the respective charges lnust be considered abnormal it also lavs emphasis on the  and  per cent dividends of the supplying companies and on the very large sums that thev are able to carry to reserve nor does it hesitate to suggest that the city corporation in past years has missed several fair chances of safeguarding the inter ests of the citizens who are now as mr jioward wiuians sand at castle baynard wardmote to a certain extent up against the act of parliamentthis is very much what in other language the champions of the two companies contend that the complainants are reopening a question already settled by the london electricity act now in force a question moreover on which the city corporation had ample opportunity of making its voice heard and its influence felt a further contention on behalf of the companies is that their working expenses wiu be heavily increased by the quinquennial valuation and that this factor prevents any more substantial reduction of charges but perhaps the strongest argu ment that the companies have to offer if one excepts that of arrangement legally accom plished lies in the peculiar situation of the citythe city is less industrial than mercantile howvever much it may manufacture its pri mary electrical need is for light at limited periods of a normal day if electricity could be stored as gas is stored this circumstance would involve no difficulty things being what they are however an electrical plant meust be kept to meet a large demand for a short period stiipped of technical language which often obscures rather than explains the view of the companies in regard to the city is that its multitudinous offices cannot be lighted so cheaply as if all tfie workinghours were dark or as if each office made by electric power the things in which it dealsprofrr of companixesfor its own part the city recognizes that in some respects it is not as other cities as has already been stated it allows for the difference between itself and edinburgh at the same time it declines to be convinced that its special character explains awav the charges of the companies and the profits of their shareholdersagainst the high charges the city sets the highprolits while to the suggestion of coming burdens it retorts that the companies ac counts for rates were reduced in  from £ to £ antd that their total rate payments fell from £ in  to £ in  in the six years  the char tag cross company paid  per cent in divi dends bonus aud bonus shares and carried  per cent to reservea total of  per cent on paidup ordinary capital in the same period the city of london company paid  per cent in dividends and carried  per cent to reserve or a total of  per cent on paidup ordinary capital the re serves to be capitalized are set down as at least £ of wvhich £ are credited to the charing cross company and £ to the city of london companyfigures therefore are not calculated to convert the business men of the city to the notion that they have no cause for grumblng nor is the reminder that they should have discovered in time the signiflcance of the act likely to bring them deeper consolation they are hurt in more than their private and personal undertakings a very large number of them feel that the pride of the citv is involved  the city they say  is pre sumed to be the centre of the commercial life of the country and should therefore be armed at all points for the light to maintain the commercial positiou of the country but instead of being armed it is weakened by extravagant burdens of working expenses which our rivals are not asked to bear to any thing like the extentfor all these reasons the coming concession by the two city companies is not in prospect greeted vith more than tepid thanks one flim estimates that on its account for a given quarter of about £ the reduction wiiu come to about £ another firm on a quarterly account of some £ expects to save about this modicum of relief goes but a small ivny towards meeting the claim of the city man that if we are to compete successfully in the markets of the world his costs must not be from  to  per cent more than those of ether commercial and maniufacturing centres
