general hertzogsnative policya national questionfrom ou own cobrespondentcape town jn with the approach to the parlia mentary session interest grows in general hertzogs proposals in regard to the natives popular opinion im my judgment is indisposed to scrutinize too elosely details or omissions regarding general i ert ogs attitude as constituting a national lead and giving an opportunity to enlighten the prevalent ignorance and formulate a sphere of discussionmluch will depend upon general smutss attitudewhich has been hesitant hitherto but there is no sign that he will attempt to assume a carping attitude general hertzog does not intend to submit his native bills for parliamentary discussion this session as he is in favour of the method of informal discussion with various interests such as farmers pro fessors and industrialists at the moment he is not disposed to accept general smutss suggestion of a national convention being impressed by the difficulty of mustering an impartial body of real standing but it is by no means certain that general hertzog will not come round to this in the end provided general smuts gives proof in time of his resolve not to attempt to make party capital out of the obvious deficiencies in general hertzogs scheme i am convinced that any attempt either by the ministerialists or general smuts to use the topic for party ends would be bitterly resented by strong public opinion the prospects for a real national effort to treat the subject in a statesmanlike way with due explanation to and con sultation of the natives are therefore favourable but any slip on either side may phunge the whole subject into a morass of petty eontroversy and this risk cannot be disregarded
