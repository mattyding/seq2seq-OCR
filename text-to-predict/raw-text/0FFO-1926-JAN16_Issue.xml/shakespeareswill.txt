shespearswtilthe second bestbeda problemi revivedwhen shalespeare in his wiiu of  left the second best bed to his wife anne he did not realize the problem he was bequeathing to future generations this problem has long vexed the minds of his admirer wvho would fain think him a good husband as well as a great poet now a good husband does unot cut off his wife with a shilling  and to that testa mentary insult it has seemed just to compare the second best bedin the current number of ynoles and qqeries mr s  addy who is well known in certain directions of antiquarian researh presents a sevencolumn argumzent to the end of roscuing shakespeares memory from the stigma on his sense of right and wrong mr addvs con clusion in brief is that the secdnl best bed iu no way expressed the full intentins of the testator he ventures even to  suggest a reason why the best bed was not mentioned and first he quotes sir sidney lees summary in the last edition of the lifethe name of shakespeare s wife was omitted from the original draft of the will but byan inter lineation in the fmal draft shereceived his second best bed with the furniture no other bequest was madc her it was  common practice of the period to specify a bedstead or other defined article of household furniture as part of a wifes inheritance nor was it unusual to bestow the best bed onr another mnember of the family than the wife leaving her only the secoud best but no will except shakeipeares s forthcoming in which a bed forms the sole bequesthler rizht to a idows dowere to a third part for life in freehold estatewas nxot sabject to testamentary disposition but shakespeare had taken stcps to prevent her from beneiugat any rate to the fhill extentin that legal arrangemecnt he had barred the dower in the case of his ltest purchase of freehold estate viz the house at black friars such procedure is pretty conclusiv proof that he had the intention of excluding her from the enjoy ment of his possessions after his deathcontemporary willsit will be noticed that sir sidney lee et pressly allows that mistress shakespeaies right to a widows dower or third part was not subject to testamentary disposition mr addy shows how old vas the doctrine in common law of the reasonable part as pplicable both to w ives and children laid dovwn by bracton who died in  it con tijnued over a considerable part of england until the th century was nearing its end and in london as late as in the absence of any collection of wvar wickshire wills mr addy has had to rely on the wills of other counties here evidence of the recognition of the common law rights of widows arid children frequently appears it is exceptional inn many publislhed series of wills for the testator to bequeath the shares to which their families were entitled by tho common law the reasonable parts were often called portionis so that men spoke of their wives portions and their childrens portions as if they were vasted rightsthere was then no need for shakespeare to give to his wvife any part of his fortune seeing that her right was strictly prescribed but mr addy proceeds to traverse sir sidney lees assertion that no will except slhakespeares is forthcoming in which a bed formns the sole bequest and he does so by quoting a case from the york probate registryin  john hill of grimesthorpe near sheffleld after giving some pecuniary legacies to his friends and relations gave to rose his wife his best bed and he gave her uothing more he bequeathed his lands to trustees to the use of his daughters saying nothing about dower and he also gave to his daughters the residue of bis estatc the will wvas proved by rose hill the widow and relict to the use of elizabeth auneand grace children under age to the inexperienced it would appear that he had treated his wife very badly by leaving ber nothing but his best bed thereby giving lher less than lie had given to distant relations and friends yet she proved his will and was in fact treated ivitli perfect fairness for by the comrmoni law she was entitled not only to dower in his lands but to a third part of all hismoney goods and chattelsthis will we are told is oni all fours writh shakeespeatres except that john hills widow proved his will whereas shakeqpeares widow who was past  was not appointed executrix in neither case did theo hsband belhave with cruelty or show a want of affection for his wifebut somo poring fellow seh as dr johnson contemned may object that shakespeare lid not leave his best bed after the example of jolm hill nor one of the best beds within my house as did philip morton of bradfield in south yorkshire in o no lie confiued his liberality to the second best bed andtlhouh he inicluded tbo furniituire belonginlg ho did uot like philip alorton add a coxmany have tried to explain this second best legacy professor ljwdoui remarks tlhat perhaps shakespeare chose a particular bed  to indulge some fancy  of bis wifes that wives do indulgoe fancies for particular aritieles of furnitdire amid not ahvays tho most in trinsically valuable is comnmon ktnowledoe mir addy however with large dependence on itmnovable property cautiously proffens another theory he bids us not to forget that abed was frequently made art heirloom and suggests that shakespeares best bed may have been affixed to te panelling or framework of tshe new placeeiouse at blackfriarsthe next point coneerns the house at black friars it stood within oft of the blaekfriars thleatle that theatre as wo like to remember occupied part of thie site now covered by the titnes offlee the house was bought bv shakespeare in  for £ and imrniediately mortgaied for £ by a conveyancing device his wife s dower was barred and the backfriars property was bequeathed to susannia tbe poets daughter with the debt upoui it un redeemed consequently susanna got only an equity of redemptionthe common mu entitled the wife to dower in the freeholds of the testator among whicl the house at blaclfriars would not be included owing to the unredeemed mortgage she had also the right to remain inher hrsbands capital mansion ntew place in stratfordonavon for  days after his death diring which time her dower must be assigncd to her mr addy is  pretty sure  thatsusanna and her husband dr hall would agree to the settlement ofthe onethir of the estate without compulsion we others can at least hope so
