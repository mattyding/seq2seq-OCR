the last days of hbinba little volume which has recently been published inparis is likely tothrow some new light onthe most intereating period of the life of one of the most in teresting figures in modern literature heinrich hleine was one of those men whose personal and literary character requires misfortane for its full de velopment he came of a longsuffering race and suffering seemed the most congenial atmosphere for him to breathe if his earhest and with one exception his most seriou passion had been crownel with success the world might have lost one of its greatest lyrical poets although the ladys happiness woaldhave been scarcelynmoresecurethn that of mlary chaworth if she had become lady byron fortunately for every one she jilted the poet and  das buch der lieder  was the result but a nature so fall of life znd desire as beines could not be permanently cast down by one dis appointment ho took refuge where most poets bave taken refuge in a distant past which his ima gination allowed him to colour in his owvn way lie became as he said himself at once the acme and the bano of the romantic school founded by tieck schlegel and novalis and on the other hand he worshipped greek besuty with the same ardour although not with the same classic dignity as goethe had done the political struggle of the day furnished him with another means of excite ment and the autborities of his fatherland not re lishing the lavour of his satire he settled in france to escapo the alternative of spaudaa the prussian fortress  where a high legal functionary had informed him  it was very cold in the winter where no oysters ever came so far from the sea and where the inha bitants caught no game except the fios which fell imto their soup h e accordingly went into volun tary exile and in  arrived inparis where at last he thought he had found a congenial home i the ingenuity the readiness above all the gaiety of the parisians lord houghton remarksin his sympathetic n emcir of the poets latter days  seemed to him almost a necessity cf existence for which his temperament had hitherto yearned in vain it was not the old greek life but it was some thing like it in its openair liveliness its alert passage from thought to thought its keen relib of sensual pleasure everything appeared new and beautiful to him  every dish he partook of at a cheap restaurant was ambrosia  every lady he saw paesing on the boulevards a veuus  and in later years he recollected with horror the ragouts and the tender words and glances which his jugendeslei had relished be was more over thrown into the midst of one of the most interesting epochs of modern french literature the leaders of french romanticism became his friends  the saintsimonian doctrine was explained to him by the initiated chopin liszt and berlioz were among his inti mates and his own articles in tho revue des deusmonda o wre eagerly read and universauy ad mired he was in short a successfal man and fevv would have recognized intho elegantfldmur with a rubicund face and with the golden ducats of his uncle salomon clinking in his pocket the singer of the sweetest and saddest songs ever conceived and a pessmist as genuine as schopenhauer himself although curiously enough the poet and the philosopher ignored each other the sentimental german heine doffed for the attire of the witty frenchman tinged with voltaireanism but iu this assumnption he was scarcely more successful than in that of greek optimism although born a subject of louis king of holland the father of the third napoleon and taught in his youth by a french abbd he never acquired the language of his adopted country in perfection even in his last days he spoke with a marked accent and his french writing although full of esprit and vivacity was nerer genuinely idiomatic he always remained a german with a secret longing for his  schdnes vaterland just as he always remained a sad man in spite of his assumed gaiety and a jew in srite of the ceremony of baptism to which he submitted or reasons of convenience all this became appa rent when misfortune tore off the mask he had worn more or less unconsciously for many yearsin swhile the revolution so often prophesied by him was rampant in the streets of paris hoeine disappeared for ever from his favourite haunts enemies asserted that he was ashamed to show his face when the accounts of the secret service money of louis philippes government came to be examined it was discovered that the german poet and journalist had been for years in receipt of a considerable pension apart from the secreev of tho transaction there was littlo to be ashamed of heines position in literature fully entitled him to oflicial recogni tion and he had always been a enuine admirer of louis pbilippe the best kingf he said  who ever wore the constitutional crown of thorns his republicanism was never more than skindeep the fastidious poet shrank from all contact with the profanum vulgus and his book against borne and the german democrats which we had occasion recently to discues bears testimony to an aversion more genuine than conld be purchased by all the money of the royal mint the real cause of heines retirement from social life was a more tra pic one a wasting disease called by the poysicians consumption of the spinal marrow had for a long time been under mining his health and at last confined him to the sick bed from which he was never to rise again he lost the use of his lower limbs  the muscles of one and ultimately cf both of his e elids become relaxed and he had to rais them with his fingers in order to see his physical sufler ings moreover were intense and night aftel night be passed in sleepless unrest the victory of mind over matter was never shown more triumphantly than by this poet dying a lingering death for seven long years at last the nature of the m man and the poet ap peared in its true colours from the whitelimbed gods and goddesses of olymius he took a sad fare well in  les dieuxc en exll  and the sufferings of his own race became henceforth his favourite theme even as in philosophy he returned from the shallow pantheism of the hegelian school to the mono theistic faith to whlich his people had clung for ages the noblest lines be ever penned were devoted to the triad of jewish poets in mediaeval spain iben eara gabirol and the great jebuda benhalevy

agree with us in placing the  romanzero ii as a permanent literary monument above the  buch der lieder in the former the poet has lost or no longer chooses to give way to the lyrical sweetness of bis

more and to absorb for the rest of his days what passionate feeling still remained to him he lcquaintance was entirely casual returning from vienna to paris the lady had been asked to take some music written to one of his songs by an admirer to the poet and was on the point of leaving his house when from an inner room she heard a violent ring of the bell and soon afterwarda an eager voice asking the servant to let the visitor enter this ahe accordingly did and found in a room bare of allornament or comfort lying on a couch propped up by pillows a suffering halfblind man in wbom she immediately recognized the great poet so dearto her by bis works  i always like he said  to talk to any one who ceomes frcr librfrom ger many in this manner commenced one of the most curious love affairs on record  for no other word can be applied to a relation between the dying poet and the attractive and fashionable lady which altbough devoid of the faintest trace of sensualism bore every trace or the most violent passion students of heines later work are familiar with the name of  la mouche given to the lady from a design on her signet ring but of her identity little was known

the same words by another witness also a lady the late lady duff gordon who had known the poet when she was a child and inspired him with the oharming lyric  waen ich an deinem hause des morgeas vor iibergeh and who again visited him in his last days gives the foll owing description of him in an in teresting letter addressed to lord houghton he lay on a pile of mattresses his body wasted so that it seemed no bigger than a child under the sheet which covered him the eyes closed and the face altogether like the most painful jecce homo e ever painted by some old german painterwhen lady duff gordon voes on to say that  his face seemed to bave gained a certain beauty from pain and suffering  she scarcely does justice to the original in middle life heine was inclined to corpulence  when disease had wasted his body the grand features of his face stood forth and his ex pression gained a strange spiritual beauty which once seen was not easily forgotten his cha racter is painted by our author in the most amiable light his bitterness and sarcasm she says were nnly the rind  tenderness and depth of feeling were the kernel of his being be was the best of husbands the tenderest of sons

the poet lays bare the distre pancy in his nature between the two elements of halilenism and of judaism between the love of the physically beautiful and the spiritual selfabnegation of the soulof the poets personal surroundings an interest ing and not altogether pleasant picture is drawn homnes early life belonged to a period when the respectability of our latter days was not yet aspired to by most literary men he had never realized the meaning of the words  homme dordre be liked alfred de musset no more than ha did victor hugo or george sand whom he unceremoniously described as a bas rouge but he took the type of jenny the grisette created by the firstnamed poet ait serieux so much so that he chose his own wife from that class the fre quenters of his sick chamber although there were princesses among them had a tinge of semirespectability about them this at least is what our author infers but her picture is some what exaggerated the literary men of france had not quite forgotten their stricen confrgre alexandre dumas and tbeophile gautier with many other leading men wept round his open grave  berlioz sometimes went to see him alithough it is true that aftor one of his risits iheino eclaimed with bitter humour  berlioz originel comme toujours  the truth probably is that la mouche wasnotinclined to look favourably upon any one who rmight assume her place by heines bed side poor mathilde the poets wife does not escape censure more hinted at than expressed in so many words beines own room we are told was devoid of au beauty nothing suggested the pre sence of a woman  that presence however made itself felt in another apartment among the cheap and showy ornaments of which was conspicuous a portrait of the lady of the house dressed up in the fashion of her early days  when i first saw madame heine we are told in another place  i felt disappointed i had imagined her an elegant fine languid woman with a pale face lit up by large veiled perfidious eyes  i saw instead a plump brown person with a rubicund complexion and a jovial faceone of those people of whom one says they ought to take long walks and plenty of exercise on what oiur authors preconceived idea was founded it is not easy to see in his writings heine indicates exactly what his wife wasa prettygoodbumoured daughter of the people whom he married from a feeling of dutyrather than from any great passion but of whom in the course of years he became genuinely fond of that fact there cannot be the slightest doubt in his letters to her he shovvs himself a devoted husband a good deal henpecked a little jealous and always affectionate of mathilde his wife at once and child he speaks in one of his most touching poems  to the angels and her welfare after he should no longer be alive to protect her was his last thought our autbor represents him exclusively occupied with his mysterious memoires in which as he said his enemies should feel the tigers claws after the tigers death and which it must he feared have been destroyed excepting the few youthful remini scences at present in course of publication in the stuttgart uartedaube in reality he was much more anxious to secure an income for his wvidow from his publisher and his wealthy cousin neither can it ba denied that mathilde was not upon the whle unworthy of such affection heines ideal of woman was very exalted so exalted that he used to say  je nai jamais vraiment aine qua des statues ou des mortes that type he could scarcely expect to find realized in a wife hence his choice in a direction which precluded all comparison between the real and the ideal what he wanted and what goethe had wanted before him was a cheerful companion and a good housewife and that he found in madameieine although she might have attended a little more to her husbands personal comforts the truth is that friendship however platonic between a poet and a lady is seldom extended to the poets wilfe for an apotheosis of mathilde heine or of christiane vulpiusgoethe one must not go to camcille selden or frau von stein
