rgypthe followsng letters have been rsent to us for publicationgrand hotel london april  dear mr glhdstonein deference to your very powerful speech made on thursday the d of april when your opponents becamne most unexpectedly theaccused in lieui of the accusers i refrained purposely from taking part in the egyptian debate raised so inopportunely by the leader of her majestys opposition this being so i think it right to give you very briefly my impressionarising out of a recent visit to egypt being not my first but third visit to that country first i will take mr clifford lloyd that officer i found popular neither with the majority of the british nor with lgyptians with whom i aname in contact tae only reform standing to his credit is the prison at cairothis however not through the intervention of any nominee of his own but that of dr cxuickshank through wbose practical kuovledge of prison in the keast the arrangements bave been materially altered for the better but the old evil of prisoners nvaiting months fortrial still remains so much so is this he case that there areprisoners wvaiting for trial whose crimes in any case ought not to exceed a total of a weeks imprisonment thiir is equally the case in the provinces also what in my opinion you require is a couple of itinerant magistrates british and native armed with sumnmary jurisdiction the legislative chamber is as conducted by mr lloyd a farce for instance when its members discuss and vote upon questions requiring their attention if not decided in accordance with the opinions oef mr lloyd they are coolly told that their votes however unanimous are useless now sir i hold thisthat to succeed with orientals in vital and radical changes you must reason and work with rather than in direct antagonism to their opinionsin other words follonv the policy which has already proved so successful in consolidating our rale in british lndia wvith regard to necessary sanitary reforms from no fault or op position on the part of the uhamberwehave done scarcely acything damietta is as it was during the cholera epidemic of last year so also are alexandria andoairo lfor reforms in this description of work you do not want police magistrates you require a totally different class of administrators youmust have wellknown and experienced municipal sanitary medical men and engineersf inancethis is certainly a most difficult problem and must owing to its international entanglements cause you con siderable anxietyregarding the alexandria indemnities i do not knodv who advised the government but there can be no doubt of thisthe egyptians have been thoroughly robbed in place of the lnternational cousmission you should have liau nn mndependent lrihunal consis ing of three or four judges leaving the rest to international advocates it is notorious that men hired rooms and had placed in them broken furniture and charred merchandize who never bad a penny at stake in the country and yet they succeeded in getting awards it is equally notorious that many of the valuationi experts received lribes for false certificatescollection of assigned and unassigned debtsin my opinion all the costs and charges for this pur pose ought to be against the mortgagees or bondholders of the property and not against the egyptian exchequer were you to charge your tenants with the cost of collect iig your rents it would only be following the principle which has been adopted with regard to the collection of bondholding and other debts in egypt tlhese charges might in equity i think be deducted from the interest of the bondholders turkish tobacco monopolythis costs the egyptians about � per annum and ought at once to be repealed as it is only anadditional tribute levied indirectly for the benefit of the turk but for whirls the egyptians receive nothing whatever in the shape of a quidpro quoi turkish tributethis ought to be reduced or compounded inasmuch as the sultan has failed to render either military or other assistance vhich he had every opportunity of doing during the sittings of the european conference the domain creditorsthese ought to bear the loss arising out of the admini ltration of their ovn properties the farms are niostly in their own hands and are being worked at a loss of about � per year which loss is charged against the egyp tian reasury and of which in my opinion it ought to be relievedland taxreally this is land rent and not a tax as known at home the poorer class of farmers pay a high rental for their small holdings whereas the ruling class pay a much sn aller rental very much iesz than the land is worth hence while as mir villiersstuart states in his letter to the timoes intended to show how the egyptian exchequer may be benefited the pashas pay too little he forgets that the small farmers are fadng too mnuch again in pointing to savings likely to arise out of a reduction or total disbandment of the tgyptian army he forgetsvthat the army of occupation costs � per head per monthalmost as much as an egyptian soldier costs per year while on this subject allow me to say that it is perfect nonsense and an imposition to send out as we have done a host of english officers to egyptian commands wbo know nothing of the language and some scarcely anything of french see tlhe times of today in its cable re ort from suakin dated the th inst administration such as this is no doubt one cause of our being so much disliked by the students of cairo college numbering about  where on going through a few weeks ago english officers were hissed by the students soudanthe question is too intricate and lengthy to deal with in a brief letterand withoutpersonaliexplanationswith the map before me suffice it to say we shall in my opinion make a grievous mistake if we compel egypt to give up khartoum and thus part of the main as well as the com mand of the bue and yhite niles its inhabitants are peaceful and as civilized as those of egypt to abandon it will be to hand it over a prey to more warlike but less oivilized tribes i have the hononr to be vour obedient servant onw t godonny the right glon w e gladstone mp downinggtreet psat the moment we are trustees in egypt
