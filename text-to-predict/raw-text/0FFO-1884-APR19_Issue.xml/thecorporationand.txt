instructions to do tbrein as should be deemed expedient reporting from tim e to time do certify that suce our report adopted by this cmrt on the th day of june  the circumstances with which we have had to contend as regards toe courletaken by ier majestys government on the question of municipal reform have up to a recent date very much circumscribed direct actionandleft us littlo alternttive but to watch vigilantly the ir direct progress of events as in the past session of parlia ment so in the present session the corporation has not leen favoured with any conmmunication whatever that would open tbe door for the swallest interebange of thought upon any voiat of municipal legislationt bat might evtn bo suggested in the interests of the metropolis coam munications have indeed been received by the lord mlaor tfrom the home siecretary but these bave been imited to a repetitiou on the iart of sir william harcourt of bis desire to be farnishzd with reports and fguris similar to those snpplied last year concerning the aetual work of the corperatun and returns aud doouments bave been sent in ateoriavce witb the order of your honourable court giving the desired informnation in anticipation of the zime when the government wvould ittroduce their bill your committee have been eugaged in obtaining and collating infornmation both in this country and abroad tearing upon the wholo subject of the munaicipal govemn went of large cities but until the scheme of the govern nieut was aotually ititrodnzed it was impossible to know hew far this iziforination wonld be of service your com mittee are nows prepared to show by treans of the com parative workings ot other gretcentres of population tbai the theory d one large municipality is botb costly aod ineltective and entirely destructive oï¿½ all principles oe loeni selfgovernment as hitherto understood and practised in this country your committee have from the frst re ognizd that in thia coutest the interests of the corpora ien would not be the ouly interests to snffer and tlhere fore they put themselves into communication with other overning bodies of the metropolis and they now believehac the course of action they recommend to four honour able court will be viewed with favour by anc receive the support nt those who have any real practical cxperience in local affairs it was only on the th day of apri instant on the eve of the i aster recess when the rome secre tary iutroduced in the house of commons  the london government bill  that the corporation and as far as we know the metropolitan board ct works and the other vitally interested public bodies learned simultaneously with the public at large the views of her majestys government on the question the present is therefore the earliest possible moment at which your committee could have the advan tag of seeking te counsel of the court and inviting dis cussion upon the great issues raised by our directions mlr remembrancer at once sent a copy of the bill to every member of your honourable court a bill which intcrferes with so many and such varied rights and inte rcsts bas been launched with all its complesities for deliberation in a time perchance limited to days never tbeless witb fundamental principles to guide us based upon history and built upon experiencewe have no hesita tion as regards primary actionthe scope of the bill will be readily understood by the perusal of b synopsis thereofpre pared by mr remembrancer in consultation with the odicers of this court and appended hereto shouh the time arrive whien it will be necessary to discuss detail there will be much to be said on palpable defects whicb attach to almost every clause of the bill the immediate necessity is howvever that all interested should with no uuccrtaiu sound declare their opinions upon the oardinal features of the bill to whioh we have purposely confned our present report after the most serious attention that the limitation of time has permitted so as not to dlelay our report we have with the utmost conlfdence come to the following primary conclnsions which in our judgmeut are apndemnatory of the bill as inimical to the best interests of the people of london it is in fact a bill of disturbances resulting in the destruction of every vestige of independent aotion on the part of the vast numbers of busy workers now loyally engaged in carrying out the details of local manage ment throughout the metropolis we beg therefore to submit the tollowing resolutions which have been agreed to by your committee for endorsement by your honourable court i i that in the deliberate opinion of this com mittee the london government bill is opposed to the in berestsuot only of the cibizens of londontut of the metro polttan ratepayers generally  that by its provisions the principle of local selfgovernment so far from being en couraged or supported is practically destroyed  that judging from past and present experience at home and ehroadtbe result of the proposed monster municipality tuust inevitablv be great increase in public rates and ex penditureanad decrease in personal care and supervision on the part of those who have hitherto as local authoritiesoc cupied themselves in the local government of the metropolis  that the bill while professing its extension and en largement praetically extinguishes the ancient corpora tion of the city of london with its charters liberties and traditions  that for tho foregoing among other reasons the bill should be strenuously opposed and this com spittee authorized to act accordingly with all possible igour and deal atch we are of opinion that a petition bhould he forthwith presented against the bill and pro secuted in such manner as we may be advisedthe report was signed by sir francis truscott the chair rman the lord nsayor sp mr alderman staples r ald rman isaacs depinties bontems fry shephard and seunders mir loveridge mfr tricker mr hart ir ashby mr george shaw lr bedford mr hicks and mtr jobnsonaldertmanc sir f truscott in moving the adop tion of the report observed that he held in his hand the government of london bill introduced by one of her majestys principal secretaries of state to that bill there was no such thing as a preamble and as the committee had thought proper to make a synopsis of its contents he alno had thought right to give it a preamble which was that it was a bill of pains and penalties a bill of confscation and a bill utterly to destroy local elfgovern ment and entirely to promote centralization he was present when the bill was introduced and he felt that every one else who hal bad the privilege of being present must have been struck by the apathetic manner in which it was received by the house which did not comprise a greater number of individuals than those he saw before bim on that ccuasioa and that apatby be tbought arose from the fact tiat the general feeling among the outside districts was that they cared nothing about the bill the liouse seemed in accord with the generat body of electors who cared nothing at all about the matter he went on to refer in detaii to the llome secretarys speech as reported in the tires newspaper sir w barcourt in com mencing it made use of a quotation whicb he thought con tnned a very unfortunate allusion to wbat had occurred before the right hun gentletnau said that coming events cas their sbadows before but he himself ventured to anticipate what the result would le aeterwards to the vesse which the home secretary bad launchtd with referenc to the general reform of corporations wh cb took pao throughout the united kingdom the right hon gentleman gave as a reason why the corporation of london was not included therein that whereas the other corporsto s were d cay d or decayirg the corporation of lonidon was a ri al corporation bossessing real m nici pal life and disoharging a useful daty to the inha itants ir tcl y went furtuer they found that a supplrmentary commission was issued which reltort d in s ard from the r port of that oommission the honie secretary mrdc two uotations entirely opposed to separate mmuicipalitie the cormmission ieing in tavour of the right hon gentle mans vyewnamely that thre should bi one munci pality for the wilje metropolis but the liome secretary ought also to have quoted from the report of the royal commisson of sf  in which tbe commissioners ex yrrssedl an opinion that if an atcimpt were made to give atinlcipal rganization to th ro metrolp iis hy a wider ext nsion of the present b urnartes cf the city tte utilty of the present c rprati n isan irstituticn suited to its present area v ould be desroycd while at the some time a municipal alministrationl of an xcessive magnitude and therfor illadapted to the wants of the other parts of the mntropolis womld be created but at the same time they sa no reason why the benedts of municipal institutions should not be txtnded to tce other districts of the metro polis by as being divided into municipal istricts facb possessing a municirai government of its own cu the part o t to corporation he insisted itpon the recorrmenda tio of that commission being recorded why did not lord palmerston anl the government of tbat day iring forwart the queton of separate municipalities  was it because the government was not strong enough or because the putlie did not wish any intereerence in the matter  tbeebovernment howevor exercised a wise disretion incarryimn out to a great extent thc recommenations of that cvmmission and creating the metropolitan bosrd of works he ventured to think that the creation of that body had been sucessful and tbat at last we bad a government for london well suited to its requirements for vvhat the board of iv orks wanted was an increase in its powers the districts too desired that money raised in their own boundaries sbould be expanded for their own purposes and by their own voices referriug again to ths reinarks of the home sceretry on the siulbeet of the non desirauility of separate ncunicipalities he challenged sir w hiarcourt to produc any correspondence sbowing a recusal on the part of any district of the metropolis to be made into a cmrporation the home secretary in support of his argument had referred to the london and north western railway that companywas conductea with con sumiratc ability by one gentltman who was a kind of autocrat he believed that the intention was tbat if the bill rassed the metropts would eventuauy be governed by paid administrators smd they would not be true to themselves if they allotd such a state of thinosto bappen therefore as far as the illustration of the london and northwestern railway was concerned they did not see its applicability the bome secretary said that the ex tinction of the cotporaton woluld be a great sbosk to the country antd to thbe house but he himself believed that if the mneasure was passed the old corporation of liondon with all its ancient traditions and associations would be extinguished the new body would have within its boundaries upwards of four million inhabitants and more than  electors it would be a ninth part of the united kingdom and wouid comprise within its klsdax a distrct evool x o pt igjv t boroughs ancities could any one in the name of common sense say how such a community was to be governed by one munici polity the very essence of our freedom was local self government in the lew body would there be the same ability the same wealth and the same system of organiza tion as there was at the present time  he thougnr not the members would have to give more time to the admsinis tration of affairs than wtas at their command le densed that it was intended to preserve the corporation and its traditions and thought that a cleau sweep of everything would be made inoluding themselves andtheir moneythe rome secretary had expressed an intention of dolor away with common hall but was not that oneof the ancient institutions of the city which hehad said hedid not intend to touch common hall was bound up in the ex istence of the city he expressed surprise at the state ment that the livery companies had nothing to do with municipal life and referrol in contradiction of that asser tion to the manner in which the lord mayor was annually elected under the proposed new municipality however any burgess could occupy the lord isayors position even a woman laughter in the present state of things before any person could be lord mayor he bad first to be elected an a derman and sancticned by his brother magis trates and he had then to go before  or co citizens assembled in comrnon halla body which was said to have no municipal life the bill he maintained was one uge measure of confscation from beginning to enda conflea tion of of their rights and privilegeb and of everything they held dear in municipal life the court of alaermen had always been an important part of the corporation ancl be could find no one who wlvshed the office of aldlerman bolished wvere they preparedi to have stipendiary miagistrates and to make pilaces for supporters of the ministry cries of  no stipendiary magistrates he thought would be a great mistake in a vast commercial city like london wvhere great commercial knowledge and ccwn sense were essential lo a magitrate in decidinlg tllf s of cases which came before him he had a strong iduea t the bill was not the work sf sir w harcourt bat rather that it was the work of a triumvirate consisting of mr firth mp mr beal and a memler of that court and also of the municipal lieform league sir jobn bennett who inone of his speeches said io away with the aldermen and let me write their epitaph be thought it was right that the public shoud know from whom the bill  mat ated the measure was an emaiation from the miunicipal reform league ai d bad been adopted by the liome st cretary havig toucted upon the qiues tion of expenditure he said that none of the proposed changes had been caused by an ii isdoing oni the part of the corporation which was adiitted to have performed its duties satisfactorily lie knew the lord mayor would not be  gulled  by the bill but that he would as he had said ght it line by linm and clause by clause the cor poration expected him to do so and would gallantly sup port him no consideration would prevent them giving a most determined opposition to the bill andthey would not only oppose it but he believed oppose it suceesfulty t was interlstidg to read what sir wijliam llarcourt said upon the subtct else where in his speech at leeds on thursday he said  one of the bedtting sins and the greatest danger of democraoy is the attack which it is dis posed to make upon local acligovernment and the attmpt to centralize power in a form which may be most in jurious raving compared the municipal ilstitutions ofngland and france he would repeat bis belief that the bill was for tymg them body and soul to centralization which they so much abhorred he believed that the tiue mad not yet arrived when the epitaph either of the court ot aldermen or the corporation should he written after some further observations sir jrancis truscott moved the adoptiona of the reportr j t bedford said the corporation would do well to oppoae ths iniquitous bill as strongly as they could and by every legal means in their power there was not a single institution in the metropolis that it did not grossly insult the lord mayor instead of being elected by some w citizens was in the future to be elected by the common council the aldermen after giving their ser vices to the country for so many years were to be abolished and the common cousicil which had existed for  years were to be told that they were ro longer re quirod sir william barcourt said they had done their duty had made london the healthiest and most renowned city in the world and every one wavs satisfied with what they had done but he should not require their services any longereeept of a small number of tbem the board of works would be held on for three years just to coacb tbe poor ignorant men who came to take tleir places and tbel they too would be bowed out the outside districts had nothing to complain of and tbey were to be deprivd of all loual government wbile the wdole government of the vast metropolis was to be intrusted to a new body of  men elected by  citizens the thing was absurd in the very conception of it thet would find tle wbole work of the corporation the whole work of the board of works the gas companies and water coaipanies and the surervi sion of the whole of the local government of the metropolisintrusted to the care of those  men bovl would they i do it  they were expected to perform that work daily throughout the year and gratuitously vhat would be the result  why the men who came there to do their duty to the best of tbeir ability would soon tire ad who would remain  jobbers lawyers architects surveyors and impecunious men of all classes of the coin munity who were looking out for comfortable berths it would be a nest of jobbory which could not possibly he revealed because thev ork ould be too much tor bonest met to perform who had other duties to attend to there would of course be plenty cf salaried officers and he should like to ask the town lerc how many town clerks would be required there would be a perfect shoal of paid officers as a reward to the blunicipal reform league the measure was confiscation from the hrs clause to the last the citizens of londorn had conducted their affairs to the ad miration of the wbole worldbut everything would bc taken froma themtheir money the libraries and schwos whinb they had expended so much uponall th property of the city of lonon was to be confacat d to the use of the whole metropois that was the great sop for getting the vote of tho outsiders and what a grand swindie it was in its very conception  the idea out of doors was that the city was so immensely rich that if they got hold of the money and property the rates of the matropolis wvotid be largely redaucd bt he would give them a littie informa tion on the subject suppose they took ross ision of the whole of the money and property of the corporation to morrow the rates of the metropolis would only be reduced to the extent of one penny in the pound lnstead of gainng any advantage from that penny it wturld cost the rete payers on shilling to get it if there was one thing more certain tban another it was that there would be en enor mois intrease in the rates ot the metropolis i hose  mnan would have uncontrolled power over  millions a year what a nice fund to dip into  they would hae  new libraries and everytbing else would have to be mul tiplied by  to make the other parts of the metropolis alike the corporation inherited a great name  they represented a grand constituencythe oity ot london the grandest city in the world and it was their urity to fight for their privileges by every awful means in their power he was sure that with tho lord wayor to lead them and wih the words  fight the bill line by line  ringin in their ears they would fght with successceersmr stonewah denied that the measure was one for the real reform of the corporation and described it as a bill of confiecation and one that completelywiped out local self governmentmr g roseitzzsr cbairman of the city comnnission of sewers said he thought the homo secretary in thespeech had traded uron tlle histolical ignorance of hs j audience he was addressing and his courtesy was very much in ths spirit of claud duval the highwayman who robbed without ruffianiern and with a smiie yle believd that whether tory bad cal or whig the moment business men really understod what the bill meant it would be strenucusfy starly and successfully opposedmr alderxlan isaac though that the corporation had that day expressed their opinion in no uncertain wvay and with greater unanimity than lie had ever known to prvail in the whole course of a long experience the bill tad beenitn preparaton for three years and had been thrice mentiom d in her flajsetys speech but it appeared to be the work of men utterly isexperienced in municipal life as migbt be judged even iu the moat appareintly uniuiportaiut arrangemebts in such a cautral council as was pro osod if such questions as that of the presr atioa of lppi g forest aroe who would stand up for the rights of the people already one goccnment hai bewn wreck d by such a bill and he dared say they would notebe forry if the present measure was the means of overthrowing another ilnistry cheersal r w s govxer said the inhabitants of london were invited by the bill to give up the substance of local self govertnment for is shadow in opposing such a result every inharitant of the metropolis ard no the ccrporation of leonon only wvas deeply interestedmr clarke said the bill vas mr firths bill so emphatically condemned in s and now the homne secretary hal oressed it in new garments to render it aceptable to the publicni r judd said the bill proposed that the highest posi tion whb could be attained in the municipalitythat of lord amayorshould not be the rewayd for past labour in municipal muntters but that anone with a great name for private or politial reasoos though he badl no ex perience oe municipal work might he elected to the offceit was on the whole an attempt at centralication which should he resisted the bill had been framed without any practical knowledge of tbe subjects dealt with and in destroying the prnciple of local selfgovernment a retro grade step of a very unfortunate description would betakenmr morrasczo said they shoild let it be understod by all the vestries of london that if they of themselves took practical steps to oppose tho bill they wonld be backed by the support and power of the corporarion he was putting it at a very low lguie when he stated that the bill would increase the rates of merchants in the city by bo per cent and in the outside districts the ratepayers would have a double burden to sustainmr halsr poiuted oat that while by the th section of the bill the whole of the property of the city of london proper was to bh transferred to the now corpora tion by the d section it provided that wheretany local property of a parish yielded annual income thatannual icome should be the local property of such parish ln other woods the city was to be despoiled of all that it had while the meanest parish in london was to retain its own propertydmr l h phillps made a warm protest against the bill which he said had eceated more conservatives in the metropolis in a week than it would have taken otherwise  years to accumulateszr john benfctr argutd that it would have been to the interest and advantgge of the corporation of london if years ago like the rest of the corporations in tho king doma it hat been reformed and made to expand wvith ex panding london hle ionted out too that when oe a pre vious occasion the corporation was threatened with a measure sirmilar to the present its commttee assented to many proposals now sanctioned in sir william harcourts schemc inccuding the aboition of the a dermanic veto it was not a poitical question for a man like lord salisbury was as much interested in the good government of london  sheo pf rarant rtdiol he belised jaa vaelect its best men to the central council the bill would he believed be carried this year and he thought the cor poration had been treated very liberally and very well it was distasteful to the aldermenbecause they were treated in a very offhard way but the retention of the alder manic dignity would nave spoiled the bill as it would have scared away the best men from municipal work the present aldermen migilt if the court appointed them continue in the new corporation but only for three years when they would have to be reelected by an enlarged con stituency and not for example by the  men who had sent mr aldermaivaterlowv into the corporation as a life member of the aldernaanic bdv there were two ways of meetidg the measure one by ounoiliatimn and the other by defance and for their own sakes he advised the corpora tion to chot sa the formermr georgn shaw said the cbjeot of mr firth and his friends was to destroy and stifle the real active and intel ligent interest taken in local affairs throughout the matro polis that was the beginnidg and the end of the bill the common oouncil were only the trustees of the charters liberties und traditions of the citizens of london and no other course was open to them biat to defend their rights to the very last by opposing the bill to the utter mostir jex and mr ticxle continued the discussionin the end the motion for the adoption of the report was agreed to amid cheers with but one dissentient sir john bennett and it wms resolved to print and circulate it amnng the vestries local boards and others interested in the mattermr innes suggested that the aldermen of each wsad should summon their electors in wardmote to consider the provisions of the billthe lord
