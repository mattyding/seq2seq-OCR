great audience you have been just re miinded by our chairman that last night there wvas a great meeting held in this town of a different characterone tbat did honour to leeds and did honour to england lcees proud of its great popularity proud of its great position among the municipalities nqt only of england but of the world desired to inaugurate its beautiful municiral offlis ard buildings by a great banquet attended by great and distinguishedt statesmen and eminent men and they wt re fortunate to find at the head of their civic affairs a publiespirited citizen of great and deserved popularity in this city who worthily and fittingly represented leeds on this gnat and auspicious occasion tonight we have a freat meetingone of a different character but one whicham sure wfl be characterized by the same harmonious feeling one that will be animated by the same desire to hear what is true  and one which will when we break up carry away i hope not unkindly recollections of what has yassed within these walls cheers there is no good in usinlg at this time sham phrases that deceivo nobody this is a party meeting addressed by a party man cheers uponi great public questions of the day i am glad and proud in this great town of leeds to address so greab an assembly as this i am glad to think that in this great audienco i aml addressing men the majority of whom agree with myself in public affairs cheers and if in this great audience there are many who differ from me i bid them welcome hear hear i am always pleased to address those who agree with me in my political opinions and i am never afraidnay i am always gladto address equally those who differ from me hear hear but who come honestly to hear the reasons which i have to give cheers the platform bas become avgreat instrument a great engine of english political life t e public men are constantly making on countless plat form appeals to the nation we have not got the means of saying when a dissolution will occur or when a general appeal to the conscience of england will be made the sooner the better cheers but until that time comes on dlatform after platform in centre of opinion after centre of opinion it is our duty and our privilege fear lessly faco to face addressing our fellowcitizens to ask their opinion upon the great questions of the day and to contrast calmly and soberly as englishmen should the actions of the government and the actions of those who arraign the government cheers i am glad to know that during what is caued i dont know why the easter holidays laughter the public men of our party have cer tany not been spending a period ot inglorious ease totee this you have only to read your papers every morning and you cannot do a better thing hear hear because you have very able newspapers published at a ridiculously small price and youave had the privilege of reading for the last weekremarkably good speeches i do not say they are all good that is too much laughter but you will be able to read at all events in mianchester and birmingham cheers many speeches that will show what there is to be said against the present government and what there is to be said for those who say the resent government should ziake way for somebody else now the first observation venture to make to you is this you have read a great deal lately about the house of commons a good deal in ensure of it a great deal of harsh criticism  but hear this from me the house of commons is not and should not be a mere legislative maehine cheers if the houise of commons was merely a kind of mill for grindine out as quickly as possible a certain number of acts of parliament t would be a very dull a very stupid and a not very useful engine for public enlghtenment ear hear of course acts of parliament are necessarya melancholy necessityof our existence laughter do not for a moment understand that i am speaking disparagingly of legislation or aots of larliament i of course respect them but the house of commons has other duties just as high and worthy in some respects higher and more worthy than legislation and that is the necessity of dis hargmng their great function of being your representative of being the grand inquest of the nation hear hear lt is the duty of the house of commons who have the government before them who have the cabinet sitting before them on the reasury bench  it is the duty of parliament of the house of lords and of the house of commons to fearlessly discharge their duty as the gand inquest of the nation and to place in distinct review beforc the ministers before parliament before you before the public opinion of the country everything that they think is essential ill reference to home and to foreign affairs hear hear of course ministers who are entitled to be spoken of with sympathy do not take quite this viewv they think that parliament should go on iu a kind of dull stupid humdrum wvay that no questions sbould be asked auehter that no answers should be expected that there should be no arraignments of home affairs no criticism of foreign affairs no debate on the adiress nothing but a few acts of parliament which nobody wvould reau and nobody would care anvthing very particularly about laughter and cheers now i said i bad sympathy with dlinisters but i can carry sympathy too far laughter hliere is a time for everything  there is a time for sympathy i am giving my sympathy to illinisters now laughter but duty steps in where sympathy ceases and duty will record its demands upon my mind when i valk into the house of commons within the next few days oheers one of the greast qestions of the day that is not legislation but is the duty of parlia ment is the question of egypta vast question a difficult question a complicated question one to be approached with a knowledge of its gravity its diffieulty nd its complexity but what do we put ministers in power or unless they are able to grapple with difficulties iind overcome them  cheers wby if diinisters can escape from responsibility by saying that things were diffeult and things wvere problems i could get any six or  men in the street and run them into a cabinet and they woald be entitled to make that triumphant excuse if you put men at the head of your government if you pnat men at the head of your home and foreign affairsyou do so because you expect that they will be able capable resourceful statesmen  men who will be able to overcome didiculties who wrll be able to grasp problems and thereforc i do not accept as any apologyor explanation of this egyptian ques tion thatit isonefullofdifflecultiesandofproblems cheers of course it is it is the duty of statesmnen it is the duty and function of able and capable men to overcome difficul ties and to see their way through problems hear hear the prime iminister of whom i desire to speak with that respect which his long public life and great attainments require at the hands of any public man re cently saidi do not know how far his arithmetic was accurate but i assume itthat  days or parts of days had been taken up inparliament in discussing thisegyptian question but that was a wide statement he reckons no doubt among the  days any day on which an hour or two were taken up and includes the numerous occasions when gentlemen on his own side showed an intelligent ouriosity on the subject but say that there were  days taken op lvho is answerable for the  days whether it was ten or  or  days i do not papaus nowv to iuquire i am on bigger and broader issues the question is who is answerable for the delay who is answerable for this great expenditure of public time i put this question to any one acquainted with the great topic involved was it not because the govern ment did not come forward with a frank clear intelligible statement of their policy at the outset  cheers if the government bad told us in plain englishin the english that yorkshiremen so like to hearhbat their policy was what their plans were what they meant and how they meant to achieve them i should like to know whether those  days would not have dwindled into one or two it is nob possible for an opnositioni care not how flagrantly neglectful of their publio duties no matter how bent on obstructionto occupy the attention of parlia ment to command the attention of the press of england and of europe unless they have on their side some great sentiment of truth some strong feeling that the govern ment have not acted in a way to command sympathy and confidence the government did not tell us inplain and in telligible english what their plans were ve do not know tbeni now they did not tell us at any time in these  days w hat their policy is a voice they have not one trhey fought battles and the blood of thousands of brave men was spent like water on the arid plains of the soudan but when the appalling bloodshed had occurred the government cast about for reasons to justify what they had done and ou will fnnd that all through this wretched egyptian business vhich is not yet clsed the govern nernt actionto use the strongest word i can for policy is alsurdvms a cowardly manufacturing of pretexts they said they went to egypt in otedience to the mandate of europe that mandate is not recorded in aciy document or resolution of the powers of urope lsowhere is it to be found they merely wentthere to p reserve the in terets of england hiear hear yes but they never said s crheers i will teli you why they never toldanlsulinecauso it would have ueen plain intelligible rebiu lor the b eerbligaantntxvogyciean i simple reason they pretended they went in theinterests of europe of civilization of gods knows what lcheerseverythinsr except thle simple clear intelligible interest of england and now when all these appl evgants have bten occurring in the soudan whe  thleairetched occurrences that we have read of recently in the pafp crs have taken place when our soldiers have behaved gallanitly ani many of them have been wounded and many of them have mret their deaths when the gallant foes to whom thy weidc opposed ana who were nrongly called rebels or they were rebelling against nobodyh ien these moen by the thousand with gallantry ancd with chivalry met their deaths when now an excuse is looked o mr gladstone in his last speeh  which sir william baeon tulat lyp described as the speech of a sick lion oh i and laughter justified what wvas being done anda said that it was in obedience to and in deference to covenants entered into by ihis predecesors  oh iam wveifing to tehievo a great deal and i have as much crodulitimost men and i hope i have as mech courtesy but there is a point where credulity will cease to act and where courtesy utgv lc otuh hear hear ihazve listened to every speech mlr gladstone has made on this egyptian q cation in the house of commons and i note thlis thtn the eatrlier stages and until the very last occasion h always maintained not that ha was responsibleof couarse ha is responsible for nothing laughternot thathis abiet wre rsposiblnoone ever said they were laughterbtt thst in gome kind of queer curious unertain waty his predecessors were answerable under the thing called td dual control i ventare to sayhaving al great repect for lr gladstone that excuse didnot deceive even hhnself lsughter rt certainly tool in nobody else and accordingly the bottom having beez knocked out of the excuse or the dual control a new pre text has been invented to cover the responsibility ol idinisters for theg slaughter in the soudan  shaune it was put timidly and hrst by a secretary of mlr glad stone in reply to somebody or other who wrote one of thesf numercus letters everybody receives on all kinds of ques tions and the excuse which the secretary of mr gladstone wrote at his instance wasthe letter was one that asked how it was that the government of r gladstonea government of peace a government that abhorred blood gulltinesshow was it they were answerable for all thit rightful bloodshed in the soudan the answver written by the intelligent and honourable secretary was  the unfortunate covenant which was entered into by tle wicked pradecessors of mr gladstono bear hear that was at once brought to book in the house of commons by lord george hamilton and lord randolph churchill cheers both at once saw this letter both asked questions in reference to it and llr gladstone came down and an nounced that there were covenants somewhere in the foreign office upon this question that he would be willing to produce them inless the late government and the french government had some objection of course thu late government had not the fuiutest objection for the obvious reason that if they searched through all the foreign noces of all the departments i venture to saythey will not be able to produce one line that would ustify them in saying that there was any covenant or statement or engagerment which compelled mr gladstolnes govern ment to do what they have done in the soudan cheers the whole matter is too ludicrous for argument take the battle of el leb what covenant could bave compelled any battle to be fought  the excuse put forward at the time was that it was to relieve the garrison of tokar that was the position of affairstbat was the pretext the real reason for the battle of el leb was to try to recover the prestige of england thatb had been grievously imperilled hcar hear the last battle that was fought by the galant troopsof sir g grabam was the battle of lamanieb where such gallantry was displayed by our troops and by those to whom they wvere opposed is it not ludicrous to suggest thai any covenant ot any predecessors of mr glad btone could have justibed that inexplicable battle i say inerplicable because it has never yet been explained why it was fought in pursutance of what policy to effect what purpose was that battle fought  i could understand the slaughtering of  soudanese there for some great pur poseif it was to accomplish some great policyalthough it would be a sad and terrible necessity that would i justify it i could understand it if it was to open up theroad from suakin to berber for the relief of gordon but when our troops only marched to tamaniebw here they fought with great peril and with great gallantry wbere they slaughtered the slousands of gallant soudaneseand then matched back again  fail to see what is the policy what is the scheme what is the intention of the presnt government l have mentioned the name of gordon  let me ay a word about himheers  em glad you cheer the name of gordon it is a niame that is an honour to englaud an honour to civilization and an honour to christianity cheers a man of splendid courage a nan of single minded purpose a man whe has ever held himself ready to obey the call of duty whether it was to go to tlhe congo to pat down slavery at the instance of the sking of the bel gians or whether it was to go to china or south africa he has never hesitated to do that which he believed honestly his dutycaaled himn to do and now having ruled millions and having had millions of money passing throughhis hands gordon remains at the present miute a brave unselesh chivalrous heroike gure icheers gordon is a fellowcountryman of ours be is an english officer be is the representative of the majesty of ingland lie bears the english tlag he bears your credit the credit of the queen and the man went there because he was summoned by the prime alinister of england by the government of england and be obeyed his orders as an officer of the crown of england to go to the soudana service of deadly peril he is no volunteer in this business eie is a great and willing and courageous public servant i am speaking words that you will hear over and over again in parliament and over and over again in the country he was no idle volunteer he was going in consequence of a private engagement with thle king of the belgians to theongo for the purposc of examining into sad putting down i slavery when he was summoned by our government with l desperate taste to go to kbartoum and if be could to make i terms there for the rescue of the garrisonsand our govern ment our prime minister of england our country sent gordon there as their representative do not believeit cannot be suggesteddo not believe it if it isthat he is there as a vomunteeer for his owvn purposes and that we are not responsihle for his welfare and for his safety cheers the government would have claimed all the credit of gordons success every bit of it they cannot have a claim to the credit of the success he wvould have won and disclaim all the responsibility that would follow for his want of success if the ministers of this empire are found descedilug to such a mean depth as to try to suggest that the responsibility rests upon the isolated sholilders of that great hero at khartoum they lhve sotnded a depth of infamy hitherto unlnown in hngland sir william harcourt safely said in the very few words in which he referred to this subject that gorion vent forth like david to this contest for whicli he offered himself do not be misled by the old testament references that the home secretary has made yes gordon has gone forward with the chivalry with the courage and with the devotion of a david but he has gone forward because ho was sent by the government of lengland loud cheers and the government that has sent gordon out cannot get rid of responsibility for gordlons safety by a mere illastration taken from some chapter of the old testamentalout david i oheers gordon is now in a desperate position i hope he is still alivestill in safety cheers yes but if ho is he need not thank the government for it cheers the desperation of his position is shown by the recent telegram we have had about his offering the governorship of khar toum and the soudan to zebelir you know zebehr is a real slave dealer a man so tainted with the traditions and usages of slavery that the moment his name was nun tioned a montb or six weeks ago the government in deference to public opinion receded from what its owvn party had said on the sub cot in the house of ommolns of coursegeneralgordon knew public opinion on this ques tion a pureminded honourablo man wlhio himself ioathed d slavery he knew the feeling of this great counitry tnct hasundergone such saciaces to abolish slaveryhe knew the l answers that have been given in the botnse of commonsos by responsible mlinisters to the queen that they could not sanotion the employment of zcbehr and when now within the last week we learn that gordon isolated friendless has offered to employ zebehr in the wvay i have said must not the offer have been wrung from him by tho fact that his position has now arrived at a point that is well nigh desperate hear hear are we not connirmed in the painful impression by reading that zebehr a man of ambition a man connected with the soudan a man con nected with khartoum who mvould i suppose a month or two ago have greatly sought for the position offered to him has at once and without hesitatiorn refused it  i fear that gordons position is one of extreme and deadly peril sir william harcourt the other night at derby said very little on this subject his sentence with reference to this was a curious one it was certainly not vatisfactory the sentence was tbis of course the government wvill irake any effort in their power to save him laughter wvell now this is a very painful subject it is one involving the honour not only of the government but the honour of england bear hear i do net like that sentence sir willlanm larcourt is the only cabinet minister vho has spoken in this recess tbab is not the sentence of a man who felt he had a cabinet behind him who meaut to cave gordon hear hear wvho meant to make sacrifices to save gordon whea a sentenoe begins with an  of course to my mind it means very often very little laughter the home secretary also said that the wvay questions were asked in parliament at every stageand atep of this egypian muddle perplexed and embarassed the government and he said how could a plan be carried out if questions were asked about it every day  i meet that at once by saying that if the government will when parliament mcet an nounce that they have a plan in their minds for the safety of gordon and that they are advised by responsible men that it will be effective i am the last man in this ountry to suggest that another question should to asked cheers but they have never yet said that they bave a plan for the safety of gordon they have never yet suggested that they mean to save gordon that they mean to go to any sacrifice for the purpnse of saving him i pass over this subject a very painful one with asking a question that the country have a right to put and one that the country have a right to have answered what do the government mean to do to save gordon in kbartoum  eave they any plan to save him  cries of  no these are questions i do not answer it is for the government to answer the country has a right to ask them and the country has a right to hold the government to a stern and rigoroos account if it is not prepared wvith a satis factory answer  bear hear and cheers remember that when gordon went at first a certain remarkable measured success attended him he vent there this isolated hero martyrlike all alone to ikhartoum and dazzled by the splendour of his permonal character the grandeur of his devotion and his courage unquestionably the people amnong whom he wvent wvere spellbound and those wvho followed the ialidi stood perplexed and did not advance for a considerable time tchat measure of success was accomplished by one man unsustained by man un sustained by anyjtliing but his own splendid senseof courage and of dety earhear wvell there are it seems to me two alternatives in reference to gordononeis to save him or try to save him at all events cheers the other is tolthiiliorethrnfilllethimbecome whatevermay be tse fate ou one wno alils a prisoner into the hands of those terrible followers ot the labdi and if that occurs what will be the result will there not be a cry of indignation au over the civilized world will there not be a cry of horror all over europe  hear hear will there not be a cry of inditnation from one end o great britain to the other at such a dastardly act being com mitted  and then what wvill occur  we shall have these hideous massatcres of the soudami reenacted we shall have more expeditions like grahams on a larger scale with bigger battles and greater slaughter really to try to reestablishthecreditand prestige of englan but of course tinder some pretended excuse to rescue some imnaginary garrssns or to perform sune unseen and un known duty chiers i have spoken rather longer than iintendeduponthis subject hut one word upon egypt propr i have very little to say upon it  i wish what i had to say was pleasant for the sae of the country our conduct there has been a sham and an imposture really there is no other word that can be applied in reference to it you readl lately of the differencebetween nubar pasba the prime minister and tir clifford lloyd who is under secretaryof state for the bcme departmcnt in egypt well of course clifford lloyd is the man of real power the prime mlinister of egypt is an ornumental man and a pretended power nubar pasla is a very clever armenian but we all knew what he was meant not to do when he was put into his present position and that he was to be a sham and accordiugly leubac pashas dignity felt a little hurt on fiding that his power was pretended and that the real power was in isir clifford lloyd the diflcutybowever has been smoothed over the imposturothy hae managed to get on its legs again but is it on a sound basis  i do not kcnow  well the result of all our doings in egypt is thiswe have destroyed the egyptian governmcnstbo egitianadsiniatrationandth escyptianarmywe did it at telelrebir and we have continued it ever since andwo have put into their place ashamgovern ment a sham administrationand a sham army cheers we have got a puppet khedive with a sham prime diinister and phantom government and olur government have struggledshall i say manfully struggled to try and put out of view their own responsibility well radicals are nothing if not sincere anti genuine there is no one vho respects siucerity more than i do but i can only again as these are vacation times tender the bomage gec my respectful sympathy to every earnest radical at the enormoas blovis whilch musit havo been struck at their love of sincerity in the shams of egypt ah of the  days we have been debating egyptian afairs has done some little good each of them has produced a smal dole ofinformation a little feeble palsied hesitating step forward has been taken by tho government towards form ing a policy for themselves and showing a very limited amount oi confidence in the nation witli reference to that policy the government are men who profess noble and lofty principles sometiona they have professedn i ref e rence to egypt sentiments so noble and so unselfish tbat they were not t a dfor carth laughter and then when ontle oe these  days ame on their teet touched the mother earth and we heard some small statement biat re conciled ns tho the recognition of human existence and human responsibilty lt is very dificglt to say what wgad that governmenttpolicy iam disposed torthink thatif it could he put into a motto it might he said to he covered by the words eant and recant langhte but after all gentlemen the logic of facts is a splendid logicthe logic of facts will overcome the judgment of many men and of most women and accordingly the logic of facts is inevitabl convincing the government that the era of sham is doomed awte are responsitwleevents have made us rsponsibleeor egypt te are responsible to egypt itself to lngland and to europe and we cannot escape from that respontsi bility no matter how our government act or speakc cheers an eminent and capable dlinister hoaled the louse of commous duringhlr u tadhtonevuneortunatenndis position used words almost equivalent to this in the house oe commonsh  l fully and frankly admitted the responsi bility of the government sir w ha court said at derby last night that it was the duty ofelngland to settle egypt and then to leave egypt to govern itself whell let tnat be so sir iv harcourt is an able man and i respect his ability lye have heard this statement from other sources too but they have not done it cheers they have taken egypt from the egyptians but they have net taken it for england like people who try to sit hetneen two steels they have fallen to the ground langhter the policy according to sir wialliam larcourt is to settle egyptthey have been a year and a half at it these splendid geaveninsel gemliuvs driken ministers it is more thon a year and a half since the tattle of telvelrebir vas fought our govfrlnir ent have been really masters of gypt evcr since and the contusion is orse thoan wen they wtent there soytat they have not settled egypt ad when they will leave the poor egyptians the privilege of governing themselves god ntly knuos v r glatstone has had his say upona this as upon every other subject g e is of coarse only anxious for an i jealous of his own great reputationl and desires to be thought consictent consistency gentlemen lb a very nice thing it is some times attainable it is sbmetimes very difficult to attainit is occasionally im oscible to attatin it a m an of genius with a resourceful tongue a man of eloquence with a genius for circulmlocution he can be consistent in every thing in the world even if he changes every lay and every hour in the day cheers i think mr gladstoneif i may presume to eay so vith great respectsomewhat hastily and with i think questionable

nothing so costly nothing so troublesome nothing so trying in p ublic lifetas a policy of change of vacillation aid of uncertainty knlhers if earlier in these transactions there had been a plain clear
