growth of settlements in creases the value of taxable property  per cent annually the county rates were   per cent iast yearwe made a brief tour southward through this region upon a neov narrowgauge railvay now constructing and found it a surface of pine forests with scattered settlements clustering about the myriad of lakes that everyvwhero appear these lakes are fed by springs and percolation through the soil and may have subterranean conneaon their waters being always fresh the ambitious young towns of this region are well aivertised and the visitor has their merits displayed to him the moment he euter florida the new railway on which we travelled had opened several of these for it is the ambition of every colony of new settlers to establish their own town among these well trumpeted settlements is  winter park  about  miles from lake monroe where a town plot of about four square miles has been laid out among some pretty lakes with the railway running through it the contre is a park with a grana boulovard stretching away towards lake osceola on the one hand and lake killarney on the other new structures were going up all around orange groves being set out and thore was a bustlino air df business the  parlk  was rather rough howv aver and some negroes were grubbingup the palmettoes that covered the ground like so many weeds so as to give it a chance to grow grass this place is a type of many in florida  and its widely advertised announcement says that this park is to be planted with tropical fruits and flowers that the boulevard will have rows of orange trees down the centre that the soil is not  sand but loam and very fertile and that while it has no newspaper at present it still has hopes the future being  big with promise the settler is further allured by the statement that  society at winter park is firstclass a social gatbering in the townhall brings togethor as refined and cultivated a company as can be found anywhere  and   educated and refined families  already live there if any one doubts the announcement goes on to classify tbem thus  three millionaires  capitalists three bankers one bishop six ministers five doctors two dentists three

this formidable social list it adds  in addition to the above are a dozen families of negroes i trust that this advertisement of the place will be pardoned for these quotations are the best methods of eliowing just how thoe  boom  these newlyborn florida townsthose young cities are different in one respect from those of the far west for the numerous drinking shops that lino the main streets of the latter are not seen hereand while  bars  occasionally exist the gaming tables that are openly licensed on the western frontier are unknown in this region the people in faot under a less rigorous temperature seem to lose the desire for stimulants or at least the open manfestation of it orlando the county seat of orange county is another young town of rapid growth that is spreading on all sides and has already gathered  population its people have the shrewd northern look of men who have come after now homes and are bent on making money this town has a newspaper the register the office was recently burnt and the people at once raised  to start the editor with a new outfit florida is evidently a paradise for the journaist who has a sufficient stock of adjectives on hand to properly describe the glories of the new country throughout all this region the fretuent lakes add to thebeauty of the scenery and give almost every settler a chance to front his house upon a pleasant water view with luxuriant oleanders bordering his lawn and orange groves around him these lakes have low bluff shoreswith generally level and stretching away from them back to the pine forests as yet unbroken it is no wonder tho settler gets enthusiastic about this region for as one of the native editors in the ls tis semitropical puts itno stormy winter enters heretis joyous spring through all the yearthe newly finished railway open to travel but a few weeks carries us to the table land of the central part of the peninsula elevated about ft above st johns river aregion of forest and swamp as yot almost unsettled although this line is expected soon to bring settlers in it passes kissimmee city on lake tohopekaliga and turns southwestward to still higher lands it was this route across the peninsula that de sotos chivalrous invasion followed then led by indian guides and now adopted by the railway surveyors more than three centuries afterwards it leads to still higher land past several forts that are abandoned relics of the indian wars and along the line a small remnant of the tallahassee tribe still live we rise to ft elevation above the gulf of mexico whence the unfinished line seeks an outlet upon the gulf coast at tasuga bay gangs of negroes are at work ballasting the now line and we pass several construction trains these negroes are thicklipped and shinyfaced fellows working and playing alternately and in most cases endeavour ing by their mothods to convince you that it is not good to do today that which may better be done tomorrow which is said to be the florida negros maxim we ran to the end of the finished line where at the most elevated parts of the peninsula the land was gently rolling with hills made by the salamander everywhere throwing up the white soil and tlie numerous lakos intersperses with cypress swvamps at the end of the line was the brandnew town of sanitarium where a colony of  families from rennessee have started a settlement fronting on lalce ariana named after an indian princess who is said to have befriended doe otoa men they have  acres almost all land for orange culture and already there are large orchards started they were busy cutting dowvn trees to build houses had their sawvmill running and their  store  in full operation the sign outsido announcing that indian corn was solli at  c per bushel oats at c and hay at s c

through a chain of lakes and swamps this lakes waters flow into it okeeciobee hlid no natural outlet and about three years ago hamilton disston conceived the project of draining te swwamp and overflowed lands of the peninsula embracing a region at least half the size of en naland and under a contract from thetaoe as to receie for his dra company one half the lands reclaimed by the process the work has been going on about two years an outlet being made fromokeechobee to the gulf by cutting a canal to the caloosahatchie river and other canals have been dredged to unite the internal waters the level of water in all these lakes has been decidedly reduced and already  acres are stated to be reclaimed the project is regarded by many as scarcely promising adequate returnbut it is earnestly pushedand the new lands are claimed to be excellent for rice jute andl sugar growing nearly �s has been already expended on these drainage operatioiis thus adlding another to tlhe various undertakings oni a largo scale by britislh and american cadital to bring florida lands into market and facilitate their settlementfrom lako tohopekaliga through tlhe tortuous water route to lake okeecliobee and thence by the caloosahatchio to the gulf is a winding channel of about  miles although in a direct line the distance is but  miles the dredges for opening the drainage canals were built on this lake the boilers and machinery being sent from the nurthern states the lake is about  miles long and covers an area of  square miles nvo erossed it to examine the drainage canals making the voyage in a flatbottomed stornwheel high pressure steamboat the lake is from f t to ft deep its waters a darl amber and having a de cidedly swampy and sulphurous odour as in fact all the waters of this immediate region have the shores are very low and the drainage aready ac complished having reduced the water level about five feet the broad sandy edge of land and uncovered cypress roots were plainly visible all around as a bright yellow rim en closing the water this lakes surface elevation above the gulf was ft when the drainage opera tions began in  so that this fall was available for the accomplislment of the work to the east ward and separated by a low strip of land three miles wide is little tohopekaliga lake upon which drainage will soon begin its elevation being ift higher than the main lake and its surface  square miles upon the shores of this lake the  florida agricultural company  of london have about  acres of land which they are opening for settlement and they contemplate establishing a town and steamboat line to kissim mee city tyirough the drainage canal we crossed the smooth waters to this partially opened canal where the dredge was at work about  yards inland cutting a ohannel ft wide and ft to sft deep having about  yards yet to accomplish the dredged soil a rich dark muck was depositedalongside the cutting which was made througl a low swampy prairie entirely without trees though some cypresses and pines grew in the background on either side a dam was con structed in the canal about a mile inland to raise the water level some four feet as the dredge was working upon an ascending grade eight men were emiployed on the machine and they expected that it would take four months altogether to com plete this canal we then visited the southern part of tohopekaliga where the finished canal is located that is raining its waters southward with quite a swift current jetties protected the entrance although there were evidences of the channel filling by silting and upon some of the uncovered land near by about  acres wero being ploughed preparatory to an experimental planting with sugar cane to test the capability of growing this crop on territory reolaimed by the drainage the cane is already successfully grown on the shores of the lakethis okeechobee drainage scheme is one of the largest and most ambitious land projects yet under taken in the states ihey expect to complete their operations which have now been going on nearly two years in four vears more and they have perceptibly lowvered much of the inland waters of the swamp district of south florida they have made a navigable channel from the gulf into lake okeechiobee a body of water covering  square miles and from this inland sea northward to this place a large steamboat now anchored off tha wharves has come up from the gulf ready to undertake such traffic as may be presented on this new and as yet almost unpeopled water route lf the are successful they will get onehalf of about  miions of acres of drained lands the state retain ing the other half the scheme is almost startling to contemplate and of course its projectors are  booming it with earnestness especially in sup porting the price of the reclaimed land quarter acre lots in kissimmee city that cost not long ago about s apiece are now held at � to � i was shown a acre island in the lake now enlarged to about  acres by lowering the wvater which was bought four years ago as government land for �  and was sold last year for � and is now hold at � although unihproved floiida lands are thus  boomed  like those of the northwest and are often held at prices equal to or higher than improved lands similarly located inthe older portions of the union even some of these overflowed lands that ought to be sold rather by the gallon than by the acre are hold at higher figures than good farms in the north such a condition of affairs is unnatural but it indicates the universal attention now drawn to florida on both sides of the amtlantio and the way in which capital is coming in hereto the southward of tohopekaliga the florida peninsula is very sparsely settled and not very well known it is a vast region of swamp and lake and watergrass covered prairie into which the forests gradually dissolve on the atlantic shore skirting for miles along the sea coast is the indian river a country of orange groves that is steadily attracting new settlers in tho interior is okeechobee a vast depression in the centre of a watergrass prairie which receives the drainage of all the surrounding swamps and juicy land and like the everglades to the southward is a niystery into which the white man is just penetrating the everglades or  grasswater which cover almost the whole southern peninsula are a broad expanse of grass and swamp generally treeless but with forests on higher ground scattered like islands and having hereland there through them a trail that the troops made during the seminole war here live the remnants ef that tribe and from this slightly explored region usually origi nate the tales of alligators and other florida animals exaggerations which are sent nortlhwvard to regale the fancy of newspaper readers there is scarcely any white population in that country dade county an enormous section stretching over  miles along the atlantic coast has barely  voters the peninsula ends with the long chain of coralbuilt islands stretching into the gulf known as the  florida keys with key west as its chief a populous and attractive town such is the southern florida peninsula whose tropical fruit belt seems destined to be the home of a large popu lation of new sattlers in the near future and wvhich is moving ahead at a pace distancing all other parts of the southern states of the american union
