complains of the absence of news from sir evelyn baring which fact is explained by the miscarriage of several telegrams sent by the latter it is obviously easier to find messengers to convey despatches from khartoum to a comparatively cafe place like berber than men who will go from barber to the besieged citythe judicial commission which has been de liberating in cairo on the reform of the procedure in the mixed tribunals has closed its sittings the result has been that every single proposition made by the english representative bas been re jected in this matter as in everything else our hesitating policy has produced enemies where otherwise we should have found allies we hesitate to employ other than moral influence with the result that our moral influence was never so practically powerless as it is now an eminent egyptian official said to me today  you assert that england has tvo alter nativesabsolute withdrawal or annexation kindly explain the first alternative  by  absolute withdrawal  do you mean the with drawal of the troops also  if so you claim the right to adopt as a policy not  rescue and retire but  abolish and abandon youclaim the right to abolish all power and to abandon us to our fateif you wish the troops to remain as supporters of such a government as the khedive may establish then you must be prepared for every eventuality assume the zmprobable event of the ehedive ordering the execution of all armenians the armenians there upon revolt you have undertaken to preserve order without any interferenco with the govern meut you must therefore suppress the revolt and insist on the armenians submitting quietly to decapitation so one of your alternatives disap pears from the moment when you support the oovernment you must control it

weakened the authority of france in international questions but at home its effect has been to lessen the chances of mdinisterial instability had ho been living it may be doubted whether m ferry would have tided over the anniversary of his accession to office be would almost inevitably either have offended gambetta by want of docility or have offended the chamber by such docility and by conse quent arrogance towards the chambor in either case his fall would have been imminent he could not have adopted that pliancy and that readiness to put up with minor rebuffs to which he owes bis retention of office he may sometimes lead the chamber but he oftener follows it and he never attempts to drive itwhich last course was the dly one compatible with gambettas temperamentwhile however gambettas disappearanco has remnoved a disturbing element from the french political system it has not extricated it from embarrassments which be created revision is one of his legacies and a few weeks hence france will have to pass through tbis unnecessary ordeal tse transportation bill is another it dates back to the be leville election meeting of august  when gambetta howled down by the mob broke his walkingstick in beating the table for silence and threatened the disturbsrs to  track them to their lairs he choee to assume that the mob consisted of criminals i ever was thera a more gratuitous assumption no doubt the criminal class has always taken advantage of political disturbancesand a large pro portion of the convicted communists were old offenders it is however absurd to suppose that criminals would attend political meetings for the purpose not of pocketpitking but of hooting a candidate the truth is that the antigambettist mob consisted of fanatical irreconcilables enraged at gambettas conversion to comparatively moderata views and at his supposed luxurious life they were in short the electors wbo all but defeated him in one division of belleville and at the second ballot returned bis opponent in the othergambetta however refused to believe that hbs original admirers had turned against him he con soled himself with the idea that the men wero criminals and on taking office one article of his programme was a wholesale transportation of  recidivistes he was overthrown before his measures were discussed or even submitted but he prompted his old colleagues to present all the bills they had prepared as a record of their in tentions and activity and the transportation bill now pending in the senate is based on one of these measuresthere is no immediate prospect of its coming on and indeed the senate has sent down to the chamber a bill framed by m berenger for improving prison management wbich would to a great extent supersede the transportation bill if however the cbamber should shelve dr reject the bdrenger scheme the senate will cer tainly subject the transportation bill to muehseverer scrutiny than it underwent in the cham ber aa it stands it is certainly nothing short of draconic and would entail such expenso that french finances are not likely for years to come to be able to support itit is to be hoped that france will not tako the retrograde step of extending the transportation of convicts it would be a confession that she cannot like england germany italy and other countries treat her criminals at homea confes sion that her prison system is not merely had but incapable of amendmentmeanwhile however it is desirable that the exponents of australian apprehensions should be careful to avoid exaggerations and that any com munications on thesubject between the british and french governments should be considered confiden ilal manifest want of taot his boen shown in the publctloza in el laud of lord lyonss convsrsation with m ferry it was seized upon by the antienglish newspapers as a fresh proof of british hyprocrisy and british jealousy of french colonies it any further despatches are exchanged whie tho bill is still pending england should not tske the initiative in publishing them and france is not likely to do so their publication would en able the promoters of the bill to say to the senate  england is disptiting our right to send criminals to our own colonies  and your rejection of the bill would be tantamount to admitting her preten sions the australian alarm is very natural but this is obviously a very delicate matter and the utmost discretion is requisite in handling itshould the bill really pass some light is thrown on its probable working by some criminal statistics recently published by the french government the bill provides for the transportation for life to the french colonies of suich offenders as hsve been convicted of a certain number of infractions of the law committed in the course of the  next preced ing years after excepting all political offences the bill recites thac it will apply to such as have been sentenced twice to penal servitude or to one such sentenco and for two offences ranking as crimes  or to three months imprisonment for any one of the following offenceslarceny breach of trust obtaining money by false pretences de structicn of trees or crops obscene conduct and habitually inciting young persons to debauchery to such as have been sentenced to four sentences of three months imprisonment for the foregoing offences or of imprisonment for crimes  to such as have been five times convicted of vagabondage being once condemned to three months imprison mentandtwo of the foregoing offences and to such as have been sentenced six times once being con demned to threo months imprisonment for begging or vagabondage under suspicious circum stancesit is evident that the last three classes are susceptible of comprising nearly the whole crirninal population of france the total number of con victions in  was  and of these that is  per centwere of old offenders the proportion in the department of the seine rising as high as  per cent   conriots had been sentenced to upwards of a years imprisonment and  to less than a years imprisonment in   old offenders wero convicted of larceny   of vagabondage and  of begging seventythree per cent of all convicted vagabonds  per cent of beggars and  per cent of thievea are old offenders more than  old offenders were punished several times in the course of viz  twice  three times  four times  five times  six times  seven times and three eight times of criminals sentenced for the more serious offences half are recaptured for fresh offences before two years have elapsed after their liberatioait is evident that with such a large criminal class and an act taking cognizance of such com mon offences as those above indicated the entire criminal population of france would soon be trans planted beyond seas it is curious that no serious criticism from the criminalist point of view should have yet been directed against the bill the existence of so large a criminal class as the official figures show to exist points to its real cause which lies as enlightened french criminalists know in the backwardness of french criminal and prison policy anybody who visits a french prison issues from it sick to the soul  and he can understand how the outcast broken in health and demoralized instead of encouraged to improvement is reduced to crime by being ex cluded from everything else the true remedy for habitual criminality is shown by its very ex istence to be to make the prison a sohool of reform and to enable the penitent prisoner to begin a new life on his liberation  and not the adoption of the longexploded idea of criminal coloniesspain france and moroccomadrid apaja some letters and telegrams from the spanish mdister in tangier respecting the active propa ganda carried on

the minor questions to be settled by means of direct negotiation between the austrian minister in bucharest and the roumanian io vernment some dispute has since arisen as to the amounts of the ad
