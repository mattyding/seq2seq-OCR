a conspiracy to mubder count i tolstoifrom a corrspoxdenta statement emanabing from degaieff the assassin of colonel soudaikin and some of his associates is i havo reason to believe now in courso of preparation describing from the nihilist point of view the condition of affairs that led up to the recent revolutionary oat rages in russia considering that deaaieff alias jablonski was colonel soudaikins most trusted agent such revelations are likely to be of more than usual interest and i have been able to secure a proof of the document in question the details of which i am able to give a summary will shortly be published in the russian magazine and organ of the nihilist party entitled he miessenger of the will of thle people this publica tion only differs from the will of the eople inas much as it is issued at geneva and enters into lengthy dissertations whieh could scarcely be printed by a clandestine press  but the party is so well organized that in spite of the police it cir culates largely in russia thus the revolutionary circles of russia will soon be supplied with a very minute accouut of the character the aims and the actions of colonel soudaikin this description is so remarkable that it wiu be equally interesting to the einglish readergeorge porphyrovitch soudaikin is represented as a typical embodiment of the social and political immorality that is destroying tho vitality of the itussian nation unlike many other opponents of the revolutionary cause he was no fanatical reac tionist though anxious to repress his enemies he entertained no feelings of personal animosity towards the revolutionists he was no patriot seeking to de fend his country and its government but an adven turer whose ambition was in no wise checked by his conscience or by any feelings of humanity at the same time ho was not exactly a cruel man unlike others who have occupied similar positions he derived no vindictive pleasure from the infliction of pain  but if it could serve his purpose he could sacrifice with a light heart the happiness and even the life of any oue who stood in his way this utter want of scruplo was so marked that on one occasion ho was warmly reproached even by his most intimate friend and confidant skandrakoff a conversation aroso between the two concerning a renegado radical who had become a police spy this individual had never been a terrorist but was sufficiently wvell acquainted with revolutionists to betray a number of them now however he could be of no further use  he had told all he knew and was too much suspected to be able to find out any thitg moreskandrakoff nevertheless protested that  it was not fair to press out everything from a man and then throw him away like a dog and give him no means of existence  but soudaikins proposals went further than this he declared that degaieff should mako some notable effort to increase his popularity with the revolutionary party and con ceived the happy idea of utilizing the wornout spy for the last time he suggested that degaieff should watch him prove to the revolutionists that he was a spy and insure his assassination at the hands of the terrorists  certainly remarked soudaikin todegaieff it isa pityto kill the fellow but whatis to be done p you must raise your credit while in any case this spy is of no use to usskandrakoff who corsidered such treatment too ungratoful finally got out of the difficulty by urging that the spy should be arrested and prose cuted and thus rendered popular once more among the revolutionists from whom on leaving prison he might again extract secrets soudaikin still bent on tie same purpose then proposed that degaieff should kill shkriaba a spy at kharkoffyou can if you think it necessary destroy him were soudaikins precise instructions  and shkriaba has been  removed but not till after soudaikin himself was e xecutedsoudaikins conduct towards his superiors was however even more characteristic the relations of this parvenu detective with the high govern mental spheres were not of a very cordial descrip tion though of noble origin soudaikins family had so fallen that he might be considered a thorough plebeian his education was slight and his manners showed even less trace of cultivation this combined with the kind of service in which he won his reputation shocked the more delicate susceptibilities of the higher governing classes who contemplated with feelings of repuliion the pros pect of his becoming one of them yet this seemed inevitable compared to the majority of russian statesmen soudaikin was an undoubted genius ministers could no longer disguise this fact and became alarmed for their positions and portfolios these feelings of fear and disgust gave rise to con tinuous opposition to all soudaikins efforts on his side soudaikin profoundly despised his supe riors and his ambition was such that no position seemed too high for him while they sought to limit his action to that of a mere detective he was aiming at the portfolio of the ministry of the in terior and the part of a dictator over the whole of russia keeping in his strong hands the weak and inapt czarthe czar himself was well disposed towards noudaikin and conceived the idea that he was his only saving angel sometimes he even manifested anxiety for the security of his person  and for instance objected to sondaikins presence at moscow during tho coronation on account of the danger he would incur at such a moment the czars appreciation was limited however to soudaikinsqualitiesasadetective whereasthe latter sought by every means to destroy this  narrow view of his capacities and continually attempted to obtain interviews with the czar count tolstoi howeverdid all he could to prevent such a meeting and in fact soudaikin died before he was able to obtain a single private audience his continual failure in this direction raised soudaskin to the highest pitch of anger but he met everywhero an invisible hand which kept him at a distance from the czar  if i could only see the emperor once he would exclaim  i would show him what i am and could easily captivate him after these re peated failures soudaikin conceived the pro foundest hatred towards count tolstoisoudaikins immediate and official superior pleve the chief of the political police of all russia sincerely esteemed him at least as a man necessary to his own advancement pleve did not spare compliments and once urged soudaikin to be more prudent for heoremarked  after the life of the lord emperor yours is the most useful to the wel fare of russia this seemed to indicate that pleve also disliked tolstoifor soudaikin replied your excellency forgots the life of count tolstoi whose person is also an object of special hatred to the revolutionists  but pleve pensively re joined certainly taking him as a man we shouldregret tolstois death  but it must be allowed that so far as russia is concerned his death would have useful consequences pleve found that tolstoi wvas too reactionary but in making such complimonts to soudaikin he drew the line wvhen his own interests came into play and was in no wiso willing to serve as a stepping stone for soudaikins ambitlon he was alvays therefore kept back and overlooked whenever tho question of rewards was mooted decorations were not spared but he was always kept in a low rank  and in spite of all his success he could not after five years struggle obtain a higher grade than that of lieutenant colonel even iis hope of receiving a full colonelcy after the coronation when he was so much flattered was not realized the fear of his elevation was greater than the fear of his anger the  saviour of russia  only roceived the order of vladimir of the fourth degreecunhs final slight broke soudaikins patiene and led to the conception of strango schemes which he confided to degaieff this trusted agent at once spy and nihilist was to form a datachment of terrorists a sort of inner oirle absolutely secure from the police for no one should be allowed to know of their existence excepting soudaikin and degaieff when once this had been accomplisbed soudaikin intended to resign on the ground thathe incapacity of his superiors rendered it im possible for him to perform his duty as an alter native plan he also proposed to organize a pretended attack on his own person and resign on the pretext of being wounded in either case soudailtins retirement was to be followed by imme diate energetic action on the part of de gaieff and his inner terrorist circle the first victim marked out was count tolstoi and this murder was to be followed by that of the grand duke vladimir brother of the czar whohad been appointed regent in case alexander iii should die before the majority of the beir apparent such a revival of terrorism would it was thoughthave so alarmqed the czar as to render the necessitj of recalling soudaikin self evident soudaikin would then however be ablo to make his owvn con ditions and this the more easily as with count tolstois death the most capable person in the czars surroundings would be removed and the ofce of minister of the interior rendered vacantsuch were soudaikins schemes and dreams in his fancy he saw degaieff becoming the most popular man among the revolutionary party who would doubtless select him as a member of their executive comnmittee or else he might organize a new centre of direction amid the teltorists then these twomen would form together a secret but still the only real government ruling alike the open and the clandes tine russia the czar and his ministers held in land by soudaikin the revolutionists led by degaieff all the elements that compose the nation would be at their disposal and bring them to some splendid but undefined future such was the true character of the  convictions  anid the  fidelity  of this desperate adventurer behind whose cofin a crown sent by the empress was carried bearing the touching inscription  to one who has fulfilled his duty to the last it would be difficult to conceive a deeper irony nor must it be thought that soudaikin was content with mere dreams shortly before his death he had deter mined to cross the rubicon he gave degaieff every information concerning count tolstois movements and habits of life he supplied every indication as to how he could best be watched the false attempt on his own life was also decided upon though notwithstanding all his confidence in degaieff he preferred to inflict the wound on himself ultimately however this latter plan was abandonedsoudaikin being alarmed by what a doctor had told him concerning the dangers of blood poisoning arising even from the most trivial wounds nevertheless the first step towvards carrying out this great conspiracy was taken soudaikin tendered his resignation to pleve fortunately for those concerned pleve implored him to remain with so much earnestness that soudaikin conceived some hope of getting the better of his superior without bloodshed he de clared however that he would not remain in office beyond may to which date he postponed his sanguinary planswhile hesitatidg as to the more dangerous under takings scudaikin pushed forward actively the miner details of his conspiracy he devoted much time to the selection of persons on whom he could absolutely rely after bo had seized the reins of power he systematically surrounded himself by his own creatures who were thoroughly devoted to him persoxally and these were chosen in a great measure from among his relations and countrymen as for instance skandrakoff soudovski sidrin o with these satellites he filled all vacant posts and created a secret police of his own connected with him exclusively by ties of personal friendship material interest common success and common danger relying on this organization be could often defy other members of the police for instance soudaikin looked upon the pubhl pro secutor dobrzynski as his most dangerous rival this man had made his reputation by extractina from goldenberg the terrorist who assassinated prince krapotkine revelations that led to the conviction and execution of a large number of nihilists dobrzynski had also prevailed upon janczewski to confess and give up the secrets ofconspiracy this last success opened the way to many other arrests and consequent promotion but soudaikins jealous was awakened so he at once employed some of his creatures to warn the revolutionists that their secrets had been surprised and those who had anything to fear from janczewskis betrayal were able to make good their escapein the course of the last two years soudaikin had raised himself from the position of an obscure detective to that of a competitor wvith the existing ministers the latter were so alarmed at his growing power that they found it not only necessary to undermine his position but they dared not act openly and resorted to intrigues this is all the more remarkable when it is considered that soudaikin was absolutely an ignorant man un educated and incapable of reading a serious book over and over again he had attempted to read carl marxs work on capital so as to deceive by his conversation the revolutionists he sought to en snare  but he always failed to understand the german exponent of communism at last he abandoned the hope of educating himself bet he often observed that even without education he would do more than the ministers  all these obstructions he would argue  make us lose the way in governmentaffairs intelligence and knowvledge of life are necessary but not science nevertheless this want of education at least brought about the collapse of the pravda a re volutionary paper founded at geneva under the auspices of soudaikin for the purpose of deceiving the socialists  but the latter saw through the mancmuvre on account of the ignorance dislayed in the editorial department in any other country the possibility of so ignorant and common a personage becoming a cabinet minister would be out of the question in russia it was not only possible but even soudaikins worst enemies recognized that it was merely a question of time under such circumstanoes his death was viewed with mixed feelings but had the entire truth been known the resentment against the nihilists would probably have been considerably modiied
