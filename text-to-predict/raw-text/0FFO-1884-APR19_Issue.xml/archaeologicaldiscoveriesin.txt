alrchaxologicl discovbrib in ityhheoly land and ybria inr i discovbry ow mount geiizim o a maxllpxdysval ornamerrd with basrelns ad insoriptionsabout tho middle of last year an important archeological discovery was made in a celebrated locality of palestine which had not previously sup plied us with anything particularly interesting in the way of antiquities some works undertaken by the ottoman authorities for the construction of a building at nablous the ancient shechem at the very foot of mount gerizimbrought to light a con sidorffble number of fragments of sculptured marble among these was found a large pedestal of marble about a mntre in height triangular or rather hexa gonal in shape with three broad and three narrow sides covered with bassi relievi and greek in scriptions m paulus a talented sculptor resident in the holy city and the governor of palestine his excellency raouf pasha whose enlightened zeal cannot be too highly praised and who has taken steps to secure the preservation of this beau tiful monument kindly sent me as soon as possible different photographs of it these i immediately communicated to the academy of inscriptions and belleslottres with some explanations which up to the present time have remained unpublished and which the public may perhaps be glad to receive the real use to which this pedestal was meant to be applied is not certain it recalls to mind the triangular altarshaped pedestals of certain ancient candelabra which are in like manner ornamented with sculptures on one of the broad sides quite at the top of the cornice a greek inscription of five lines is enxgraved i have been ablo to de cipher a portion of it in spite of the smallness of the photographic reproduction and the shadow cast by the cornice which hides many of the characters it is a metrical inscription on the narrow side to the right of the preceding sido is engraved another greek inscription of nine lines which is absolutely undecipherable in its presentstatethe cha racters being not only on a microscopical scale but in addition distorted by the perspectiveeach of the three large sides is divided into two compartments in which are sculptiured in basrelief different scenes taken from tho hellenic mytho logyviz six subjects in all several of these scenes are accompanied by short greek epigraphs engraved in the field giving the names of the principal personages who are engaged in the scene represented the three lower sceneswhich are the most distinct and the easiest to identify belong to the cycle of the legend of theseus they follow one another in a relatively logical order in the first we see the young hero raising the stone under which are hidden tho sword and the shoes of his father aigeus  three women including probably his mother are talking part in the scene in the second theseus is in combat with the minotaur who may be recognized by his bulls head on one side are the young athenians whom theseus has come to set free and a kind of cavern indicating the monsters den  in the field i noticed the traces of an inscription giving the name of meinotauros in the accusative in the third theseus has triumphed over the robber corynetes vho is stretchedi at full lengtlh at his feet  the conqueror erect appears to be leaning on his own club and holding the iron club of tho robber of epidaurus  three other persons so much mutilated that they cannot be with certainty identified are standing by the side of the robbers corpse i pass now to a description of the upper compart ments the first of them shows us artemis apollo and latona with their names inscribed above their heads  on the right is the serpent python his head pierced with an arrow discharged by the divine archer in the second scene a personae probably demeter passes to the left maunted in the celebrated car drawn by serpents another wvoman lying in the shadow of a tree that crowns a height and leaning on her right elbow holds a palm or a cornucopia and has a garland of flowers on her breast  it is perhaps an indi cation of the country persunified or the repre sentation of a telluric divinity in the third upper scenewhich appears to have greatly suffered and which is imperfectly given in the photograph a manly personage is seen probably hercules half kneeling down and contending with two serpents to the right and left two women are hurriedly fleeing from the place of combatsuc is in a snmmary form the description of this very curious monument which derives its chief interest from the place in which it was found it belongs to the graecoroman epoch and must have come from the pagan temple which was erected on mount gerizim and which is so fre quently reproduced on the greek imperial coins of neapolis by what association of ideas did these greek legends come to be localized at neapolis  it appears that the ancients had establisbled between the ancient shechem transformed at the lrmecoroman period and athens one of those issimilations more or less arbitrary which were customary with them i will confine myself without insisting on my contentionto point ng out three concordant facts in support of shis suggestion on the coins of ineapolis the hiount gerizim the temple which surmounted it and the grand monumental staircase which are re presented recall to mind in a singular manner tne monetary representations of the acropolis  the greater part of the scenes figured on our monument are borrowed from the attic cycle theseus and demeter finally attica is certainly mentioned in the inscription in order to pronounce an opinion definitively on this point and on other secondary points it will be necessary to wait for better re productions of the monument above all the inscriptions must enlighten us by informirg as in what conditions it was dedicated i have asked for squeezes which i trust will enable me to settle this question in the meanwhilethismonu mont remains none the less one of the most inte resting which has been hitherto found in palestine it is much to be regretted that the occasional ex cavations which led to its discovery have not been resumed and continued in a methodical manner as they might produce results of the greatest im portanceii discovvry or antxqoutizs at emmabnicopolisthe discovery of the bilingual inscriptions of gezer has permitted by consequence the deter mination with a mathematical certainty so to speak of the position of the ancient emmails nico polis at the arab village of amwas situated on the road from jaffa to jerusalem between ramli and the point where the road penetrates into the mountain mass of judah amwais is one of the points of palestine where excavations might be made with fruitful results from an archseological point of view already at the time of my last mission in   collected there some interesting monuments among others some roman inscriptions and a marble capi tal bearing a curious inscription and coming proba bly from the very ancient basilica which waserected at emmauis this inscription in contestably christian was in effect bilin gual greek and hebrew one only god  may his name be blessed in eternity  the hebrew part strange to relate was in archaic characters analogous to those of the jrewish shekels if the stela of mesa may be considered as the alpha of hebrew epigraphy the capital of amwais may with good reason pass for its omegasince my departure some excavations un dertaken for pious purposes by a french lady mademoiselle do saintcricq have been carried on under the direction of captain guillemot in the ruins of the basilica of amwasalready excavated by me in  they havo led to new finds which e guillemot has kindly communicated to mea cruciform baptistery fragments of a vase in terra cotta with a handle in the form of a cross and the invocation  lord x re momber thy servant   a fragment of the lid of an ornamented sarcophagus  an ancient quarry mans bore fragments of funereal inscriptions in greek c but that which specially deserves to be noticed is a discovery which has realized one of my predictions i said in one of my first reports on my mission of  p  in discussing the difficult problem of the dedication of the basilica of amwias there is there in my opinion among otberchances thatoefndingsomepavement of historical mosaics per baps accompanied by inscriptions which will inform us mero

the very parts of the dedication which contain the key to this historical enigma that have disappearedanother interesting discovery made at amwas is that of a jewish sepulchre inviolate cut in the rock according to the habitual plan a square chamber with nine loculi or koukim dis posed three by three on tbree of tho walls in the centre were two ossuaries or osteothques in the form of caissettes

repro ductions of a series of inedited monuments which deserve a special mentionthese are first of all three roman inscriptions coming from the ruins of deir elkal at beit meri in the lebanon this

difflculties but this is not the place to stay and dis cuss them i would remarkhowever that if saddane is really as it appears to be the proper name of a woman it approaches very near to the name of the queen saddan engraved in syriac and in hebrew on the sarcophagus coming from thetombs of tho kings of jerusalem i have already had occasion to say that i considered saddan as the somitic and national name of helen queen of adiabone it is not impossible that the flavia daughter of titus of beit meri was attached by the ties of parentage or affranchisement tothe royal family of adiabene

attention of learned tourists who may have the opportunity of travelling in those partsv new inscrifrons in haunm lbytved sent me also the copy of four greek inscriptions collected by him in hauran they appear to me to be unpublished and they ought to be added to those already numerous which m waddington our present ambassador in london found in the ancient auranitis the first comes from numr a locality situated at an hours distance to tho south east of harra and not marked on the maps it is engraved on a small altar on which has been traced at a comparatively recent perioda large cross it is the dedication of the monument made by a certain zenon son of kadmos the second name is interesting i showed a long time ago that that of zenon frequently borne by phcenicians of the greek epochwas theblellenic equivalent of a semitic name composed with the name of baal the seoond inscription comes likewise from numr it is only a fragment containing  lines it appears to me to have eference to the erection of a boundary stone marking the limit of two ancient villages whose names are given but are badly preserved one of them appears to be namara the other two inscriptions come from djasim a small locality also situated in hauran they are both christian and one appears to contain a passage taken from the greek version of the psalmsa little later on m j lioytved sent me the copy of  new greek inscriptions collected by him during his tour in hauran in company with m p schroeder they come is from various localities oi auranitis from trachonitis from bataneea and from the ancient

wlhich up to the present tine has only been known to us by copies due to im wetzstein and wad dingtoncopies stiu leaving room for doubts in spite of the care taken by their autbors it is a bilinual greek and arabic inscription engraved on the lintel of an old chapel or martyrion at harran in the ledia that which gives special interest to this inscription of three lines mentioning the construction of the martyrionin honour of st john by a tribal chief or phylarch  asarabil son of talemou is that it is dated with an entire certitude after the local era of bostra the year  corresponding to the year  ad then it results from this that the arabic portion written in pure neskhi is anterior by fifty years to the hegira and consequently en graved befote the birth of mahomet during the last  years i have pointed out this desideraoum to al the persons of my acquaintance who had the opportunity to explore this region but vith out success m lytved has had the kindness to do what i could not obtain from his pre decessors and he has just sent me a very goodimpression of this precious inscription thankso tins document i hope soon to be in a position to cast a new light on

certainly genuine but that which is not genuine is a pheanician inscription of five characters which it bears engraved on the left side and which i read gadyaton the proper name of a man which signifies literally gad has given it has a good semitic physiognomy and sureties in the collection of phcenician proper names nevertheless it must have been engraved afterwards by a modern forger upon the little figure in order to increase its market value the forger must have been inspired with the legends on certain phoenician seals the letters have a stiffness which betrays a modern hand the graver has in places exfoliated the pellicle of the antique oxide and in spite of the precautions taken to cover over the engraved lines with an artificial patine one can perceive here and there brilliant points of the metalviii discoveny of a fragment or an imperialinscrirtion at jietrsalemin the course of the summer of  excavations were undertaken under the direction of the archi mandrite of the russian mission at jerusalem in the vast tract of ground belonging to the russian government and situatad east of the church of the holy sepulchre this point is one of the most in teresting to explore for the topography of the heoly city because there is a chance of finding traces there of the second enclosure wall a problem writh which the authenticity of the eoly sepulchre is intimately connected i myself made there during my mission of  some excavations which have led to certain resultsthe archimandrite in a letter dated the th of december  informs me that the new works which have just been undertaken have brought to light the threshold of a large antique door and a fragment of a roman inscription it is a piece of flagstone   metre in length by  in width with these charactersi imvp part the word impbrator evidently indicates i that we have to do with an imperial inscription the surname of partiicus can only be applied to trajanus who first assumed that title after his expedition against the parthians or to one of the antonini who bore the name after himnbw foogxbms at jerusalemfor some little timne past the forgers at jerusalem appear to have applied themselves to the cultiva tion of another branch of industry i say  for some little time past because in the yearl there was no question of it at jerusalem and if the industry had existed some product of it would certainly have fallen into my hands during my stay in palestine at that period i refer to the manufacture of terra cotta lampsthe forgers have had the ingenious idea of imi tating those little antique lamps belonging for the most part to the christian epoch which have been found by hundreds in jerusalem and its neigh bourhood several of themi am speaking of the authentic onesbear very curious christian symbols and some of them even greek inscriptions the first specimen of which i made known in  they are pious eulogies such as sc xi eni iiacin  the light ot christ shines for all atxnapia kaaa beautiful lamps c this latter epi graph haa the advantage of giving us the very name of these lamps of these lychnaria which probably served as well for profane as for sacred purposesnothing is more easy than to counterfeit these little lychnaria which were cast in rude moulds the two portionsthe upper and the lowverwere moulded separately and they were thon put together before the baking of the clay i discovered and brought away with me several of these antique moulds used in palestinei do not know whether the forgers have made use of upper castings surnoulages or whethar they have reproduced in their entirety certain models which they can hardly have failed to procure at all events they have put in circula tion a considerable number of false lychnaria and have multiplied them in abundance thanks to the expeditious process of moulding imitatad fron the ancients in order to make the fraud more profitable they have ornamented their wares with fancy inscriptions having once set themselves to this task they ao not do things by halves greek christian inscriptions like those which are already known were but small beer for them hebrew inscriptions if you please here for example is a little clay iychnarion which is worth itb weight in gold it is circulated at jeru salem in several copies and i recommend it to tourists on the upper part is represented a palm tree separating into two sections a group of four archaic hebrew letters which are read without difficulty simeon the counterfeiter has simply copied the complete type of the reverse of one of the jewish coins struck during the last revolt it is the coin which is ordinarily attributed by numis matists though the correctness of the statement is open to discussion to the famous barcochebas a lamp with the name of the jewish hero  that is in deed a wonderful lamp unfortunately here aladdin probably calls himself selim elkariand it is with the story of the forty thieves that we have to doi am informed from jerusalem that there was found in a cavern near hebron during the summer of a quanity of terracotta lamps of the same type description and size bearing on the upper part a similar inscription in illegible characters of semitic appearance although this  find  ap pears to me to be very suspicious i suspend my judgment regarding it until i am more fully informedoh
