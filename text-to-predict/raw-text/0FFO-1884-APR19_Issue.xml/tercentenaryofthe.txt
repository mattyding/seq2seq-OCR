rcboentbbaby of tijfb uynibbsityio redinburahedinburge aiï¿½m for the third time this week a great morning meeting was hold today in the united presbyterian hall tuesdays meeting was that of the graduates who were then admitted to the fellowship of their university thursdays meeting was of the senatus academicus which celebrated the th birthday of the university by a largesse of academic honours bestowed on illustrious men of all nations todays meeting was distinctively that of the students it was the  students reception of the university guests and it was therefore fitly pre sided over by the rector sir s northcote who is their elected representativethe meeting wvas a most interesting and success ful one indeed one of the most successful of the whole series the central area of the great hall was occupied entirely by students who were ad mitted on the presentation of their matriculation tickets on the platform were many of the dis tinguished guests of tho university mr lowell mr robert browvning m de lesseps m pasteur professor virchow professor relmnholtzdr beets m laveleyo count saffi and others principal sir alexander grant supported the rector on the right and lord provost harrison on the left lord reay and sir lvon playfair were also present a remarkable group of the professors in their robes occupied the lower plat form in front of tho chair the galleries and spaces under them were reserved for those of the general public wlho had been fortunate enough to procure tickets of admission the vast hall was fiuled to overflowingthe success which has attended all the events in tho festival or connected with it with which the students have been direotly identified is one of the most striking features of the celeuration the torchlight procession the dramatic entertainment the bal  the reception of the guests the concert in the musichall and the symposium of tonight have eaoh and all been arranged for and controlled by the students themselves independently of though with the entire approval of the university authorities and in every instance the results have beeu most successful and most gratifying this will probably strike with surprise those who have been accustomed to hear of the meetings of scottish students as scenes of uproar and as chiefly remarkable for a defiance of the proprieties of civi lized life there is however a simple explanation of the changewhat the professors failed in doing the students have been able to do of themselves they have for social and other extraacademical pur poses incorporated themselves in a union which has its representative council and its executive and through these boies their powers of selfgovernment are most effectively exercised the representative council consists of  members  of whom are elected by the students of the fonr facilties of divinityarts law and mledicine in proportion to their comnparative strength while the remaining  sre elected by the associated societies literary and philosophical one of the chief aims of this organization which came into being only during last winter session is to establish a union adapted to the peculiarities of edinburgh student life it is hoped that by this means the social side of undergraduate life the weakness of which has been the reproach of the scottish uni versities may be developed and strengthened with out incurring the risks therein involved some time however must elapse before this scheme can be carried out especially as it implies the collec tion of a considerable sum of money in the mean time the students organization has rendered very important services not only to themselves but also to the university the whole arrangement for the last rectorial meetingwhen sir stafford northoote was installed in office were intrusted to the representa tive coancil and its executive and never before within living memory was a students meeting for any such purpose conducted so admirably so com fortably and with so much quietness and good order the greatest credit is due to the council for that result they deserve equal if not greater credit for the contributions they have made to the success of the tercentenary festivalthis mornings meeting was in nearly every re spect a model meeting of students there was a little impatience shown during the latter part of mi de lessepss speeoh of halfanhour infrenchand also a little while professor virchow addressed them in german but the feeling was not unnatural and the expression of it was so promptly repressed that the oircumstances really showed that the students were well under control on the whole and from first to last the order was admirable there was enthusiasm without roughness and the speeches of the distinguished men who addressed them were thoroughly appreciated it is not often of course that such an opportunity occurs of combining in one setting so many gems of the first water the banquet of last night suffered from the same embarras de richesse the committee had suoh a host of great mon at their disposal that they did not know at whom to draw the line consequently the toast list was inordinately long but the speaking was far above the average of such meetings both in cquality and in the personal interest of the speakerswith this mornings meeting the same disioulty was felt it was very desirable that the strangers should see an assemblage of scottish students it was also desirable that scottish students should be brought into immediate contact with the minds of some of the most original thinkers and greatest discoverers of the age most of the students now in edinburgh are medical and scientific students and therefore men connected with science were preferred but mr lowell and lord reay were istened to with great attention fortunately the speakers profited by the experienceof last night and made the speeches as i a rule short and pithy the rector set a good example in this respect contenting hiaself with stating the reason which had sug gested the meetingand with thanking the students for their kindness to himself mr lowell followed the few words he addressed to the audience had been suggested he said by the torchlight proces sion of tuesday night it had suggested to him two reflections one of thom pathetic and the other hopeful one of the things that was perhaps saddest to a teacher was that he remained and saw passing before him these endless processions of young mon comparable to the bird of the anglo saxon king which flew in at one end of the lighted hall from the darkness and out of the other into the darkness and so they passed before us this was omething of a sal reflection on the other hand as he looked at their torches he thought how high how sacred how anxious was the office of teacher when he looked at the torches he thought of that familiar passage of the latin poet of how the lamps of life were passed from hand to hand some times teachers had the good fortune not often of lighting these torches and as he saw them emerge from the darkness he felt it was their destiny the destiny of students to carry them down to the future and hand them on to their sucoessorsprofessor beets of utrecht called forth loud cheers by his apt quotations from burns and scott he was followed by m de lesseps in a french speech in which ho corroborated the statement that had been made by the rector as to his scottish origin he recounted the story of the suez canal described the progress of the panama canal and spoke in glowing and eloquent terms of the pro gress of commnerce throuagh the combination ofscience with industry professor virchow in german defined and defended his attitude towards darwinism professor holmholtz in english warned the students against a spurious rationalism in medical science and told them to be true to the facts m pasteurinfrenchcommended the experi mental method in scientific inquiry count saffi said that nothing had impressed him more than the evidence afforded by the festival of the intimate unior between religion and scienceafter a few wvords from m de laveleye lord reay in the name of the students thanked the guests for their speeches thero was then a call for browning whereupon mr browning roso and said that though taken by surprise and unable to make a speech he would say ono word vhich would be this he had been accused of being unintelligible in his writings when he said how thoroughly grateful he felt at the reception given to him he should consider it to the end of his life one of the proudest of his days to be recognized by them in the way that they had dons on this occasionin the morning tho guests and the members of the university breakfasted by invitation with the president and fellows of the royal college of eurgeonls dr johp jtbk k atedbq i hwas supported by the liord provost and sir iyon playfair gave the strangers a cordial welcome in the course of the day visits were paid to holyrood palace the castle the university buildings and other points of interest in edinburah while ex cursions wero made to historic places in the neigh bourhood fortunately the weatber was finein the aftornoon a concert was given in the musichall by the members of the university musical society the hall was filled in every part by an enthusiastic and appreciative audience the chorus consisted of students the orchestra com prised professionals as well as amateurs and professor sir herbert oakeley conducted the opening number was the students song  alma matcr  by sir herbert oakeleyvords by professor maclagan vhich was given wvith great spirit the orchestral selections the solo songs and pianoforte solo were much enjoyed  but the most striking features of the concert were undoubtedly the scottish melodies with chorus which were given with the utmost precision and with feeling as well as with forceat a later hour the gaueries of the royal scottish academy enw sruite with the national gallery vere thrown open for a reception by the president and council of the royal scottish academy that was a happy thought which made this afternoons conversciione a part of the programme scottish science and scottish literature may be transported beyond seas but an adequate representation of scottish art can be furnished only on scottish soil besides nowhere can a public reception be given more pleasantly or with more charming con comitants than in a picture gallery the strangers wgho visited the galleries today bad an opportunity at least of acquainting them selves wvith some of the greatest works pro duced by theo scottish school in past times as well as with escellent and characteristic specimens of the painters of today in portraiture and land scape as well as in genre subjects the rooms were beautifully decorated vith growing palms and with masses of flowers and foliage refreshments were served at buffets in all the large rooms and on occasional tables scattered through the gal leries for two hours there streamed through the rooms bright and radiant crowds inclading many distinguished strangers wvho seemed thorouglly to enjoy the hospitality of the academiciansat halfpast oolock the students reception under the presidency of the lord lrector was held in the synod hall of the utnited presbyterian church the students occupied the body of the hail and the remainder nvas crowded by visitors the platform was occupied by the rector the principalthe lord provost and a large number of foreign delegatesthe rectost sir stafford lnorthcote saidt am sure it will be a satisfaction to the distinguished men who have visited us upon this occasion to have the opportunity of coming face to face with you all and to make your acquaintance and i am also sure that to many to the whole body of you it will also be a matter of the greatest and most lasting satisfaction that you have had an opportunity of coming into personal communication wvith these distinguished men of whom several i hope will to day address you it is an opportunity such as i will venture to think vill be given to very few men indeed to witness agaiunamelythe collection of so many men distinguishea in various branches of literature and scienoe and art as those who are collected on the present occasin i should be unpardonable if i were to take up your time because i may have other opportunities from time to time of visit ing you loud cheers and i therefore will not stand between you and those whom yon may have no opportunity of ever seeing or hearing again i take this oppcrtunity of thanking you on my own part and on the part of the other university authoritiesfor the excellent conduct which has been displayed for the seal with which the students have thrown thenmsdves into the festival and tho part which they have taken in providing entertainment and in every wary making themselves responsible for assisting to enter tam and render their visit aereesble to our friendsmr loweli who was received with loud cheers said he confessed he was very deeply touched by the kindness of their reception he had feared that his engagements were such that he could not be there that morningbut he could not bear to go away without seeing the students face to face cheers he could not bear to lose the chance of having perhaps one of the greatest pleasures that fell to ateackierand he fur years was a teachertime pleasure of looking into young eyes it was a bath of youth a bath of hope it was restoring and invigorating ele would only say a very few words and they bis feilowstudente would pardon himfor he was very tired the few words he should say were suggested by the very pretty sight he sawv the other evening from the windows of his hotelhe meant the torchlight procession which seemed to him emblematic it suggested to him two reflections one of them pathetic the other bopeful one of the things that were perhaps saddest to a teacher was that he remained and saw paevng before him there endless proct ssions of young men comparable to the bird of the anglosaxon kingwhicb diew in at one end of the lighted hail from the darkness and out of the other into the darlness and so that passed before them this was something of a sad reflection on the other band as he looked at their torches he thought bowv high how sacred how anuxious was the ohice of teacher when he looked at the torches he thought of that familiar passage of the latin poet of how the lamps of life were passed from hand to hand sometimes teacbers had the good fortune not oi ten df lighting those torches and as he sawv them emerge from darkness he felt it was their destiny the destiny of students to carrythem downto thefuture and band them on to their successors he would not detain them longer ex ept to express the great satisfaction the great pleasure end interest that all their guests must have felt in this ceremonial which had been going on for the last two or three days and which had been successful beyond all possible expectation be could conceive notbing more in teresting and it seemed to him they were singu larly fortunate in being able to carry with them such e tradition into life as the memory of having stood face to face with so many eminent men and remarkable person ages cheersprofvssor burts in the course of an address in which he quoted many familiar expressions n scottish literature aud spoke of edinburgh as auld peekie said he came to them as an old man with a young heart in wvhom the love of beauty had not diminished he often thought that he owed as much to his fellow students as to his professorsm de lesrs who spoke in french was received with great enthusiasm after expressiug regret at his inabilitv to speak english he said that his family vere of scottish descent his rather bad been sent to egypt by the french directorate after the peace of amrdens and intrusted with the duty of fnding a native chief sufficiently energetic and intelligent to overthrow the power of the iamelukes whose disastrous rule had ruined the country and been the cause of the french expedition to egypt he found an intelligent and vigorous man named mehemet ali whp was born in macedonia that chieftain had only  men under his orders and he did not know how to read or write but he was very proud to haveleen chosenby the representative of france to govern egypt ilater on in  when he had himself gone as consulgeneral in egypt he was very well received by mlehemet ali who remembered that he owed his situation to his father that succession of circum stances had helped materially the success of tho suez canal he had been frequently attacked not in scotland but in england and those attacks hadl been favourable to his undertaking he could not forget that  years ago when he had made a tour of  public meetings in england and scotland lie had come to lolanburgb where he had received most cordial hospitality under the auspices of the university at a public meeting in thattowvn resolu tion was carried setting forch that the work would be use ful to humanity al de lesseps proceeded to give some par ticulars as to the construction of

that must be his excuse for not attempt ing to do what in other words he should certainly have done in acknowledging their kindness he has been accused in his writings of being unintelligible laughter
