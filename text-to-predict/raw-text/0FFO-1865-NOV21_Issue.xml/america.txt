federacy the whole of the country thus passed or traversed was hotly contested during the war the breastworks and forts of the southerners line the virginian sliord of the potomac and similar works abound as thickly on the maryland side there are also other places of bistoric celebrity on tho river fort washington one of tho oldest structures of the kind in the united states and not far from it on tho other shore the home and the grave of the father of his country mount vernon in passing which every vessel to this hour tolls the bell as for a funeral the passengers who travel this way now are chiefly northern men on the look out for good opportunities for investment it is easy for thlem or anyone else to spy out the naked ness of the land and they have already bought ex tensively in the neighbourhood of richmond not altogether to the satisfaction of thevirginians they need money sorely but they would ratber have it from any source than from their northern brethren the railroad between acquia creek and this city is a single line passing through fredericks burg spotsylvania and the bloody fields of the wvilderness where the confederates made so reso lute a stand that only the enormous numbers of their foes couldhave sufficed to prevail against them the land was never entirely cultivated but it is now lying wasto in all directions and the remains of encampments the feued timber and the absence of fences mark out too plainly the path of war an enclosure of stones here and here shows where the falien were buried but in the thick growth of underwood wvhich covers the country there must be still many brave men lying who have not yet found a grave the bridges acros the creeks and ravines were all destroyed and temporary wooden bridges have since been put upriclketty works they are over which the trains move very slowly and cau tiously one feature of travel in the south at the present time soon attracts attention on the boats and trains there wil often be seen a large oblong wooden box with a skuu aud crossbones painted outside and a name and date this contains the body of a northern soldier who fell in the south and wlhose remains the relatives are anxious to have buried near them the disinterment and removal of corpses has become an extensive trade in the south it is so profitable that rocruery has taken advantage of it and i see in one of the papers here a warning agauist unscru pulous persons who advertize as  embalmers  and send a corpse to affectionate relatives but not the corpse i enclose a circular in which the real simon pure of richmond announces his readiness to disinter and disinfect remains of deceased soldiers and send them  home in patent deodo rizing or airtight cofins at a small expense the demand comes almost exclusively from

there are laree hotels and streets of houses belonging to the tbeter clases the burnt district of the towvn has a forlorm appearance but new houses are rapidly rising above the ruins and in the course of a year or two it is probable that the worst traces of a line of fire extendino over a inile will have disappeared beyond this burnt district is a rano of warehouses once used for the west india trade now partly occupied by federal troops it has a board out side on which is painted libby prison the walls vithin have been whitewashed and the floors scraped so that few menisorials of the prisoners are left i noticed several chequer boards carved out on the floor and also an arrangement which i was told was intended for tho game of  goose what ever that may be many new stores have lately been opened by northerners and so far as i can discover things are not more than twice as dear here as they are in new york and in new york they are twice as dear as they are in any other part of the worldnot even excepting the east thero is a theatre in the city and several halls in one of which i saw last eveniny a young per son with no more dress on than she could well spare dancing to a select audience of soldiers and negroes the most interesting build ing in the city is the state capitol where the confederate congress met during the war it is in an incredibly dilapidated and filthy state during these terrible four years the representatives of the south had neither time nor money to bestow on their capital and everything went to rack and ruid the carpets of the rooms are worn into large holes the leaden covering to the stairs is hanging together by pieces and the old chair used in the first house of burgesses in virginia is only a skeleton a statue of washington in the entrancehall the only one taken during lifo is uninjured as is also a stove said to have been presented to the virginian burgesses by george iv the library forrmerly one of the best in the country was wantonly injured by the federal troops after the evacuation of the city by the confederates au the plates having been torn out of the books and hundreds of volumes carried off the librarian a mulatto who has been here  years tells me that not one of the many relics once stored here were left by the union soldiers they were au safe he said the day before the evacuation the old man looked round at the disordered shelves in an affectionate mamner and seemed to regret the loss of his books much more than the downfall of the confederacy indeed his talk denoted that he was a true union man but like everybody else in this country he had readilrecuulouatea nnmseir to circumstances when mr jefferson davis took possession just opposite is the houlse where mr davis lived and hardby is the building used as the treasury department in former days the postoffice on another side of the square is st johns church where as the librarian said  mr davis worshipped neither of these buildings were injured by the great tire and the wholo of the upper part of the town escaped unharmed by the flames workmen are now employed within the capitol attempting to patch it together hastily for the meeting of theix ginia senate on the first monday of december the day on which congress assembles atwashingtonethere are greater external signs of prosperity in richmond than the actual condition of the people justifies and it is owing to the fact that northern men have come here and opened stores fnd other wise laid out money in the expectation of at once doing a large business bat the success of this enterprize depends upon the back country and this is utterly prostrated and povertystricken in the town itself the wealthier class of former days is now poorer than the meanest tadesman used to be a lady who belongs to a very old and leading family here told me that they were  all living from hand to mouth we went to sleop rich she said  and awoke with nothing in i the world our currency was annihilated in one day and we lost all the property we possessed on the morning after the federal troops came in isud denly recollected that all my confederate notes were so much waste paper and that i had not money enough to buy the common household neces saries the reverse indeed was moro disastrous than most persons in england have realized like the money in fairy tales the confederate currency has turned to dead leaves in a single niaht not only did the government paper cease to have the smallest value but worse still the local banks all broke and the stato securities in which the virginians kept a large permanent in vestment suffered an iminense depreciation a large holder of this stock informs me that the state bonds nre not worth more than  in the hundred and that he does not expect they will go much higher for many years it may be judged what capabilities the people possess to pay the taxes whieh i nowv are levied on ererything in the united states ill as at honest

endeavouring to raise money but chiefly in convincing tho new york judiciary that it is infamous conduct on their part to hold general ortega the chief justice and vicepresident of the republic of mexico upon a criminal information juares term of oflice expires in a few days and ortega were he only on mexican soil would be thpe constitutional successor but the unfortunate vicepresident has been under ar rest in new york to answer a charge of swindling the vilest of au charges that can be made against one high in authority in an embryo government and being until yesterday fast in the clutches of the law the mexican republio stood an excellent chance in spite of loans sympathy meetings and the monroo doctrine of being without any govem inent at all as general ortega had no tinme to spare and was anxious to get off to mexico to pre vent the fatal  interregnum his counsel on the th of november moved to set aside the order of arrest which was procured some time since by a colonel allen who brought a suit against general ortega for  due for services and expenses in recrtutingmen for the liberalists in new york a large amount of evidence was given on both sides of the question and from the character of the vwitnesses against general ortega and the positions thoy held under juarez it reems thoy regard the cause as hopeless and before leaving give it a parting kick by testifying against the general i spite of their testimony however the general has been released from arrest and is now at libertyto go where he lists the meiican bonds do not seem to have yet produced more than enoaeh money to pay this small debt but the genera is released and can go to the rio grande and if possible reestablish the tottering republicthe governors of the southern states are recoghe could not cough without putting a stamp on his mouth the worst circumstance of all is that it is impossible to obtain labour and in consequence but little wheat or corn has been sown so that the next harvet will not assist the people through their difficulties all parties concur in tho statement that tlie neoro will not go to work voluntarily this is not merely the testimony of southern men the provisional governor of virginia mr pierpoint told me today that nothing wvould shake the convictioii of the negro that con gress meant to give him lands for his own use next decomber northern men bad been among them telling them not to hire themselves out becauso congress must loolk after them other negroes wander about the country under the belief that if they stay with their old masters they axe not free they can only assure themselves of their free dom by running away governor pierpoint looks forward with great apprehension to the ensuingwinter and feels sure that notbing can save the freed men from the most terrible hardships and sufferings ile regretted that so many of their old masters should want to get rid of them because he thought their labour could not be dispensed with finally lhe said we arelnerely drifting on nono of us can fsay how events will go the negro may do wel and he may not mr pierpoint further told me a curious circumstance when the condition of the freedmen was investigated this summer it wvas fonud that they had parted with every dollar of confederate currency almost as soon as it had come into their hands one man in the city had over   of which he had hoarded in aold and  in greenbacks others had spent their confederate notes in the purchase of land about the town these welltodo negroes had kept stores or amassed moneyin domestic service and it is to be wished that their masters had taken as good care of themselves as their servants managed to do a neoro of whom i had occasion to ask my way today gave me his opinion of his countrymen like every other negroi have yet seen in the streets of virginia he was leaning against a post with one band in his pocket grinning and otherwise enjoying himself in the sunlight of freedom he rubbed his flat nose with an air of profound thoughtfulness and said he guessed some of his people coloured pussons he called themwere wuss off and some better he was wuss off hle had left his old master not that lie was ever illusedhe was always treated well he believed they would all be better off by and bye did i think congress meant to give them any lands  if not he reckoned yankee freedom wvasnt very good for them he interrupted himself withumas ox iaugnrer as jie celeiverect thlese re marks the joke being too subtle for a white mans intelligence to discover the hotel people complain that their neoroes have grovw n very i nsolent and independent and that it is almost impossible to get good work out of themtho necessities of this war drove the southern people to manufacture for themselves and among other things so produced i have been shown some excellent potterymade in the virginia vauey the discovery of valuable clay will probably help a sec tion of the country to recover its losses very soon it is found at the western base of the blueridge and is from g to so feet in depth skilled labour is much needed and there is a good opening for european enterprise in this department of industry the clay can be brought to richmond at a cost of s or  a ton by rail and governor pierpoint hopes that some oue will be induced to come from eingland or france aud set up pottery works at richmondhere as in the virginia valley i have found a general feelina oi soreness towards england the people say itat we ought to have recognized their independence and seem to attach very little importance to the points which ar so strongly in sisted upon in the norththe alabama the con federate loan and the rest of the old story in a large factory in the city i met a man who was the overseer or perhaps the proprietor who said that he had served in the army throughout the war and would go through it all again to ensure a different result he thought they ought to have had their independence acknowledged for they had fought hard enoucah for it they would have beaten the yannkecs if they had been anything like fairly matched they had never aslked better than to have no more than five to one against them and they would beat the northerners at those odds if they would give them arms he fully ex pected that england would have interfered shouldnt we have liked to have had them as colonists was there likely to be a war between england and america if so the south would never fight for the yankecs he would much rather be living under the english flag than the federal flag for he did not feel that this was his own country nowagainst this i must set the words of a staff officer in the confederacy who told me that the only event that could ever thoroughly unite north and south would be a war against england we shallnever forgive you he said  for standing by and seeing us crashed i put the case to this gentleman in a different light but feeling is stronger than reason and passion than factsthe administration of justice is at present entirely in the hands of the military authorities general halleck has introduced here  courts of concilia tion similar in constitution to those which existed in california when the united states took it from mexico all questions as to contracts or claims for land are heard before three gentlemen who examine all the evidene bearing upon the suit and pronounce judgment without reference to any civiltribunal during the war some land belonging to union men was conftiscated by the confederate government and claims for its restoration are brought before this court of conciliation it has already ordered the restoration of considerable pro perty to its former owners and decided on numer ous contracts made at various periods during the war the foreo of military now stationed here is small and gives no offence to the inhabitantsfpo an aneisbican correspoidentphiladelpfhi yov the steamer city of new york which sailed for queenstown and liverpool from new york on november  took tho first brief announcement that the cholera had reached america its arrival found us entirely unprepared and as may easily be supposed created a great panic when tho steamship atlanta which had the disease on board sailed into new york harbour early on the morn ing of november  the authorities of the great american cities were lazily discussing tho proper precautions to be taken to prevent the approach of tho epidemic as if its visiting america were but a remote probability the consternation it caused when the news was spread over the country was something like the excitement following the fau of sumter ia  every man told his neighbour not to be frightened but au the while was himself quaking wvith fear the panicis uncontrollable and therulers of the country nationalstate and muni cipal are abused without stint and so thorougnly roused are the people that were the disease to ap pear in any of our citie the infected quarter would have small chance of escape from the incendiarys torchthe steamship atlanta which brought the disease among us is now closely guarded in the lower bay of new york near sandy hook and au communi cation vith her is forbidden shehad on board passengers all of whom are kept at suidy book there had been  cases of cholera on board tho first one appearing soon after the vessel sailed from brest and of the sick  had died the cholera being among us all precautions of health commis soners afd quarantine officors will be of little avail for on its former visits although the vesselbringing it was kept in close quarantine it soon appeared im filthy places in the city and in two or threo days spread over the country the rapid approach of winter may in this case neutralizo the poison but the probabilities are thatit will soon fasten itself on the now york tenement houses and become a con firmed epidemic now that it has come the boards of health which before its arrival did nothing but talk are going to work in earnest new york philadelphia baltimore and boston are to be thorotighly cleansed and if labour and money can deep offthe disease it wil remain at sandy hook the new york health board have petitioned the president to allow them the uso of the government land at sandy hook for tho construction of a hos pital for the detention of cholera cases every vessel arriving at the port of new york from london southampton havre and the meditor ranean is to undergo a quarantine of five days for observation and if any case of cholera has adpeared the vessel will be detained until the pas sengers are removed and both the vessel and cargo thoroughly ventilated and disinfeosed until the sandyhook hospital is ready au passengers sick wvith cholera or ordinary diarrhcea are to be kept on board

french steamer europe from havre but she has no signs of cholera on board nd vdll soon be released her passengers are very indignant at the detention and threaten the board of health with suits for ciamages as they report that many parisians and others from cities infected with cholera go to liverpool and embark for ame rica the quarantine will probably be extended to vessels arriving from liverpool the fear of the cholera is so universal throughout america that it is believed it will cause a general destruction of business as it did on its previous visits in  and  it always has a great effect upon trade as it drives people out of the citie but it never is so great a scourge among its as it is in the old world in nowyork city the number of deaths from cholera since its first appaance

brought in vessels to quebec on both occasions and guarded as closely as human power could guard it the disease quickly and almost simultaneously appeared in quebec now york boston and philadelphia

anywhero but on the decks of the atlantasome unfaithful fenian not having the fear of the head centro before his eyes has much to the consternation and dismay of the brotherhood laid bare the secrets of the order by revealing the isew constituition just framed at the congress in this city which ought to have been kept a profound secret miany of its provisions through the careless babbling of members of the brotherhood have already been made public but now the entire con stitution lias been laid open to view and the inten tions and duties of the order are as well known out side as inside the mysterious circles the new  constitution is framed very much like the con stitution of the united states and the preamble of the latter has an almost compiete paraphrase in the former the constitution defines the fcnian brotherhood as  a distinct and independent orga nization and continuesit is composed in the first place of citizens of the united states of amnerica of irish birth and lincage and in tho second place of irishmen and friends of ireland living on tho american continent and in the provinces of the british empire he reversituate its headquarters are and shallbe within

to be to extort money from the poor and ignorant irish elabomato directions are given in the constitution how tbis is to be done every fenian is to pay a weekly fee of not less than  cents and on entering the order an initiation fee of ono dollar tho treasury department contains a trea surer an  agent of tho irish republicl a  sub scription agent and numerous other subordinates and power is given it to raise an unlimited amount of money by loan for which the itish republic bonds  are made out in returnit will be seen that tho brotherhood is thus a despotic organization the members pledging them selves to implicit obedience to the commands of their superiors the constitution empowers the president and senate  to make arrangements and treaties with persons or powers friendly tothe objects of the fenian brotherhood and to  appoint en voys andambassadors and the presidentshall c re ceive envoys and other public ministers members guilty of perfidy in maligning the order or reveal ing its secrets shall be expelled and proscribed by fenians throughout the world the brotherhood have agreed upon a stamp which is to be affixed to alt bonds and documents but this action makes themn amenable to the laws of the united states prohibiting the use of stamps and seals unless in corporated the fenians however do not seem to care for laws and as they are quite harmless they will scarcely be prosecuted the publication of their constitution has caused them much anxiety for it gives evidence of the most revolutionary de signs but as they raise very little money and the chief fenans always find ways of spending the little that is raised other than in wvarlike movements and as au the fenians both leaders and followers are very loth to go and per sonally relieve ireland from the  yoke of eng land they talk so much ofs there is very little op portunity of their putting their revolutionary de signs into execution meanwshile the senate is in constant session in new york

the necessity of bowing to his will have in almost all the states ratified his decision the confederato debt state aid national is therefore valueless but the southern state debts in existence beforo

on this debt will amount on january   to  or an annual interest of  governor sietcher recommends that measures be taken for the payment of this interest as speedily as possible even if new bonds have

seceded states almost exclu sively to their own people giving so few orders that they have been almost untrammelled in their actiofi he now for some reason exhibits a lively distrust of the new southern governors chosen at the recent elections some time since provisional governor perry of south carolina was told not to yield his place to governor orr until ordered to do so by the president mnir orr thus holds an aniomalous position he is a governor but without authority and bowing to the will of the president is anxioustoknow whatit all means on the th of november a similar order was sent to provisional governor sharkey of mississippi he is not until exprcssly ordered by the president to yield vilby w xeluenrl numpnreys tle new o vernor whlo was formauy inaugurated two weeks since the result of this order has caused trouble in mississippi for during the few days governor humphreys was in power ho began the organization of the state militia and now governor sharkey has to undo au that has been done this change of feeling on the part of the president is perplexing but can be traced to the disobedience of his orders iu both south carolina and mississippi south carolinadid not repudiate the confederate debt mississippi did not grant civil rights to the negroes anid until these states change their laws the presi dent intendsto control them through his provisional governors there is little doubt that enactments in conformity vith the presidents wishes passed in ood faith by tho legislatures of south carolina an mississippi will be speedily followed by per mission to governors orr and humpbreys to begin their administrations this conduct on the part of tho president may be properi do not question it but it certainly shows a despotic power in the hands of a single man at which the people of a republic and even of a monarchy sbould shudderit is stated that john mitchel wlho was recently released from fortress monroe has given his parole not to leave the state of virginia this will seri ously interfere with the crcer he has marked out for himself as high priest among the fenians the president has announced his intention of pardoning roger a fryer and robert ould and a petition has just been sent him by the mississippi legisla ture asking for the pardon of jacob thompson one of the coiifederatc agents in canada the georgia state convention has also asked the pardon of commodore tatnalltoday is a day of general election in several statesto wit in new york new jersey massa chusetts delaware miaryland missouri illinois miichigan wisconsin andl minnesota very light votes will be polled in all these states and as no national issue is involved all parties in all the states having endorsed the presidents policy very little interest is manifested in the
