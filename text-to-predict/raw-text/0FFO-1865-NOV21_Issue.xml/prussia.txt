prussiamr ou ou awir corbxponzmnr iberlin nov these are strange times indeed i the kreuz zeihtou a paper whose task it has been so long to support legitimacy and combat the french the orginators of political sin in this european world of ours not only pleads an saliance with france but also hints that stich an allianco bas been already offered to this government nay more the same paper already inquires what advantages might be eventually obtained of francenud what concessions might be accorded ia return as the league it is owned woould be directed against austria there is no need to answer the former question very ex plicitly france is simply expected to grant what austria bas so long refused in the duchies and perhaps souaewhereelse as to counterconcessionsthis is a delicate point which the ministerial and conservative organ par excellence wiu not advert to just now excopt indirectly no german territory it says can be ever yielded up to a nongerman state such a calamity the king formally engaged to prevent in one of the famous speeches he deli vered in the beginning of his reign there can be no question of it then but has any other such question been mooted at all the astonished reader involuntarily asks bimself at the close of the oracu lar article i should not wonder if our euriosity were never satised on this head it is just possible the article or rather the articles in the krenz zeitung are little more than hints and feelers intended to frighten austria into pliancy if so it must be acknowledged how ever the means used are very strong iideed the only alternative left to austria in the columns of the kreuz zeitung lies between sincere alliance and war to the knife  we must be either good friends or bitter enemies is the argument sub mitted to the raiser if the latter it will be another silesian war and that at a time when prussia has been in the ascendant for a century and is so much nxore ofa smatch for austria than under frederick the great you see the conversion of the kreuz zeitung is apparently as complete as it is sudden and sensationalwhile this surprising change of sentiments is either taking place in or affected by the leading circles of the conservative party here a no less interesting phenomenon may be observed at st petersburg the lolos a paper notoriously subven tioned by the rtussian government bitterly com plains that count bismark should have preferred seeking the crowvn of tho duchies ab biarritz rather than zarakoselo perhaps it adds e russia would not have been altogether disinclined to in dulgo him  butof coursethe service could not have been rendered for nothinc and the russoprussian frontier would have required being rectified at the sametime were the golos in a position to write what it pleases or bad it been treated to an avis for offending the permanent aly of the czar the menace umplied in these words would have at tracted less attention than i perceive is paid to it it is true berlin folks make light of the threat the french and prussian governments being more capable of realizing their plans inthe teeth of russia than a rtussoprussian league would be of ignoring the opposition of france  but the mere fact that such a thi coull be published in a minisiieael orgau aa oz rtersburg and that tto years after this government engaged to support russia aud polad against all the world isan event in itself it rea y seems as though those farsighted oiticians are m the right who perceiving that russia has no temitory to cede to russia were always of opinion thatbf a bold and grasp ing

these fond hopes and expectations were suddenly disappointed by a royal order published yesterday it is a long story but i lill try to teu it as briefly as possible when tho revolutionary extravagance

down the rules for the election of others by the nobility however it was not in the spirit of the then cabinet to allow any limitation of the royal prerogative which could be possibly evaded anad thus the act providing for the election of peers  by ancient families in the possession of the same estates for a hundred years and upwards contained a quiet little corollary to the effect that the king reserved to himself the riglht to modify this particular portion oe the decree the lower house although its proviso had just beon virtually set aside had nothing to say against the enactment of royal

oldenburg in which he ceded to him those claims which he said had reverted to himself on the cessation of danish rule in the duchies the imperial letter and cession were then viewed favourably by this government and looked upon as one reason anmong many others why the title of the augustenburg branch should not bo recognized at once and indeed must be tested by the strictest examination of the
