houoway furz was foroman said the number of prisoners for trial was about the usual averago considering the interval which bad elapsea since the holding of the last sexsion nor was there anything unusuallyscrious in the character of the offeuces it was probable the proe sent sesmion would be a prolonged one  bat that would not hbave the efrect of detaining the grand jury beyond the time they were ordinarily engaged in tho discharge of their daties some cases however had stood over from former sessions and these mnuse necesarily occupy a lengthened in vestigation thero wero only a few of the offences which it was necesgary to comment upon because no doubt thb grand jury were fully nequaintec with tho nature of the duties required of tbem they had merelv to see whether or not tho several prisoners should bo put upon their trial before a petty jury or in other words whether a prirnu focie case was mado out for a more particular in qumry to be instihtted in open court and supposing they should think on an cz prte hearing that there was not such a case a to render it probable a trial would end in a conviction they would fidd  no billh there was happily only one case in the calendar which in volved the loss of human life and that clarged a maia namted wiuiam belcher with mnanslaughter he was at a time when he was believed to be in liquor driving a horse and cart along the bustonrond and one of his shafts struck a woman who was crossing at the moenont and knocked her down au omnibus was coming elong the read at a proper pace and the woman baving been suddenly knocked down ln front of that vehicle one of its wheels passed over her and theroby caused her death if her fall were the result of careless and culpable negligence then it would he tho duty of the grna jury to find a true bill and if before the pettv jury the prisoner should bo found guilty the extent of his punishment woald depend upon the degree of carelessness and noxegence he had shown there was a charge against janies murphy of having fe lonioualy wounded mary ann jeunings a barmaid vith intent to murder her the prisoner at tho time he committed this assaultwas the sweetheart of the prose cutrix she became dissatisfied with his conduct and was anxious to break off the connection with him he was quito awaro of thisandheappeareddetermineatoresentit becauso ho waited for her in the neighboarhood of coventgarden caught hold of her as she was going into the publichouse where she acted as barmaid threw her down on the ground and cut her throat the wound was serious sevora of tho arteries in the neck having been divided but the medical man was of opinion that the injury was not a dangorous one to life and sho was now going on well the charge as already sald was one of assault wnitb intent to commit mur der the grand jury would hear what thoprisoner said and did and they would judge for themselves whether the at tempt was made to deprive herof life if thev should thinkit wasso made they wodfnd a truebil andifthepetty jury should arrivo at tho conclusion that he did not intend to produce so serious a result as that of death they would find a verdict upon the lesser count in the indictment these two were tho only cases in the calendar which involved the loss of life and the attempt to take away life there was a very serious caso against a gentleman of position and a me cal mran besides named hunter for a apo upon one of his patients which would require the cautious considera tion of tho grand jury nothing more serious than such a charge against a medicat man could well he preferred and while there was nothing more easy to advance there was at  asg muore oulcult to negative the evidence on tho part of the prosecution mainly if notwholly depended uopon the womlan herself sh ha been suffering from some dimeae of the lungs ana she con sulted kjr or as be wlas called dr hrunter and heir statement was that inil of a sfudden when she vas sitting in his roouil for patients sbe found him in the act of having connexion with her undoubtedly there was something peculiar in tile account she gave it was impos sible not to see that it was a verv extraordinary one it apeared that she went away after the occurrence that slhe did not make any complaiut and that there wasanot the least disturbanco or noise mnade at the time end no outcry it was upon these facts the graend jury would have to determine and certainly they were facts which were quite suffi cien ia themselves to awaken extreme caution at the sami time the mnatter was so momentous there being nothing which could exceed the importauce of an investiga tion into sucoh circumstances that perhaps the grand jury would thinkc it advisable even for dr hunters own sake to find a true bill and thereby enable him if he could publich to exonerate hi if fromn so serious an aaelation thcy would probably think that for the sake of a� partiesdr huinter on the one band and the publio on the otherthe matter shlouldi come before a petty jury in order that there might he a full and gatisfactory investi gation after alluding to some cases of indecent assault in the calendar the commonscejeant proceededl to observe that there were some chiarges of fraud and conspiracy which woutld occutpy attention at these sessions twio personis namned hall andl lofouracade were aid to be connected with a case of which the grand jury must have heard a good cleal of latethat of m adame valentin the charge egainsti hall and lafourcade was that they had oouspired together to impoverish the proeccutrix bt sun processes of law against her and imprisoning her hall was ana attorney in london and lafeurcado went and gave him tome information an agreement was made between them that a sum of sol should be loaged in a bank and that lafourcadersbouldagive such information is he represented be was possmsed of touching certan french railwa shares of which he alleged maaame valentin was illegallypossessed the object belfg that hall should obtan all the benefit arising from these shares being talken eus of herbhands then theangreement wentontoasay that ifthe wholeof the shares shouldi be recoveredl the  wvas to belong to lafourcade that if a smaller sum thai the whole was recovered a correspondling porio of the  was to belong to him  hut that if nothing was reooveredl he was not to take any portion of thst amnount upon this agreement being entered into madame valentin was sent to whitesrossstreet and many things were done to disposess her of the shares tlhe question for the grand jury was net whether these were right stepst for hall to take but whether this was a con iracy hall being an alttorney andi being moreover cmpleyed for the purpose of prsoccutina felony and of recovering proceeds said to be unjustly o tained would no doubt consideor it his duty to procure all the informnation heo psibly could to forwvard the interests of his client if all he did was merely that of going beyondi the office of an attorney anud rather taldug upoa himself that of a detective then he would not he guilty of a conspirncy because conspiracy implieda a corrupt motive hut if the grand jury sholdhe of opinion that he eon spired wvith lasfoureade to injure and oppress this lady thien he would he guilty of a conspiracy lint the whole of the circumstancesbearing upo thispoint would have to becare fully looked into wit the view of seeing whether he wvas actuated bond jldc or mauhjldc and indeed this was the only question in the case to consider there was another charge of conspiracy against a father and son and the con spiracy here alleged was that they bad giveni a false charac ter whereby a person had obtained a situation in a publie house anud no sooner get there than ho commenced robbing the landlorda species of robbery which it wvas said he had previously practised at another publichouse to the knw tde ofh prisoners then there w as a charge
