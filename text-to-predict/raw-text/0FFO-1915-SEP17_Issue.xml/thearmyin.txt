the army in parliamentmr asquiths figures lord kitchenersadmissionsby our mlitary correspondentthe debates which took place in the two rouses of parliament on wednesday last can only be jrcgarded as an introduction to tho dis eussin which must arise when tho cabinet having at length come to an agrcement on the vitalsubject which  has not esciiped their attention will comeout into the open and tell the public the wholo truth on the subject of re cruiting apd our future needsi mr asquites fcigumswhat is the precise mcaning of the prime ministers reference to the numbers at present available a re placed the figurcs at an aggre gate ofnotfar short of three millions of men firstahnd lastwho haveoffered themselves to the country thofigexisfaargo one and whatcvcr rcservatins may have to be made about it there is no lquestion that every one from lord bitchener down tothe huinblest agent of recruitingservice has wvorked hard and that the country has responded tothe call for men in a magnificent andunprecedcntrd mannerif we desire toaiscertaintho exact meaning of these figures weomusthowever examine them a littie more losely the gross total is of thoso who  havooffered themselves  is it the figure of the wouldbe recruits or f those passed fit for scrice and actually incorporated  does it include or does it not include those who have joined and havo had tobc discharged within three months as unlikely to become efficient soliirs  there issome uncertainty on this point and mr asquith will do well to remove it the primeminister also reaches his total by adding to men whio were serving or wero called up to serve in the navy and the army at the outbreak of the war those who have since enlisted in both services in order to ascertain the total number ofrecruitstaken for the army sinco the war began we must deduct somo  serving sbldiers given oni p  of the army estimatesfor andthe  men of thonav at the present date these are only round figures but they show that the recruits for the army who have offered themselves must be  not far short  of tvo millions instead of three from the total army figures of  or thereabouts we have further to deduct a per manent loss of  or so out of the  casualties incurred up to august   leaving a net total of  or say  after reckoning in the sicl it is to be presumed that the figures will be analysed clopely on some future occasion but this is tho nearest that we can corme to them on the data supplied by tho primo minister and on figures already publishedthe question thon arises how many are engaged in our different campaigns now in pro gross wliether tllese niunbers are enough for victory and whlat drafts will bo needed to maintain in the field the numbers contemplated by tho government for tho year   the journal des dbiafs lias recently announced that our aggregate strongth in franco is a million men and we have no particular roason to quarrel with this figure it must at the same time bb remembered that out of each division of  men in the aggregate thero are only  bayonets at the most and that an aggregate of a million doos not moan a million inbn in the fihting lino a general is fortunate if with a miltion men in the aggregate ho can use half a million bayonets at the front a million men in the aggregato roquir over a million men for drafts in the courso of a year considerably over for the infantry require drafts of  per cent according to the present rate of wastage and it is difficult to understand why captain guests statement on this subject surprised some members of the rouse of com monsif we therefore possess at the very outside estimate  men if we have a million men in france and require at least a million men to give them drafts if wve have a need of f men for homne dofenceand if ivohavo also to maintain a largo armnyat tho dardanelles and to make good its heavy losss wo are ovidently not in a brilliant position oven if wo place to the credit side of our account the indian army corps and the dominion troopswbhich were probably excluded from the prime ministors totals thema is further the vory vital question whether a uiaillioni men in fraicolis enough or wheotherthis figure should not bo doubled and our divisions in the field increased to  in numberthe state of rciurtnjinthe mystery which has for so long cn shrouded au this question of nximbers and recruiting retiurns and the inability of the cabinet to realize our needs and take the publlc into their confidence must be held to be the primary causes of the present crisis of numbers the public are utterly wvithout responsibility in the matter and it is only now two days after the last misleading and inaccurate statement on the subject by mir harcourt that the prime minister and lord kitchener come forward to reveal a little of tho truthwe are told at last that the prime minister regrets to ay  that the figures of recruiting during the last few weeks show signs au falling off the secretary for war is a trifle more definite he declares that every effort has been made to obtain our requirements under the present system that the provision to keep up our strengths in   has caused us anxious thought whichhas been accentuated and rendered more pressing by tho recent falling off in the numbers coming forward to enlist  and that in order to mnaintaiin the strength of our armies  we shall require a large addition to the numbers of recruits joiningthus tiirdily are we told the truth or at least a fraction of it but we lhavo still to bo told whether our numbers in the field are enough whether strcngths are below o stablishments and by how much whether the monthly intake of recruitsis now only tho half of otur needs or bears some other proportton to them
