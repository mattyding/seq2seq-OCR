british airmenin gallipolinoonday nightmare l of thie turkbyewitnesss storythe hawk and itspreyf we publish below extractsfrom the brilliant tloarrative of the campaign in gallipoli as seen from the teurkish side which mr arthur ruhl is contridtting to colliers weekly o the strength of his personal rcxperiences in the peninsulain the present article mr ruhl describes a visit to the turkish lines at the southernend of the penirnsula where he was the guest of shukri bey colonel in command of the  local turkish forces during the courseof this visit lr ruhl shared with his ttrkish whosts the sensation of being under te bombs of a british acroplaneby abthub ruri the allies foothold here was much wider than that at ari burnu in the genoral land ing operations of april  and  one force swas sent ashore in a large collier from which after she was beached the men poured across anchored lighters to the shorethe english and french had established themselves in sedd el ahr itself and along tho cliffs on either side this position was strengthened during the weeks idf fighting which followed until they appeared to bo pretty firmly fixed on the end of the peninsula with a front running clean across st in a general northwest line several idlo netres in from the point the valley we had just left was about seven miles from sedd el bahr and the plateau across which we were walking led on the right up to a ridge from hvhich one could look down on the whole battle iield or to the left straight down into the battle itselfan everyday scenewe could see the end of the peninsula whero the coast curves round from eski hissarlik toward sedd el bahr and two of the enemys cruisers steaming slowly back and forth under the cliffs firing presumably as they steamed now they wero hidden under the shore now they came in view and opposit eski his sarlik swung roun  and steamed west again iri front of us just over the edge of the plateau which there began to slope downward wore the trenches of the turks left wing now under bombardment the ridgo just hid the sheus as they struck hut we could see the smoke from each now a tall black column like thejack johnsons  of tho west now a yellowish loud that hung long afterward like fogand with it the continuous rattle of infantry fire soveral flyers wera creeping about far up against tho blue looking for just such hidden batteries as that which kept barking behind us and out in front and to the right came the ionv brrummn  of heavy gunsfighting like this had been going on for weeks the ships having the advantage of their big guns by day tho turks recovering them selves apparently at night they wero on their own grounda succession of ridges one behind the otherand they could not only always see but generally looked down on an enemy who could not generally see them and the enemys men supplies perhaps even his waterfor this is a dry country at all times but after june there are almost no tainsmust come from his shipsthe sun was shining level down the road as we returned to camp and soldiers were still tramping peacefuij up to the front with their kettles of food   the first alaiimi awole shortly after daylight thinking i icard anaeroplane strumming in the distance and was drowsily wondoring whether or not it was fancy wheoa a crash echoed up tho valloy we both hurried out it wvas sunup a delicious ynorning and far up against tho southern sky the little speck was sailing back toward tho west there was a flash of silver just under the flyerit was an english biplaneand a inornent later another crash further away either did any damagea few minutes later we wero looking at the semains of the bomb and propellorlike wvings whose whirling as it falls opens a valve that causes it to explode on strildng its markjntil it had fallen a certain number of metres i nere striking the ground would not explode ita device to protect the airman in case of tccident to his machine or if lie is forced to inake a quick landingin the fresh still morning with the camp ustwaking up and the curious turkish curry combs clinldng away over by the tethered horses otur aerial visitor added only a pleasant excitement to this life in the open and wo went on withl our dressing with great satisfac tion little dreaming hiow soon lwe were to look pt one of those little flying specks quite differentlyuncomplaining fatalistse breakfasted with the colonet in his arbotir on bread and ripe olives and tea and walked vith him round the camp through a hospital ind into an old farmhouse yard where the gunsmiths wvere going over stacks of captared guns and damaged rifles of the wourded while the bees left behind in some clumsy old box hives buzzed away as of yore aviser than men the colonel observed there wero english enfields and french rifles of the early nineties and a mitrailleuse to wlhich the turks had fitted a now wooden base thore were rifles witli smashed barrels with stocks bored through by bullets cleancut holes that must have gono on through the men who held themlive men liko ourselves quick choldng instants of terror the ghosts of which we were poking and peering into there in the warm sunshine  we said goodbye to the colonel for our masses took us but to tho valley ando had stretched a point in sending us down the plateau the evening before the boat wve vent by was the saine littlo paddle steamer wo had come down o crowded with wvounded now mudstainedbloodstained just as thoy had come from the trenches across the water with no place to lio but tho bare deck the stifling hold was packed with them they curled up about the eogineroom gratingfor it was cold that ntightyet there was no complaint a tired gh now and then a moan of weariness and ho soldier wrapped his army overcoat a little blosor about him curled ilp like a dog on a doormat and left tho rest to fate a big round yellown moon climbed up out of asia end poured its silver down on them and on the black hills and water stiu as some inland laketho littlo steamer tied up at akbash for the fight and it was not until the middle of the niext moyning that it was decided that she should cross and leav her wounded at lapsaki instead of going qn up to constantinople we lugged our baggege oft add hurnted up our old friendthe hamburgamerican captain to see wvhat might be done till some other craft appearedfinally we went aboatd a sort of enlarged tug which might be going up that afternoon or eveninga miidday visrronit was about midday the sun blazing down on tlle crowded flat on boxes sacks steve dores wrapped up in all tho variegated rags of the east shuffling in and out of the sliips on gangs digging piling lumber boiling water cooking soup officers in brown uniforms and brown lambswool caps on horses ox teams and a vast herd of sheep which had just poured out of a transport and spread over the plain when from the hill came two shots of warningthe gangs scattered like waterbugs when a stone is thrown into the wrater they ran for the hill dropped into trenches to the beach and threw themselves flat on the sand into the waterall as they ran looking over their shoulders to where far overhead whirred steadily nearer that tiny terrible hawka hidden battery roared andpop a little puff of cotton floated in the slky under the approaching flyer another and anothor all the nervous little batteries in the hills round about were coming to our rescue the bird man safely above them drew on without flinching we had looked up at aeroplanes many times bofore and watched the pretty chase of the shrapnel and we leaned out from undor the awning to keep the thing in view  look i said  shes coming right over us  and then all at once there was a crash a concussion that hit the oar liko a blow a geyser of smoke and dust and stones out on the flat in front of us througlh tho smoke i saw a horse with its pack undone and flopping under its belly trotting round with the wild aimlessness of horses in the bull ring after they have beon gored mnien were running and in a tangle of wagons half a dozen oxen on the ground wore giving a few spasmodic kicksmon streaked up from the engineroom and across the wharfaftor all the wharf would be the thing hod try forand i found myself out on the flat with them just as there came another crash but this time over by the barbarossa across tho bay black smoke was pouring from the turlish cruiser as she got under way and with tho shrapnel puffs chasing hopelessly after tho flyer swung to the south ward and out of sightte two anxmofficers wore galloping about youing orders over in the dust where the bomb had struck a man was sawing furiously away at the throats of the oxen there were seven of thom and thero would be plenty of beef in camp that night at any rate there was a dead horse two badly wounded men and looft away a man lying on his face hatless just as lie had been blown thoro dead or as good as deedit appeared that two airmen lad come from opposits directions and most of the crowd had seen but the one while the other droppd the bomb it had struck just outside thebusiest part of the camp aimed very likely attho stores piled there it lied made a hole only five or sib feet wide and three or fouir feet deepbut it had blown evorything in the neighbour hood out from it as the captain had said holesyou could put your fist in wore torn in the flanks of the oxen and tho tires of soene of the wagons sixty or soventy feet away had been cut through liko waxwith a curious senso that the bottom had somehow fallen out of thingseven tho blue above was traachorousand that ono of those things which only happen to other people not only could but was going to happen to us right here and now we watched the men goback to work and the afternoon wear qn we even went for a swimthe rude bountnrnowenat every unexpected noise one looked utpwardand when about  oclock tho crqvwd scattored again i will confess that i watched that littlospeck buzzing nearer on a line that vould bring him straight overhead with an inter est coniiderably less casual than any i had bestowed on these birds  before there wewere confined in our little ampihitheatre thero was that diabolical bird peering dowln at us and in another minute somewhere in that space would come that earthshaking explosion q mingling of crasl and whaiq l there was no escaping it no dodging it nothing to got under but empty airi had decided that the beach about a hundred yards away from the wharves vas the safestplace and hurried there but the speck over head as if anticipating me seemed to beaiming for the precise spot it is difficult under such circumstances to sit tight reasoning calmly that after all the chances of the bombs not landing exactly there are a good many to oneyou demand at least tho ostrichlikesatis faction of havfig something overhead so i scurried over to the left to get out from under what seemed his line of flight when what should he do but begin to tiurn  this was really rubbing it in a bit to fly across as hehad that morning was one thing but to pen one up in a nice little pocket in the hills and then on a radius of three or four thousand yards circle round over ones headanything yet devised by the hiunan nightmare wvas crude and inmnature to thiswas it overhad  no behind but it was travelling at  or  miles an hour and thebomb would carry forwardjust enough pro  bably to bring it over and if over still the bomb would be several seconds in fallingit might be right on top of us now should we run backward or forward  here was a place in between some grain bags but the grainbags were open towvard the wharf and the wharf was what lie was aiming at and a plank blown through you no the trench was the thing but quick he is overheadthe beach the bags the ditch all the way round the camp was ever anything m ore inglorious  somewhere in the middle of it ahideous wlhiffling wail came down the sky trrot     trrou    trou and then a crash the bomb had hit the water just off the end of the pier i kept on running therewas another tprro    trron  another geyser of water and the bird had flowvn onback to stambouri wvas on the edge of th c eamp by this time and that strange afternoon ended when one of agang of ditch diggers swvathed in bright coloured rags addressed me a greekturk from the island of mlarmara who climbing out of the trench in which he and his gang hadbeen hiding announced that ho had lived in new york for five years in fortieth street and worked for the morgan line and beggedthat i get him out of this nerveracking place and where he belonged somewhere on board ship there wore crowds like himgreeksarmenians turks not wanted as soldiers but impressed for this sort of work they were unloading firewood long after dark that night when our boat at last got under way we paused till sunup at lapsald crept close toshore through the marmara and once through floating wreckageboards and a galvanized iron gasoline tank left by a submarineand after dark with lights out as we had started round the corner of stamboul
