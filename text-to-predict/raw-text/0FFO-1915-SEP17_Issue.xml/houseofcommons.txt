about lo tons a week a reduction in the charges might be ex pected to result in a further large increase in the number and weight of parccls sent and even if the difficulties of carriage by sea and

save a great deal of the present huge expenditure on thewar by adopting a change in our national systemand he protested against the charge that those who wished to raise this question were guilty of splitting the nation unity particularly in time of war was highly desirable but if unity meant persistence in a system which they believed was leading straight to disaster and that the system must be maintained until all agreed to thango it unity of that kind might be too dearly bought if unity meant that they were all to agree to go cheer fully to the devil together whatever charm that course might have from the point of view of sociat bihty be thought that on a matter of this import ance total disagreement would be preferable thoso who advocated a change in our national system were convinced that if no change were made now the piti less logic of events would in the course of a few months force every man who cared for his country to accept a change in the meantime while they were hesitatng huge sums of money were being wasted greater commitments were being incurred and priceless time was being lostmiary oprmoit and ndsit was essential that the change should be justified on the ground of military necessity and this was one of those rare casas in which military necessity harmo nized wvith financial prudence having becn serving abroad for the last year and having had mdny

preserving the spen valley from some of the aftlictions which had fallen upon unhappy belgium cheersand were enabling the right hon gentleman to sleep comfortably in his bed they ought to be permitted to express their views with out being chided in what he thought to be a most patronizing and offensive fashion cheers the present system was in all essentials rapidly becoming a system of compulsion in peculiarly odious and unjust forms and it was roping in as many un walling soldiers or at least men who had no natural impulse towards soldiering as would a system of com pulsory national service and that it was not pro ducing satisfactory results either as regards numbers or from his own experience as regards in many cases fresh drafts for the purposes of reinforcements he felt almost bound to make a retraction not for what lie said but thought a year ago he frankly did not believe it was possible that anv man or any system could produce in such a short time such magnificent units that made up the new arjies they made a tremendous impression on their arrival at the front hear hear there is no credit too great that could be paid to lord kiteclener for his foresight and achievements in that direction he was not referring to the original manning of the new army but to the question of drafts for a regular army in the field for the forces already there and what he said was that owing to tle fact that the supply of these splendid men had dried up or was in process of being dried up under the voluntary system the war office was being compelled to take men and send them out as drafts who were not physically fit for the arduous work of the campaign hel had seen hundreds of men sent out as drafts who owing to their age and physical infirmities were not fit for the work of the campalgn and they had had to be sent back we neeed a system under which the government could select men who might be perfectly fit for industrial work but notforsoldiering in the field and to replace them by younger men who would be able totake their part in field operations hear bear insufficient weight he thought was being given by the house and by the country to the immense moral effect that would be produced by a change in our system and on the ground of our fancial position he thought a change wvas imperatively necessarytine alleged newspapesc conspmacythe discussion at the trades union

should not fail to express their opinions and they cauld only hope that the government if they would not lead might be ready to follow the largest voicea labour memibers warningir thmas derby lab said tho national service party would not trust the government they wanted to put every one else under how then could they expect the great mass of working men to place themselves unreserveday at the disposal of thc govcrnm ent p hcar hear labour could not get out oftheir minds the suspicion that one of the primary objects of the advocates of national service as declared in the carly stages of the campaign was cheap soldiers expressions of dissent working men anyhow could not be blamed if they had that suspicion he contrasted the depressing accounts of the military situation by the champions of compulsion with the statement of lord kitchener in the house of lords who painted no such gloomy pictures from the mining industry as the select ommittc had reported it would be dangerous for another man to go and there was lho same evidence with regard to the railways and agriculture the evidence supplied to the select committee was that there was a shogtage of  in agriculture in munitions  more men were required imme diately until therefore a responsible minister told the house the cxact position labour would not be dragged at the heel of a press campaign he presumed members who wercadvocating this policy genuinely believed it would help the war he was speaking under restraint having regard to the railway situation although he made optimistic speeches and gave the best advico he could to the mcn he was not unmindful of the tremendous unrest in the country he begged of those who were advo catingnational service to realize what would happcnrailway stoppsaog as a piiotestin his own organization nearly every branch had not only passed a resolution against conscription but had indicated to the executive committee that at its introduction they would stop the trades union congress passed their resolution unanimously and if the munitions act could not be put into opeation against  men what would happen when the men numbered three millions  supposing the system were appled to the railways tomorrow would the minister say what railwaymen were to join the forces a if so the railways would decline re sponsibility should the rmilways make the selection they would be believed to be taking advantage of it to get rid of prominent union men that was the sort of difficulty that had constantly to be met ie and others were striving and working for peace if hehad merely to consider his personal position and health he would resign his office tomorrow but he stuck to his post because he believed they had to take a national view and recognized a national obligation but lie was not unmindful of the dangers which existeddid hon members who favoured compulsion want an inconclusive peace  did they want a settlement necessitated by industrial trouble p the sentiment of the tradeunion movement was absolutely against tlem it was suspicious of them cheers was the itner meaning of this matter a desire to remove the prime minister  nobody probably had dis agreed with the prime minister more than the occu eants of the labour benches but they sraid in this hour of the nations crisis that lie could not be re placed general cheers if hon members meant those cheers let them act accordingly he was genuincly anxious to win the war yle had said and would continue tosay to the workers that they had got to subordinate their personal or sectional interests to the interests of the nation if the war was to be brought to a successful conclusion was it likely to bc done by splitting the unity of the nation  if advo cates of compulsion forced and won an election what would happen  did they thinki that the minority who felt deeply on this questiohi would not imme diately set to work to make their voices felt  did thley think that with an increased cost of living of  per cent falling on thousands of men who could hardly exist that this winter the whole our atten tion would not be required to keep the peace in this country  he appealed to members not to mini mize the dangerthreat of an industrial revolutionthe ilrst day this principle was introduced the government would have to deal not with compul sory service but perhaps unfortunately with indus trial revolution that was not the way to win the war cheers if the voluntary system had failed it would not have really been tho failure of volun taryism what efforts had been made to kill it i lord kitchener had said that the voluntary system bad not only justified itself but that it was marvellous that morning the daild miail placard had the line litchener on the fallure oft recruiting cheers and counterchecrs working men noted these things if intrigue was at the bottoni of this he asked those who had engaged in it to halt before they went too far if however the only object was to wvin the war and he believed that was the case with members let them not hide from themselves the overwhelm ing feeling of tle mmasses the worker felt that he was giving his life to crush german militarism lhe was not however blind to the fact that there were those in this country whlo would like to see mili tarism established and would be ns dangerous as the german militarists cheers ile urged members to realize the difficulties in the labour movement and to give thoso who were strivin f or peace a helping hand then they would be able to defeat militarism and all it stood for serious and vague

cave had heard tho speeches of mr asquith and lord kitchener and they had satis fied him that tho government were giving their earnest and urgent consideration to the question the main point was the question of rcruitin they woer told that recruits were necessary but were no longer coming in that was the whole a lrmativeon the question this war must be won on land as well as on sea in order to win on land we must have an army not less than we had today some people said more but of that he was not a judgetho wastage was greater than in any previous war and that could only be made up by fresh troops the only point to determine was whether they could get by the present system recruits to  the vacancies they were told that the troops were no longer comugin at the old rate could they looking forward for sixs months or longer say with certainty that ilic nmmber of recruiits by that time would be s tlicient for the purpose for which thqy were neededpan hon  mmzmencan you say they wont fr
