the bill was last before the house the debate on the second reading was adjourned against the wishes of the government who desired to see the bil at once put into operation happily do one had suffered by the delay the chief points to which the critics of the bill objected were the size and conposition of the central statutory committee which was to be the final authority for dealing with pensions and allowance the representation upon that conunittee of tlhe voluntary societies which had been engaged upon the work in the past the size and com position of the local committees by whom the work

allow a mcasure of such farreaching importance to be read a second time in silence when it lacked the one element that could male it a successnamely adequate financethe governmients pledgesthe darquess of lansdowne said that he lad regretted the postponement of the bill nt so much on account of an expectation that any persons vwould suffer greatly through the delay although therc was a chance that something of the kind might occur as on account of the possibility that the action of the house in refusing to give a second reading to the bill miglht give rise to that kind of misrepresenta tion to which their lordships house had so often been exposed lord devonport had complained very bitterly of the finance of the measure or as he would say the absence of adequate financial backing the whole scheme was founded upon the assumption that the grants andallowances were to he derived partly from privatc sources and partly from the exchequer it was now of course impossible to say to vhat extent it would be possible to rely on private benevo lence upon wvhich there had been so many calls there was therefore an unknown quantity in the calculation but as to the provision from the ex chequer the language of the chancellor of the ex chequer and of other members of the government had been sulliciently explicit mr mckcnna had told the house of commons that to whatever extent might be necessary tlle shortcomings of private effort would be supplemented from public funds this assurance he repeated the gaveriimcnt would see to it that the necessary funds would be forth coming for the purposes of the bill the pledges of the government could not therefore be regarded as worthless he had never thouht that in any part of the house there was any feeling of hostility to the measure hear hear the feeling that prevailed was one of strong objection to passing the bill in the very short space of time between the first reading and the holiday adjounrament the
