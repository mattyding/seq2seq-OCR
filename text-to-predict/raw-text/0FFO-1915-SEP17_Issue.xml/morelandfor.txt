agriculturists of the counties of somerset dorset gloucester hereford mlonmouth warwick wiorcester and wrilts convened by mr henry hobhouse chairman of the somerset county council at his request to consider tho position of agri culture in this country and the steps to be taken to increase the production of food during tho war le explained in detail his scheme for the establishment of local committees to get into touch with and advise farmers to this end and advocated an increase of arble landlord s mnonss sid that the history of england was the history of the land and at this moment of great crisis in the bistory of england he came to them in the west who lived by the land to ask them to help the king and england now by pro ducing in the coming year of great difficulty not less food but more food it must necessarily be a wise precautionfor any country at war to produce au the food itcould within its own borders during the war and if it were not for the shield which the navy threw over us it would bo also a vito matter agriculturists should produce much more food in england than they bad done in the past niothing farners could do in the next year would enable england to be fed entirely by the produce of england nevertheless if they coald produce more food here in the coming year they would be making a very great contribution to the struggleau extra production owing to which goods could be sent across the atlantic would be to our advantage but of the two other ways of overcoming the difriculty ono was rigorously to cut down our consumption of every article not absolutely necessary which was im ported from america and the other was to produce in england food that would otherwise have to be bought in america as this would be a contribution towards our victory he did not expect the farmers to make any sacrifices which he would not call upon any other englishman to make farmers were going to pay very heavy taxes he did not ask them to diminish their capital or to spend money which as sensible men of business they thought was more likely to dimivish than increase their capital lie did not come to them as philanthropists but as men of business fired with patriotism vhile he did not ask them to sacriflce their capitl he did ask them to sacriflce their leisure their pleasant convenience customs and habitsnsov volunrary assocritionsfeeling that it was incumbent on him on his part to help the farmers when he asked them to do this he souglht some organization in touch with farmers and able to bring them into connexion with the board of agriculture he therefore vsked the county coundls to appoint county war agricultural committees they would not be in any sense statutory committees they would have no powers conferred by law they would be only voluntary associations for anational purpose in time of crisis he would next ask the county war agricultural committees to establish local committees from the area of every district council apd urban district council when the urban district council included any appreciable amount of agricultural lands he hoped the expenditure on this machinery would not be large he was not going to ask them to make any contribution from tlc rates wlhatever the machinery might cost within reasonable limits of which they must permit him to be the judge would be discharged by the national exchequer they must not suppose that meant that they could spend anythiing they liked and that the chancellor of the exchequecr would foot the bill he was going to ask the county councils when he put the whole scheme beforc them to make an estimate of what they thought the machinery of the scheme would cost in their county for the year whenhe had that estimate before him he would put the whole matter before the chancellor of the exchequer when he would be able to say how much money he woald be able to give if they spent more thin they were allowed they would have to find the difference themselveshe hoped the local committees would get into touch with a the parishes and farms within their rea they would very otten be able to give thn assistance and advice whfch the farmer or smallbolder with labourers might need otherwise they would report to the county committces which would deal with those reports and forward them to the board of agriculture either for information or so that the board miglht give that help which the county commiltee itself was not in a position to give in each group of counties connected with the pro vincial agriculural council there would be ono officer of the board of agriculture appointed who would be responsible for doing all he possibly could to assist the county cammittees in hiis group and kccp them in touch with the board of agriculture these comniittees nvould help by giving advico and assistance to farmers acns lass araulg ladhc found that there were today in england  fewer acres under clover and rotation grasses than ithere were in  and  acres fewer of other and under flc plough added together it showed that there were  acres less of arable land in england today than there were in  wvhat was nwanted in the present emergency was to increase the arablc land we wanted some of these long rotation grasses ploughed up soonr than they other wise would be and some of the inferior pasture ploughed nip he did not want the mere substittion of wheat for other crops without any increase of the plouglhed land tliurc was very little use in that blecause wheat was not the only thing in enland in  also there were  acres of fallow this was not a luxury we could afford this vearhe begged them to try and get back as far as ihey could to the land under plough in  they should plough not only for cereals but for macat what we wanted vas mcat bacon milk cheese wheat oats and potatoes he next a ppealed to women to belp the farmers and asked the farmers not to be so shy of making use of the womenhe asked the farmers to set an example to the trade unionists and he made the same appeal to the landlords he appealed to them to depart from customs in which they were rooted he asked the landlords to help the farmers in time of war bv relaxations if necessary for which there would be no necessity in times ofpeacc he asked the farmer to root himself out of his timelhonoured habits and customs and show england once more that in time of a great crisis lie could set an example which might save the country cheers
