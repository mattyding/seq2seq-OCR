they had bouglht and had become owners of goods consigned by the companies pvere for b the learned pre sident said that the lcgal qucstions which arose with regard to the real destination of the goods claimed by miessrs morris and co were identical with those arising in other clairms referring tc miessrs armour and cos claim he said that that colnpany before the war liad a subsidiary company armour and co aktieselskabat copenhagen as agents these agents it wvs said ha always had strict instructions from the claimants to confine their sales to denmark other scandinavian countries finland and russia and not to sell to any other countries the copenhagen oflice was small before the war the principal branch was at frankfort as to the copenhagen office not even the name of the manager vas given to the court no one from copenhagen favoured the court with any evidence the companys direct claim vas to nearly eight million pounds of foodstuffs when the amounts of their alleged vendees claims wvere added the total was over nine and a half million pounds that enormous quantity was consigned to their agents at copen hagen within one month ilow ame it to be sent  what were the instructions of the anonymous manager at the copenhagen office with reard to its disposal  with the exception of comparatively small quantities of casings canned beef and fatbaclus it was all lard of various qualities the average monthly quantity of lard exported from the united states to all scandinavia in october and november  was b a year later in about three weeks from october  to november   it is shown that this one company was shipping to copenhagen alone considerably more than  times that quantity the claim of messrs armour and co dated april   was made on the ground that the gooids were their property as neutrals shipped in neutral vesscl and consigned to neutrals at a neutral port and that the goods were not intended for sale to or use by or on behalf of an enemy government or the armed forces of an enemy the main evidence in support of the claim was an affidavit sworn may   by mr moeeker one of the vicepresidents and managers of armour and co germany was not named and thle impression conveyedj and clearly intended to be conveyed was that the goods were shipped and consigned for purely scandinavian business as if the wvar had not intervenedas to ihe shipment on the kim however there was this additional paragraphthe ss kim sailed from the wert of new york on november  find up till that time the claimants bad no knowielge whirtever of the order in council of the

had been notified to the american ambassador on october  and wvas published in new york on november his lordship then nmade references to and criticized further affidavits filed on behalf of the claimants he said that the claimants did not produce any letter telegram contract or any other document which had passed betwveen them and their agcnts in copenhagen touching any part of the enormous quanfities of goods shipped  and they did not produce one single book of account or commercial document of any kind kept by their agents in copenhagen dealingwith the goods claimedthe legal principlesthe learned president then dealt with the legal principles wlich are applicable to the cases accord ing to international law he said while the guiding principles of the law muslt be followed it is a truism to say that international law in order to bh adequate as well ns just must have regard to the cireumstances of tlie times including thie cireunistances arising out of the particular situation of the war or the condition of the parties engaged in it vide the jonge margatetta i ch tob d and chancellor kentg commentaries p  two important doctrines familiar to inter national law conmc prominently forward for considera tion the one is embodied in the rule as to  con tinuous voyage  or  continuous transportation the other relates to the ultimate hostile destination of conditional and absolute conitraband respectivelythe doctrine of  continuous voyalge  was first applicd by the english prize courts to unlawvful trading there is no reported case in our courts where the doctrine is applied in terms to the carriage of con traband but it was so applied and extended by the united states couuts agaiuist this country in the time of the american civil wvar and its application was acceded to by the british government of the day aind wa morcovor acted uaon by the international comnmission lwhich st under the treaty made at wvashington on may   when the commission composed of an italian an american and a british delegate unanimously disallowved the claims in the peterhoff  wall  vhich was the leading case upon the subject of continuous transporta tion in relation to contraband goods the other wellknowvn american casescy the stephen hart blatch pr case  the bermuda  wall  and the springbok p wall iconsidered and alfplied the doctrine in relation to attempted breaches of blockadethe doctrine was asserted by lord salisbury at the time of the south african wvar with referenee to german vessels carrying goods to delagoa bay add as he was dealing with germany he fortified himselt by referring to the view of llntschll as the true view as followsif the sbhip or rood are sent to the ietlnatlon of a neutrl port only the better to come to the ald of the eenly there will be onatea band ot wax and conlscation will be jlustiledit is essential to appreciate that the foundation of the law of contraband and the reason for the doctrine of continuous voyage which has been grafted intei it is the right of a belligerent to prevent certain goods from reaching the country of the cnemy for his military use neutral traders in their own interest set limits to the exercise of this right as far as they can thcsc conflicting interests of neutrals and belligerents arc the causes of the contests which have taken place upon the subject of contraband and continuous voyages a compromise was attempted by the london conference in the unratiaed declaration of londontse case o wabsolnute cona nandthe doctrino of continuous voyage or continuous transportation was conceded to the full bv the conference in the case of absolute contraband and it vwas expressly declared that it is im material ulhether the carriage of the goods is direct or entails transhipmeut or a subsequent transport by land as to conditional contraband the attempted compromise was that the doctrine was excluded in the caso of conditional contraband except where the enemy country had no scatoua as is usual in compromises there seerns to be anabsence ot logical reason for the exclusion if it is right that a belligerent should be permitted to cap ture absolute contraband proceeding by various voyages or transport with an ultimate destination for the enemy territory why should he not be allowedt capture goods twhecdthough not absolutely contraband become contraband by reason of a further destinttion of the enemy government or its armed fores  and w ith the faciliti es of tranlsportationby ea and by land wihich nob exist the right of a bellgerent to capture conditional ontraband would be of a very shadony value if a mere confignmtentt o a neutral port wero sumcient to protect the goodsit appears also to be obvious the in these days oteasy transit

voyage or ttans portation both in relation to carriage of contraband absolute and conditional by sea and overland had become patr of the law of nations at tho beinning of the present var in accordance wlth the principles of recognized legal decisloni and with thc vivew of the great body of modern jurists and also with thc practice of nations in recent maritime warfarethe result is that the court is not restricted in its vision to the primary consignment of the goods in these cases to the neutral port of copenhagen but is entitled and bound to take a more extended outlook in order to ascertain vhether this neutral destination was merely ostensiblc andif so what the real ultimate destination was as to the real destina tion of a cargo one of the chief tests is whether it was consigned to the neutral port to be there delivered for the purpose of being imported into the common stock of the country this test was applied over a century ago by sir william grant in the court of appeals in prize cases in tho case of thc william  ch rob  it was adopted by the united states supremo court in their unanimous judgment in the bermueda  lvall  vhere chief justice chase in delivering the judgment said  neutrals may convey in ncutral ships from one neutral port to another any goods whether contraband of war or not if intended for actual delivery at the port of destination nnd to become part of the common stock of the country or of the portanother circumstance which has been regarded ae important in determining the question of real or ostensible destination at the neutral port was the consignment  to order or assigns  without naming any consignee in the celebrated case of the springbok  wallace i the supreme court of the united sates acted upon inferences as to destination in the case of blockade on this very groundconsioxemts  to ordenthe same circumstance was also similarly dealt with in the bermuda  wall and in the peterlioff blatch p  and  wall at p  i am not unmindful of the argument that consignment  to order is common in these days but a similar argu ment was used in the springkok casc supported by the testimony of some of tlie principal brokers in londorn to thc effect that a consignment  to order or aissigns was the usual and regular form of consign ment to an agent for sale at such a port as nassau the british government was petitioned to intervenc for the shippers but upon thls point the british foreign office said that  no doubt the form was usual in time of peace but that a practice which might be perfectly regular in timc of peace under the municipal regulations of a particular state would not always satisfy the law of nations in time of wvar more particu ilrly wvhen the voyage might expose the ship to the visit of belligerent cruisersthe nrgument still remains good that if dltippers after the outbreak of war consign goods of thc nature of contraband to their own order without naming a consignee it may be a circumstance of suspicion in considering the question whether the goods were really intended for the neutral destina tion and to become part of the common stock of thc neutral country or wvhetlher they had another ultimatedestiration of course it is not conclusive the i suspicion arising from this form of consignment during vrar might be dispelled by evidence produced by the slippers it may be here observe d that some point was made that in many of the con signments the bills of lading were not made out  to order  simnlicitcr but to branches or agents of the shippers thatt circumstance does not in my opinion make any material diilencoupon this branch of the case for reasons which have been given when dealing witi the conignments generally and wvhen stating the circumstances with rcspect to each claim i have no hesitation in stating my conclusion that the cargoes other than the small portions acqiireil by persons in scandinavia whose claims are allowved were not drstined for consumption or use in denmark or intended to be ineorporated into the general stock of that country by sale pr otherwvise that copenhagen was not the real bena fidedetination  but that the cargoes were on their way at fhe time of capture to german territoiy as their actual aud real tiltimate destinationte onidelts in coincthe second branch oi the ease raises the question whether the good which i have decided were on their wxay to german territroy were destined further for the use of the german governmcnt or depart mcats os for military use by the troops or other persons actually cnaged in warlike operations or should be presumed to be so destined in the cir currstancesills lordship then considered th eeffect of two orders in council and said that lie had expressed iiis viewss on the general qoestion of the binding chiracter of orders in council upon theprize court in the case of the zanmora  the times law rleportsilhe went on to say that the effect of the order in counczl of october  was thalt in addition to the presumotions laid down in article  of the dclara tioni of loadon a picsumpion of enemy destination as lefineti by article  should be presumed to exist if the goods were consigned to or for an agent of the enemy state or to a persol in the enemy territorv  or if they are fconsigned  to order  or if the ships papers did not show ho the conrigne was but in the latter cises the owners mght if they were able prove that the destination wan irnocentall the goods claimed by the shippers in the iim were consigned to their own order or to the order of their agents which was the samc tlling and not to any independent consignee and they had all entirely failed to discharge the onus which lay upon them to prove that their destination was innocent ie wans of opinion that under the order in council the goods claimed by all the shippets in the kaim were confiscable as lawful prizetnmn destination op time c anorstho learned ptesident continuing said the question remains whether the real ultimate destina tion of the cargoes was for the use of tho gcrman government or its naval or military forcee if the goods were destined for germany what are the facts and the law hearing upon the question whether they lind the further hostile destination for tho german government for military use  they were destined for some of the nearest german ports whero sonte of the forces were quartered it is by no moans neces sary that the court should be able to fix tho exact port see the dolplhin  fed cas  the pearl  fed cas   wall   and the peterhoff  wall at p  regard must also he had to the state of things in gernmany during tbis war in relatior to the military forces and to the civil population and to the niethol described in evidence which wvs adopted by the governmient in order to procure sup plies for the forcesnow as to the question of the proof of intention on the part of the shippers of the cargoes it may be observ ed that it is not necessary that an intention at the beginning of the voyage should be established by the captors either absolutely or by inference in the bermuda the chief justice of the supreme court of the united states in referring to the decision of sir willhm grant in the william  ch rob  saidif thero be an intention either formed at the time of the oriinal sbhipment or aftermards to send the goods forward to an unawful destination the continuity of thc voyage will iiot be broken as to the cargo by any transctions at the intennediate dortit is no doubt incumbent upon the captors in the first instance to prove facts from wlhieh a reasonable interence of hostile destinatioin can be drawvn sub ject to rebuttal by the claimants so far as it is necessary to establish intention on the part of the shippers it appears to me to be beyond question that it ean beshown by inferences from surrounding eircum stances relating to the shipment of and dealings with the ioods     if at the time of the seizure thegoods were in fact on their vway to the enemy government or its forces as their real ultimate destination by the action of the shippers when ever their project was conceived or however it was to be carried out if in truth it is reasonably certain that the shippers must have known that that was the real destination of the goods apart of course from any genuine sale to be made at some intermediate place the belligerent had a right to stoa the goods on their way and to seize them as contiseaole goodsin the circumstances of these cases especially in view of the opportunity given to the claimants whho possessed the best and fullest knowledge of the facts to answer the cases made against them any fair tribunal hke a jury or an arbitrator whose duty it wvas to judge facts not only inight but almost cer tainly would come to the conclusion that at thc time of the seizure the goods which remained the property of the shippers wvere if not as to the whole at any rate as to a substantial proportion of them at tha time of seizure on their way to the enemy for his hostile uses the facts in these cuases in my opinion more than amply satisfy the  highly probable destina tion  spoken of bylord stowellhis lordship then referred to the opinion recentdy expressed by the hamburg prizo court in the case of the marlsp where goods consigned from the united states to irish ports were laden in a neutral dutch vessel he concludedfor thl many reason mwhicli have given i have come to the clear conclusion that thc cargoes claimed by the shippers as belonging to them at the time of scizure were not on their way to denmark to be incorporated into the common stock of that countryby consumption or bona file sale or otherwbise but that they vwere on their way not only to ocrbn territory but also to tho ctmax governwnent and their forces for naval and iilifm sao as their real ultimate destinationtie resultit only remains to conclude these long and trouble sem cases to state the rcsults va
