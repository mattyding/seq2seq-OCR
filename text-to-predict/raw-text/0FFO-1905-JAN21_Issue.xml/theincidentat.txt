the incident at thewinter palacemilitary plot suspectedst petersburg j a special commission under the presidency of lieutenantgeneral khitrovo commander of the artillery of the corps of guards has been appointed to investigate the origin of yesterdays incident at the winter palace the commission will be under the superintendence of the inspectorgeneral of artiuery the grand duke serge mikhaiovitehthe theory which appears to have been spread broadcast throughout europe that russia is face to face with an army plot is discounted by the trivial nature of the damage done it is pointed out that hadl the shell been fully charged it must have worked terrible havoc at the short range of less than a quarter of a mile opinions are divided as to whether the affair was accidental or intentional though they rathor preponderate in favour of the latter assumption but even so the discharge of shrapnel bullets by means of a saluting fuse is hardly consistent with the idea of an organized army conspiracythe following ofiicers were on duty yesterday with the first battery of the artillery brigade which fired the salute during the ceremony of the blessing of the neva captain davidof com manding the battery staff captain karzeff and lieutenants count kontaissoff porsbinosoff and miller the battery was composed of old muzzle loaxbin guns a rumour becamo current today that captain davidoff had been arrested and had committed suicide on inquiry it was found that the rumours in question were unfoundedstatement by a russian genrlmom our omw connewpondsparis jax it is impossible at this distance with the con flicting information to hand to form an opinion as to whether yesterdays untoward incident at the winter palace was due to accident or to design bnt admitting as correct the oticial version attributing it to accident it only fllr nishes fresh evidence that even among the guards there is deplorable disorder this much said it must however be recognized that the general tendency among the paris public is to believe in criminal design such too was at least the first impression of the st petersburg corre spondents of the paris papers before m gaston drtl snf the bczo de paris had received the official account which he seems to have accepted as correct he interviewed a general who was present at the ceremony at the winter palace the general saidyou know there are  strilkersatpresent in st petersburg disturbances are expected amontg the artillery of theguard which received orders to be prepared to march were distributed old shrapnel shells which aro now only used for prmetice one of these had been forgotten in one of the guns fortunately the charge of powder in the blank shells used for salutes is smallother wise a terrible accident might have happened there would have been numerous victims in the room where the corps diplomatique was present for the shrapnel instead of falling without much force on the ventilators soupi awv of the palace would have violently strack the faadem gaillard of the journal elicited the follow ingd statement from the french ambassador m bompardthe ambassadors did not think it was a ckbaiiali ntthik bat mhv v a eedentiroduced by a rocket fusie fired to give the signal for the salutes in any case if the emperor was at once aware that an attempt had been madethe imperturbable selfpossession which he displayed is astounding he was never more affable nor more master of himself never did the corps dplomatiqne ebnd him more unaffeetedly cordialberlin jail the extraordinary incident which took place at the blessing of the waters in st petersburg is all but universally interpreted here as an attack upon the person of the tsar of an unprecedented character the alternative explanation that the discharge of canistershot from one of the guns which was firing a salute was due to accident is regarded as too improbable even in the present unsatisfactory condition of the russian army moreover it is not believed that private soldiers who might have come under the influence of nihilists or revolutionaries could in ordinary circumstances have managed to substitute shot for a blank charge in one of the guns itis thought that officers musz have been concerned in the plot and this leads the natimalzeitung to suggest that the incident was a demonstration organized by the extreme reactionaries in order to intimidate the tsar and to alienate him from the reform policy of prince sviatopolkmirski the fall of the grand duke serge had according to this view convinced the reactionaries that power was slipping from their hands and that not a moment was to be lost it was only in the personal cntourage of the tsar and among the highest military officers that a plot of this extra ordinary nature could be batchedif this be the case the incident in the opinion of the national liberal organ will probably never be fully elucidated it is noted that the populace cheered the tsar on his waybackto tsarskoeseloand it is suggested that by steering a middle course between reactionaries and revolu tionaries it may still bepossible for the autocracy to appeal to the instincts of the russian people and to exhibit to the world the canistershot of january  as an  historical mistake
