the russian apmy aind tm e i peopletrv nym ktrpatrr in the published accounts of the accident or incident on the neva thlera is evidently some mistake since no such unit as the th horse artillery battery of the guard exists the guard horse artiulery consists of a single brigade of live batteries at present commanded by colonel masalsky and divided into two brigado divisions under colonels gasparini and baggo voot the explanation which attributes the discharge of a round of case to mischance is a reflection on the sobriety of the guard horse gunners since in no other circumstances could the russian kartech or case shot be mistaken for anything but what it is this pro jectile is a tin cylinder with a leather handle and contains  zinc balls each of which weighs something under oz and as its weight isb nobody save an individual in no condition to distinguish a havk from ahandsaw could possibly mistake it for a saluting chargewe stated a fortnight ago that the excesses which had been committed by mobilized troops had been of a far more serious nature than bad been alloweed to transpire and whatever the real explanation of the extraordinary affair of last thursday may be no one acquainted with the modern russian army would feel any surprise to find the artillery implicated in the ftrst serious movement of revoltthe russian artillery has always embodied the most intelligent elements of the yearly contingents and the general tone of the branch has been con sistently liberal if the higher ranks of the nobility who join the guards have better facili ties for education and are more iltted to shine in society the officers of the artillery monopolize the pick of the science and intelligence of the professional side of the army and they have been generally distinguished by liberal tendencies the poetrebel bonrad rylejev the two borisovs gorbatchevsky pestov colonels borstel and jentalzov with many other decembrists and more remarkable than all michael baktuin all served in the russian artilery and it is this branch from which wo slhould naturally eidect the first signal of revolt against the established order of thingsflut apart from this it is necessary to re member that the demands upon the russian population during the past year have been very heavy the contingent for  was fi ed at  men by a ukase of june  of last year a figure representing an increase of  men over the numbers for   whereas during the last  years the average increase of the con tingent has stood at about  meh in addi tion to this drain upon the people there have been the successive partial mobilizations number ing eight in all up to and inclusive of that of december  last to which we have already alluded out of the  recruiting districts all but  tave been already bled for men some once some twice and in a few cases even as many as thlree times the exact numbers taken for despatch to the east and to fill the place of units despatched from western garrisons cannot at present be given with the desirable accuracy but it would appear that out of an average of  available reserves in each district nearly onebhalf have been already withdrawn from the dlistricts affectedl by the mobilization orders the youngest classes have of course been taken first but it seems likely that the order of mobilization carried out last month affected a mnuch latger number of men than any previous order and that it has entailed the employment of an unusually high proportion of married men according to the writers information the number affected by the december mobilization was  which is more likely to be correct than the figuro of  given by foreign pro fessional journals and confessedly only arough approximationthese double demands of increased contingents and endless drains upon the reserves must neces sarily have a deplorable influence upon the population of russia and it is well known that mobilization during winter has a partieularly cruel effect upon the peasants since they have often to travel long distances to join their headquarters and generally find no means of restoring their treasured sheepskins or fur coats to their families these valable pos sessions are generally sold for a song to the local jew and only in rare instances are returned to the peasants family the unit of labour in russia from time immemorial has been a man a woman and a horse the removal of so many workinig hands must affect a scattered agri cultura community very seriously and as alevidence shows that the war grows more un popular every day there may be limits beyond which even russian autocracy cannot safely travelthis general disturance of the social life in algricultural centres has now been rendered more dangerous by an extension of the unrest to the manufacturing classes of st petersburg the wvorkmen of the oboukhoff foundry of the putiloff manufactory of tho lezner and stieglitz esta blishments and lastly of the neva dockyard are al out on strike and if the railway employas join in the movement a very grave national danger will confront the russian government the solidarity of labour in ltussia and the close attaechments between the workmen in the rural districts and the towns explain the sudden and notable outburst of something that already re sembles a general revolt and if the  men of the garrison of the capital are perfectly capable of suppressing an outbreak it is also necessary to remember that the st army corps of the garrison has been sent east and their place has been taken by reserve troops and that it has yet to be proved whether the army can be trusted to put down a movement which has a political eomplesion and is either openly or seeretly favoured by ninetenths of the russian peoplethose vho have seen a russian mob driven about like sheep by a couple of cossacks armed with nothing more formidable than the ngnaika or cossack whip may indeed doubt whether pussians have the genius of revolution but the liberal movement has been so rapid its dominance over opinion so markled and its effects sowvidespread thatno one will care to foretell the future or to affirm that the interests of a small and partly effete governing class are certain to overcome the desires the demands and the re sistance of a great people r z x  eartrquaxn snocx r conrwajla distinct shock of earthquakoe was felt at redruth early

what disturbed by finding that when it came to the practical work of education construction one found so many people who theoretically were all in favour of education but when they were wanted to put their hands iato their pockets or even to allow hands to be put into their localities pocklets they said  oh yes education must have money but do not take it from us local patriotism was a very good thing but they could not have a good education system without paying for itthey had inl that country a very completo system of ele mentary education but they wanted the edcationsl ladder whchreached from the elementary system up to the culmination of the educationai career in the univer sity to be complete that ladder ought to be within the reach of every one who was fit to use it if they vrere to male education better they could only do it by mans of the charsater and attainmonts of those who tauaht and they could only create those characters and attainments if they made the profession of
