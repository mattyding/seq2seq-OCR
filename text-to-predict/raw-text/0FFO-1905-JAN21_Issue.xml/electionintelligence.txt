just outside tho tonm onco granted to sir walter raleigh in his day of court favour are new tho headquarters of tbo w ing filoddigbys whose bonefactions last century helpad so much to completo tho restoration of tho abbey church of sherborno and the estimation in which this family is held throughout tho countryside accounts in a large measaro for the recent failures of the liberals to rocapture the seat which they filled from s until  whether liborals as well as conservatives voted for mr vvmgfeld digby as is allegod cannot of course be ascertained there is little doubt however that a

assured me tbat after giving sir randolf baler tho benefit of evory  doubtful  and dedacting  por cent from the absoluto promises to vote for mr wills the liberals could already depend pon securing a substantial majority in the shorborne pouing district and howent so far as to predict that on the polling day mir wills would be returned with a margin to tho good running into four figures i can obtain no trstwortay information show ing that such a tremendous upheaval is to be anticipated but tbat such things should be sad is sn indication of the hopeful spirit in which the liberals are conducting their campaign the number of electors in north dorset varies tory little from year to year in  it was  in   and now it stands at s the highest poll on record w as that of  when  per cent of those on the register voted four years ago the percentae was  seeing that the current register has been in force three weeks only and that for various reasons tho voting at a byelection is osually heavier than at a genoral election the poll ought this time to reach something lime  per cet the  odd parishes however which are grouped into  polling districts are thinly scttered over an area extending  miles from east to west and  miles from north to south  and unless tho weather im proves considerably before thumsday a good many abstentions may be loolkd for in tho smaller villages and
