 watepfindingier rrormsson w f ibaittett fmsthe voluminous correspondence which has recently been appearing in the times on the sub ject of waterfinding by means of the socalled dowsingrod illustrates the wide difference of opinion that exists on this sabject even among educated persons broadly speaking in the ex treme soathwest of england in the counties of cornwall devon somerset and parb of wilt shire faith in the  dowser  is widespread writing to me in  from the manorhouse clifton the treasurer of the merchant venturers society in bristol mr e h pope says on the estates which i look after we always employ a  dowser and i do not recollect any instance of failure to flnd water we never sink a well before using the rod an extensive wiltshire land agent mr h b napier writing to me the same year from chippenham wilts savs i am so satisfied of the dowsers power that i should never dream of sinking a well without their assistance the lato mr christiemiller a man trained in wide and careful observation informied ne that on his difherent estates he always em ployed a dowser with invariable success  he had sunk seven wells under their directions and all were successful but before calling in the aid of the dowser he had spent a very large sum in sinking for water but had been quite unsuccess ful the right hion sir ed vard fry writing to me in  stated that he had sunk in four places for water on his estate near bristol in three of the places he employed a dowser and obtained water in one he used his ovm scientilla judgment without a dowser and got no water many similar opinions given to me by the owners or agents of estates might be quoted all chvhom cooborate that able and im partial authority mr f t elworthy who in his  west somerset wordbook  writes  the power of the dowser to discover water is not merely a surviving superstition but is believed in by hardheaded practical men of the world who have proved by repeated trials that the advice of thedowser is correct and worth paying foron the other hand there are many who have tried a dowser and have failed to obtain water at the site he indicated instances of this have been given in the recent correspondence in your eolumnsand other failuresxhave been investigated and quoted by meelsewherethat a forked twig can enable any one to locate the position of underground water appears too obviously arelic of superstition to be worth serious inquiry moreover what are we to think of its waterflnding powerswhen historical investigation shows that it was originally employed for finding underground metallic lodes and its use still survives in many parts for this purpose it was also and is still occasionally used for the disi covery of buried treasure and of hidden or lost objects in the latter part of the th century it was employed in the south of france for the purpose of tracking criminals and heretics the skldl of jacques aymarin finding the murderer of a man in lyons by its means in  became so notorious that for a time the judgment of the courts was replaced by that of the dowser from the settlement of lost boundaries to the discovery of the fathers of foundlings the decision of the baguette our forkedtwig was invoked everywhere throughout dauphiny and for scores of different purposes the abuse becaene so great that cardinal camus interfered andobtained a decree of the inquisition forbidding its use in the moralworldie for purposes of justicein it is obvious therefore that those who claim that some mysterious electrical or other physical action is produced by underground water upon a forked twig or upon the dowser himself will have to extend this action to a bewildering variety of objects when the absurdity of any physical hypothesis becomes apparent but is there anything to explain beyond chance coinci dence or an eye for the ground in the case of expert dovwsers  at first i thought not and was somewhatstrenuous inthatopinion buturged by the council of the society for psychical re search to undertake a careful investigation of the whole subject i yielded whenl found the request strongly supportedby the late professor sidg wick whose opinion was based upon a mass of evidence already in the possession of the society this was in the year  and from that time to the present ihave devoted considerable time to the systematic investigation of what has proved to be a most trotiblesome and entangled set of phenomena the results of this psychophysical research have been published in lengthy reports issued by the psychical research society the first in  the second in  while a third report has now been read and will shortly be published i hone to embody the substance of these reports in a more compendious andaccessible form as soon as time permits ifthere is any public desire for such a volume meanwhile i may briefly state the general conclusions at which i have arrived historicalthe birthplace of the modern divining or dowsingrod is the mining districts of germany probably the hiarz mountains the first record of its use was in prospecting for mineral lodes chevreulfollowing earlier writers attributes to the alchemist who wrote under the name of basil valentine the first mention of the use of the rod in history at the latter part of the th century but both the date and the author ship of basil valentines writings are extremely doubtful  theywere issued at aiauch later period as internal evidence shows sebastian munsters  cosmography published in the early part of the th century and agricolas  de re metauica published in basel in  contain the earliest records i can find of the use of the forked twig or tirgula furcata for discovering metallicelodes in both these works plates are given showing the german miners searching for mineral veins in a very businesslike way by noting the dipping of a hazel or willow rod the forked ends of which are held in the hands of the expert agricola is careful to point out what is now wholly overlooked that albeitthe tirgula furcata was generally called the virgula divina it had nothing in common with the ancient superstition of the vbgulla divitza as described by cieero tacitus and others which was a method of augury by the casting of bits of stick rhabdomaney in its various forms goes back to a remote antiqufty but so far as i know it was used only for the purpose of augury some of your correspondents and nearly every writer on the socalled diviningrod mr a lang is an exceptiou fall into the vulgar error of con fusing two entirely distinct thingsthe forked rod or schlagruthe strikingrod of the german miners was brought over to england towards the end of the th century by the german miners whom the merchantventurers of cornwall engaged in exploiting the cornisli mines under a charter granted by queenelinabeth i have no doubt that the translation of the colloquial termstrisingrol into the cornish celitieor middle english of that period me dusdlen to strike or fall gave riseto theterm dowsingrod or deusing rod  as locke calls it in  the term  striking a vein of mineral oreor other hidden object is probably a survival of the old slaaegrutle how the use of the forked rod originated is obscure i aminclinedto think thatdating as it does fronmthe revivaloflearning itmarks thegrowing spirit of observation and inquiry for the drooping of trees and the character of the vegetation were regarded not without reason as indicative of certain mineral lodes beneath the immediate surface  the doctrine of  sympathy as widely held by the learned in the middle ages as the doctrine of evolution is held nowwas supposed to explain this as melancthon shows in an essay on the sympathetic attraction between certain plants and certain minerals i hence wvhat more natural than to cut a light branch off one of these trees and see if it drooped when prospecting for metallic ores this i believe is the origin of our dowsingrodwhich came intouniversaluse amongst miners throughout europe though it was very soon found that only certain persons had the  gif ofusing the iod lnor vas it employed onby bbte ignorant  critical and caretulobservers were found to admit its value as may be seen by a reference to theworks of the hon robert boyle vol l  to the great work on mining by pryce the  mineralogia cornu biensis  published in  or to billingsleys excellent book on  somerset  published in  and also otherwriters of that period the difficulty of finding underground water in parts of cornwall and somerset led to the trial of the rod for this pur pose about the middle of the th century though it had been used a centuryearlier forwaterfinding in the south of france do quiincey in several of his writings refers to the value of the water finders or  jowsers as he calls them in somer set thus he says  for  miles roundwring ton in somersetthe birthplace of locke nobody sinks for wells without their aid and again he remarks  i have myself witnessed the enormous trouble delay and expense accruing to those who refused to benefit by this art as the lead mines of the mendips became worked out and mining declined in cornwall the use of tho donvser in searching for lodes has almost dis appeared in england and the waterfinder has taken his place geologicalwhilst we know that metallic lodes are found generaly in rveinsaud so maybe a fit subject for the dowser if his  gift  be assunmed undergroumd water is by many believed to esist only in sheets lodging on some widespread im permeable stratum as rock or clay after soaking through a permeable stratum like saud and gravel this is pointed out by one of your correspondents who ridicules the dowsers notion of narrow underground streamis or springs of water but boah the dowser and your correspondent are wrong there are two main types of underground water  the more common it is true is that de scribed above water flltering through porous beds and existing in widespread underground areasbedwater we may call it but there is another type which may be called fissure water arising from tho drainage of water through joints or channels in impermeable strata such water bearing joints have no surface indication and the finding of a domestic water supply in such regions is therefore a matter of great difficulty hence as mr b westlake fgs points out  this condition which is the geologists ex tremity is the dowsers opportumit now it is precisely in those parts of england where fissure water largely existsviz in tho secondariy rocks of somersetthat the water dowser has won his reputation and is so largely in request but the dowser is nearly always an unlettered man utterly ignorant of geo logy and the type of underground water which he is familiar with in parts of somerset he fancies exists everywhere hence vith the utmost assurance he professes to trace the course of a narrow underground water channel up to what he calls the  head of the spring although the local geological conditions render such a state of things impossible every professional dowser that i know talks and acts as if all under ground water existed only in narrow channels and his clients usually take him for an oracle and implicitly believe his statements in many cases where a dowser is called in he is either needless water being found everywhere in the locality at a certain depth or he is useless and comes to griefno water or only surface water being foundowing to the great depth of an impermneable stratum like the london or oxford clay usually in such caseshe persuades his unfortumate patron to incur ruinous expense in sinking deeper with out result a little knowledge of the local geology would in many instauces show how absurd are the dowsers pretensions and opinions experimentalwe nowcometo the main ques tion where underground fissure water existsean the dowser locate its position or are his successes only such as may be ascribed to chance coinci denceor a knowledge of the locality with a clever  eye for the ground  the opinions expressed by competent observers in such localities are i entirely confirmed by my own inquiries and experimentsviz that a good dowser like the elder mullins or lawrence botlh of these are now dead so that i can mention their names without fear of advertising themhas a record of successes in localities where no local knowledge or skilled observation would avail far beyond any explanation on the ground of chance coincidence it has been nrged that the successes are re membered and the failures forgotten but i have taken special pains to get at the failures of a good dowser and though many such are sure to have escaped me yet many successes have also escaped me making a liberal allowance for failures of which i have not heard i have no hesitation in saying that where fissure water exists and the discovery of underground water sunflcient for a domestic supply is a matter of the utmost diffl culty the chances of success with a good dowser far exceed mere lucky hits or the suecess obtained by the most skilful observers even wvith full knowledge of the local geology the grounds upon which this opinion is based and the possible explanation of the dowsers success i must with the editors permission leave to the next article
