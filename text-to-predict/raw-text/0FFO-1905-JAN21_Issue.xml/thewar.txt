colonial and foreignintelligencethe warthe baltic flegadmiiral rozidestven s plansinformation which reaehes us from trustworthy sources shows that admiral rozhdestvensky no longer contemplates proceeding immediately t the far eastthe baltic fleet when it leaves madagascar may proceed in an easterly direction but it is most improbable that its cruise will take it for the present even into the eastern waters of the indian ocean and still less into proximity of the east indian archipelago where it might come into contact with japanese craiserswe have reason to believe that no attempt will be made by admiral rozhdostvensky to reach far eastern waters for another three months at leastrussia and cethtesneutralityagreem t among the powrfrom oun ownv o nspoxdxrwasmngton jae something may now be added to the statement i telegraphed you on wednesday concerning the interchange of views between this government and the european governments with reference to safeguarding the integrity of china i then said that the substantial unanimity of nearly all if not all the powers in safegnarding to the utmost possible extent china and chinese rights had been secured the chief exception vws france but france has now followed england and ger many in adherence to mr flays new proposal that proposal does not differ essentially from the original purpose of this government supported by the european governmentsmr hay renewed these commnications not as having any immediate connexion with russias complaint of chinese neutralityi believe indeed that his note antedated the russian notebut with reference to the futare the latest acts of russia seemed to make it desirable that tho powers should once more in somewhat altered circumstances recognize their former pledges as still binding there were moreover rumours that certain powers in view of a pro longed conflict and the probable influence of it on clinawere disposed to consider the permanent integrity of china difficult to maintain what mir hay did was to put the question whether each power would abide by its former declara tions each now answers yes the territorial integrity and administrative entity of china and the policy of the open door are once more re affirmed as the settled purpose of the european rnd american governments the american notes to each power were identical no concert or concerted action was invited but substanti ally the same end vas achieved by thesabstantial unanimity of the replies their assurances are explicit categorical and comprehensivethe rumours above mentioned are emphasized in some quarters but not officially nothing like an imputation on the policy or good faith of any neutral powver has been made or suggested it is however true that such rumours prevailed in certain chancelleries and embassies ineurope and were made known by diplomatie representa tives to this governmentbut although mr hays inquiries began before russias latest disclosure of her probable ultimate purpose to trample on chinese neutrality they have or may have a direct bearing on this pro bable ultimate purpose for if the powers are agreed not to commit nor to tolerate aggressions upon china after the war is ended they are far leas likely it is here thought to tolerate sueh aggression while the war is in progress and in fact these new assurances are reckoned broad enough to cover immediate contingencies as well as remote the new note handed as i cabled yesterday by count cassini to mr may reaffirm ing the original accusations against china was perhaps inspired by the knowledge of negotia tions between the european powers and the united states if so it only makes the failure of this latest example of russian diplomacy more conspicuousfinally it should be nmderstood that the narra tive of transactions given you on wednesday and today is only an outline which may or maynot be filled in later no correspondence has been published or is likely to be published just yet there are circumstances in connexion with the origin of the present notes which could they be stated would illuminate the whole subject it is more probable that they will be given to the world by some other government than by this if at all so of the form which the present re ciprocal assurances or guarantees take not till the notes are made public oflicially can the full force of them be felt but they may best be described in the phrase of one who has the right to describe them as a selfdenying ordinancetehu operations inmanchuriajapa nese patrol suprsedst petersburg jx a telegram from general
