toe timte and itsreaderswe dealt in a former article with the sugges tions that advertisements should be assigned to a separate part of the paper where they need not necessarily be seen about an equal num ber of our readers representing i por cent of our circulation are anxious that different items of news should be assigned to definite positions some go so far as to ask that the paper should always be the same size and that the same sort of news should always be found on a nniformly numbered page ignoring the fact that it is the number of advertisements pluts the quantity of news that must regulate the sizeof the paper and that as advertisements may vary from  to s columns while the news may requiire from  to g columns uniformity of size is quite unattainable other readers less mnreasonable suggest that the news each day should occupyat least the same relative position that the leading articles should always be in the exact centre of the paper that the mloney market should always be found on the first or the last page of news that the  contents should bo on page  or that the most important news should always bo facing the leading articles some with nmch pains for which wo are grateful have elaborated a complete alteration of the makeup of the paper to them we would point outthat it is one thing with the entire paper before one to arrange with scissors and paste a makeup which wouldbe ideally perfect it is quite another as we shall show to carry out such an arrangement ujnder the actual eonditions of our work a third class still more reasonably ask tbat irrespective of the position which may be assigned to any particular class of news all news relating to cogate subjeets should be grouped togetherthat for instance all commercial and finaneial news should be in one or two pages by them selves or that all letters to the editor should be grouped together in one page this last idea which seems to attract a good many people is however destructiveof the other for as letters deal with a variety of subjects it ap pears more methodical to do what we endeavour to do nomnamely to arrange the letters as much as possible nmderneath other comments or news on the subjects to which they relatethe suggestion that tho news shonlai be better arranged is a most natural one no one is more fully alive than we are to the great advantage that would be gained if all news could be coordinated so that eaeh reader should be able in cue or two pages to study that part of the paper which most interests him why it is asked for instance should home markets appear on page  foreign markets on page  and the tmoney market on page   whynot place them all together  the advantage is so obvious that it might have occurred to everyone that there msust be reasons which make it impossible lihe the criticisms on advertisements anl these sugges tions arise from a perfectly natural inability to realize all tlhe difficulties under which a morning newspaper is produced and we shall perhaps be forgiven if to some extent we lift the veil what oar readers fail to grasp is that one of the main factors that regulate the position of different news items in a paper is the time at whieh these happen to reach us that for eaeh page there is a givennoment by which it mnst be completed and sent to the foundry to be east after which it cannot be changed or added to with a growing demand on the part of the public to receive their papersearlier and the consequent despatch of our daily issue by earlier trains vith an equal tendencv to put off public functions until late at night mad to protract them to almost midnight the time during which the paper must be producd is shortened atboth ends while the recent increas in our circulation has at the samo time

as is contained in mfr morleys tifeof gladstone that estimate vwas rather below themark in an estimate beforeus of a copy of a single days paper we find that it contained in newsalone exclusive of advertisements  words or the equivalent of ono volume of teat work that however wonld be above the daily average which isabout t words equivalent to  pages of mr morleys worka space which that author devotes to the first  years of mr gladstones career now in tho collection and sifting of material for that period mr morley doubtless spent as many months as he spent weeks in the mere writing of it and when written the publishers spent at least as many days in producing it no such leisure is allowved to those who hav to produce he times they too have to sift and select from an enormous amount of material representing enoughmatter to fill many copies off the times some idea of the complexityof this portion of the work may be gathered from the fact that the private list of recognized correspondents reporters contribu tors and others connected with the tines which is printed periodieally for office use contains something lilke  names and these are verv far from including all the sources from which news is copiously reeeived countless telegrams are nightly poured in by the home and foreign news tgencies and further matter is received from many other directions of this enormous total every item large or small must be examined to ensure that nothing of importance is toverlooked yet for the collection selection and sub editing of the news for tie writing re vising editing printing and publishing of the paper ten hours at the outside can be given the first subeditor comes at  pm the paper mnust be at the general post office before i am it is true that the paper is the worlk of many writers and reporters but as the bottle narrows at tho neck so the whole of that mass of manuscript has to pass through some dozen hands until it finally passes through the hands of the editor to those of the printer in its fnal formfrom about  pm the icopy  begins to pour in by post by telegraph by train by messenger from every corner of the united kingdom from most parts of the globenot each subject nor indeed each item con secutively but in more or less disjointed frag ments first may arrive reports from police courts some bluebooks to be carefully read tnalysed and condensed a fragment of a speech of mr chamberlains in glasgow next i page or two of sir h campbellbannerman from perth some court news an assize report some more of mr chamberlain items of naval intelligence a little more of sir h campbell bannerman  and here let it be noted that by the eccentricities of telegraphy the end of either of these speeches may reach us before the middle of it the whole in any order imperfectly pumbered aul this varied  copy  and much iuore has to be gone through carefully in the n qridutarticla aneared on deoember first place to see what must be published and what may be omitted duplicate reports mnst ba compared and the besb selected allusions verified names and titles cheelmd letters read and considered long reports condensed donbt ful points cleared up and much judgmont exercised through the wvhole work the copy piece by piece as it seems complete and correct is going all the time to the printer retunming in proof from the printer to the subeditors under going correction and returning again possibly more than once to receive in the end the flnal editorial approval or corrections at a later hoar when the more important nenvs is becoming visible leading articles are being writtenupon it and with foreign telegrams are going through a yet more minute revision and so the work proceeds from  pm to  am but at midnight the tally may show  columns of news matter in type with more to follow and there is roomperhaps for only  then comes a further process of necessary condensation the two columns must in someoway be reduced to one and a half the halfcolumn to a third some of the less pressing articles letters or paragraphs must be taken out of the list all this time the printers are busy they haveto deal not only with what reaches them from tho editors room but with what they receive from the advertise ment department with which except in so far as it affects the space available for news and literary matter the editor has nothing to do the copy reaching the printer in scraps must be set up read for errors corrected madeup into columns and into pages each of these pages must be sent to the stereotype foundry where a papier machd matrix is taken direct from the type a metal casb is made from the matrix and whon trimmed and finished is ready for the presslet us assume that the paper is to consistof  pages colmns  of which the printer receives from the advertisement department and  from the editorial several casts according to the number of printing presses to be worked must be made of each of these pages of type the first of which must reach the foundry by  pm the last not later than  am in five hours the foundry has to turn out some  plates for the  pagesthe first at   another at   a third at   and so on through the five hours the first four pages cast are probably devoted whlly to advertisements which arrive earlier than news but at  oclock there may be waiting three or four pagespartially filled with advertisements one requiringtwo columns of news another three andlanother four before they can be completed and gotontof the way what news shall be selected to fll them  necessarily that which is ready whiclh has come in earliest which has already passed through the hands of the sub editor and after revision through tho hands of the editor otherwise there will be no page ready in rotation for the foundry there are two columns say of a speech by mr chamberlain ready but the speech is not finished that at least must wait but there is other matter available say the home markets and there fore these are used to fil the page and get it away to the foundry two hours later the foreign markets or the american market report may have reached us through the sub marine cables of course it would be advisable to put these witlx the home markets but the page containing the latter has been cast two hours ago and is ot the press waiting for the others to adopt the practiceof holding over a page in order to insert in it news on cognate subjects that might arrive later would involve holding over nearly every page of news to the last moment no donbt if all the pages could thus be held overif the printer could have before him as our critics have the complete contents of the paper if he could have all round him the whole  pages andshift any article at will from one page into anotherit would be possible to achieve perfection in the arrangement of the paper but then the s plates would havo to be cast together in the last  minutes and this would be impossible as things are the absolutely essential condition is that each page shau be completed closed cast and got out of the way before the next page is taken in hand only so can thework be done in time and the paper be got ready for delivery by the early trains and post within those limits all that can be done is done the law reports coming in early are nearly always in the earlier pages the colonial and foreign intelligence page and the leading article page are the last to beclosed up and in them therefore more coordination is possible the contents and the summary always in the same place enable the most inexperienced person to find readily the news he wants the proper vay to read the ptaper is to turn at once to the contents stummary and leader page a few minutes given to that page will put any reader in possession of all the more important news of the day and will enable him to find the fuller details without any of the difficulty alleged by some of our correspondentswe say some for though abont  per ceent of our readers make the complaint upon which we have been commenting a very considerable number lay emphasis on the fact that they experience no difficulty whatever in finding what they want an old subscriber writes  with all your changes supplements included i have nothing but praise to give to the admirable and consistent arrangement of your newvs and from long experience i can spot directly where to look for anything i want a newer subscriber writes  i must confess that at first i was puzzled to find what i wanted in die times but your excellent contents showed me my way about and i soon learnt that there was not even this to complain of a third writes  the charm of your paper is that contents which saves half the time i used to waste in looldng for things in other paperstee camegi
