chapter vthough in the formation of our character the influence of individuals cannot be doubted or denied nevertheless there are some persons born with a predisposition so strong that it is diificult to believe that under any circumstances that native vein woulld not have assorted itself lord gaston was of this kind and class even as a celd he vas inquisitive sceptical and eccentric doing things whlich were forbidden or if too original to have been contemplated anticipated by the censure of others when done disapproved he had the awkwvard habit of asking questions w hich could not be easily ansnvered and expressing opinions which per plexed and sometimes shocked nevertheless he was a favourite and at first universally so and this was owing to two causeshis good looks and his good temper nothing could disturb the last and his first glance fascinated still it was a lamentable fact that in the long run he could not as the phrase goes  get on  with anybody at a great public school he was soon idolized but it ended by the authorities privately com municating with his father that they thought on the whole it would be advantageous that his son should be withdranm from their control not that he ever did anything disgraceful mean or ignominious or even committed violent or rebellious acts but he was in the habit of circulating opinions which injuriously affected the discipline of the school was in the habit of reading and advising others to read books which while affecting to be philosophical could not for a moment be tolerated as tending in the opinion of the masters to the destruction of morals and religion what however brought affairs to a crisis was a motion which lie made in the boys debating society condemning the system of public education ilad he not been the son of a great noble vfho himself in his day had been one of the bright ornaments of their institution he would probably have been expelled but as it was he surrendered and marched out with all the houours of warlord bertram was such a complete man of the world that he resolved never to quarrel with his sou and he endenvoured by indirect means to guide him in the right path and counteract these evil tendencies he thought oxford would remove them and he sent him there at an nnusually early age but the oxford of gaston was no longer the oxford of his father and lord bertram whilo had many things to think about was not sufficiently aware of this a spirit almost as inquisitive as that which influenced his son had begun to pervade the great university and it unfortunately happened that the head of the house of which gaston had become a member was one of those distinguished divines who do not believe in divinity of this socrates he soon became the favourite pupil and considering his rank his fine looks his fiue temper and the reputation for talents which was soon circulated about and easily and eagerly accepted oxford came to believe that it cherished in its bosom one who in due season would become its most brilliant ornmment and its shining lightnevertheless when he had exhaustedt all the nebulous interpretations of his master which would prove that things though entirely profane were yet essentially sacred gaston engaged in a controversy on the origin of evil vwhiel ter minated by his somewhat abruptly quitting his alma mater and informing his father tuat he should not return to oxford which he looked upon as a nest of sacerdotal hypoerisythis was a great disappointment to lord bertram who however was a man never witbout resource and lord gaston was soon gazetted as aln attaeh to one of our most important embassies this seemed a successful arrange ment nobody could be more popular than lord gaston in his newv world all the great ladies were enchanted with him abd invited him to their tea parties he was called the handsome english man aud thon he was so kind and obliainu toohe was as goodnatured as he was beautiful apparently he was well pleased with his new life two years passed away and he never asked for leave of absence though ho wroto charming letters to his father whlo read extracts fromn them sometimes to his colleagues and sent the most exquisite presents to claribel whom he called mania unhappily one morning he appeared without notice at bertramhouse and ordered breakfast as calmly as if ho never had left his home ile bad travelled night and day for he had been ordered by the government of the country to leave it at an hours notice some correspondence having been discovered between the noble british attaeh and a revolutionary leader a secret communication was made to lord bertram but it was tho interest of all parties that the affair should be hushed up there is nothing to be done for him now but to push him into parliament said his fatber  if anything can get the nonsense out of a man it is the house of commonsthe reader will have seen that this last expe dient had not been quite successful lord bertram forgot his annovance in the pressure of public business and ladiy bertram found a sub stitute for the sceptical eonfidences and revolu tionary prinoiples of her stepson withl which she was beginning to sympathize in the unflinching orthodoxy and ultraconservatism of his parlia mentary successor urged as they were by himn with irresistible dialectics and a torrent of nvords wvhich no improvisatore could excel and to which lady bertram in veiled ecstasy listened as she wouild to a cataract in the alpson a certain day in every week it came to be imderstood that mfr joseph toplady i falconet would probably be drinking a cupof tea at bertramhouse and expounding his schemes of regeneration for a society which he was resolved to save though lie admitted its condition was somewhat desperate he had already achieved success in the house of commons where rapid success is difficult very shortly after his entrance into that still fastidiouis and somewhat incredulouis assembly he took up the sabbatarian question and the notice of his motion was received with contemptuotus respect but the feeling was far otherwise when they had listened to him tlhe old hands at once recog nized that this was a man who would mount and looked forward with interest to the occasion when he might deliver himself on some practical subject and not on such nloonshine as that with which he had favoured them but here the old hands as they often do mnade a mistake there was a great though latent fand of religionism in the house much of it sincere a large portion no doubt inspired by the constituencies  but the members who acknowledged these sentiments were generally speaking not of a class calculated to enthral listening senates they were respect able men usuauy opulent and their opinions on matters of trade and taxation ahlays com manded deference but they were qrito in capable of grappling with the great questions that touch the convictions and consciences of nations and they hailed with satisfaction a commanding expounder of opinions which in their hands they felt would have assumed a character of feebleness which they were per suaded was undesenred these men sitting on both sides of the house rallied round falconet he gathered other allies with all his abilities and acquirements joseph toplady falconet was essentially a prig and among prigs there is a freemasony wiich never fails all the prigs spoke of hih as of the coming manlady bertram always returned from her daily drive at five oclock and she was always at home there never had been formal invitations but the initiated camea small refined circle there were always a few ladies of great fashion some times a royal duchess an ambassador a dandy or twofor lady bertram could even command dandiesaud halfadozen other men native or foreign but of european celebrity when it was in his power falconet was there but that was uncertain for the house of commons is a jealous mistress and will not grant success without due attention the greatest compliment you can pay to a woman is to give to her your time and it is the same with our senate a man wlho is always in his place becomes a sort of favourite but there were other means of communication between claribel and her new prophet books vere mutuauy lent to each other and every day there were letters exchanged on her part little em blazoned notes  on his treatises pamphlets where everything was divided under heads and every question exhausted and settled
