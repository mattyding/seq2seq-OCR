on thursday in aid of lady londonderrys fumd for the church schools of tho diocese of durham there was a large attendance sir thomas wrightson mp moved a resolution affirming the paramoumt importance of definite religious instruction he said the education act wee passed because there was a cry in the country for increased eficiency in regard to secalar education the act inits incepton was not a religious one and the problem might have been solved by leaving the voluntary schools out of consideration that however would bave involved an enormous expenditure and the present volun tary schools would havo been thrown away tho good sense of the people was against such a course and conse quently a compromise was arrived at he expressed the hopo that the response to the appeal would be such as to enable the churchpeople of the diocese to put all the schools in proper repair and to meet the requirements of the education authority the motion having been carried lord barnard moved a resolution pledginm the meeting to help lady londonderrys fund he said he was not a thickandthin supporter of church schools in the settlement of the question he should have preferred to see only one class of schools in the conmtry but unless they were prepared to throw them over and to outrage the feelins of a large number of people they must deal vith those in which church teaching was given and recognize them as part of the educational machinery of the country he was not one of those who decried all the opponents of volunta school arrangements for religious education as t many of them at any rate in the farst instance had some scruples in the matter but whatever sympath he had for them had been eliminated by their gross mis statements for political purposes the motion was carried and it
