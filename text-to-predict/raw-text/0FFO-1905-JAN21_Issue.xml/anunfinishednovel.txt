amounted to being celebrated an illustrious foreigner for example after the tllamestannel and the crystal palace noted among his agenda during his london visit the opportunity if possible of making his bow to that great lady invitations were not a matter of course even to her own political friencls and murmurs were not infrequently heard by expect ing but omitted guests that their room seemed to be occupied by the other side no individuals however foreign or domestic experienced any difficulty in entering her saloons provided they were famous or even eminent and provided they properly appreciated the trans cendent qualities of their hostessclaribel countess bertram was a very young widowv when she consented to become the second wife of her present husband ilerself a member of one of our most ancient and noblest families beautiful highly jointured and with an only child who was a great heiress it the world did not exactly express their wonder at her union wvith lord bertram they still witl frequent lindness would observe that he was the most fortumate of men but lord bertram was one of those who understand women and ho was a favourite wvith themtall pale and somewhat fragile but of a dis tinguished mien her large dark eyes full of inscrutable meaning while a profusion of rich brown hair all her own veiled in a straight line her wellmoulded brow and shaded with rich masses her oval cheeks claribel received her guests  her voice low but musical and quite distinct though she scarcely condescended to raise it beyond a whisper she listened rather than conversed bub could seem deeply or what is styled intensely interested with her companion and generally herself sutmmed up with an epigram or what sounded as such then the favoured guest might retire and record the words of wit and wisdom in his journal if he kept oneit was amusing unobserved to watch the various modes with which she welcomed her guests generally speaking the mass of either sex passed by her absolutely in fear and trembling the beautiful head grave almost to sadness wvith a slight touch of celestial pride in the recognition just divinely inclined itself but occasionally her countenance became animated a phosphorieflame shot forth from those eyes of olympian repose and she held forth the most beautiful hand in the world for them to touch and even to press these favourites were almost always men  statesmen of both sides who habitually consulted her neological professors from foreign universities or wild radical poets who found occasion notwithstanding their scream ing odes to coming men and coming times privately to indite impassioned sonnets to the queen of beanty of fashion and of geniuswith her own sex she was courteous but rarely cordial except wvith some yong ladies who were her worshippers and certainly except with her own family whom she habitually welcomed with a courtly embrace it was a divine condescension and meant to intimate what she was in the habit of asserting that there was no family in the peerage which for blood and historical achieve ment could for a moment be classed with her ownthe daughter of lady bertram the lady ermyntrude had just been presented though young even for such an initiation hler future was a subject of frequent discussion in wlhat is called  society whom she would marry and when she would marry  large questionsand then there were some wvho fancied she would never marry and why  because she was eccentric eccentric in what  well they say she has ideas of her own that is certainly serious tonight it might have been expected that she would have been by the side of her mother as lady bertram received her guests but lady ermyntrude had an instinctive feeling that lady bertram was not particularly anxious for her contiguous presence and she found it more amusing to move in her own orbitbut not unattended there was a german lady fraiulein von weimar who was her official and inseparable companion and geneally one of her guardians  a bishop of captivating gifts snua ciently serious yet of a lusory mind a prelate who ever remembered how much the church owed to holy women contrived to hover round her and was usuauy welcomed and encouraged by hor smileit must not be supposed however that lady bertram was not a devoted mother she was a perfect parentin theory she wished her daughter to have every advantage and enjoy every delight that was alike proper and practic able only she was too much interested about herself to be able to spare any time to carry her theories into practice fortunately she had become acquainted with fraulein von weimar who had gained her conmidence and her heart by her appreciation of lady bertrams genius and her wondering recognition of lady bertrams resistless iniluence over men this last ascendant power however was of so fascinating a character and it absorbed the life of claribel to such a degree that in duie course she found it was im possible to spare any longer any portion of her existence even to the sweet tongue and subtle mind of fraiulein von weimar so after some scenes and mucht unnecessary diplomacy on both sides this lady beeame the guide the preceptress and inseparable companion of the lady ermyn trudeher pupil had not the lustrous beauty of her mother and yet her appearance was hardly less striking she had a beautiful figure rare to see any one more shapely and she moved as if she were conscious of her symmetry her counte uance was delicate aquiline with grey eyes but there was a vwant of mobility about her features and it seemed doubtful whether their habitual oxpression were a simper or a sneer fralulein although very few years older than lady ermyntrude had the mien and carriage of a matured woman she was rather under the middle size and her stature was scarcely redeemed by grace but she had a bright com plexion beautiful teeth a commanding brow and a large blue eye of searching powerit was rather late in the evening  lord bertram who at its commencemept as was his custom had assisted his wife in the reception of her gnests and then wandered abouxt the crowded saloons talking with those he wished or eared to meet had quietly stolen away to his red boxes the rooms were still full though thinner mr chatterley was standing by the side of lady bertram he was one of the favonred thougi never welcomed with enthusiasm and sometimes scarcely treated with consideration he was lady bertrams man of letters and as he flattered him self the only one of his class really in society his chief business was to carry to her gossip and to take care that she was properly worshipped in the lettered world servile to her and adulatory he vindicated his independence by his arrogance in the inferior circles which ho sometimes deigned to reenter and where his quotation of great personages made his conversation somewhatresemble the columns of thoe ourt fircarlady ermyntrude is looking charming to night observed mer chatterley dearest ermyntrude i  exclaimed her mama she has just had a joust with the bishop said mir chatterley  and i do not think had the worst of it indeed murmured lady bertram with a vacant look h have yoa no news to give me to night   she could not for a moment suppose that mr chatterley had ventured to stop by her side merely to liraise her daughter all thie world is talking of young mr falconets speech said air chatterley yes he seems a considerable person ho dined here todayi am told he is  great admirer of lady bertram said mr chatterley e knovs very little of me said the lady trying to veil her euriosity he kiows what all know and feels what all feel who have the honour and delight of lady bertrams acquaintance only vwhat we feel or know goes for nothing we alas i who are not orators or poets and statesmen what did he say  said lady bertram in a hiishad voicebnt before he could answer lie was obliged to retire for a young man quickly and unceremoni ouisly approached and addressed lady bertramhe was handsome  the highest order of english beauty the norman tempored by the saxon his complexion bright his dark blue eye dolicately arched regular features the upper lip short and with hyacinthine locks of auburn hairi thought i was not to see you tonight gaston said the lady of the housei viell i do not inow whether i ought to be here i have not been exactly cut by some of your friends but they were rather queer i suppose being in my fathers house they could scarcely refrain from noticing mei have made the acquaintance of your successor murmured lady bertratm  lie dined here i have had much conversation with him ah i  said lord gaston  tihen i suppose you are in an orthodox moodt the english are essentially a religious people said lady bertram you did not think so the last time we talked about these matters i think i might now sit down said lady bertram as if his words had not reached her and she tool his arm before even it could be offered and they vere soon seated on a sofa this air falconet is an extraordinary man said lady bertram  i never knew any one so eloquent ee talks of course too much bnt that will wear off i am sorry now that you left parliament i am nob parliaments are worn out but you say that of everything said lady bertramand it is trae of everything but of the whole afrair nothing is so exhausted as the human race itself but what then is to happen   inquired lady bertramd many things may happen i do not suppose that because man is worn out even this little planet which we call ours has not yet some future the mistake wiich our selfconceit has always made has been to suppose that this planet vas made for man there never was alny founda tion for such a belief and now we know it is mere folly thefact is that man has really never very much taken to this globe and no wonder it clearly was never intended for him it con sists of more water than land and of that land a great portion is uninhabitable desert look at the miserable amount of population that after millions of years he has just contrived to procreate  scarcely equal to the spawn of a shoal of herringst hen you think the world was made for herrings   sweetly whispered lady bertram i cannot teu what it vas made for but i think i can tell what it was not madle forthen you can have no interest in life  yes i have in youif you begin talking nonsense i will go and fetch my lordi suppose it is only mr falconet who may talk nonsense mr falconet has none but the most exalted ideas his life is devoted to the vindication and the triumph of religious truth i am also capable of devotion said lord gaston  and that is to the happiness of my species for that reason i wish it to become extincttwo young ladies with very long trains bowed to lady bertram from a distance and kissed their hands  i must say a word to them she said as she returned their salute  you do not mind  no i like them both they have more sense than half the girls i knowthe ladies approached i was so sorry lady bertram said one of them  not to meet professor ogalaxy here tonight we were at his lecture today at the royal and i wanted so much to ask him a question i see my way so far as protoplasm clearly  but there i stop i think we ought to be satisfied but blanche de grey says no that will not satisfy her she must go furtlher if lady blanche goes further she wvill not get rid of her dificulties said lord gaston
