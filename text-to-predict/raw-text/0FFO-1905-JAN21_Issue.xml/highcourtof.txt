was necessary that the doors should be locked he even thought that if tho occupants of the two tenements were subject to proper ceremony to visit one another by passing through these doors the tenements would not necessarily be one tene ment the solicitorgoneral had put his caso on the specialcircumstances of the case he his lordship thought that having rogard to the udgmort of the lord

that it interfered vith the light towhichho was entitled andwhicbhad hithorto beenenjoyedin connexionwith his premises part of which had been used for mpwards of  years past by the plaintiff for tho pnuposes of his offlces including a drawing offico for which a special amount of light was required all the lights were ancient oecept as to the additional amount of light coming through cortain new shopfronts a slight but not material interference with light was caused to those parts of the plaintiffs premises for which no special amorunt of light was reuirode the plaitifa claimed that ho was entitledto damages the umpire awarded andfoundas follows notwithstanding the defendants buildings there remains sufficient light to the plaintiffs premises for llpurposes of ordinary userand the plaintiff is not entitledto damages for interfereneo with such ordinary user but if  am entitled to take into account daniages which the plaintift has sustainedin respect of loss of light to those parts of the premises used for occupations in respectof wbichaspecialamount of light is required then i award � damages at the reqnest of both parties the umpire submitted for the opinion of tho court the question wvhether on tho foregoing facts he was bound by the decision in  colls vhome and colonial stores   i ac  and tberefore could not award damages to the plaintiff or whether he could award damages to tho plaintiff in respect of interference with such special user of light as aforesaid it was argued for the plaintill  that the umpire bad found that an architects busiuess was not an ordinary business that this was wrong in law tlat an architects business was an ordinary business  and as he had found that tho light was insuflicient for this business he had found that itwas innificientforan ordinary business and thereforo aceording to the law as laid down in collss caso thero had been an actionable interfereneowith the plaintifrs ancient lights andthe plaintiff was entitledto the go damages in the alter native it was contended that the questionwhether an architects business was an ordinary business was a mixed qnestion of law and fact and the unppire must have mis directed himself or misunderstood collss case and the case oughxt to be sent back to him to have the facts more fully stated it wass contended  that the  years enjoyment had given the plaintiff a

wvaugh ec and mr h t waddy for the defendantmr jujscsc br y in delivering judgment today said tlht in examnining tho contentions put forward forthe plaintiff it was necessary to see what was meant by the expressions which wero to be found in thespecial case and in tho judgments in collss case ordinary user or  ordinary business or ordinary parposes lae thought that tre word  ordinary  wvs used solely with reference to light and an ordinarytnser or an ordinary businessmeantauserorbusiness which in factrequired onlyanordinary amount of light thiswasa question of fact anid must depend on th evidlence in each case  and it could not be predicated as a matter of law whether an architects business or any other business was en ordinary business he did not think that it was even mixed act rnd law but if it were he felt quitemable to see whero the umpire had misdirected himself or how he had misunderstood coulss ease the second point did raise a questieu of lawinamely whether uso or enjoyment of a special light for  yours gave a rih mt ht special light and thus enlarged the easement and inereasedtlhe burden of the seyient tenement it was important to observe that the sumpire did not state as a fact that the owners of the sorvient tenements were aware that the premises were being used for businesses that required special light it was said by tho plaintifis counsel that no evidence was given at the hearing beforo the umpire aboutit and that if it was arelevant fact the case ought to be sent baek to the umpire to find itis lordship did not agreewith that contention a plaintiff had to prove his esse andif he did not prove a necessary part of his casebho must fail theonly fact therefore to he dealt with was the uso and enjoyment of the special light for  years did that givo a right to it  this point was not decided in collss casebut was referred to in some of the judgments in which however there was nothing that assist edtheplaintiffs contention on theocontrary their inclination seemed to be agaistit thero was a dictum in  lanfranchi vfckeanie  lr  eq at p  distinctly opposed to the plaintlifs contention if klowledge was not to be assirmed and the reasons there given for thinking that no right could bo gained in the absence of knowledge seemed un answerable if the origin of the rightto light was a supposed lost grant or covenant as the cases seemed to showv vho would presume that the owner of the servient tenement intended to grant a special right beyond the ordinarynright when hoewas ignorantof the special user or enjovment  hlis lordship was however prepared to go further and to hold that even  years enjoyment to tho inowledge of tho servient tenement would not giva alargerzright tho result of tho iudcments incellss case was to show that the test of tho nght was wvleother the obstruction complained of was a nuisance if ono turned to the nzuisance cases did one find any traco of the doctrino that a person carrying on a delicato trade wvas entitled to more freedom from annoyance than ordinary people becauso for  years his neighbourshad been aware of the trade he was carrying on and had left him undis turbed ills lordship was not aware of anvydecision that suggested such a proposition and it sounded absurd in the judgmentsin colls s and other cases it wras implied if not expressed that in meanirinag the quaantum of ii aht to w hich the owneor of the dominant tenementwaqs ontitledtepurpose for which he desired to use or did use the light should bo disregarded and did not either enlarge or dimifnish the eaqsement whichheha

on tho dominant tenement and not on the servient tenement which was not in any way affected by it if the true doctrine was that laid down in collss case that bv  years user all that was acquired was a right to prevent the defendant f rom building so as to interfere with tho light previously enjoved so materially as to amount to a niuisance it would  logically iniconsistent withl this doctrine to hold that alarger right could be acquired to introduce the elemeat of quantum of user would also work inconvenience and cause unmcertainty if the only right capablo of being acquired was suicient light for the ordinary uses of inhabitancy and business the owner of the servient tenement inew his exact positiont hekimew within reasonable limits how high he could raise bis buildings and whether during the  ears it was vworth his while to obstruct his neighbour swdovs if a ri t to special light was capable of acquisition withou is knowledge he could not know his position and if he had notice ot some special light being required for his neigh bours business he could not measure the extent with any exactitirde it seemed altogether unreasonable to presame tbat any man would have made a grant of such an in dellnite easement on the vhole both reason and auithority compelled him to decide this point against the plaintiff the last point depended on the construction of tie agreement for roference but his lordship could not dra from tao words of the agreement any inference that tho defendant intended to give up any legal defenco th dispute was wbethecr the plaintiff had sustained

pressure as he said by tho defendant undertook to play the part for a salary of � a week the contract was only a verbal one the plaintiff went out to america with the defendant by tho same boat and tho tour opened in new york on september  the plaintiff alleged that his engagement by tho defendant was fron sepitember  to january   with the option of being released in november  in the event of a
