close yesterday in tho council chambor of the london county council whe mr f wns oss tho chairman for tho year presided tho proceedings on thursday wore privatetho crxtrrran in the course of his address yestor day said that thoso of them who had bsen called upon to assist in tho administration of tho edncation act of  had witnessed a second revival of learning they could not however do everything at once and the authorities would requiro time to accommodate them selves to the now condition of affairs there was real danger in hurry and he was a little afraid that there had been a disposition to rush matters both in the provinces and at headquarters especially tho latter thero could ba no doubt that tho act had brought the country great good but somo littlo disappointment would bo felt by many authorities that in the matter of higher education thore had not come that powor and responsibility which mr balfour said would como lir balfour sketched out in glowving terms how the local authorities would bave power to deal with primary and higher oducation especially in the counties and county boroughs possibly the prime minister would bo a little shocked to know that for some mystorious rason or othor local authori ties wore not getting that control especially in the highor branches which ho stated thay would get speaking of tho training of teachors tho chairman said that he had been greatly surprised at some of tho schemes proposed for tho training of teachers in his opinion it was not the business of education authorities to train teachers at was the duty of tlho state if it bolieved in education to train its own teachors just as much as it was tho duty of the stato to train its own soldiers and sailors the line of defenco which he advocatod was that they should train up a raco of resourceful men and women teachers who vould not be more automata but who would thirlintelligently and lyeo of tha best of that thought to improve the mental and moral condition of the ehildren of the country it was moro than over necessary that we should have capablo and welltrainod men and women as teachers not boys and girls which many of them now were it was beyond his comprehension that theyhad for so long putup with the pupilteacher system in any third or fourth rate countrythepupil teacherwasuukown ho did not believe in the system and would bo delighted to seoits entireabolition butifthoy weretoretain it slonld be mado as perfect as possiblo why should their classes not have men and woinen as teachers wbo had been thoroughly trained and who possessed good scbolarshi  they vould got neither of these qualifications much umder  years of age why should they have a kings scholar ship examination at all  wvhy should not the universi ties which wero now spread over tho length and breadth of the land have a hand in dotermining under proper conditions tho fitness or otherwise of the candidates wvho ware to become tha futuro teachers of thiscountry suroly they would never miss the kings slolarship when thero were  other different doors by which teachers could be rocognized and get into the profession then again latterly ttiov had all been madeacquainted with tho desires which tho endowed secondszy or grarnmar of both new and old type schools bad ex pressed to help in this ver important work but he saw a real danger in trustin this great task to such institu tions after the pupils hi attained the age of  or there bouts the training which those schools were capablo of giving was too scademio in character and those most essential subjects school discipline and development of aptitudo to imnpart knowledge were altogether neg lected the secondary schools of the oountrycould nevor be made altogether suitable for the training of pupil teachers qua pupil teachers the object tradition and life of the grammar school were unsuited to that end it ought to be the business of those who were respon si le for the training of bovs and girls who vero to aets teachers in the primrary schools that from  years of ago and onwards they should tbo mado thorouyl familiar with the elemonts of school disciplino and secool management in reading tho recent report on tho state of education in birkenheasd by mr sadler ho vms delighted to find that he was distinctlv of opinion that it woas unwiso to attempt to draw the whole future supply of our pupil teachers from or through the secondary schools the chairman believed that a good working scheme conld easily be made by which suitable and satisfactory instruc tion couldbe given in convenient centres to those who wero in training for teachers if tho glovermment would onlyfix a date by which iu women toachers in primary schools should be certiflcatod and all men trained and certificatod he believed untold good would come to the schools and tho country ieo knew thore would be some cases of hard ship but ultimate benefit would como in the end some said that it would bo unwoisoto certificate everybodybvben many of their women left for other happier spheres and tlat it was more men that they wanted in the profession they would get them if they offered a better mnoaximuna salary for all trainod eertificated men who would asrule unliho the women remain in the profession until superannuation age if this could be done his convic tion was that they would soon have a steady supply all tho bursary sebemes in the world would not bring the men in if the ond of the period of traidning was not more re munerative let the government fix a date say  after which all male teachers must be trained and certifi cated anid all women teachers certificated end ho fully believed a reformation would bo brought sbout in their primary schools with reforence to the nwov rogulations he said that if authorities wero to be responsible for their administration thero should bo some intimation given of all contemplatedchangossmall and great had tho slightest opportunity been given to those capable of criticism some of the rogulations especially thoso for secondary schools would nover havo appeared or would have been considerably modifled the authorities had a right to know at least  months before what changes were suggested either in tho primary or bigher education codes lle complainod that theynever knew whatwas going to happen next they lived in a stato of unstablo equilibrium they needed time to accommodate their local schemes and poliries to thoso of the central offico then againthere should bo some stability about the rules and regulations when thov were mado within recent years many auithorities rihtly or wrongly wero induced to enter upon policies vhich ended inevitably in the spending of large sums of money on secondary schools the authorities concerned having once put their bands to the plough should not have them suddenly torn away and be told to discard this or that macbine and plough no longer in this or thatfashion surely the iocal auathorities kew something of what was best suited to their own localities and if certain types of schools had been found suitable for thlem thie south kensington branch of tho board of education had no right to tear up by the roots systems which they themseoles helped to plant without raking ad ate compensation for the oxpuditore incurred to the authorities concernid publio attention should also be called to tho action of the board of education with reforenco to tbo manner in which it was dealing with secondary schools in particular and with the county colncils responsible for secondary education in general he supposed that if mto aid was to be voted it would in the first place be voted from the rating authoritiesviz the county colncils surely then it would be wise policy on thbo part of tho board of education to take into its confidence the county council flrst and if there were doflellncies to be mot or assistance to be rovided it would be better to discuss these matters first hnd with the authoritv most con corned and if the schools were the property of the uthority or were dependent either for extension or alteration by means of funds obtained from mtes it was absolutely necessary that communication should at any rate at the beginning be sent to the connty council but tbey fomund that exactly the opposite coarso was being taken and tho cotunty of surrey could provide some very aggravated cases of a method of procedure on the part cf the board of education which could only end in irritation and serious retardation of any desire to promote secondary education which the county coumcil might bave the same kiind of thing hadheen done in worcestorshire where the managers of a secondary school supported by the worcester county council had actually nreed with the board to build a chemical laboratory whici the council were to pay for without telling the council about it possibly if inquiries were mado many instances of a similrlan d could be found the action which the board of education was pursuing especially at south kensing ton savoured very stronglv of a goverment within a government ho next dealt with the question of tenure of assistant teachors in secondary schools and spoke of the attempts  to perpetuate the monstrous injustice of dismissal withont appeal or reason this was what they found in the recent schemes for secondary schools especially i the schools which were seeldng recognition by the secondary branch of tho board tho assistant teachers working undor the schemes now issuing from south kensington woutld be in a hopeless position in fact the headmastershousemaid end cool would enygrentor security of tenure than the majority of assistants in the secondary sebools of this country after years of patient toil study and negative income ho might be suddenly told that his servicas weroe no longer required lvhat possible argument could be used for a continuance of a stato of things which bad no othor parallel in anv brancb of the civil servieo either at homo or abroad  the assistants in endowed secondary schools had been too long in bonduge and now the opportunity was coming along when tho committees could help them to their emancipation he sincerely hoped that the authorities of this country would protest in tho very strongest possible manner against this modern recrudeseence of despotism after referring to the  very strong tendency on the part of the board of education to reduce in quito a number of wvays the income of the local authorities to the with drawal of tho science and art scholarships by the board and to the new rules for the building and equipping of secondary schools all of which he condemned the chair man expressed the hopo that the spirit and zeal which had been manifested by the vast majoritv of the education nathorities might continlu and that it might be possiblo for the whole of tlio children of this countrv to have as good and as sound an education
