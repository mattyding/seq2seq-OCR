because he was in one sense the real conservative a laugh that he could not help saying some strong things against the present government which was shamconservative laughter and  hear hear before however pro ceeding to deal with curznt politics he referred briofly to tho church diffiuilty in scotl and cud said that while the recent judgment in the houso of lords might be legauy beyond disputo he doubtod whether the law lords fully reylized the very serious effects of their own action which gravely affected important issues of pro gress and spiritual independonce parliament would have to emend and adjust the law so as to bring the state of things defied by the appeal court into harmony with the glaring facts of the caso  hear hear  and cheers he believed with regard to generai politics that there were issues raised in the present political situation which went almost as deeply iato the life and character of the people of great britain as even the great church issue now raised in scotland he submitted that we had now in ofice a overnment which was outraging the maxims and principles that had since the time of harles il ani mated all governments in this country hear hear balrous e sc porcwhat ray of light did any unionist speakers inengland or scotland shed upon the real chbracter and limits of mr baf ours policy which they professed tosupport wee the prime minister in favour of protection or in favour of free trade  did mr balfour or did he not agree with mr chamberlain  hear the late colonial esecratary had in todays papors written a lotter in which he said hoe did not himself reconize anv difference iri principlo between mr balfour ana himsell that if they diffeored at all it was only on the question of methbd or tactics and that mr balfonr had advocated the greatobject which he mr chamberlain had in view as strongly as any tariilreformer could desire a laugh he hoped that kr balfour in addressing his constituelts in manchester next weel ould plainly state whether mr cham borlain was justified in saying that they agreed in principle that there was no difference between them and that mr balfour had advocated mr chamber lans objectsas strongly as any tariff reformer could desire lie urgently invited tho prime minieter to answer that simple uestion hear hear wvas the primo mlinister or wasphe net in agreement with the objects which every tariff reformer desired if the primeinister waos prepared to propose great changes why did he not tell us clearly what these changes wereand why did he not tell uls that in terms we could all uderstand  we had been told in various neva ternis that mr balfour had announced a change had adumbrated a chaagewhat ws adambrated laughter had foreshadged a change what chane  mr balfour had never tol u were ut off witn the blessed word  retaliation lord erey claimoed the soger convention as an instance of socossful retaliation t did the dundee manufac turers who used sugar in their trade or confectioners or private consumers of sugar say to tiiat  was tho sugar convention a kind of policy which thoy desired their parlamentaty representative to support  he thought not hear hear the government had assured us that they alone realised the probloms before the country if the sugar convention was a result or token or samplo of their conception of what was good for the coumtry then it was indeed a very bad leooout for us hear hesa hie thoronghl iympathied with unionist candidates who bad to go efore constituencies end yet whon pressed were compelled to reveal the fact thst they hanot an idea in thoir own adumbrated minds as to what vwa the policy of their titular loader no more scandalous seenes ad been behbold in our politioal history than the scone now witnessod in this island of plain men whero nobody knew what it was that the prime minister really wanted tobeatand what he was going toaskthe counmryto assist himn in striving to securetim policy of  govnmamtrwhatwas tho policyof the governmenti hecould find no sign ina single public departmcatthat the govern meat had realy thought out theirpolieyor theirpro posals let them take for instance tho south african war they declared in the first placo that there would notbeawar thatthe btees would notfight thenthathe war would only ist a feowmonths next that it would only coat ten millions instead of  thues that amount that was one fatal example of the constant failure of tho government to think out their problems although he had hhnaalf defeated thatwar and stilletestd it he had never felt that its army arrangements vwere very diacrediteblo to the war office or to the system which thewar olfice represented but tndoubtodly the war revealed great defects in army ortnoiztien during the past four years the gove meent had proposed advo cated and then dropped a succession of schemes of military and war osfice reform until now he did not believe that anybody in that department could plainlv tell how matters stood or what schemo was to be acted upon tena with regard to tbeir irish land legislationthe goreramnt had mado many serious mnlcalculations besides having greatly underestimated the number of applications for purchase and sale next the statements of various leading members of tho governmont in favour of their sugar convention had been entirely falsifted by events futhertmistakes had been made in the minis terial reform of parlirunentarv procedure almost overy body in parliamuent fully realied tht the procedrie reform had worked as badly as any chango in procedure could possibly have worked the present plum represented a broluen md incompleto bit of jorrybuilding hich had been more disastrous to the effectiveness gnity and selfrespect of the house of commons than all the opera tions of ir parnell and his allies how unhappy moralfour must feel when he saw how unfortunate and unsatisfactory had been the results of his changes in pariamentary proceduro the prime minister had dealt almost as gre a blow at tho dignity and standiag of our system of government by cabinotthe question of rxrrsmnroit was often said that there was to be a redistribution bill in the coming session btif we were going to remove anoamalies in our electoral svstem whlat wan to become of tho house of lardsp lhe object of any redistribution bill would mainly be to reduce the nmber of irish members in the hiouse of commons and no doubt irelaid in view of her popullation vas now largely overrepresented in thehous of commons but boore cutting down the represenltation of ireland to her exacot nmnerical pro portion one thing to be rreemabered as abeoltey relevant was that in tve house of lords which was mcoequal i power with the house of commons there was not one single dect representative of that portion of ireland which sent an overthearing majority of trish members t the hopuse of cobnmon ohear hear there was ha believed not a single direct ationalist in tbe hoese of lords and that was onereson whyireland might claim somewhatmorettha her etwact numberica pro portion in the pepular branch of the legispatore ttis government shorld be branded as one w hich d rd perversely dealt in a party interest with n nmmber of euestions which they ought to have attempted to settle in the national intercst one example was the english education act which left all the nonconformists infuria ted and wales in such a state that smplementary legislation was required to force the welsch county councils to obey the law the government had obviously not thoeght that matter out they wero so blidly bent on pursuing their own objects that they overlooked tho depth and just intensity of feeling that their course mrst excite hear hear they not only ofended tlhe religious sentinents of a considerable proportion of the bst citizens in england but by rooting out tlho school boad they had diimaged and impaired the interest practically taken by competent and trained men in the work of education hear hear next with regard to the licensing act he believed that the government transformation of an annual interest in publichousus into a vested end perpetual interest was one of the most serious blows to the causeoftemperance that had beeam inflicted in this generationnational fnaxczanother clause in his indictment had reference to national finance the accumulation of debt after war was doubtles inevitable and be hoped they wvid not thinkaim callous or insoent if ho said itserved us ri t  hear hear and cheers but ws it inevitable thatth skilful bandling and with something better than wasteful handtomonth treatment the national credit should be so injured that isstead of the govemments borrowing at  per centthey now bad to borrow at about  per cent  a large amoumt of floating debt bad been created which was ainly in foreign bands and upon some occasiion of international emergency that might lead to conplications that might prove some day to be of the very first magnitude fcheers but a sill more striking illustramtio ofn siegnal failureof tho govern ment to think out their problems was their attitude with reard to the fiscal question which mr cbamberlain launched irl o no deubt the lato colonial secretary per suaded himself that it was a good policy for this country but whre was there any sira that those who remained hin oice and power as the uoverninent bad thouglhtout their own lino upon that most vital and momentous question  there was no such sign and that fact was undoubtedly causing considerable embarwsment to our trade and commoerce we now lived in a very agitated state of the world great changes were nm ver the civilized world apart from hussi aind a e courusof nature might produce an opening for chages in the great empire of austria how wero we better able under this government to face our enemies in the gate so far as we had enemies  how should we be more ikely to play a manful part in the coumcils of the world whichn it was our duty to do how were we on these annronchne eccensions to form critics and farreaching de io wnuthority when everybod knvwand it was knoan abroad as well as hereteat tho government of

off a dissolution bat it was when thoe had good reason to think that they would rain in poer and authority mr balfour coqu not declare that he exected or hoped that the approaching dissolution would give the present government a ajority cheers it was a scandal and a danger to tho country as well as a weakness and a dis credit to our political fifo that the government should hang on in the wxy in
