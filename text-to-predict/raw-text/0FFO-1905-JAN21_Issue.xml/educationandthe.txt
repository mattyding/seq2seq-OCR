eld cation and the fopfa tionoffl charactethe fllowig appeal hls been sent to the local ednteadon autborities in dngland and waleswe whose nasnes are undersigned desire to approach you as ono of the looal education authorities of the country to whom a high and responsible task has been entrusted for those who hold controlling power over the education oi the comitry are gaidinxg the destinies of the people we are sure that in this high task youwill be inspied waith the unselfish spirit of an enlightenod patriotism and being assured of this we appeal to you with the more confdence on behalf of what we believe to be the chief end of all tme education the formation of moral chwacterthe supreme importance of this has never been denied and wo rejoice that it has hean clearly nad judicioasly recoginized by the highest public authorities in the intro duction to the recently issued code but in the zeal of other things it has often bwen overlooked and the means of securing it disregarded we thereforoemiost earmestly desire that in all schools effective moral training based upon those christian prinoiples which ought to pervade all teaching and discipline should be provided on this account we trust and have reason to hope that bible teaching fitly graded will bo contiined in tho schools under your care  but you aro mraro e feol sure that experienco has shown that this religious teaching is not sufficient unless supported by influences inspired by tho spirit of that teaching  for principles unless trans lated into liing examnple are of littlo efect in forming those tastes and habits out of which charaeter is builtand without which the build is but poorly equipped to meet the temptations of lifeour anxiety on this matter is all the greater wvhen we contemplate the special dangers to which the youmg in our own day are exposed these aro well known to you and we need not recall the changes in national conditions which hve multiplied these porils it is enough to recall that changed conditions of trade have weakened the sense of responsibility of employers for the young peoplo in their servicothat tho chance of earning wages at an early age has tended to give greator independence to theoung and that in consequence parental aulhority and lome dissipline re lessoned freedom too early acquired and the feverish love of excitement dull and insanitary dwellmigs add zest to the imworthy uttraction and turbli lent play of the streets moral and to a largo extent also physical deterioration is tho result and the savago hooliganism of which wo have heard so muclh is not un likely to followour hope to remedy evs like these lies under god in the opportunity wluch education affords lhlo children are under influence for eight or ten years they are ours to form their character in the most receptive and plastic years of their life  herein is our op rtuitv not onlfor imparting knowledge but for incating thoso habits of sehrestraint true conscientioauiess fidelity hononr and kindness which are neodfal alike for individual self respect and national wellbeing from those habits sprinrs character the best asset it has been said of a nation s wealth the best guarantee of its industrial energy and the strongest bu arirof its esearity we earestly trust therefore that while other objects are pursued this the supreme object of all educationthe formation of character wiu hold the chief place in the aim of local authorities managers and teachersinasmuch as great advantage has resulted from con ferences designed to promote intellectual and technical efficiency we hope that like conferences may be promoted to secure cooperation and efficiency in the moral tram ing inour schools on a christian basisand inspiredby christian motives that the teachers themselves should bo inspired by tho best and highest ideals appears to us to be of the highest importance and we therefore would earnestly and respectfully suggest that in our normal training institutions the true aims of education should ho constantly brought bfore those into whose hands the education of the young will naturally passwe ask youir iodulgencewhlle we clai your sympathy in placing these considertions before you we represent widely divergent views on many mattors connected with the subject and it is understood that in making this appeal we do not surrender our individual ideas of educa tion and educational policy or of the christian teaching denominational or otherwise which we seek to securo we approach the matter in the interests of no denomine tion but in tho interests of the nation and on behalf of the children who will be tho men and women of the next generation and oyn whose moral fibre and character the welfare of the empire will do dtno tmmr and b  fv
