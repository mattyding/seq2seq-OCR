was received with great cordieity welcomed the delegates in the namenof the corporation of london and exprefsed tho opinion that no subject of greater importance could bo raised than thatwbich they had met to consider he trusted that their discussions might be profltable and instructive hear hesrsir jonm gorst in his address said their common bond of union vwas that thoy all felt tho gravityand urgency of the physical condition of the children in our public elementary schools and that they vwero determined to do all in their power to improve it cheers the conference was comprehensive and liberal as wee proved by their choosing a ehairman who was not in favour of the state maintenance of all children but of thoso only who were in need a lingering faith in mothers a growing distrust of publio administration inclined him to the view thatw ith wellnourished children who formed the majority of tho ehildren in our public elementary sehools we had better not meddle but leavo them to the car of their parents and not undertake the charge of them on one point they would be all in accord they would all vindicate and nuphold those legal rights to state main tenance which children already possessed but of which they were iysterdatically defrauded cheers every child was bore into our society with a iight to bo main tained by itr parents in the filrst instance and in dofault of ita parents by the stato to refuse this maintenance was to rob the ehild cheers in the case of a child dependenea did not pauperizo hoar hear there was no such thing as a pauper child people vwho set up as teaehers of the peoplo and said tbat a child had no rights were ignorant of the laws of their country itwassolomnlv decided by thoe court of appeal four years ago in the caso of the  attorneygeneral t hierthyr tyll that the childrea of ablebodied men who refused to work were entitled to relief tbouagh the men themselves were not  and that itwas the duty of tbo public authorityto reliove tho children and taks such measures as the law provided aginst the parents the words of tho master of the rols in giving judgment were children reduced to destitution by the strike it was a striho of colliers in south wales wero entitled to relief under the statuto of elizabeth and there has been no unlawful expenditure of tho poorrates in supporting them the guardians were justifled in relieving the children even of the strikers these were entitled to relief cbeers it appeared from this judgment that no such tbing as a starving child should exist in a public elementary school or elsewohero that if thie public authority had notico of there being such ebildren in a school and did not at once take steps for their relief it would bo liable to indictment for a misdemeanour that the relief must be prompt and bo given before inquiry  and tbat no mis conouctoftheparent could affeetthelegalright ofthe ehild to state maintenance so long as it remained in need o h it ear hear itwas obvious thatthe state whose sacred dnty it was to protect the rights of tho poor and helpless lad been robbing tho children of tho poor and leaving them to perish for the lack of that nisintenance to which they had as viaid a title as any citizen to iis property cheers onr injustie lhid worked out its own pimishment ourxnational system of education was spoilt childreii with starved brains could not learn to press them was sheer cruelty cheers the attempt to teach them failed and leftthemstupidand idiotic alare part of the millions we spend on education was absolutey wasted the penalty wve paid in maintaining these children in nfter life vas tremendous they grew up crippled feeble and diseased tdey filled our hospitals asylums poorhouses end gaols the fewv pounds wo saved by cheating them out of their maintenance as children cost us hundreds in maintaining hem as adults hear hear finally wo degraded and wealened our empire anfl our nation it was the publio interest that our boys and girls should grow np strong healthy intelligent men and women fit to discharge their duty as citizens our injustieo to the cbildren of the poor tainted our people with a crowd of iucapables whose degeneratoe condition tended to tho deterioration of our race cheersmtr josatra hutarcuixsox who was heartily vel comed said he was no alarmist ho did not believe at all in the alleged deterioration of the race and he had had considerable opportunities in the courso of hisprofes sional avocation of gaining some knowledge of it he read an interesting letter in hc times of yesterdav by sir george brtley mp with regard to providing labour for the unemployed sir george bartley was an alarrnist but he produced a number of facts which wero so cheering thlat he should keep the record constantly before him to read whenover ho felt despond ent about the future laughter sir george proved that there had been a large increase in the consumption of beef and of beer tbat wages had gono up and that every ordinary nrticle of life wns cheaper now than it was  years ago his own convictionwas that the world was improving and tbat there was no sort of reason for this clamour s to any probable general deterioration hear hear at the same time thero was room for improve ment steady improveoment was what was wanted and that was what they bad got to arim at as to the states resvonsibilit for the maintenance of childrenbe oxtromely regretted that such a wvide nnd vague expression as  stato niainteuance of children should havo been introduced into tho rosohlition which as to be submitted to the conference because it would be mis understood aud would excito prejudice and alarm lia thought that what the confereneo had met to decide rw not as to tho state maintenanco of children in gencral but whether tho children sbould bo fed whetber the state had any dutv to provide food for the children attending school tundoubtedly he did not wish to diminish parental responsibility but he was one of a g reat number who had come to the conclusion that whilst parents woro in tho main responsible for the upbringing of their children tbhere was still a social duty hv ich the state bad to perform hle wished to acknowledge that part of the provision of children might bo suitably entered upon bv the state it could bo dono better and cheaper if theengaged in it as a social sehemo in which tho stato money as used to assist parents in the upbringing of children it was to tho interest of the stato that some such svstom should be created his own pot scheme was that at all schoolsat which children attended compulsorily meals shouldbeprovidedforalil children wvithout any inquiry whatever cheers he would not stop to aslk how many children who wreo attending sebools wero now underfed but ho thought somo of the estimates had been exaggerated hear hear lie did not think there was a large numbsr he did not thinlk any large number vere after all so poorly fed that it would jastifv any magistrate on inter fering and in taldng public cognisanco of it but as a medical man he thoulghlt a large number of children were not fed in a wav which was appropriate and that they might have much more suitable food provided for theni itt a common table hear hear children instead of trudging home to get wvhat very often wlas not a saitable meal should be ncouraged to stav at school during tho dinner hourwhore a meal sbould be provided at a cormmon table oa assembling at school in tho norning the children shouild be offered some refroiliment he would not say breakfast bht some ligbt refreshment particularly milk which many of them did not get in their homes the money to pay for all this should be raised either by tertates or the taxes that camo upon the conmunityv

conferenceo of delegates from british labour organizations socialist and other bodies declares in favour of state maintenance of children as a necessary corolary of universal compulsory education and as theonly eltectualmeans of arresting that phynical deterioration of the industrial population of this country which is now generally recognized as a grave national danger as a step towards such state maitenance this conference supporting thi decision of tho last txrdeunin cngrss ponthin queston calls upon the government to introduco vithout further cliav nsuchlegislative measues as will

beard of education on the committee on pbesicaldeterioration in wvhich he stated that tho  questfon of feed is at the base of all the evils of ch ild degeneracy and that if steps were taken to ere the proper adequate feeding of the childrenm the evil will rapidly ceaso  he said the evidence before the committee on physical deterioration showed that about two million children attending our elementarv schools went to school either without breakfast at all or with insuticient food it was absolutely essential that the children should be fod ho ywas not going to troublo so much abont where the money was coming from for this purposoeas toisee that the children were fed cheers the primo minister hod declared that it would cost �c per annum to feed the children even if the whole of tno children were fed ho did not believe thev would be able to work out the cost at more than zcoooo per asntunand surely a government that could spend milions and millions of money upon armaments end to

present position end which local authorities themselves to the number of several hundreds had petitioned parliament to give prompt effect to hear hear tho words  state maintenance  would frighten the wits out of a good many people laughter and cheers and would not advanco tho cause which they all had so much at heart his own views were  that no child had any right to go hungry that it the parents could make provision for feeding their  offspring they must do so  that if thev did not mako suco provision either by reason of drunmkcnmess or thriftlessness theymtst bo pursued with the utmost rigour of the lawv and  that if the parerts could not make pro vision through the lack of employment misfortuno or illhealth then at once the stato must mako provision for the feeding of the children without in auywayypauperizingz the parents whose children received such public assist anco cheers he advocated the adoption of tho svstem at work in paris thero tho schools were grouped and a common

for the more they were likely to get it was vital that theyshould get the principle of state maint enance affirmned it would  be calculated to induce some of their timid politicians to say  if we give
