the strike of germais minerssocialist interpeilationrnom ou own cospoxndntjberlin jman in the reichstag today the socialist inter pellation on the miners strike was debated the interpellation caued attention  to alleged evasions of tho mines regulations by the employers  to the breach of contract in volved in the insidious lengthening of the hounrs of labour  to the cancelling of payment for trollies containing dross and  to the effect of the mineowners ring upon prices and the interests of manufacturers and of the publicthe interpellation was introduced by the socialisb deputy for bochum herr hue who gave a very elaborate accounb of the grievances of the miners he stated that after the strilke of may s tho mineowners association had expressly declared that the duration of the shift was to be eight hours including the time occu pied by the descent and ascent scilfahrt as a matter of actual fact miners were now working in various instances nine nine and a quarter nine and onehalf and even ten hours on a shift the cancelling of trollies was in many instances pure chicanery it was a practice uaknown both in england and in the silesian mines it had happened that at one mine  trollies had been cancelled one after the other after giving instances of the brutalityvwhich characterized the foremen in their dealing wvith the miners herr hue appealed to the government to maintain law and justice against the illegal conduct of the employersspeech by tim chancellorcount von billow replied and noted with satis faction that the strike had not yet been accom panied by any disturbance of public order nevertheless he warned the miners against acts of violence which would be suppressed by all the powers of the state in particular he uttered a warning against all intimidation of those who were willing to work he went on to express his disapproval of the breach of contract which had been comnmtted by the strikers when he was somewhat disastrously interrupted by a social democrat deputy who alluding to the chau cellors own recent unconstitutional action in connexion with the estimates for southwest africa exclaimed amid the laughter of the whole left  all that is needed is an indemnity bill count von bhlow then proceeded to bring the prevailing dissatisfaction among the miners into direct connexion with the labour organizations which he maintained were not in germany the products of economic con ditions but the instruments of political parties lie endeavoured to draw a distinction between german and englislh trade unions and mentioned that lassalie or amarx had condemned the leaders of the english unionists because they endeavoured to secure their objects by peaceful means and without strikesthe chancellors observations however were historically and tlheoretically at fault inasmuch as the german social democracy itself is an economic far more than a political partyand has only developed on political lines because the majority of the working classes in germany have been unable to place any confidence in exponents of the existing order of society such as those conservative or liberal members of parliament who in hundreds of instances i represent working class constituencies in england count von billow nevertheless made a debating point when he went on to say that if the socialists had no confidence in the government if they described both the government and the majority of the reichstag as absolutely identified with the interests of the capitalists then there was no sense in appealing by the interpellation to the government and the house he attributed thebstrile largely to the incitements twhich had appeared throughout many years in the socialist press and he urged the house to discuss this grave question with a rational calmness which wtould contrast with the pernicious provocations in which the social democracy indulgedthe minister of commerce herr mciler explained the attitude of the government which would have preferred to remain an impartial spectator but which had been obliged to proffer its good offices owing to the magnitude of the interests involved he was unable to deny that while the representatives of the miners had sub mitted their caso to the government com missioners the mineowners refused to negotiate the attempts of the government to mediate were therefore for the present at a deadlock he re capitulated the preventive measures which the government bad urged before the strike broke out and explained that even at the bruchstrasse colliery where the quarrel had originated the government had indaced the employers to give due warning of the increased time for the descent and ascent which they had been attempting to iotroduce in defiance of their contract with the miners there had been at one time a prospect of an understanding but it had been fristrated by the inflammatory languago of the socialist leaders and their press then against the will of the leaders who only wanteda local strike the movemeylt had suddenly assumed its present dimensions thereby furnishing a proof of the helplessness of the trade unions to control their members he admitted that there had hitherto been no serious disturbance of order and hoped that the situation would remain pacific in con nexion with the cancelling oi troueys he admitted that it had been excessive in somo collieries and promised an inquiryfrom the subsequent remarks of a clerical deputy it became clear that the clericals in this conflict are taking the side of the miners the speaker in question attributed the strike to the action of the employers who represented a remarkably small number of great mineowners and who refused to negotiate even on the invita tion of the government with the representatives of  workmen mention was mado of a contribution of  marks x from arch bishop fischer of cologne for tho relief of distress among the minersthe leader of the conservatives herr von normann laconically declared amid violent interrnptions from the social democrats that his party could not discuss the rights and wrongs of the dispute until the miners who had broken their contract returned to work
