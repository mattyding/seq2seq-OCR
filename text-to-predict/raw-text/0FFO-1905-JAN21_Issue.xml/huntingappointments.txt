exercised by ahipowners in tho transit of cattle it being rmanifestly in their interests to do so  that froni their experience any casualties were mainly dne tocauses altogether outsid of their

loxdoniimgm  the report of lientenantcolonel p g von fdonop rb to the board of trade has been issued setting forth the reslt of the inqmiry into the circumstances in whicha collision occurred on november  near londonbridge station between a train belonging to tho london brighton and south coast railiay company and a light engine bolonging to the southeastern and chatham railway company lieuterantcolonel von donop finds that the principal blame for the accident rests with slxmter flood for not having prevented driver slkimer from running past the signalox at undne speed blat drnior skinmer is also made to bear part of the responsi eility no blame appears to attach to any of the servants of the london brighton and south coast roilway com panv the report states that the backing of a light engine m tho down direction along the southeastern companys up road towards the point wbere it fouls tho brighton companys down lino is a rislkv operation and the onficials of the southeastern and chatham railway company recognize the fact in lientenantcolonel von donops opinion the precautions takentomninimizethe risk are adequate but ho says it is essential that thesrules should be strictly adherd to and that the shunter in charge should be a duly qunalified and trustworthy man lhe suggests that tho position of the diso for shunting thro gh no  points in the up direction should be altered to a place nearer the facin pointtowhichit refersthe teacring of sswmming in erementany scwoonslord meath chairman of the ietropolitan public gardens association has addressed the following letter dated the th inst to tho clerl to the london county council  tho metropolitan publio gardens association has observed with great regret that tho council at its last meotinz reluctantly came to the con clusion that it could not maco the teaching of swimming an obligatorv subject in its schools owving to the lack of adequato bath acconmmodation it has always been one of the recognized objects of the association to encouirage the orection of swimming baths becauso it strongly holds that a knowledge of swimming is not only of great valuo for the saving of life but also is an exercise that tends to promote habits of cleanliness selfreliance and self respect and to improvo the health and physique of tho people in order to do what lies in its power at the pre sent time to further its views on the subject more especially in connexion vith the elementary sclools of the metropolis the association at its meeting on wednes day last at which ipresided pnssed the folloving resolu tion which i was directed to forward to the council ihaving regard to the recent report of the education committee of the london county council that there aro not suifficient swimming baths fo enable swimmning to be taught to the children of the schools under the councils control tho motropolitanprblic gardens association will he glad to contributo a snm of � with a view to thereby assisting in the erection by tho council of a swimming bath or baths for th unso of scholars attending the elementary schools of the metropolis itmaybe said that such a smm will not go far towards maldn good tho existing deficiency but even it it will assist the council to at onco proceed withthe erection of ono swimming bath so placed as to bo adoeuato for the needs of several sebools a grent work lwill havobeen accom plished and the association will bo amply rowarded for its ontlay in tho coursoeof even a single year hundreds of scholars would have been able to acquire a kno wlcdge of swimming and to dorive the benefts accruingthboro from it bas occurred to the association that tthe xpense of providing accommodation vorld be greatly lessened in the case of schools oibich have already been ormay bo built with a central hall such hall at a comparatively small additional cost could itself be adapted as a swimming bath by being furnished with a floor that could he drwn ovor the btai or withdrawn atill the only actnal exense would then be tho formation of the bath itself and the largo outlay on site walls roof o would be saved it is by no means uncormmon for public baths as atpaddingten tobefloored overinthewvintertime so as to be available as gymasia  but probably in the easo of schools which might want to use thlo loor space some times in summer as well as in winter the flooi should be capable of being drawn over or removed from the bath by suitable mechanism at any time i heartilv trnst that the council may see its warto avail itself of the associations offer which it is
