latest intelligenceturkey and the powers by telemapkifrom our correspondentsconstanytinople july the vaguo hopes officially and unofficially ex pressed in western europe that turkey will per haps be wise in time and submit to the moral pres sure of united europe cause a good deal of surprise here both among the diplomatists and in the gene ral public moral pressure not backed by the im mediate prospect of its being followed up if neces sary by material coercion has no longer any influ ence in constartinople and in the present case the turks are becoming more and more convinced that material coercion will not be ermployed the porte has discovered through one of its agents abroad that england has confidentially sounded the powers on the subject and has put forward the idea of a naval demonstration in the neighbourhood of dulcigno but the intelligence has caused no alarm the minister of foreign affairs is reported to have said that any demonstration of the kind would simply have the effect of inciting the albanians to energetic action and the naval authorities are of opinion that a hostile fleet could not inflict much real injury so long as the dardanelles are properly protected by forts and torpedoes the sultan who directs personally the foreign as well as the domestic policy is as impervious to moral pressure as any of his ministers and as incapable of taking a comprehensive view of the situation he is guided chlfly by the fear of immediate consequences and his fears together with all the other influences around himtend to make him offer a dogged resist ance to the will of europe in the first place there is the immediate personal danger of yielding niot only his minister of foreign affairs and other high dignitaries but also a large number of the palace guards on whom he relies for his personal safety are albanians and he is naturally afraid to do anything that might displease them in the second place his policy of resistance has the moral support of the mussulmans generally and even of some christians who think that the conference went much too far in the work of dismembering the empire as this current of public feeling coincides with the sultans own inclinations it is an important factor in the problem and it is very probable that an appeal will shortly be made to it by means of a grand national council similar to that which was held before the war with russia such a national council has for the sultan a two fold advantage it enables him to lay the flattering unction to his soul that he thereby divests himself of all responsibility for ulterior disastrous conse quences and it at the same time strengthens his diplomatic position in the face of europe by afford ing a proof that the policy of resistance is ap proved not only by the albanians but also by all his subjects an assembly of the kind must be of course in a certain sense simply a political comedy for it can do nothing more than confirm and re gister foregone conclusions  but it will if really called together have a grave political significance for the sultan by affecting to consult the national will and to abide by its decisions makes a solemnpublic declaration nor easily retracted and as it were nails his colours to the mast for the mo ment his majesty hesitates to take any decisive step but the native press is allowed to stir up feelings of nlussulman patriotism as an illustra tion of this i may give here a brief summary of a long article which has appeared in the terjimani hakiket the writer who professes to be one of the ulema referring to the rumours about an im perial manifesto having been prepared for the pur pose of exciting the mussulmans against the christians declares that such a manifesto is quite unnecessaryfrom tj beginning of the war with ser via he sa s  down to the congress of berlin all the acts of europe towards us were founded on in justice as the turkish and european press have fully proved diplomatists have talked constantly about the integrity progress and independence of the ottoman empire but we have learned by sad experience what all that really means and have no need of manifestoes to enlighten tis even dumb beasts when led to the slaughterhonse have often a presentiment of their fate the mlussulmans who have lied from europe into asia relate the suffer ings which they have endured hundreds of thousands of refugees made lastyear the pilgrimage to mecca  from them the alussulmans of the most distant countries will learn what islam has to expect from christianity the decisions of the ohristian powers tend to drive us out of europe though the treatv of berlin affected to protect the nlussulmans in the countries where they had ceased to be the dominant race its stipulations in that re spect have remained a dead letter and thousands of them have to flee in order to save their honour and their life our honour and our religion are trampled lnder foot and our property ruthlessly pillaged and when we venture to complain we are accused of falsehood with all these things before our eyes what need have we for manifestoes to convince us that europe desires our annihilation  lf the sultan had really called upon us to take up arms we should have risen as one man and the face of the world would have been changedthis article represents pretty accurately the feelings of the educated mussulmans of stamboul especially those of them who have more or less intimate rela tions with the higher raulks of the officials but the great mass of the people so far as i have been able to discover sbow a wonderful indifference to all political questions and are ready to accept with stoical resignation anything that  kismet  may have in store for themberlin july the news that the porte has already responded to the collective note of the powers is contra dicted in government circles here and it is even believed that some time must still elapse beforeany answer may be expected the reason for this delay may lie in the fact that a very brisk diplo matic intercourse is still going on between the turkish government and the signatory powers in order to come to some understanding in spite of the many difficulties which still exist it is bere hoped that the letter wbich her inmajestythe queen is reported to have written to the sultan vill help to bring about this muchdesired result the ger man press has received this report in a very sym pathetic way and the leading liberal organ the national zeitung comments upon the letter in a very remarkable article in which it is said that queen victoria is certainly the truest friend and counsellor the turkish empire possesses and that the turkish statesmen must have lost every par ticle of common sense if they do not pay the fullest attention to words proceeding fronm such a high and influential quarter queen victoria continues the article has indeed never abandoned the old tradi tions of conservative policy which formerly in duced the western powers to support turkey in the crimean war it cannot be doubted that the revival of this policy by lord beaconsfield was completelyapproved bv the queen and also that on the other hand mr gladstone is obliged to fight his way step by step in order to carry through his policy which has in view the total exs tinction of the turkish empire the life of the prince consort  has conclusively proved what in fluence the queen has always reserved for herself in all foreign affairs and for the last  years no important note has passed through downingstreet which has not been perused by her miajesty in all important and critical moments the queen has personally taken the initiative but if her majesty has now written a letter to the sultan this has of course not been done without the knowledge of lord granville the porto has indeed concludesthis artiole very good reason to listen to tb e warn i ing words of her last and best friend all the more as the queen is undoubtedly fully acquainted with the intentions of mr gladstone and sir charles dilke in case the porte has resolved on further re sistancethe government press continues to entertain hopeful views on the development of eastern afiairs although it confesses that during the last few days much alarming news has been in circula tiorl tho loyalty of the porte is much doubted and it is not believed that the good understanding now existing between the powers will continue the government organs complain much of such reports being so inopportunely circulated for by systematically doubting the duration of the euro pean concert and by showing that every power has different aims in the east the porte and the moslems will be brought to believe that the mea sures of coercion proposed by the powers cannot be of a serious nature the porte will likewise be strengthened in its resistance by the tone of a great part of the foreign press which is regarded by the german government papers as being in spired by a desire to prove that it would be wiser not to expect great results from the maritime de monstration the latter project has indeed been accepted in principle by all the powers but negotiations are still going on regarding the ques tions of detail it is said that the commanderin chief of the united squadron will be appointed by one of the western powers but the question as to the nature of the instructions to be given to him will give rise to many difficulties for it will not be possible to give very strict and decided instruc tions on the contrary it will be necessary togrant a certain freedom in case of unforeseen events in this respect neither austria nor germany seem to be inclined to agree to any measure by which the maritime demonstration mightbe changed intoareal decisive action it will appear however to people here somewhat ridiculous if it should turn out that the powers have resolved to arrange only a prome nade for their ironclads in the mediterranean all will therefore depend on the further development of affairs in constantinonleparis july  ithe rappel is one ofithe last papers one would expect to be in the secrets of crowned heads but it professes to bave received information from the best sources at constantinople to this effect an autograph letter was addressed by queen victoria to the sultan ten days ago in which after speaking of her personal sentimentsshe reminded him of tbe unequivocal proofs of sympathy uniformly given by england to turkey since the commencement of his reign for the sake of these recollections and of the wellunderstood interest of the ottoman em pire the queen imdlores the sultan to respond by a conciliatory attitude to the wish of the powers and thus insure the maintenance of peace queen victorias letter concludes by an appeal to the honour of the turkish government which after having signed at berlin the cession of the terri tory now claimed by greece cannot leave that treaty unexecuted the rappel believes but cannot vouch for itthatthe sultan has replied tothe queen simultaneously with his ministers communicating his fresh proposals to the powers
