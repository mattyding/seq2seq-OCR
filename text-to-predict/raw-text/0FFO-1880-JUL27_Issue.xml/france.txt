fra nceparis mon day july   pma quarrel has arisen between the municipality of cherbourg and admiral ribourt the maritime prefect which may possibly interfere with al grevys visit during which an english squadron it is believed would pay him the compliment of ap pearing in the roads the admiral refused to allow the marines to march through the town after the distribution of flags yesterday in consequence of which the procession of the other troops was countermanded  while the mayor prohibited the erection by the admiral of a special stand at the review for his subordinates and friends though offering to accommodate them on the municipal stand the admiral retaliated by not going to salute the municipal tribune the municipality threatens to resign unless the admiral is shifted to another post and the mayor has come over to paris today and stated his grievances first to m gambetta and next by the latters advice to m grevy who has promised that the cabinet shall consider them tomorrow this tempest in a teapot has broken out just when the difficulty as to the joint visit of m grdvy and m gambetta had been arranged the mayor first invited them both m grevy pleaded inability to go m gambetta ac ceptod thereupon m grevy was induced to change his mindbeing told that after compliment ing the army he ought not to overlook the navy next m leon say was urged to go though he had not been invited not from any disrespect for the president of the senate but because m gambetta had been invited not as president of the chamber but as the republican leader unless m say went there would as was pointed out be an appearance of rivalry between m gambetta and m grvy whereas if he went m grdvys superior rank as president of the republic would be marked by his being accompanied by the presidents of the two chambers this is so far satisfactory but it is evident that m gambettas prompt acceptance of the invitation has induced or obliged both m grvy and m say to go rather against their will the obvious moral is that invitations to municipal festivities should not be accepted by the president of the chamber without inquiring whether the two other presidents have also been invited and what answer they intend to give m gambetta cannot divest himself at will of his presidential functions and even when not invited in virtue of them he must act as if he were or there will be danger of a semblance of rivalry with his titular superior m grevy or his titular equal m sayfresh orders have been given to french ambas sadors and consuls to facilitate the return of the amnestied communistsm rochefort who read his last nights speechhsm not inserted in the report in his owsn paper the phrase which he uttered on a voice exclaiming that millire and cremieux had been assassinated  oui et nous les vengerons esperonsle lneither interruption nor reply appears in his paper it is understood morcover that he wishes to attend as few meetings as possible and to con fine himself to his journalistic duties the reac tionary papers eagerly reprint his speeoh feeling that he is their coworker in opposition to the re publicm rochefort has been asked by two arab sheiks condemned to imprisonment after the al gerian rising of  to obtain for them the benefit of the amnesty they are still interned in corsica but it seems clear that the amnesty applies to them
