thb law of vacciyationa deputation of members of the british lmiedical assoeia tion claiming to represent not onlythe parlianentary bills committee of that association the duty of which is to supervise all bills affecting the medical profession intro duced into parliament but also the general body of the association comprising among its members nearly half of the practising medical men in the united kingdom waited upon the xight hon j g dodson president of the local government board yesterday afternoon at wtviteball to make representations on the subject of the vaccination acts amendment billamong the principal members of the deputation were sir j w lubbock mp sir t lawrence mi p mr erring ton mip dr lyons mp yr g w hastings ip colonelalexander mp mr farqubarson p sir t

habershon guys blospital  dr w a guy kings college hospital dr playfair and inr ceely aylesburymr hastings mp introdiuced the deputation to the president of the local government bord as repre senting a body of upwards of oo medical men as a member of parliament he objected to the principle that any subject might escape the inciuence of the laws of the realrm by making a money payment if the vaccination act were an error the short course would be to repeal it but so long as it remaiaed on the ntatute book it ought to be enforced thoogh with modera tion and judgment he had heard a good deal as to the popular feeling against the vaccination act but he had not been able to ted that any such feeling existed the constituency he represented was tolerably numerous tcre being aboutdrvoters on the register at the last election but the number of persons who had expressed a wish that he should vote against the vaccination act was aboutthree he thought that the outcry had been ezaggerated as to its extent and intensitydpr lyons spoke as representing ireland and ir fadt quiiaron as representing scotlandmr i nest ilart stated that he had a list of  gen tlemen whohad written to him to express their strong regretthat ovingto the hour of meetingand tbe sbort notice they were unable to be present he had received a letter from sir w jenner in which be said i regret extremely tbatl cannot attend on the th the bill is so absurd that i can scarcely conceive it will be come law instead of a fine of s if ir dodson deter minesto carry his measure would it not be better that any one sb ould have a licence from the inland reveuue office to go unvaccinated  then one would get a licence at lha same time that one got a licence for dogs hoses c this certainly would be moresimple and would ia time yield a revenue to the state licences might also be granted for a suitable sum for drunkenness c and tten people would not be fned as often as they now are s i think if a man paid s at the beginning of the year he would have a seasonticket for drunkenness and a season ticket for spreading smallpoxsir  burrows had also written to say that he much re gretted that he could not attend the deputation on this question the profession had spoken with no uncer tain sound the royal colleges of physicians and sur teons as well as the british medical assocation and other associations of medical men throughout the kingdom had expressed their oppositiol to the principle of the government bill the medical profes sion felt teat were zhe bill to become law the first blow would be given to the system of compulsory vaccination in this country formerlythegreatbulk of the smailpoxdeattis were among children but since the law had provided a ma chinery for looking up each child from its birth till it was vaccinated the proportion of smallpox deaths at different agres had completely changed if this bill were to pass no one could foresee the suffering and mortality that would ensue if smallpox again became epidemicdb cttdwick and dx baxonoi also spoke and were followed by d quan whogavethe opinionof the college of physicians in the language of a petition to the house of commons in which they declared that  the bill in question would if it became law he certto cause the spread of smallpox to the great detriient of the public they also feel justified in expressing a confa dent belief that by insuring a more careful and efficient performance of vaccination and by carrying out with still further stringency the compulsry provisions of the vre sent law smallpox might eventually be exterminated and the ravages of one of tne most loathsome nnd fatal diseases by whicb humanity has ever been anaicted become a thing of the pastmir rsas wilson spealing on the part of the col lege of surgeon would simply say that they were all of one mind on the question and that this bill ought not in the sense in which it was intended to become lawmr ceely aylesbury added a few words in support of the objects of the deputation and was followed bysix jon lubbockc mp who said there was no ques tion on which they could expect unanimity of opinion but there was hardly any case in which there was such a pre ponderance of opinion as in that of vaccination if this bill were passed into law he believed it woaul cause a very profound feeling of dissatisfaction he very earnestly hoped that her majestys government wluld reconsider the matterand onder over the argurnents brought forward that day to which so much force must be given owing to the tery eminent authorities by whom those arguments had been put forwardmr dodssow wished first of all to remove any misappre hension which mnight exist that he had any feeling or as far as a laymran miight speak any doubt as to the value of vaccination and the best proof he could give was in bis own persox for he had been repeatedly revaccinated and heannd his whole household were revaccinated a few years ago when the epidemic was raging bat he would not at tribute the introduction of the bill to any feelilr of his own he perfectly agreed with sir john lubbock and other gentlemen that the prevalent feeling in the cundtry was decidedly in favour of vaccination and he hearily re joiced that it was so the question however before them was whether the law as it stood promoted vaccination or whether it acted the reverse way and that was a question of experience he thought it was scarcely fair to attack the bill on the ground that people wvould be allowed to escape the operation of the law by a money payrment and that thatwould be tlhe effectof thebill that was tihe law as it stood any one might escape the operation of the law by a money payment and the antivaccinators instead of going to prison escaped the law by money payments the law was that if a man did not really bring his child for vaccination he might be fined and there was no further power to compel him it had been asked lwhether yon would allow a drunken man to purchase an indulgence for drunkenness by money payment but if a man got drunk he was fined for his act the cases were not absolutely parallel it was said that a moan was compelled to drain his house whether he thought it necessary or not that was perfectly true but they would hllow that there was an essential difference between a man being compelled to do an act with reference to his house and requiring a man to submit his child to a particular operation which he might think perhaps wrongheadedly injurious to him and to the child upon whom it was proposed to be performed the letter of sir wilriam jenner was a very sbort way of turning the bill into ridicule jldiculum acrifortius ac melius magnas plerumque secat resridicule was a very powerfal weapon but it might not always be the best guide to truth when a man took out a licence to do a thing he purchased the privilege of doing a thing which might be otherwise condemned but as the right was treated as a privilege it required the payment of a specific money payment iaking out a licence was not however the same thing as submitting to a penalty the billsaid thatbif aperson hadhbadthe full penalty of s once indicted upon himhe should not he fined again but if the full penalty was not irfaicted in the first instance le emainedliable nuder another clause to be brought up by the vaccination officer before a magistrate and fined under one clause a nanwas liable to a penalty if he did not bring his child to ba vaccinated i the full penalty was not in flicted lemight be asked to show cause why an order should not be made for his child to be vaccinated he was liable to be fined twite and brought before the magis trates he nas reminded that comnpulsory vaccination was established in  in  it was provided that neglect to take the child for vaccination within three months or in scattered districts a longer period was an offence for which the parent could be proceeded against sutnmarily and for which he was iable to a penalty not exsceeding s the proposition of the bill was not a new one in the fbill of  appeared the very proposition made in the present bill wvhen the clause containing it was passed in the house of commons he could not call to mind but he did not think that any strong and organized opposition on the part of the medical profession was then maderir bairthe bill came on late in the rouse of commons and the opposition was made in the rouse of lordsir dodsonthe bill passed through the house of commons and the clause was thrown out in the rouse of lords at all events the proposition which seemed to have stirred up so many members of the medical profes sion was not put before the country forthe first time hr mlight say that is predecessor inthatofficewhoreprasented the late loverument though lhe did not bring in a bill felt as much as he hir fodson did the dificulties that were caused by the injudicious infliction of multiplied penalties and he issued a circular letter in which be strengly recom mended the exercise of great caution in the infliczion of penalties and directed that the vaccination oieter ibould not proceed in the way of multiplied penalties until he had brought tha circumsttances of the cabse under the notice of the bsoard of guardians the question wae which was the best expedient for securing the greatest amount of vaccina eion lt appeared to him that where they had cases in which the same man had been fined  times andl more and yet the child remained unvaccinated and would remain unvaccinated probably if the parent were fined  times o times this was not advancing the law that was only making a martyr of a man as to imprisonment a man was liable to imprisonment if he did not pay the fine now the opinion of many gentlemen was that compulsion ought to be direct and not indirect manyarguments went on the supposition tbat vaccination was compulsor whereasifthechild were not vaccinated the parent paid the penaltyris own desire was toseevaccination promoted snd renderedas universalaspossiblethroughout thecountry the question was one of expediency as to the execution of the law thedeputation migit be sure that their atguments
