thle gowbrnment of hospitalsrrgor a coxrmsponndertthe lamentable history told by dr habershon in his letter aboit guys hospital in is times of saturday wilt surely he sufiicient to raise the question of the relative advantages and disadvantages of different forms of hospital government wvhen benevolent persons combine to furnish the funds for a new institution they may not unreasonably claim to control itsoperations as they see fit but when a hospital is maintained by an income derived from the bene factions of donors long since deceased it would seem that the interest of the public in its being administered upon sound principles is undeniable and is almost proportionate to the amount of the endowment the three largest and wealthiest hospitals of londonguys st thouass amd st bartholomevseach possessing an independent income not far short of s a year or possibly eaceeding that sum are governed upon principles which if it were for the fist tinme propcsed to applythem to hospitals in the present day wvould consigu the originator of such a proposition to safe custcdy ia bedlam the socalled  governors  are a small body of parsons mostly of good social position but wvith no necessary knmowledge of hospital management and the absolute power whichi they collectively possess is wielded for thcem by au oficial caled tle treasurer who is elected by themselves from among their body and is regarded as their representative this treasurer is practically an autocrat for although the governors in general rameting mnight reverse his decisions they take care never to do so apparently because they regard hirm as  ga lman who mnust be supported at all hazatrds against any interference from those whose sole claim to interfere rests upon such trivial grounds as know ledge or responsibility the office of treasurer to a great hos sital is one that is eagerly sought by city man partly on accunt of the influence which it gives partly on ac count of mtte remnuneration direct or indirect wbich may accompany it it used to le said of a former teasurer not of guysthat although his position was supposed to be honorary it was lis custom to mlakc ali the trades people of the hospital give i months credit for their itc counts the result of which course res that he bad always a year s income of the lospital in the bands of his private barnkers the latte treasurer of st thonmass by utterly refusing to listen to the advice of those who lknew what they wore talking about built the new hospital at a cost of about ï¿½ and thus crippled for an indefinite number of years the natural oporatiols of rho charity in which only about half the beds are occupied and in which the governors are trying to tid ovcz their difficulties by the temporary reception of  paying patients at guys itself the recent fluawcal administration has been so le plorable that notvithstanding the great wvealth of the foundation it lies been necessary to close beds for want of funds and yet the treasurer at this very conjuncture is said to hare found it pssible and to bave thought it proper to expeend oo oa tle improvement of his official resi deceit should always be remembered i think that the pur poses of a mnetropolitan hospital are tvvofoldthe treatment of the sick and the education of medical practi tioners this being so the controlling authority of a hos pital is caled upou to make provision for the best possible treatment of the sick aud for the best possible instruction of medical studants  and where the claims of these two dbiects come into appareut conflict he has to determine how they may best be reconcilecd ith the smallest sacrifice of either to lo this requires not only knowledge but knowledge of a very special kind and such indeed as in the nature of thinsgs can hardly be possessed by any person it is difficelt even to conceive the existence of a person wvho shoald be sufficiently acquainted with the re guiremauts of nedical treatment with the requirements of medical education and with the organization of a great lstablishlmaent to be able even if he were willing usefully atnd without bundering to enactthe part of an irrespoasible despot in a metropolitan hospital the only po sibility of good government must be sought by combining the know ledge of several persons and by dividin the responsibility of the decisions at which they arriveatn attempt of this kind is made in some hospitals by depuling the govennent to a committee but this plan although it is better than having an autocratic tea surer etill leaves iucli to be desired committees are apt to be comlposed of thc idlest and most crotchety governors of the institutioun and when they display their incompe tence there is often a fecling among the other governors who hbre electzd then because they were aske t to do so tlat the committee must be upported at au costs again thu committees rarely contain the necessary element of medical knowledge and for want of this they often rommit themslcves to the adoption of schemes which the first words of any instructed doc or wouldl scatter to the winds they develoi with iuflihite pains some project which is utterly preposterous and thea they become furious with th doctors lecause these as soon as they hear vlac is in conltempla tion declxare that it cannot be zarried outthe b st conceivahle form of lospital government is i beliave that which exists at st georges the governors are a numerous body practically consisting of all who subserbe as much as fivn guineas a year to the institution anm they meet as a  weekly board every wednesday to this lord every governor is entitled to come  and when be is ther ha is entitled to speak and vote upon any question vhch may he brought forward the medicl ofllicas of the lhospital are governors like others by vii tue of theic subscriptions not esx qocli and they also come and epraki or vote as they please as a rule the boatd meeting is composed of a small number of go vernos ho acteed regularly and are conversant with the routine business so that they represent all the useful ness of a conmit tee thc loctors or some of them are maaly always present and thlus if any suggestion of which they disapprove is brought forward they ara able at the very beginniug to explain the liglt in which it appears to them if auy swleping change were to be attempted governors whbo scldom attend wvound cotme for tbo special occasion to surport o to oppose it the result of all this is that although tle nwedical staff are a small minority among the governors as a body they have opportunities of being berd which are deuied to theon elsewhere and they bring theirs ecial experience of hospital requireaments to bear upon the beginning of every important discussion they are not liable to have great changes initiated withoat their knowledge and coniatied in defaace of their helpless pro testsamon otlier things done in a hospital is nursing the business of a nurso is to assist tha physician or surgeon by carryiug ont his directions with re tard to the bodily position of the patient his per sonal cetnliucss the administration of food or medi cine and other such
