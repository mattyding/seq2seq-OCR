oclock in the afternoonhaving been put in the bath about  in the morning she said i have not been able to get warm since he was feeble and half crying and it was only in a disconnected manner that her statement was made ec sat down an the bed in order to hear what she said as she spoke in a low tone of voice le immediately said there weee students going round with him at the time  this statement must be inquired into and he sent for the sister of the ward and told her that this case must be fully inquired into he desired the house physician who was present to get a fuluer statement from the patient and also to get information from the other patients in the ward he did so because he did not know at the time but that it might be some delirium on the part df the patient wvhen witness next visited the ward on the th of july the house physician said he had found bruises on the patients body and that from what he bad learnt he had felt it necessary upon his own responsibility to commu nicate on the subject with the treasurer wvitness then made an examination of the patient and found bruises on the arms and on the left leg she appeared to be under the influence of a powerful mental shock up to that time there no febrile or inflamnmatory symptoms he made a special visit on the followving day in fact with the exception of the sunday before she died lie isited her daily on the sth

upper part of the left lung indicative of the existence of consumption of old standing aud not in an active state having described the condition of the brain he said he considered that the condition of the brainl was the cause of death that condition of the brain he should think wvas not antecedent to the th of julythe coronerthat is to say it arose after the bath  it arose after the baththe cobosebtwhat would yen call it tubercular and inflammatory disease of the brainbeing asked to say what in his judgment this arose from witness explained at some length tne conditions under which sucl a state of disease might be developed in the brain in his judgmnent the cold bath and the excitement of getting the patient to it might in ker state of health be aprobable cause of the state of the braia he thought the patients death was hastened by what occurred on the th he did not sav that she would not have died wlithout this but she died sooner than she would have done under ordinary circumstances under the circum tstances it would have been proper to cleanse the patient but not to keep her in the bath for such a timethe cononewould the nurse ingle have authority or be permitted of her own accord to give a patient a bath without the consent of a superiorwituessi should consider that a nurse ought not to be permitted to give a patient a bath of her own accord but lately nurses
