for the interest le had all along evinced in the undertakingdr glover alluding to the awvard of ï¿½ to the east bourne convalescent hospital drw the councils attention to the fact that a patient there had been desired to go against her will to the confessional and had received a manual of instruction in which under the head of  sins against alrmighty god was classified the attendance at a dissenting place of worship thze girl in question hap pened to be a wesleyau as wrere al her family and oni telling the sister so the reply was that then sh e must leave her people ee dr clover had also heard of two caes in which unknown to their relations patients bad been bap tized as a convalesceut iastitution le as a subscriber knew of its merits but he thought such abuses as le had danoted should not be countenanced by a fund collected in discriminately from all sects and denomitiationsis is ryyjnety avtreusrlowreplied that tho statement took him by surprise the distribution committee of course only wvent into the merits of the institutions as hospitals and did not investigate their religious tendencies the hospital in question was under xoyal patronage mnd among the managing committee were eminent medical men slch as sir wv jeuner sir james paget sir george burrows and mr rrichsen these were he thought guarantees of the efficieucy of the hospital as such and the accounts and mangeinent were from that point ot view satisfuctory he wisled dr glovers complaint had reached the distributiom committee in time to have the matter in vestigated but the subject should not lbe lost sight of next yearsir francis lycirt thought that that was not enough and rs the award had not b eu paid over ie moved thiat payment of it be deferred until the distribution committee had investigated the complaint made by dr glovermr cihisty seconded this and it wvas carried unani mouslywith that exception the distribution committees re port vas adopted and a very cordial vote of thanks to the lord mayor for the aid he hai d rendered to the fund closed the procedings
