addressing tie gentlemen cadets said it was highly gratifying to receive such favour able reports both from the directorgeneral of militaxy education and the governor of the royal military academy of their proficiency and good conduct the long period of hard work which they had undergone witheut a vacation was against a very high examination but in spite of au disadvantages they had done credit to the academy their instructors and themseles muck of thia result he ascribed to the late governor sir john ady whose loss at the academy shough he was still useful in another vocation he personally re gretted having always recognized the ability and efficiency with which he had conducted its affairs the masters and professorshadhadahard time of it and he was glad to bear from the new governor his friend general browne that he had already experienced great support from the staff of the institution such as wvas invariably given to its hief a great college of this description de pended to a grea extent upon the efficiency and zeal of its officers and teachers and having these the cadets must be in fault themselves if they did not turn out well the aicademy was in fact progressing most favourably at one time it was subected to some criticisak which ho could not say was always fair but it was certainly now in no fear of criticism his royal bighness then impressed upon the gentiewen cadets the importance of the duties tney were about to assume and pointea ont the oppor tunities of distinction and advancement which lay before them of late years he said many efficers of the army and especially of che ordnance corps had occasion to diszidguisn tnanseives n tue nela or niaal obtained odenings to advancement and hoaour in the liploinaticrervice yoeug men could not hope to win suca positions imme diately but if they worked diligently the same openings and advantages would be theirs nereatter the reason ne mentioned the subject now was lest any of them might tink that they had no occasion to continue their work when they left the academy and that the future wras only play tthey must go on wurldng for nothing stood still the art of war was constantly improving and neglect or study would not succeed  man who wsouid get on rust work always and opportuwities would come to those vho sought thm ele wvas happy to lnoiv that tbis sentiment was appreciated in the army and in no branch of it more fully mhan in the scientific corps the members of which by their studies and trainiogin this academy obtained a foot ing which properly applied would ineyitably raise them to prominent positions he warned the young officers not to forget the men intrusted to them and to begin by being good soldiers themselves sonme men who were very scientific ttought that the mihitary soldier wasasecond consideration but in his opinion it was of the firstim portance that botn officers and men should have a thorough and practical knowledge of their military duties it wss imperativethey shonldknowtheir duties as soldiersfor with out this no oibcer could be selected by the authorities for a responsihie position especially he enforced the necessity of discipline as an essntial guality in officers and men this combined with spirit eid zeal and the knowledge tiney had acquired would enable them to achieve hoanor and succeed in the honornrable career before them lie was very pleased that so good a class was going ont and that nader such disadvantges they had producedsuchgood results lle hoped that taey would bear in mind his ad vice and work hard t obtain success
