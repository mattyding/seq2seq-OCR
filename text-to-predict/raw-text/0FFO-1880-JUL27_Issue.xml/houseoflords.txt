and the births and deaths registration ireland bill were read a second timewild birds proteotion law amendmentbilllord aberdare in moving the second reading of this bill said that its object was to consolidate and partially amend the four acts that had from time to time been passed for the protection of wild birds it would not materially alter the existing law except by prohibiting the destruction between the st of march and the ist of august of the birds mentioned in the schedule the cruel opera tions of the professional birdcatchers would be prevented but as doubts were entertained as to the good or harm done by some kinds of the birds in question sufficient powers were reserved to landowners and their authorized agents to kill them if necessary he moved the second reading of the biuthe earl of aberdeen thought that the bill was likely to be useful and that in some respects it might have been advantageously made more stringent he was sure that singing birds were rapidly disappearing from many parts of the country and was glad as they had many enemies that it was proposed to secure them against their human foes larks in particular seemed to be diminishing in numbers and ought to have been included in the schedule of the billthe earl of dartrey observed that in ireland regulations such as those now proposed were often disregarded he recommended that instructions should be given to the police in order to enforce the lawthe duie of argyell wondered who bad drawn up the schedule of the bill it must have been prepared by somebody who did not know anything of the birds to which it referred nearly onebalf of the names of birds were synonyms for instance the lapwing was also entered as the pewit ie also found in the schedule one or two birds of a very destructive character this schedule was made up of a mixture of schedules in previous acts of parliament without any examination as to the comparative importance or value of the birds in  an act was passed for the first time for the preservation of sea birds alone and a good deal of the present schedule was copied literally from it in  another act was passed which related to certain wvild land birds notbing could be more absurd than the schedule of that act it was founded upon no principle whatever in  a third act of par liament was passed relating to certain rwild fowls which were staple articles of trade and food he thought that a bill for the protection of all birds during the breedin season would be useful he shottld not move to amend the schedule to the present bill for although it was absurd it was harmless with that exception he thought the bill would be of great value and he hoped it would be passedlord walsinghaii recommended this bill to their lordships favourable consideration for a second reading re did not know who drew up the schedule but the object of including the same bird under different names was that it should be known by its local name in different places though he granted that this bill was a considerable ex tension of the former acts he could not quite admit what was stated by the noble lord who introduced itviz that it was as strong as those acts l ere still it was a very desirable bill and though perhaps the object of its pro moters would scarcely be fully realized if they wished to reintroduee rare birds which were almost extinct it migbt iave the effect of saving some kinds of birds which other wise would become extinctthe lord chancellor suggested that it was worth his noble friends while to consider whether some birds such as the woodpecker and the lingfisher should not be included in the schedule that were now omitted from itthe earl of powis called attention to the manner in whicl the bill would affect persons who kept wild ducks to be turned out to decoy one of the clauses would make a person who bad any of the scheduled birds in his posses sion after the th of march equally liable with a person who had killed such birds after that date it appeared to hin that the clause would so operate that a private owner would be obliged to destroy all those birds before the close date or eise turn them outthe bill was read a second timethe educational endowments scotland bill was read a third time and passedevictions in ireland replying to the ealu of limnerickearl spencer said the government were not respon sible for the formn in which the returns relating to landlord and tenant ireland were presented these having been moved for by noble lords opposite they did not perhaps sufficiently explain themselves but he would endeavour to make clear their purport he believed the  decrees granted  and  decrees executed  were not for nonpay ment of rent merely but included ejectments from other causes wvith regard to the proportion of cases for non payment of rent compared wvith others he begged to refer the noble lord to certain statistics of  from which it appeared that in  out of  districts in ireland the eject ments for nonpayment of rent were to the others as oi to  generally speahing these returns related to rural dis tricts  they related only to a limited extent to towns and this small urban element he believed it was almost im possible to excludeirelief of distress ireland billearl spencer on rising to move that the relief of distress ireland act s amendment bill be read a second time explained that the measure was designed merelyto carry oat one introduced by the late government iu the spring of the present year the present government on coming into office found that the sum of money which the public works commissioners in ireland were allowed to advance to landowners sanitary authorities and pre sentment sessions was totally inadequate to meet the loans applied for there had been applications from those various authorities for about ï¿½ whereas the amount placed at the disposal of the commissioners was only ï¿½ the government thought it advisablein fact felt themselves boundto execute the contract which their predecessors had virtuauy entered into with the landlords and the present bill was intended to carry eut their obligations inl that respect it was proposed to em powver tho church commissioners to advance an additional sum of ï¿½l making a total of ï¿½ wbich it vas thought would be sufficient for all the purposes contem plated by the former act and by the present bill the landowvners had applied for ï¿½ up to the th inst ï¿½ had been advanced to them and since that time ï¿½ their lordships would observe that the amount advanced fell very far short of that asked for but it was believed thbt she full amount asked for would nut be required the sanitary authorities had applied for ï¿½ jp to the  th inst ï¿½ had been advaned to them andsince thenï¿½ altogether a sum of ï¿½ had been advauced lo landowners and sanitary authorities with regard to the baronial sessions there had been sanc tioned up to the present time loans amountingto ï¿½ and advances amounting to ï¿½ hadactually been made he thought he might say that those works had already effected very considerable good and notably in county roscommon the amount given in the shape of outdoor relief had been greatly diminished in consequence of the employment of large numbers of men under tke action of the baronial sessions ble would in the next place tell their lordships wvhat was the amount of distress now pre tailing in ireland on the lth of july  there were  persona receiving outdoor relief whereas on the th of july in the present year the number wvas  showing an increase of  those figures proved that there was a great increase in the amount of the distress in the country and he might perhaps mention that of the  wfho had obtained relief  had been relieved under the act which had been passed at the beginning of the year the bill he might add gave permission to the local government board if a union became bankrupt to mtake agrant up to the sum of ï¿½ but up to the present time there had happily been no necessity for such a grant and he rather hoped that no such necessity would no arise it had however been deemed iadispensable in the event of the distress continuing to give those very exceptional powers to unions in order to meet theexi gencies of an actual increase of famine the bill also pro vided for the extension of the power to give outdoor relief to ablebodied persons in irelaud from the st of december next to the following st of mlarch it wras deemed expe dient to do that because otherwise the next session might come en and find the country ia a bad state with ao time for getting a renewal oe the aat which mould expire at the close of this year tee bill would further give ficilities to boarda of guardians to borrowr money for the purposes bï¿½f outdr relief r t suqh imtroyd terma and thewere aew offered the same facilities as were given to the landlords under the act of the late government the number of years allowed for the repayment of the loans had been extended to  or  and the rate of interest had been reduced to  per cent these figures disposed he thoughtof that part of the question which related to boards of guardians the sanitary authority and the presentment sessions and he now came to that portion of the measure by which important powers were conferred for the relitf of dlistress in certain districts the biil contained a provision enabling the board of wirorks to make advances for fishery piers if an individual or the public would provide a quarter of the cost the treasury might grant the rermaining threequarters in order to mneet the large canadianl grants given with the viewv of having those particalar wforks carried out in ireland the bill proided certain facilities for preliminary notices which were of rather too compli cated a nature for him to enter into at that moment there were xome other provisions in thebillgivingthe boards of guardians power to levyaratefortherepay ment of the money that was required under the seeds act and which permitted the levying of the rate to be postponed for one year another provision of the bill was that which empowered the boards of guardians to sell seed to the tenants but which did not restrict them to one acre for any particular crop but enabled them to arrange that two acres tnigst be devotea to a crop there was in addition power taken for thie purpose of making grants for the completion of certain railroads and tramways in ireland as their lordships were awvare a great many railways which had been commenced in that country had never been finished and it had been deemed a proper opportunity to aid in their completion when so many people stood in need of em ployment there were certain railroads mentioned in the schedules but it did not follow that au those which were so scheduled would receive assistance but only those which the board of works and the treasury might deem it desirable to aid he did not thiak it was necessary thut he should detain their lordships on that occasion with any further remarks he thought they would be disposed to pass a bill which would he hoped enable the government and the local authorities to meet the distress which pre vailed in different parts of ireland without having its operation accompanied by many of the evils which on former occasions attended the legislation which had been framed with a similar object fear hear the noble earl concluded by moving the second reading of the billthe earl of liiercek pointed out that under the operation of clause  the money which was to be advanced for the purposes of railways would be levied on a barony not in the shape of county cess but as a poorrate and would as a consequence be divided between landlord and tenant a landlord might receive a head rent of only ï¿½ a year on a property which might be worth ï¿½ or ï¿½ a year yet under the clause he would have to pay half the money on account of its being levied as a poerrate that was a point which he would suggest was entitled to the further consideration of the governmentthe earll of leitrimi hoped the noble earl who had charge of the bill would carefully consider the suggestions oe the noble earl below the gangwayearl spencer pointed out that the late  overnment were responsible for the division of the rate between the
