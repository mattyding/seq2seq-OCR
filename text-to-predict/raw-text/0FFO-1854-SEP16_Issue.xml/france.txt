to apprehend him when he absconded and left for basle under a false name the government gave notice to the authorities of his arrival and he was arrested on alighting from the diligencethe ipzpendance beige publishes the following letter dated parma th instaccording to the disclosures made by one of the per sons sentenced to death for participation in the revolt of july and whose penalty has been commated into  years imprisonment the real assassin of the duke charles iii is a man named carra who arrested under that charge was liberated for want of proofs and embarked at genoa for the united states of america csrra after the perpetration of the crime succeeded in reaching the ramparts and making his escape into the country after wandering about for some time he returned to parma at the gate of the city ho quietly conversed with one of the customhouse officers on duty whom he knew and who related to him the circumstances of the murder of his sovereign this person well known to the police was arrested and tried by courtmartial he however easily proved an alibi and was restored to liberty by a strange eoincidence carra bears a remarkable resemblanceo to bocechi which accounts for the magistrates persisting in regarding the latter as the murderer of the dake the good faith of the customhouse officer may have been the more easily surprised as carra bore no marks of the crime he had committed he had had fuu time to recover his selfpos ession and you may remember that not a drop of blood oozed out of the wound of the unfortunate duke a fresh inquiry wil shortly be opened
