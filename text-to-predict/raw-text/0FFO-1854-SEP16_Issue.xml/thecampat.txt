the camp at bovloxnefrom our owe reportxrsboulogne szrr the contemplated manceuvres on the line of road from st omer by eseceuilles and desvres yester day terminating today in the attack and capture of boulogne itself have not taken place and it is now said stand postponed till the emperors return from the south of france as far as conclusions can be safely drawn from his movements he intends to do something of the kind but when exactly or how no one can say it does not at au folow that the circumstances which connect his name rather ludicrously with the idea of an attack on boulogne should have any influence in deterring him from making such a demonstration for he has more than once taken occasion to show that he is not at all ashamed of acts in his life at the time universauy condemned as foolish meaiwhile however the mixed population of this favourite wateringplace have breathing space afforded them from the terrors of the impending siege  but it is due to them to state that never did inbabitants of tbreatened town or city display greater composure with such a prospect of assault and military violenee imminent whether this proceeds from a well founded confidence in the security of the english alliance or from any other cause must of couirse remain doubtfal the emperor although his plans are changed or have perhapsbeen misapprehended has not been idle yesterday at an early hour he again visited the camp of helfaut near st omer and reviewed his troops inthepresence of lieutenant general de wedell the generaloffieer deputed by the king of prussia to witness the military evdlu tions of the army of the north the revie ap parently had for its sole object to give general de wedel an opportunity of seeing helfaut and the extent and quality of the force in cavalry and infantry stationed there or within and around st omer the infantry were first minutely inspected and defiled past theemperor on the fine open ground in front of the camp then the cavalry to the number of  squadronsone half of cuirassiers and the other composed equauy of lancers and dragoons were manceuvred for some time by his majesty with splendid effect upon the bruyere a piece of level ground about a mile and ahalf to the west of st omer and well adapted for sach movements it is somewhat difficult to determine which sight was the most imposingthat of the foot soldiers drawn up on an elevated plateau with a noble pros pectextendingovermany leagues in front and behind a hugeencampment omore than years standing or the mounted men a vast and glittering array the bare sight of which as it swayed and surged to and fro along the plain must have stirred the heart of every spectator the camp at helfaut is the most striking in every way of the five in which the army of the north is now assembled situated on the summit level of the heights which overlook st omer it is hardly possible to conceive a position more healthy or better adapted in every way for the purpose to which it has been applied an obelisk monument to the lateduke of orleans stands in front the inseription almost obliterated by the names of soldiers rudely carved over it the huts are more substantially constructed than those around bou logne and are different in plan being larger more commodious and in fact forming to all appearance a town on the top of a hill regularly laid out in rect angular streets of uniform substantial wellthatched cottages with a swarming population made up exclu sively of soldiers one may fancy the effect of such a scene so different from anything to which english men are accustomed but it is not duringthe day or even while reviews and exercises are in progress that the remarkable spectacle which this camp pre sents is seen to the greatest advantage it is when the evening closes in and parade work is overwhen the men turn out in front of the camp and form themselves in happy groups to pursue their favourite sportswhen foraging parties wend their way down the zigzag road into the valley singing gaily to while away the time and when the ruddy glow of the camp fires begins to divide the picturesque effects upon the eye with the declning light the prus sian general must have been struck with all that he saw at helfaut but beyond the arrangements of the camp and its commanding site the appear ance of the soldiers must have impressed him so intelligent and full of alacrity these sturdy little men seem to have about them every requisite for successful campaigning and what an englishman remarks most in them is their great sobriety we have not yet seen among them a single case of drunkennessthe emperors review of the cavalry was unfor tunately marred by hewvy rain which came on shortly after the evolutions had commenced the different regiments were drawn up by squadrons in two extended lines the dragoons and lancers in front and the cuirassiers behind when the imperial cortye arrived the usual preliminary inspection over a series of brilliantly executed movements of the ordinary parade character fol lowed and the display terminated with a grand charge one man was unhorsed and broke his leg in the fall in two other cases the horses came down with their riders but recovered themselves again taken singly french troopers have rather an insignificant appearance as compared with those of our service and our reoiments may fairly claim considerably greater perfection and precision of drill and training but there the balance of contrasts stops or turns against us and in numbers especially we are completely overwhelmed there must have been from  to  cavalry on the bruyere yesterday and a striking sight it was to behold so vast an array of mounted men now formed into one dense mass and now whirled by squadrons into ex tended columnsretiring advancing taking ground one moment to the right another to the left and still through all preserving the firm com pact unwavering line of their ranks some objections have beentaken apparently with good reasonto the mode in which the french cavalry hold their swords in charging they rush on at the assault with the arm uplifted and the body left very open instead of being in an attitude in which they can most readily avail themselves of an opponents fence it is a splendid force however and looked grand yesterday in spite of the weather in so large a body of men the shouting of orders swells to such an extent as almost to resemble cheering and several times it was difficult to resist the impression that the different regiments were giving the emperor a hurrah as he passed the tricolor streamers of the eight squadrons oflancers when massed together had a wonderfully pretty effect nor were the dragoons in their brass helmets and the cuirassiers in their glittering panoply of steel less splendidly attractive what will thepomp of warbecome when the diminishing value of cavalry as an arm of the service is at length recognized if the extreme limits of the range accuracy andrapidity of firing with pro jec tiles like the mini are still undetermined may the heart of humanity not hope that a time will shortly eome when with rare exceptions the horse may be exempted from all but his natural ser vice to man and no longer be obliged to share with him the carnage of the battle field  lt was past  oclock and they had both been well soaked by the rain before the emperor and his guests dismounting and resuming their seats in the imperial carriage re turniedto boulogne the troopsat the same time and wivthout defiingreturned totheirquaters theywear in wet weather long cloaks of a light fawn colour which are not so conspicuous as those used in ourservice and yet in a body of men look remarkably well at a distance they might be taken to be water proof but in reality are not soalthough beyond the mere display of cavalry and infantry there was nothing in the actual details of what occurred yesterday near st omer worthy of any lengthened notice it is not improbable that a deeper meaning than meets the eye lurks beneath the emperors courtesies to general wedell in the present state of european politics the king of prsia may be sincerely desirous to know all that he can with reference to the five great camps composing the french army of the north napoleon also may be anxious to make the king thoroughly appreciate the military resources which he commands and which at very short notice from st omer he can pour across the rhine rmthe emperor accompanied by lieutenant general de wedell has just ridden out on horse back to review the troops at the camps of honvault and wimereux the prussian general was at tended by colonel dolberg and captain de franmois the officers in his suite the emnperor was accompanied bya briliant staff of generals and aidesdecamp and followed by an escort ofthe centgardes in full costume the crowds in the street are never wearied of admiring so imposing and magnificent a cavalcade as that which accompanies the emperor in his re iviews and inspections at the camp the hotelsare still full and english and parisian visitors find abundant occupation in visits to one or other of the camps of the army three of which equihem hon vault snd wimereux are within an easy distance of boulogne and delightfully placed upon the cliffs commanding a view of the opposite coast of eng land a strou to the camp along the sands to honvault is a favourite excursion when the visitors arrives at the camp abundant and excellent refreshments can be procured at cafes elegantly decorated and fitted up and a military ball afresco twice aweek attracts a numerous attendance of english visitors who are cordially invited to join in the festivities nothing can esceed the politeness or courtesy of the french offices to our countrymen and countrywomen and the interior of the huts and tents of the troops and every detail connected with the organization of the french army are freely shown and explained to the nu xaerous english officers who visit the camp the town stiu swarms with military and the cfts present a busy and animated scene at night from the number of frcnch officers who stroli over from the neighbouring camps to enjoy their cigar mud a cup of caf noirthe imperial guard are encamped in handsome mnarquee tents on the other side of the harbour and the peculiar roll and beat of the french tambour and the martial trumpet call are constantly borne over the harbour to the houses on the quay from the windows of which the imperial guard can be distinctly seen at their musters and inspections the weather during the last month has been unin terruptedly fine and during the high tides of the last week seabathing has been enjoyed by the visitors under every advantage but the weather bas now broken and the disappointment which niight otherwise have been felt at the post ponement of the grand feigned battle ia which the first and second corps darmie are to be united is somewhat diminished by the re flection that the torrents of rain which have fallen yesterday and today would have rendered it im possible for the majority of sightseers to assist at the manceuvres the prussian general wedeu is un fortunate in respect to weather for it began to rain smartly as soon as the troops turned out to day and the rain continued to fau during the whole time the emderor was at the camp his majesty ecorns to wear a cloak or any other protection against the worst weather and the emperor general wedell aidesdecamp generals of division generals of brigade centgardes and all
