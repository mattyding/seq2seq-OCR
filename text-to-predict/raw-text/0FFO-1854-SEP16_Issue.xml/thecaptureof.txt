under the command of captain du eransold chief of the detachment of artillery of the island at the same time there were sent from the fort five guns of the rampart for which the workmen had made new carriages under the orders of sublieutenant pistchouline of the artiuery garrison of aland and in accordance with the directions of captain diu kransold when this battery was ready a certain number of picked men taken from the fin land battalion of the line no  from the garrison of artiuery of aland were ordered to work the battery under the command of lieutenant schimanovsky and sublieu tenant pistchouline detachments of the d and th compa nies ofthebattalionof grenadierriflemenunderthe command of colonel of the guard de furnjehm adjutant of the go vernor of abo were ordered to defend this battery ulti mately after the entry of the anglofrench fleet to the number of more than  vessels into the bay of lumpar it was demolished the guns were destroyed and all the men were sent to the principal fort and a portion of the rifle men were stationed in the three towers all this was en tirely completed on the th of august according to the statement of m westerius the gar rison of each tower was composed of about  men of the finland battalion of the line no  and about  nnen of the artillery and engineers with three officers and in addition in the tower c were captain of artillery de tesche lieutenant de salberg of the battalion of the line ensign de bolfra and sublieutenant couradi of the battalion of grenadier riflemen in the tower u lieutenanb of artillery zvereff second captain de art and sublieutenant de blahm of the battalion of the line also in the tower z the lieutenant of artillery chatelain and captains de knoning and permilowsky of the battalion of the line at the same timethat is to say during the month of june according to the instructions of the commandant there were constructed under the superintendence of the head of the engineers in the principal fort a masked earth battery covering three paixhan guns au the openings being walled round internal as well as external the latter not being armed with guns during the construction of the battery of lumpar four pieces of the garrison of field artillery of aland under the command of captain of artillery schvtoff were divided into two detachments one of which took post at the limit of the force of schvtoff and the other near mougstekt ech supported by detachments of grenadier riflemen there existed on these two points old batteries in ruins which the soldiers reconstructed in the night between the th and th of august these four pieces were taken from their positions and placed ia the fort with men to work them and troops to defend them in the evening of the th of august  artilery horseswere seutto gerad theofficer of the crown at aland that they might be fed by the inhabitants such was the situation of the fortifications when on the th of july there arrived seven of ths enemys vessels in the bay of lumpar this number successively increased and amounted in a few days to more than  at the same time the enemy surrounded the fortifications on the other sides his vessels remained quietly at anchor andwere cnly occupied in sounding until the th of august on that day it was remarked that the enemys vessels were being towed into the bays of lumpar and wargata and it was presumed that troops intended to land were on board and this idea was confirmed the next day for at clock in the morning the enemy landed troops upon two points viz to the west of the village of ivanwik and to the east of that of hutta the riflemen advanced from these points in large masses and the two troops assembled together at finby situated three versts from the fortifications there they bivouacked and the head of the french troops took up his position in the vilage according to probable reports which reached me on the same day as the landing of his troops at aland the enemy began the assault upon the tower c but was repulsed with loss he then began to construct his batteries and to bring his guns to the siege by means of rollers placed in a par ticular manner subsequently in the night between the th and th of august he opened a fire upon the tower endeavouring at the same time to erect a new battery nearer to it but what he had succeeded in raising during the night was destroyed at daybreak by our balls eventually having discovered au appropriate position where he was sheltered the enemy constructed a battery and when it was finished he fired day and night upon both sides of the tower with a view to make a breach so that it was eeriously and dangerously damaged in every part upon this the garrison which defended it foreseeing probably the impossibility of holding out much longer decided upon re turning to the principal fort bat was prevented by the enemy who unexpectedly made an assault upon it sur rounded it and cut off au retreat both officers and sol diers as i have heard were desirous of forcing a passage at the point of the bayonet but they could not overcome the advantage of superior numbers and were forced to surren der a fewhours afterwards the tower which was much shaken tumbled to pieces among its officers the artiuery captain de tesche was wounded with a bayonet in the leg and ensign de bolfras of the battalion of grenadier guards received injury on the shoulder from a blow with a swordafter the capture of the tower c the enemy raised bat teries against the tower u the bombardment of which was commenced on the th of august aud was continued with out intermissionduring three days thattowerin which two large breaches were made by the balls without reckoning the other damage done to its interior by shells having only the means of firing four times more was at length forced to capitulate i am not aware of the cause of the reduction of the tower b i only know that the garrison capitulated on the th of august at  oclock in the evening i have not received precise inforaation asto the reasons forthe capitulation of the principal fort but the following are the reports which i have collected upon the subject the authenticity of which however i do not guarantee while the french troops bombarded the towers the anlo french fleet in the bay of lumpar kept up an irresistible fire against the principal fort doing serious injury to its interior overthrowing the roofs and chimneys and de stroying the embrasures the garrison of the fort surren dered on the th of august it is said that the cause of this surrender was that after having lost the tower it was no longer possible for it to repulse eimulta neously the attacks by land and by seasand that it was destitute of the means of silencing the enemysopowerful artilery before the reduction of the princpal fort ito garrison was so exhausted by the watches and the incessant operations it had effected during several days that it was iaot in a condition either for further action or for offering a longer resistance it is said that on ourside the number of killed was  and that of thewrounded  andthsttbe enemy lost from oto  men the garrisons of theprincipik fort nd of the three towers
