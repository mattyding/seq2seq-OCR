 scarcity of milki cause of diminishedsupplycost of feeding stuffsi biy our agoiclullruitil aniti f lpax pthe decrease in the output of milk surprises no ono with practical knowledge of milk production tho present scarcity was foretold months ngo when the authorities dclined to recognize the full extent of the changes governing production it was expected sooner but was delayed by the action of the board of agriculture last marei in inducing tho food con troller to prolong winter prices till may and to gua rantee a price for this winter of not less than is d a gallon the diminution can be accounted for on purely economic grounds milk production in many districts has not been consistently profitablc sinco war conditions disturbed the ordinary routine of intensive dairy farming last whiter for instance was particularly trying for the class of farmer wlho wns in the iabit of feeding for heavy returns and whose circumstanlces mado his practice essential the position was eased for the trade and for the consumer wvhen the grazing season caine and milk was delivered in greater quantities froni the outlying districts but the return of winter has renewed tlho increased de pendeniee om the localities in which the herds are fed intensively and mainly en bought stuffsit is important to mark tho difference between the two methods of productionthe intensive system usually practised in thie vicinitv of largo urban centrcs uid the more natural meihod in which the cows are fed mostly with produeo of the farm on which they are kept the cost of tlhe ration is con siderably less in the one case than in the other but it is only by tle odoption of intensive feeding that an adequtte standard of output can be maintained in the winter months the farmers who fed highly with bought foodsbulky or concentratedrelied on tle increased yield to givo themn their rewvard and generally did weh when fceding stuffs were plentifui and not expensive the reduced quantities of feed ing stuffs and their greatly increased cost liave altered that and farmers are now compelled to adopt a policy similar to tlht common in the remoter districts with the result that the market suffers a serious diminution in the supply ot winter milk the falling off is not explained entirely by the decrease in the aggregate of cows there has been a reduction irn the number of herds and cows in milk but perhaps the smaller average yield is an equally noteworthy factor the formel gystem of high feeding whether with home grown or imported materialshasnot been an economic proposition since the intervention of the government prevented a rise in the price of milk proportionate to the increased cost ot producing it for a time farmers struggled to keep going in the belief that tbings would change in their favour but when that hope failed with the growing shortage of tonnage the inevitable happened the system of management that gave the country an abundance of milk at a penny a quart less than was paid  years ago lind to be abandoned and tho increasing dearth is the outcomethe number of farmers who have sold or are selling their herds is a disquieting circuinstanco and might well create a feeling of despondency concern ing the future but the diminished yield per cow is an even more influential factor tas it is largely respon sible for the dispersion of herds the high cost and scarcity of feeding stuffs may be the primary ex planation but the effect is intensified by the labour trouble the supply of capable milkers has been greatly reduced and though substitutes have been ob tained in fair numbers there is a difference betwcen the quantity of milk drawn by competent hands and by less experienced ones which only the farmer can appreciate dairy farming is not only an exacting and laborious businessfor iceding and milking have to be done at stated times seven days a weekbut it is a highly skilled occupation and until the general public regard it in this light and appreciate the costs and risks of production there can be little hope for improvementan impatient public may appeal for drastic measures and attempts will be made to apportion blame but the problem admits of no easy or im mediate solution lin fairness to the board of agri culture it may be said that they have done their best to impress on the other departments the neces sity of considering equitably the position and claimis of producers there is reason to believe that wnrning was given of what was likely to happen if the reason able demands of dairy farmers were disregarded the ministry of food has also been more symripathetic than their action with regard to prices would imply the trouble has arisen ibainly from an irresistible demand on behalf of consumers for lower prices than were compatible with the increased cost and trouble of production the public has had its way and the present and increasing scarcity is the result some thing might possibly be done to ease matters by encouraging the consignment of milk from outlying sources as probably was intended wvhen the present price of bultter was fixed although w inter milk is seldom plentiful in inaccessible districts but pro duction on the normal intensive system must neces sarily be less and will remain so while existing con ditions last irish milk prices fixedpowers for the food committeethe irish milk order which comes into force on december  and remains in operation until april  next fixes the maximum retail price of milk in ire land at is d per ganlon if the milk is delivered over the counter by the retailer and at q per gaulon if the milk is delivered to the customers house the maximum wholesale price is fixed at is d per gallon these prices may however be varied by the irish food control committee subject to the review of the food controller where any mill has been specially prepared for human consumption by a process approved and authorized by the committee or where in the opinion of the
