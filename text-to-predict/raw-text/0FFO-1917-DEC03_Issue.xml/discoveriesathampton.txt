supportarrange ments are being made between the lord charn berlains departmnent and his majestys office of works for shortly opening probably before christmas the eiaunted gallery at hampton court to the public it may be interesting to give an account of its history and associations as well as of certain curious discoveries recently made in and near itrhe gallery is situated between henry viiis great watching chamber and the chapel occupying two sides of the inner eourt known as tho round kitchen court and is one of the most interesting rooms remaining in the palace of tho early tudor periodin width  feet with six large gothio mullioned windows of eight lights each it extends to a total length of  feet originally built it would seem by cardinal wolsey though altered by henry viii when he took over hampton court it formed one of the msin connecting links between the western portion of the building and the easterly wolsey it should be observed was the originator of those  long gal leries  which becanme distinctive features of all great tudor mansions and this one if not the first was certainly one of the frst ever constructed many a timne wolsey must have paced along it reading his breviary conversing with his diplomatie and other agents or pondering in anxious thought on his vast schemes of international politics or on the kings private business the divorce

so far unidentifled and near by this are a few roughly drawn strokes representing a gibbet with a man dangling from itno doubt some joke of the workmen it is curious to think of these men thus scratching their nanies on this wall little thinking as they saw it being bricked uppresumably for everthat their scrawlings after being hidden for  years would become objects of interest to sightseers in another old inscription just discovered on the walls of the haunted galery is cut into the plaster of woiseys or henry viils time and undoubtedly dates from that period it is to be found by the northernmost door of the three which lend into henry vliis holiday closet or oratory in the chapel and is a twolined latin text in roman letter ing framed about like a sort of tablet by four incised strokes the iinrner line of the text is much obliterated and nearly indistinguishable but the second line reads clearly enough  praefe amaire deum this is the addition made by st thomas a

and shownin truth when all these littleknown nooks and corners of the old tudor palace come to be tho roughly explored it will be found that there are few places outside stratford which have such tangible and intimate assoclations with our great poet not without interest for instance is the discovery already made in the hall or rather the minstrels loft or  gallery  in it which was used in tudor and stuart days not merely by the kings musicians but by the actors as well when playing  upper chamber scenes hidden away and only to be reached up a tiny pitcl dark spiral turret stairs not

directly down to it the players it may be observed always had a special allowance of beer on play uights in the royal palaces in addition it would seem to each players daily ration of  one gallon of ale as grooms of the chamber so that there would have been at the disposal of each of them on play days at court some four and twenty glasses of free beer i not on draughts of water did our great elizabethan playwrights and players conceive and stage the mighty drama that gives them their undying famealter the play the actors doubtless went down these stairs and foregatlered with the kings musicians the revels men and other grooms of the chamber in the drinking house when the leading men of the kings company might be pri vileged to quaff a cnp of sack or  canary or  jrain a draught of

interesting historic embellishments were not less re pugnant to the narrow classicism and the strict mathematical rectangularity of sir christopher wren than to the squaredup spruce trimness of his animagillative dutch master so the old gallery was dismantled of its furniture and curiosities its walls tripped of their tapestries and horns its old fretted snc gilt ceiling dragged down its stained

the lord chamber lains department that questions which formerly took years to decide are now settled in as many weelks no soouer in fact was the idea mooted as it had been more than once before
