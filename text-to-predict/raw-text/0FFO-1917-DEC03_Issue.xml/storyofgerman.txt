story of germanonslaughtia great bid for bourlon wooduleavy price of enemygainsfrom our special correspondentwapr correspondentsheadquarters dec you already know that wve havp been having an exciting time here to make things quito clear it will bo necessary to go back to the events of friday mornhing and the preceding nightwhile the southern fqce of the salientmade by our recent advance from gonnclieu to near crevecccur had been fairly quiet for some days except for spasmodic machinegun and rifle snip ing very hard fighting had been going on almost continually on the northern face from west of mluvres by bourlon wood to and beyond fn tainenotredame here also hoxvever there had been a comparative lull on rhursday except that by a local advance we had gained some small but appreciable ground between mwceuvres and jourlon the german artillery activity however lad very much increased and most of the area of the salient especially on the northern side was continuously if dispersedly shelled throughout the day with occasional beavy concentrations on individual roads vllaiges or suppose battery positions there wasalso a great deal of air fighting and the enemy made persistent attempts to get at our balloons with the evident desire to interfere with our observa tion these things gave no serious indication that unusual events were impending and tliurs day night was perhaps quieter than atny night for a weekfirst signs of attackthe first intimation of a large movement on the part of the enemy was thet heavy shellinsg wvhieh began shortly before  on kriday morn ing an immense number of gas shells were used both on the northern siae oonspicuously on bourln wood and on soae sectioi on the south and on the latter side an intantry attack was launched almost siiultnneously with the beginininig of the shelling lor it will be understood that our new line here is not ckienned by a formal trench system with thick wim entarnglemuents de inanding heavy artillery preparation to cut the wire if the attaek therekire was unexpected at some poiuts it is iot to be put in the sarme class with bur recent surprise attack on tlhe iiindenburg lines the unians had practically open positions confronting themu tyerywherethe attack upon the southern side seems to have been launctied at once upn some  yards of the front from crvecceur to the east and south of gonnelieu onnelieu it will be remuembered was the point from which tle extrenie right of our recnt advance started and here thierefore was the hinge or angle formed by our old line and our newv evidently it vas a point by driving a wedge in which the eneuny could hope to gain the largest results doubtless he calculated that if lie could cut here into tho base of the salient all our recent gains would be endangered and our troops in the advanced positions might be cut off and compelled to sur render his hopes ruigt have been realized with any troops who fpught less well than oursabout this hinge or angle were certain english county battalions which have seen very hard fighting this summer the gerniians attacked nigreat weight miuch heavier than ve ever use it is probable that on this southertn attack alone six divisions were employed and appearances seem to poinit to as many as seven cavalry sup ported the infantry it seems to bave becii nt the point known as the flird cage that tlu germans first succeeded in penetrating our lines to the southeast of gonnelieu and advancing across open country reached the village of villerscuislain from the breach made here they then endeavoured to push northeastwards they were strengthened by other troops on tficir right which poured in through the widening breach in our linlesthe advance heldon the right centre they reached and went through gonnelieu on the extreme right they got close up to la vacqueric on the left they carried the triangular wood known as the bois gauche just west of gonnelieu and went ou and penetrated gouzeaucourt this was as far as they gotour first thin line of troops had resisted as far as it was possible to resist but the enemiy came on in masses and whatever gaps machine guns or rifles might make in them more masses followed with every hundred yards of advance however their attack lost momentum they suffered very heavily around gauche wood and on the small ridge there known as st quentin spurby halfpast  in the morning their rush was definitely held the west edges of gouzeaucourt and gauche wood marking the farthest limit of the advance they were able to maintain tlhem selves in thoso positions for something over four hours unable to advance farther they cn deavoured to dig themselves in on a line before those placesenemy forced backthen our counterattack fell upon them with tanks assisting by  oclock the german line began to give vay and our men forced an entrance into gouzeaucourt and large numbers of germzans streamed out of the village back east ward while the majority of the enemy infantry fell back a number of machinegunners and snipers continued to try to hold the village and fought hard steadily however we fought our way through the village and the wvhole place was sgain in our handscoitinuing we worked our way into gaucho wood which again saw stiff fightting beforo long howevr we had again ejected him from the wood and the wlhole of st quentin spur was oncemore in our hands up to the outskirts of villesguislain and gonnelieu at noon today i beleve the germians were still in possession of those two villages making a gain of ground to tho enemy of about  yards at the former place and about  at the latter fromn our old line on the rest of this southern front tho attiwk was almost a complete failureoin the extreme north from the crossings of the caril at crevecceur he endeavoured to reaeh masniercs but though some of his troops straggled as far as les rues vertes to the eotuthof tlue town they did not succeed in penetrating the place itself or shaking om hold on the canal crossings here or at marcoing beloxu here ho had a small success in the capture of latcau wood and oar positions which formerly ran along the east side of the wood are now an tficontinued in naao  column zistory of german onslaughtcontinued from page  column wvest side on all tihis right scetion of the attack on the southern side of tlle salient however his success nowhere was of any magnitudosupreme effort at bourlonwoodthis souttlern attack was launched about half past  the attack on the northern side of the salient did not develop till some two hours later but when it did it furnished certainly the heaviest and perbaps the most dramatic fight irmg of a dramatic day in cffect it was one massed onslauglht upon our positions all the way from near cantaing by fontaine past bourlon wood to and bevond mlceuvres as on the south the front was not much under  yards nearly seven miles it was in stern earnest everywhere but where the enemy made his supreme effort was on bourlon wood and to the west of it towards mceuvres not less than five grerman divisions were throxvn in on this front and not less than thrce were concentrated on about  yards from mkuvres to bourlonit has alreadv been said that tho operation was prefaced by very heavy shelling especielly xvith gas shells on bourlon wood and other of our positions while highiexplosives and shrapnel were thrown all over the back areas of the salient as far as the south end of havrincourt wood on the extrenme right by cantaing the infantry attack never threatened us seriously though the village of cantaing itself which i spoke of only tlhree days aeo as still undamaged and therein formning  cointrast to the shattered village of fontaine was under a heavy barrage of  shells and since then has apparently been almost un ceasingly in process of being knocked to piecesbefore fontaine and in bourlon wood itself the enemy entirely failed to make any impression on our lines the heights of the wood are of course the great prize for which he is fighting here after drenching the wvhole wood witlh gas until he hoped our garrison would be uiable to defend it lie flung attack after attack against the wood but nowlhere succeeded even in forcing an entrance great masses of men were employed and tho german losses must have been very hcavygerman wave upon wavebut it was in the open country to the vest of tlih wood that the rnost extraordinary fighting went on how many massed waves of germans came on here no one seems to know but fromn halfpast  until dark they never stopped wave after wave attack after attack niass upon mass our gunners and observation officers say that the ground was simply black witlh germans you could not mniss tliemi and by the end of the dav much of the ground was still black with dead at places field guns were brought up with the in fantry presumably with some idea of their being useful against thc tanks and our guns got on to them and knocked them out in somo cases before they had fired more than a single round our guns machineguns and rifles were all busv it was like fighting successive swarms of bees and if tho bees come on long enough and thick enough some of them will ultimately get some wlhereso there was a time when some of the germans actually got forward nearly  yards and are said to have touched the cambrai road at the sugar refinery above graincourt but they could not stay there it was only the apex of the swarm that reachedl that point both to the right and tlhe left the oncoming flood was held and then the apex whichi had thrust forwardi inow i am mixing metaphorswas forced back again and the flood retreated oni itself until by the end of a dreadful and bloody dav the whole gain that the enemy had made at the price of so awful a number of lives was represented on the map by a little bay or dent in our positions in the opeu country where it means nothing rarely have a few yards of ground been won at such a terrible costthe net result of the whole operation on both sides of the salient so far as we can see now is that the enemy at the first rushlon the south side penetrated at considerable distance the total advance at the deepest point being about  yards the ground temporarily wvon including the villages of gonuelieu villerscuislain and couzeaucourt and la vacquerie was also closely threatened if not penetrated lie had seized the important higlh ground at st quentin ridge between villersguislain and ouzeaucourt but we recaptured thc ridge and removed the threat from la vacqueiie gonnelieu and villers gtuislain were still in his handsto the right of here his occupation of lateau wood wvith part of bonavis spur which was fiercely defended wlhen we first attacked it on november  while small is of some tactical im portance elsewhere his attack failed to gain anytlhing of any importance especially on tlhonorth which is where the chief nveight was thrown and his losses were extrcmely heavycounterattack bythe guardsncidents of enemiysfirst rushdecembmer it is notv possible to fill in some of tho details in the hasty outline already sent you of the operations of friday and saturday morning thouglh theje is nothing to be added to the essential facts as giveni the enemys advance by  oclock in tho morning had reached gouzeaucourt and some parties of his troops even pushed out  vards or so farther west but lie never cffectively held anything beyond the village and that only for a few hours the counterattack by the guards with dismounted cavalry and tanks cooperating met with immediate success the first troops which had pushed west of the village were driven back soino were taken prisoners and many were killed and the rest fled into and through the village they do not seem to have waited in the village hut all accounts say that as the guards attacked the village large numbers of the enemy streamed away on the farther side none the less the place wsas stoutly defended by machine gunners and rifle snipers all througlh the placc and there was stiff and prolonged street fighting before the guards had worked their way through it xxas a very fine piece of worktherc was also very stubborn fighting in the later attack on guiuche wood and st quentin spur which had been occupied in great strength and here wo took some  prisoners and  maclhineguns to these arc to be added some few hindred prisoners taken at other pointsin the gemians first advance here all sorts of curious things happened the wveight of the attack broke through our outpost line before any warning reached some points intherear men were getting up or having breakiast one officer was in his bath and had to escape all soapy and wrapped up in towels it was unpleasant be cause gas shells wvere falling about and rifle bullets whizzing through the streets of the vil lage at one place the enemy captured one of our dressing stations where the doctors went on with their work our counterattack later recovered the dressing station and the stafl wvas still at workin a quarry not far from gouzeaucourt one of our units had pushed up and established an advanced headquarters there ivas a most active and exciting time when the situation was dis covered and while the staff and pcrsonnea all escaped in various stages of unreadiness a good deal of miscellaneous belongings fell into ger man hands and had been removed by the time we got the place back againamong those who had thrilling experiences wvere certain parties of american engineers who wero at work on railway construction in the gouzeaucourt area and who all behaved ex tremely well at this point there were three trains standing on switches alid the officers and crews had no time to get either themselves or the trains away one oflicer and four of his crew hid in shell holes while the germans passed over them and they stayed there undetected till our counterattack drove the enemy back there were several other sinmilar experiences the americans there were from all parts of the uinited states and among them were men from new york st louis chicago and tennessee several of them including one bigshouldered man from tennessee who rejoiced at having his first taste of real fighting since the spanishamerican wvar picked up or borrowed rifles and joined in the counterattack when it came along all of them turned to and made themselves extremely useful in one way or another and our troops are loud in their praisethe enemy claim to gunsand prisonersthe germans got some guns but not nearly so many as at one time looked lilkely on the ground which they overran there were a con siderable number of guns but some vere got away as the enemy advanced wrhile about two thirds of those which were temprarily in his hands were recaptured when we cameback againthe germans have also got prisoners but nothing like the number of  which they claim our plan as you know is always to an nounce prisoners cautiously and day by day as noses are actually counted on entrance to the cages the germans adopt the different plan of announcing large round figures at once in hopes of impressing the world  the figures are roughly corresponding to what the germans con sider was the probable total strength of the force defending the positions thus the last timewhen the germans took any considerablc number of prisoners from us was at lombaertzyde last summer when they claimed  that was the total strength of our troops in the positions attacked and as you know we had some killed a good many wounded xho were recovered and many parties amounting in all to some hundreds got back by swvimming the canal and under cover of night and so forth it was some days before we were able to estimate wxith accuracy that the number of prisoners that the gcrinais had actually taken was something under  aieamvhile their claim of  was some days old tho same thing is happeniing hereon our part we have several hundred german prisoners which will go at least a little way to offsetting our losses  to which is to be added that tho german casualties in their massed attacks on the northern front by bourlon far exceeded any combined losses whether in iilled prisoners or wounded in the other parts f the fieldall of whlich is not to say that itis not a ger man success it is bnt it is nothing like what they aimed at and they aro a long way from having turned our victory into a defeat that some such efforts wcre to be anticipated we knew and it was evident that the neighbourhood of gonnelicu at the base of the salient on one side would bo likely to be the placo for tho blow to fall while tho rcal objective as i have said many times in theso dispatches would be the recovery of the bourloni wood heights while therefore somc such attack was expected and perhaps is still to be expected this  enveloping operation with the weight of troops wkith which it was delivered found us i conjecture at some points unprepared the stubbornness with which our troops withstood the main attack on the north and the way in which they pulled them selves together on the south and the great gal lantry of the counterattacks saved what might have been a very awkward situationmasnieres line drawn inlatea slnday alrtnooxfighting is still going on along a large section of this front with continued enemy attacks on the northerni sector especially in the fontaine bourlon wood area where he has already suffered so heavilyrie has not made any progressoii the southern sector we seeni to have safely recovered gonnelieu we were reported to have made an entrance into the village last evening but the enemy resistance was still going on this takes away from the germans the most important of the carly gains which still remained in their handson the other hand before daylight this morn ing we had to draw in our line slightly in the region of masniercs where it was rendered un tenablo by reason of the enemy possession of the ground by lateaui wood and his guns to the southcast thereof witlh rumilly and the lateau wood region in german hands the salient at masnires becomes very exposedfrom men who have come from thero it appears that some of the fiercest and from our point of view most satisfactory fighting of tlho battle has been going on there i mentioned in an earlier message how at the first rush the enemy penetrated into les rues vertes south of alasnires but was thrown out again after that it appears that lie continued to pour in troops in the endeavour to tale the position intil no fewer than nine successive attacks had been delivered and all beaten back there are these who say that never since this war began have so many germans been killed in so narrow a space as here around masniorcs and les rues vertes and last evening our men wvorn out with the mere work of killing were left in possession during the night it was decided that it would be better to withdratv them slightly and straighten the line which was successfully done witlhout molestation and never have men better earned restvery heavy artillerv fire is going on the weather remains fine and cold but sunny and the spirits of our men are magnificentfrom far up north in the passchendaele area comes news of a minor attack on our part along the ridge north from the village by which web appear to have made some few hundred yards progress and taken positions of local tacticalj importance naturally it is too far away for m to get detailsit is in my opinion unlikely that the enemy has yet reached the end of his effort here fpr so long as fair weather continues he will probably try to recover bourlon wood at least but thlvsituation now seems reasonably secure if from our imprvised positions we gould hold the masses of men which they threw gaainst us bhere on friday and saturday it is probable that we can withstand anything the germans can do
