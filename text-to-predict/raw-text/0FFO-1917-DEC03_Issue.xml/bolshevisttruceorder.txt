the parlernentaires were instructed to fix a date and place for thle interview it is stated that they approached the german trenches without en countering aniy opposition at  oclock the same afternoon on their return they stated that they had been informiied that the gerrnanreply would be given on december a friend of krilenko explains that this date was fixed in order to leaveo time to arranege for pourparlcme on all fronts and also to give russias allies a last chanee of emnbracing the bolshevist policy and of arrangting an armistice on all the belligerent frontson receipt of this information krilenko issued an enthusiastic  order of the day  announcing tlhe near approach of peace and at the same time denouncing the members of theo general staff at mohileff as  valets of the bourgeoisie   cashiering gceneral tcheremisoff the commander on the northern front and a number of other generals and high officers and proclaiming gen eral dakhonin to be an  enemy of the people and declaring that all who support him will be arrestedthe military revolutionary committee resolved today to suppress the mlilitia wlhich has hitherto discharged the duties of the police and to substitute for it the  red guardthe chief of the american militarv mission here has informed ttie general staff that while no official information has reached the aimierican embassy witlh regard to the prohibition of vessvls about to sail for russia as reported in the press and the detention of goods ready for shipmllent to the value of  ll pending the formnation of a firmly established govermnent the report in his opinion and in that of the amknerican amnbas sador represents exactly thc point of view of the united states covernmenta french appealgeneral berthelot chief of the french mlili tamy alission to runmania has informed general shtcherbacheff that he has received a communi cation from m clemenecau to say that france does net recognize the present government ot commissioners of the people and that con vinced of tho patriotism of the russian chief command she trusts that they will categorically reject all criminal pourparlers and maintain the rimsian army face to face with the common foe france will not recognize any governnment capable oi making terms with the enemythe decisioni to hold the peasant congress at arny headquarters has not been maintained and the congress under the presidency of a woman maria spiridonova held its first sitting here this is a success for the bolshevists wxho are watching the proceedings of the peasants with some nervousness and desire to remove theni from contact witli the army the execu tive committee is composed of  revolutionary socialists three boishevists one maximalist and one independent delegate a considerable num ber of delegates have not arrived probably re garding petrograd as an undesirable place of re sidence in existing conditions or perhaps they have been hindered by the stoppage of communi cationsthe future attitude of the peasants affords a problem of the greatest interest and importance and there seems some ground for believing that their rustic shrewdness and native common sense may yet impose a wholesome check upon the career of extreme sansculottism much interest attaches to the part that may now be played by m tchernoff vho possesses great influence with the peasant masses m tchernoff was arrested on arrival here but he was soon liberated and is now attending the congress
