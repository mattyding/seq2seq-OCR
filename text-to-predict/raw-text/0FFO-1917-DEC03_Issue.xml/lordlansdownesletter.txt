too is in no miood to make a mountain out of a molehill a small niinority of members will ask qtuestions about the letter today and may seek to force a debate but a iliotion for tho adljoutrnment of tlho house is virtually ruiled init if the letter was hnot an urgent matter of definito public importance on thursday tho lay on which it was puiblished and niobody souglht to move the adjournment of the house thenit cannot be ield to be so four days inter when suclh excitement as it caused has subsidedthe last thing the governrnent are likely to agree to is lord henry bientineks suggestion that tho letter should be discussed in secret session suelh an expedient would create an altogether false impression of the importanco attached in this cotntry to the expression  of unpopular views there

people were asiiiug tuem selves wvny it was tuat one of our hiost emidnenlt statesmen had found it necessary to throw a bomb shell into tao political arena no good purpose would be served by suouting  traitor or  lolobecauso the position of lord lansdowne was such his past political and diplomatic record was such as to entitle iiini to the considered judgiuent of thte people of the country if thle object oi lord lans downes letter was to give the statesruen of tis country an opportunity t state in clear and deinite laniguage what our war airms were that we had no desire to exterminate the

letter iucy are not new but they liave assumed an important form because tey come from lord lansdowne and al i would say for the present is that a linited allies statenient of our var ainis now would in my opinion help to strengloen our people here at home and probably wouid tentd to weaken the foes ow our country in loreign countries ciheers
