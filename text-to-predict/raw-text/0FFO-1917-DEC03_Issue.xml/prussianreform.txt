district the electoral district and not the cbniniune shall be the basis of risidential qulali fication thus while germansi who move into  russia from other parts of gerrutany will be dis qualified

bill regarding alterations of the constitution enables the upper house to inter fere in the control of finance at present the upper house can only vote upon the budget as a whole in future if the lower house amends any vote and refuses to acoept the ultimate decision of the goveriunent the upper houso will be able to arrive at a decision upon this particular vote before dealing with the budget as a whole and if the upper house does not agree with tho lower house the disputed vote will be referred to a committee of the two houses secondly the lower house is de prived of its right to vote additional expendi ture without the consent of the government thirdly the government will be empowered to continue the expenditure of monev even if the budget has not been passed at the beginning of the financial yearmanv features of this remarkable scheme are so reactionary that they may have beern in serted as material for demonstrativo concessions by the governiment bnt upon the whole it would appear that the government intends to pass the bills in the knowledge that they are perfectly harmless that they cannot con ceivably effect any immediate alteration of the balance of power in prussia still less in the expression of prussias domination of the em p ire and that the future will look after itself ithe agrarians nd the industrialists are already making the traditional and exrpected
