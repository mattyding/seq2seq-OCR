hirethe offices of the agricultural wages board are at  pallmall london sw ifood sent abroad as shipsstoresnew control plan to stopleakagethe ministry of food has issued tho following statementin shipping rircles and at docks it has been common knowledge that large quantities of foodstuffs have been passing out of the country in the guise of stores neu tral vessels it woultd seem were the most extrava gant in this respect early this year an order was made by the board of customs and excise making it compulsory for neutral steamers to submit their store lists to the customs authorities for approval before ordering but there remained a big loophole in this arrangement as there was no order prohibiting ships suppliersfiomproviding more than was sanc tioned by the authoritieslord rhondda has been carefully watching this leakage ee has kept observation in the matter not only over neutral hut over british and allied shipping ele does not intend to interfere with the present board of trade statutory scale of supplies to seamen but evidence has accumulated to warrant his controlling all foodstuffs sent on board anv ship whether flving the british flag or the ensign of allies or neutralsmany of the leadling shipowners have given patriotic assistance to the country by responding to the appeal made some tzue ago by the board of trade the food controluer and the ministry of shipping they have brought into the cowutry as large a quantity of foodstuffs as possible instead of taking large supplies out but glaring instances arc before lord rhondd a of excessive quantities of butter tea sugar and bacon being shipped as  ships stores even to ports where these articles of food are perhaps better avail able than in great britainlo conserve in this country the essential foodstuffs lord rhondda after several conferences with the board of trade the board of customs and excise tho admiralty and the ministry of shipping has decided to issue an order under the defence of the realni act making it a penal offence for any dealer to supply any article of foodl including livestock or drink to any ship unless it is sanctioned by the responsible authorities at the portslhis order will come into force on december  inspectors will be appointed by the ministry of food at the principal ports to work in conjunction with the board of trade arid tihe board of customs and excise in this matter exact returns of stores sent out of the country and their port of destination must be furnished to the customs authorities and with a view to meeting any possible shortage of supplies to slips the ministry of food through fhe local inspector will be in a position to make the necessary arrange ments for the release of essential foodstulfs required by the mercantile marine at the request of ur navelock wilson facilities will also be granted to  the weekly seaman  who punchases his own food under existing conditions he is experiencing difficulty at some of the ports in obtaining wvhat he reallythe board of customs and excise is also makin an order compelling foreigngoing british and allied ships to submit their stores lists to the port autho ritiesnamely the board of tradefor approvaljust as neutral vessels do at psesent the controi will not be extended to coasting vesselsall departments interested in shippingtheboard of trade the board of customs and excise the ministry of shippingare cooperating with the mini stry of food and a working arrangement has been devised shipowners marino superintendents and agents are invited to consult with tho board of trade officers so that on the one hand the new system of regulation may be fully understood anxd on the other that measures may be taken for complying with this system without ineonvenience or delay the schenie will not only result in a great saving of foodstuflf to the country but will materially assist in a more equit able distribution of the supplies to meet the needs of the mercantile marinelord bhondda has appointed mr t g jones of the ministry of food to be diector of ships supplies and to control the scheme lie will supervise the representatives at the ports and work in cooperation with the other government departments interestedin shippingmr clynes on rationingmr w lt clynes parliamentary secretary to the ministry of fcod addressing a meeting of the oldham trades cud labour council on saturday night said that thie ministry of food could not hope to do anything which was popular and it tried to do nothing that was unniecessary but the great demands of wvar conditions compelled them to upset the useal trading conditions of persons who were sucking too great profits from food supplies when their ways were left undisturbed he was well aware of the inconvenience and hardships which masses of the popu lation hald suffered and in some degree must suffer in the future but if those hardships could be reduced by any member of parliament taking his place he had only to announce his name and he could have it he proceededi have all along felt that labour had a special responsibility on the question of food supplies and food control and i regret to find that in some quarters we are being condemned for doing the very tbings which organized labour has demanded the mminjtry has taken action on four lincs it hasfixed prices in order to cheapen certain essentiali foods it has controlled distribution in such a manner as to set aside the speculator middleman and profiteer it has bought large quantities of food in the markets of the world and supplied them through the usual channels and it has redued the price of bread and potatoes by taking millions ofimoney from tne national exchequer and spending it as a war charge to cheapen the food of the poor it was true he added that prices were hih though the cost of home commodities had been substantially reduced in regard to meat  per cent of it in pre war dtays came from abroad and it the government had not flxed meat prices the people might now be paving double the present cost the price of milk for children and expectant mothers should bo materi ally reduced and fish should be cheapened if it could bo done without injustico to the fishernen who wvere running enprmous risks in their labours at sea he marvelled at tho easygoing way in which rationing was demanded it would not increase supplies but would increase the inconvenience and djstress which the poorer people now suffered the only safeguard against being driven to a rationing system was more rigid economy in au cases where it could be practised slany poor people had no margin on which to econo nrize but there were millions of others who could givo far bettor help to their country and thouhhoh knew that many hotels were conforming to the rc quirements there wero many more such establsh ments which would require greatly to modify their eaisting praeticeif tho appeal for economyto the ma of the people was to succeed cheers
