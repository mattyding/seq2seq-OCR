essential and penraiient interests of the tho great neighbouring nations of germany and kussia i am profounaly satisfied that we are able to pursue this course in full agreement wlth our alises and i take it also with the almost unanimous morl upport of the representatives of the german people here assembleda fact which will give our action the nlecessary weightitzaly pay ing the pricethe itnperial chancellor gave you a detailed state ment on the military situation yesterday i will therefore confine myself today to saying only a few words about our campaign in italy whichi is still in full swving although as yet the political consequences nt this campaign eannot of course be sulveyed in tull yet in several poinits its effects are clearly recogniz able it wvs a magnificent picture never as yet witllessed even in this gigantic struggle to see thie grey rows of germaln and austrohungarian steel helmets descending through the autumnal valleys of the alps into the radiant plains of aly which have ever sinee tde days of the hohenstaufen irresistibly attracted the man from tho north utnder the leader ship of tha young iapsburg enmperor and under the mighty blonvs dealt by the strategic genius of the central powers the entire rmmed torces of a great nation vere defeated and had to retreat wlitlh no country in europe had germany maintained before the war such intimate relations as with italv the newly united state had gained iu prestige and bad grown to power and wealth under the auspices of the mighty triple alliance unspeakable bittemess was felt among us when late in the war when there were fools wuc thought the hour had come to deal a death blow to the wounded enemy italy yielding to the clamourings of a corrupt press and under the leader slhip of unscrupulous and shortsighted statesmen from pure greerl for territory decided on the shameful poliey for whlich she is now paying so dearly never theless there will be some who in this hour ofutter collapse will not withhold all sympathy from the italian peoplepolitical decline in the westi have just touched upoil the effects of our military successes these are noticeable also in ingland and france a brief sturvey of simultaneous internal developments in germany and in these countries will be instructive in germany the great words spoken by the emperor at the outset of the war have during tile wftf borne fruit anid developed the relations be tvecn the people and the crown which lhave on a basis of the most sincere mutual confldeneo for ever miore been rendered freer more active and thereforestronger in geimany the government is carrying out the programme laid down by the chancellor in his speech of yesterday not giving way under party pressore but rather with the clear perception of a hiistorical necessitvthe development has been exactly the opposite in england and france botlh like to pose as the worlds guardlians and champions of popular liberty froe dom of thought and freedom of speech are suppressed partly by violent and brutal measures in these counttries whichl had been democracies things are tending more and more towards absolute dictatorship in france actuated by a dogged dcesire to continue the war whicl finds its mzainstay in president poincare m clemcnccau has been called to power as the last card in the game of war a outrancc whtlilst in

having constituted his cabinet entirely witlout consulting parliament in an absolutist and dictatorial manner and as one of the first functions of govern ment tbe ruthless suppression of pacifist efforts is announcedtee little wizard prom nvalesin england tke development wvhich has now oceurred lin france took place some time ago the war party al oetrancer brought mr lloyd george to the fore lle was invested with powers whereby disregarding tlh provisions so dear to the british constitution he was de facto made dictator the little vizard froi wvales hms witth all his will to carry on war as ruthlessly as possible probably not quite come un to the ex pectations of his friends but since there seems tole no one to surpass mr lloyd george in deternmina tion to carry on the war and since tho idea of suc ceeding iini appears to tempt no one unless lord northeliffe is to be resorted to we may probably for some time to come see the western democracies under the leadership of their dictators discussing hifull harmony the question of the commnand of their allied forcessome timi ago i spoke to an exceedingly well informed neutral about english statesmeni and their astounding ignorance of the conutinent more espe cially of germany my clever informant thought lord robert cecil to be the cleverest of the younger nen so far as foreign affairs were concerned he may have been right one wvould think that lord salisburys son having from childhood breathed tho air of great international affairs might have some knowledge of affairs outside england but since thuat gentleman has pinned the british government to acceptance of the ridiculous and disgusting story ofthe utilization of corpses and since he nowv in a speech propagated ly router in all seriousness de clares the alleged plan of a lill to introduce polygamy into germaily to be chareteristie of our views and institutions one must really say that the world is to be pitied it in its most vital aiffairs for whicb tbou sandse are daily sacrificing their lives it is led by tnen who arc so shockingly ignorant about their adver saries mentality and llabitsa transparent invitationtime is pressink and i must refrain from dealing nlore closely with many subjects i only wish to touch upon one particular argument as it is ofteii to be found in the enemy press whence it has passed into the speeches of enemy statesmen it is said whether bona or niala fidc i will nnt decide that germauy has shown such great reserve because she had a fraudulent design carefully planned namely thalt once german astuteness had succeeded in assembling its adversaries at tho conference table ger rnany wvouldi conie out with ihipossible clainms reckoni ing that people being tired of the war and prepared for farreaching political sacrilties would iot give their statesmen tue support necessary to refute the germnan demantds and that by reason of this design it is necessary to continue to light until germany has been forezd to make a detailed public statement as to her terms of course i should not diseuss these contentions had they not been accepted by enemy statesmenl if our adversaries are anxious to know what our aims are tlhe mi atter s very simple indecd there are a sufficient number of ways at their dis posal hlistory las not furnished a single example of any great diplomuatic assembly purporting to settle international affairs ever having been convened with ont previously having informed itself as to the in tentions of the parties concerned nothing but victory fromn one point of view gentlemen wo welcome the clearing up of our situntion towards the western powers whlich has arisen under pressure of our most recent successes thosc in favotir of war i otroance have come out into the openi demandina victcry and nothing but victory how they intend to use this victory is shown by the secret documents the publi cation of wlichl has been begln ijy the neiw russian government it may be that the letter publisled by lord lansdowne a man of itdluence and eon siderable diplomatic experience in a london paper aletter which i have as yet only seen in a telegraphicl sumimary can be talen as a hopeful sign thateven in england the forces of moderation are gaininhg gronnd when i had the honour to speak to you the last time it seemed doubtful whether our wvestern adversaries would answer tie popes note and whether certain tendencies towards an inlerstaiidinaz which were faintlv noticeable would gain in strength and influence today it is certain that the popes messasgwill receive no answer fromi the western powers and that france and england tire rcsolved to rely only on violende thereore the germnan people will stand up and be prepaired to beat fotrce by foree until the dawn of a
