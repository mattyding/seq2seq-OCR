given notice to prevent traveling on fbis rail way on the sabbath the lon member prceedd to obseve that the petition which be had already presented frotn bath on this subject bad been called in question by some hon members in reply to tbeir insinuations he would say that it was signed by the bihop of the diocese by  resident clmegvmen and bysetral most respectable inhabitantsof atl that v tion too on a former casion had been described by iont members as prepostrous and extraordinary hear as if an application to parliament to sanction the divine law by hu man enactment was in any respect deserving of such epithets he would submit to the consideration of the house thatwhat ever might be theopinion entertained within thoselallson this subject there was a growing desire out of doors which was becoming daily more prevalent to prevent the violations of the sabbatb by stringent igislative enactments in justice to the promoters of this bill he muat say that they expressed their willingncss to insert a dausc to prevent travelling on the raleway irom  oclock till  on sunday di dudng eivmc ser vice but he begged to add that such a proposluon did not meet the views of the gentleman who hal proposed this dause nor did it meet his v miless view this vras a comnpany inivestin their capital in an undertaking for the purposes of profit and when it was recolcted that at that moment a bill was in its pasage through the house to prevent sunday trading he did not see how thev could allow this bill to pas in its present shape without ising a cry throughout ther countrg that they were acting unjustly towards all other classes whose trading on sundays would bc prohi bited hear the question thcrfore admitted of no compromise the object of the clause was to enable the persons mployed on the railway to pass their sundays in a lproper manner there was a great mistake as to the number of per sons employed on the railway on a former occasion the hon member for carlisle had talkedf of the number emnployed on the engine as consisting of only three persons nut when the house considered that the line ot this altnway would extend l miles and that several engines would he moving on different parts ot it at the same time it would see that a great number of peris must be thus employed it had been alo suggested to him that he should bring in a ge neral le islative enactment on the subject instead of trying to accomp ish his object in this way his answer was that he was desirous to feel the pulse of the house hear and he beggefd to assure honenmberus thatsbouild bheave smaiority on this occaion he would at a future opportunity bring forward a general measure for preventing all travel ling on sundays cries of hear hear the hon member concludedhy moving the insertion of the clause which provided that no engine or other carriage should trarel on this railway on the lordsday and that in case it did the company and their successors should be liable to the penalty of f for each cngine or cazriage so travelling to be recovered in the same manner as other penaities imposed by the said acton the question that the clause be brought up there were several cries of  no noitr potter said he regretted very much the absence of the right hon baronet sir r peel when this clause was under discussion hear that right hon gentleman had come very opportunely to their assistance the other evening when they vere endeavouring to prevent a restriction of tne sunday hear hear and he was therefore very sorry the right non baronet as not present on this occasion the hon gentleman had said that should he succeed in cutrying this clause he would then introduce a general neasure and so far he certainly would be quite consistent to pmrent sun iay travelinf not only on ralroads but on all roads whatever lxpresaions of dissent from pr dliles and dthers hc mr potter had undoubtedly so under stood tne hon member now suppose the hon memn ber should succeed in cartying such enactments what would be the effect of them to compel the inhabitants of large towns to remnain within the limits of their towns on sunday iven in surnmer to generare therein nothing but tumult and discontent and instead of promotint the fiaterests of religion to give a mortal stab to them hear such he had no doubt would be the inevitable consequences of this kind of legialation the hon gentleman proposed to lav a penalty if  on every engine that should travel on this railway in a sunday which would in fact prevent au sunday travel ing on it now when this railwavwas finished it was likely thatit would monopolize all travelling on tbeein thecom non roads being totally deserted so that this clause would if rrried put an end altogether to travelling on sundays in the arge towns and populous istricts through which this rail vay passed in the instance of the manchester and liver ool railway the turnpikeroadfor the purtoses of traveling ad been entirely forsaken for the railway tbat railway was he communication between the town of mlanchester with a opulation of upwards of  inbabitants and the town of liverpool with a population of upwards of  inhabi ants there existing very extensive connexions and relations letween the two towns suppose then the hon gentlemans nactnent regarding ralways passed in the case he r otter bad cited its effect would fall exclusively on the vorking and industrious classes hear who liad no opportu iity of going and visting their friends in those respective oowins except on sundays but wbo would be told by the le pislature that that enjoyment must be denied them hear hear then there were the large towns of bath and bristol n the line of the present railway  of course the inter mourse at least between the industrious classes of those towns would be altogether stopped by such an enactment he trusted that the house by its division on this motion would in some degree put a stop to these attempts at restric ion of the sabbath whicl could do no good but would be nroductive of great injury to the real interests of religion in he instanice of another railway bill the hon member for wigton sir a agnew attempted to insert a clause similar o this but rhe committee on the bill defeated the attemut ele hoped the house would deal in the same manner vith thc resent clause it wgas wellknown that railways would be mployed for carrying provisions to large towns if therefore uch a measure as thisshouldbeadoptedthepopulation of this freat metropolis woult be deprived of the means of obtaining hose supplies of provisions and agricultural produce which if sunday traveling on railways were allowed would arrive to them not only fwom the neighbouring but fm distant parts in sondays and tuesdays eie would call the attention of he landea gentry to that fact e was erstain indeed that uny such enactment would be productive of scrous injury to the farmner he would give his most decided opposition to the clausemr dysosm herc appeared at the bar with the list of the orshasm election committee and r tlls being one of the menbers swom on it he was obliged to retire with the restmr h curteis said that if this clause should be car ried the house would in common consistency and justicc be bound to pass a bill prohibiting sunday travelling on alturnpike roads as well as railways hesr ne hon gen tleman had acknowledged that some bad described this pro position as preposterous and extraordinary he mir cur tees felt no hesitation in saying that it appeared to him to be one of the most preposterous clauses that had ever been brought forward if the house was determined to restrict the enjoyments of the humbler classws of society on sundays let the thing be done openly and not by a sidewind similar to this clause hear bewould give his most strenuous op position to such a sidewind and partial species of legislation as to the country gentlemen they generally speaking did not travel much on sundays and he would say that in the rural districts the sunday was at present mucb better ob ered by the industrious classes than it had been formerly hiad they a right to deprive thoscldasses of free agency on the sunday and thereby to debar them from almost every pecies of innocent enjoyment hear he called on the country gentlemen to resist this attempt and he trusted the bouse would render it abortivemir robinson observed that whatever differences of opinion might exist amongst hon mrembers on the subject of legislating with regard to the observance of thesabbath there could he apprehended be no diflerence as to the impropriety of legislating in this manner on such a matter hear hear it scarcely required a remarl to exemplify the absuraity of inserting a clause like this in a railway bill altogether pro hibiting sunday travellng on that particular railway whilst srlt railwaylull hbatj bemn already passed with no such proibition contained in them lect the house come to a decision on the general principle involved in tlis matter and do not let it legislatr with regard to individual case crieaof  dividesir r inglis who was very indistinctly heard in the gallery observed that they bad been told by the hon member who had just sat down that they should not liglate in this manner but that they should b rin forwtard sote general measure on the subject nowshould the house reject this clause and should a general measure be introduced hereafler vould it not be said ttat the house had in this specific in stance decid against the principle of such amesure he thoughtthereibrethat the cause should be adopted if in this case they limited sunday travelling in acordance with what theybelieved to be te law of god the persons promoting this bill could not complainas they had applied for it subjet to
