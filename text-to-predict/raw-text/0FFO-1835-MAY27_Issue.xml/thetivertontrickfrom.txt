run r trvuox ticufrom a correspondent  to a paragraph inserted yesterday a query was ap pendedwhat mr liennedy is to obtain for resigning riverton in favour of lordt palmerston besides the unprofitable stewardship of the chiltern hundreds a city correspondent enables us to throw some light on this subject by adverting to a rumour current yester day at the indiahouse and on the exchange tlbat the learned gentleian has received or is about to re ceive the valuable appointment of chief justice at madras in the room of sir ralphl palmer now the period of service of this latter gentleman which en titles him to his retiring pension is ten years and that time will expire next month it is at hls option however to reinain if he pre fers it instead of claiming his pension sir ralph palmer has we believe written home to state his intention to return to england in january next but without any formal resignation of his office or appli cation for his retiring allowance it suited the purpose however of certain official persons to give sucf an in terpretation to his letter add accordinglywithout loss of time an order is signed conferring on sir ralph palmer his retiring pension this fixes his resigna tion and the post being wvith equal celerity as the report goes conferred on mr kennedy the borough of tiverton is opened to lord palmerston who will no doubt be most warmly velcomed by the electors it is right howvever they should know ah the circumstances which have preceded the honour about to be conferredpon them lve can scarcely believe this statementat a barrister
