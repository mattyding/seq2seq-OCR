the financlloutlookmr chamberlainand defencetrade barriersthe chancellor of the exchequer the governor and directors of the bank of england and bankers and merchants of the city of london were the guestsof the lord mayor and the lady mayoress at dinner at the mansion house last nightthe load mayor proposing  prosperity to the public purse and the health of the chan cellor of the exchequer said that the banking system of this country had bcen built up over long years on a basis so sound and satisfactory that it not only adequately met the needs of the community but was largely responsible for the high standard of credit which this country enjoyed and which was the admiration and envy of other trading peoples cheersthe chancellor of the exchequer on rising was greeted with loud cheers he said that it was a privilege of the city not only to rejoice in the prosperity of the public purse but also to contribute very materially to it the fact that they had coupled with the toast the name of the chancellor of the exchequer only empha sized the friendly relations which had always subsisted between the holder of that office and the city indeed it was a happy reflection that the relations between the lord mayor and him self could be described as they were described in the case of two typical friends of all time even in death they were not divided laughternew factorsmr chamberlain continuing said on pre vious occasions when i have had the honour of attending this annual banquet i have tried to lay before you some account of the trend of the national finances so far as theycould be judged by the information availablc at this time of the year and qualified of course by the reservation which must always be kept in mind while we are cndeavouring to anticipate the results of incuba tion before the emergence of the only reliable evidence upon the subject if i am tonight to follow that course again i must be more than usually cautious because since the beginning of the year therehave entered upon the scene some new factorsfactors which must certainly affect the outturn of the year but the extent of whose influence it is not yet possible to judgematerial is already in your hands it appeared this morning in the columns of the press if i had only to think of revenue i should find definite encouragement in more directions than one the yield of customs duties from imports is running at a level which exceeds my anticipa tion the consumption of beer and tobacco has strengthened the revenue in a manner which is entirely satisfactory to me it is of course not possible to form any judgment as to the probable return for incometax and surtax until a much later stage in the financial year but my guess at a diminished return from estate duties has already been falsified to a substantial extent altogether therefore i may say that judging by the results of the first six months of this year the revenue is buoyant cheersexpenditure on theincreasedefence needsnow my lord mayor you infer from that fact that not this year but another year this buoyancy of revenue will allow me to bring about a buoyancy of spirits but i am sure you have forgotten that i have unfortunately two sides to my accounts i have to set off against the surplus of revenue an increase of expenditure which has already exceeded by nearly ï¿½ the amount which i allowed for supplemen taries in my budget estimates even so that does not take into account one of those new factors of which i spoke just nownamely the further sums which are at the present time beingexpended upon the improvement of our defences altogether although i have no reason to anticipate any really un favourable outturn at the end of the financial year i think it is already clear that i shall not find myself in possession of that large surplus upon which some of my more sanguine friends werescounting at budget time in order to justify their claim that i had deliberately under estimated the possibilities of tax rcduction that is as far as i can go in estimating the state of the nations finances judged by the first half of the year when i look forward to thesecond half i am bound to take into account the development in foreign affairs which has introduced new sources of doubt and anxiety just at a time when pro gress to recovery seems to be making definite headway over a large part of the world i must say that up to now there has been exceeding little sign of check in our mprovementunemployment continues to decline in the summer months when we have been accustomed to expect a rise employment judged by the number of insured persons employed goes on breaking records and it is picking up the increase in the population in a most satisfactory manner the figures of exports of retail trade of notes in circulation bank clearings bank advances all show substantial increases as com pared with the same period a year ago and it is only in new capital issues which were con tinuously extending up to the end of july that in august we perceived a definite check due no doubt to the situation abroaddesire for peacei am anxious not to say anything which might make that situation more difficult the position of his majestys government has been described by the foreign secretary with a precision and comprehensiveness which one would have thought would leave no possible doubt as to our motive in our support of the league we regard the league as an instrument which if effcctively handled provides the best hope of preventing war and establishing peace and we desire peace earnestly and passionately not merely for our selves but for the whole world because apart from humanitarian considerations we recognize that war wherever it takes place must ulti mately inflict injury upon a country like our own which carries its trade activities to the furthest extremity of the globe therefore un less and until the league has been proved in capable of fulfilling the function for which it was created we intend to take our partthough no more than our partin fulfilling our obliga tions under the covenant in that course we believe we shall have the general approval and support of the whole nation cheersspeaking in this room  months ago i ventured to utter a warning that we could not indefinitely postpone measures for preserving the safety of the country since then that question has been presented to us under another aspect the march of events in these last two months has made it abundantly clear to us that the known weakness of our defences has seriously impaired our influence for peace in the counsels of the world that unilateral disarma ment which has been practised by this country since the war did not arise out of any decision by the present government it was a deliberate act of successive governments representing the different parties in the state and their decisions were arrived at after careful weighing of all the various considerations in the hope of inducing others to disarm like ourselves having regard to the paramount necd for economy and the sense that in time we might come to astate of things when armaments wouldbe considered superfluousi for otie looking back upon those decisions am not prepared to condemn them i am not pre pared to say that in the light of the circumstances existing at the time those decisions were not thebest that could be arrived at but conditions have changed so far from following our example other countries have been increasing their arma ments and with the consciousness of increased power there seems to have come a disinclination to listen to counsels ofmoderation therefore if we are to carry out the policy of which we believe the nation approves if we are to pull our weight in the cause of peace we must be given the means without which that end cannot be achieved i do not believe that the country which i am convinced is with us heart and soul in our policy for a prevention of war and the reestablishment of confidence in the maintenance of peace will refuse us the only method by which we can hope to achieve successin the meantime we need not and we shadl not relax our efforts to promote the flow of goods and services throughout the nations of the worldthe blocking of which has so long retarded world recovery and we may take encouragement from the fact that the true cause of our trouble is beginning to obtain recognition in new and in fluential quarters cheersquite recently for example m bonnet the french minister of commerce in a speech to the second committee of the assembly of the league of nations referred to the recommendations of the economic com mittee of the league and other bodiks in favour of a lowering of the barriers of interna tional trade and in a striking passage he de clared that it was for the governments to trans late those recommendations into action sub sequently the committee passed a resolution which was moved by the british delegate dr burgin and accepted by m bonnet recommend ing the conclusion of bilateral commercial agree ments and pointing out that the effect of those agreements would be the more widespread if they were subject to the principles of the most favourednation clause before the assembly dispersed a message was received from mr cordell hull the american secretary of state in which while cordially supporting dr burgins resolution he observed that the general con sensus of opinion in the committee upon that subject was both dramatic and cncouragingi need not emphasize the importance of this pronouncement coming from two countries possessed of such wealth and so highly developed industrially as france and the united states becauseif in the words of m bonnet they are prepared to translate this resolution into action then indeed they will open up new vistas of freer intercourse and exchange and new hopes for the revival of international trade so far as we are concerned in this country we welcome m bonnets appeal and indeed we may say we have already been acting in the spirit of it for the level of our customs duties is low and we have moreover an extensive free list from which foreign producers may benefit we make no dis crimination in our duty between the goods o one foreign country and another we impose no exchange control we have neier placed a quota upon manufactured goods in our com mercial agreements we have provided that con ccssions given may be shared by other exporting countries who are entitled to the benefits of the mostfavourednation clause if we do fix a quota for a limited number of agricultural pro ducts that has been done with the desire to regu late the important british market for foodstuffs in the interests of food producers generally it in no way affects the main principle ofbritish policy which ir rather to increase consumption than to restrict production if only in those respects our example wcre to be followed up by the other important countries of the world then very speedily international trade would be re lieved from some of the most burdensome of its shacklesthe gold standardthere is one other matter mentioned by m bonnet which naturally comes to the surface whenever there is a discussion about finance and trade and that was the question of the standardi zation of currencies nowadays it is obvious that a constantly fluctuating rate of exchange must mean a serious handicap to trade and that even the anticipation of a coming change in exchange rates is bound to give rise to un desirable speculation and to act as a check upon confidence of course all of us would likc to get back as soon as possible to a stable common international monetary standard which in prac tice means the gold standard but i sometimes think that some of those who have been appeal ing for a british lead those who dwell upon the advantage of having safe stable currencies do not always stop to consider the possible con sequences of attempting to establish a rigid system in a world of instability in a world where existing currencies are sadly out of equilibrium with one another and where they cannot be adjusted without serious and perhaps dangerous political repercussions after all the essence of a stable monetary standard must be that the country which adheres to it must regulate its price level and its credit policies in respect of other important centres to which it is linked therefore if this country were to go back to a gold standard it would mean that we should no longer be free to adapt our policy in regard to price levels and cheap money to our own domestic requirements we should have to adjust it according to conditions oversea over which we had no control and at a time when intemational affairs are unsettled and when large movements of capital quite sufficient to upset any newly established equilibrium are by no means beyond the bounds of probabilitynor must we forget that in this matter we have not only our own interests to think of a renewed fall in prices would be even more disastrous to the dominions and to the colonies than to ourselves and i say they would have a just cause of grievance if we were to move with out the utmost circumspection in a matter which so nearly concerns their vital interests cheersso it does not seem to me that the time has yct come when we can venture to tic our hands we must wait a little longer with as much patience as we can muster until the international skies clear and until funds are more stable and the dollar and the franc can look one another in the face without a squint in the meantime we are doing nothing to aggravate the situation and i might even say we have done something to mitigate it we have never tried to depre ciate the pound nor to snatch commercial advantage therefrom and we never shall we have never attempted to impose our monetary policy upon other people we have contributed to the comparative stability of sterling through out the sterling area which in itself forms no small fraction of the surface of the globe we havedone something to bring back prosperity to our own country so long as we freely buiy the worlds goods and freely pay for them that is the best contribution that we can make to the prosperity of the world loud cheerschanges in the citylord plender proposing the toast of the bankers and merchants of the city of london and the health of the governor of the bank of england spoke of the adaptation of the city to new conditions and said that today in the city of london they saw in the art of bank ing a system suited to the needs of the countrys commerce based on firm fouridations not rigid not inelastic but frecly moving as legitimate requirements demanded and the end was not yet the economic changes they saw in the world today had created a situation undreamt of in their early days it was a different world they lived in now and until a new spirit arose which would dispel jealousies among nations and lead to mutual understandings and good will it was hard to see how world commerce could revivepreparing for thefuturemr normans plea forcooperationmr montagu norman in reply said that they had enjoyed during the past year a time of recovery and a time within limits of good busi ness that was not all their own doing they owed it broadly speaking to confidence for without confidence they could not transact their business and they had known during these past months a confidence which had come almost unexpectedly to the extent to which it had that confidence was built in the mainon sound tinance and to some extent on a pro tective policy however it had come about and they had profited by it and they were grate ful to the chancellor of the exchequer for having provided it they depended on him he was not concerned with the wider aspects of the subject which had been described but he did recognize and they must all recognize that as had been said great as that progress had been it was not now altogether continuous and if it was to reach that goal for which they hoped they depended upon foreign trade industry on the one hand banking on the other while they were thus waiting owing in part to the disturb ances to which allusion had been made and in part to a general settlement through the world which had not yet appeared the question which was perplexing him was how they should best keep in order the machine for which they were responsiblein many countries abroad in order to achieve this end rules laws and regulations were essen tial it had never been our custom here to re quire beyond the minimum of rules and laws we worked by adaptation by tradition and all the time this period was passingthis period of unccrtaintywe were trying to adapt the machine which we had inherited to the new uses to which it might be put later he doubted if many of them would see that new condition in any settled form look east or west as one would listen to the words of the chancellor of the exchequer as regards the gold standard stabilization and the like see as they must the gold escaping from europe across the atlantic week after week if not day after day and they could see how far they were from those settled conditions under which alone they could work this cnd thispreparation forthe future this maintaining of the machine in the condition wvherein in the future it would best serve its purpose depended largely on cooperation it depended upon service per sonal servicea phrase a subject which a generation ago was unknownhe did not need to praise the banks of this country they had become a symbol for bank ing throughout the world and their coopjration had become a tradition much greater in the last few years than before if they were going tc proceed by evolution and not by revolution they had got to continually adapt themselves to the changing conditions and this needed a certain amount of imagination a certain amount of give and take a certain amount of willingness to wait and a certain amount of unselfishness he spent a great part of his life in discussing questions of this kind with friends some of them said  i have always done this and therefore i am going to do it again nothihg could be a worse argument todaysir archibald campbell chairman of the stock exchange proposed the health of the lord mayor and the
