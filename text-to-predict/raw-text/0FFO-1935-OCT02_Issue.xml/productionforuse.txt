production forusehelp schemes forthe worklessan interim reviewfrom our labour correspondenttwo  subsistence production schemes werc established in the spring of this year to give unemployed men useful occupation and the opportunity to supplement the meagre livelihood of the dole they are about to close their first agricultural season and an interim estimate of their first achievements may be made one scheme has its home in the eastern valley of monmouthshire and the other in lancashire in the neighbourhood of wigan both are developments on a much larger scale of the experiments conducted last year by a society of friends inspired by mr peter scott whose initiation of cooperative industry for the un employed of brynmawr has been a distinctive contribution to the treatment of a complex problem identical in principle in purpose and in general character the two subsistence pro duction schemes are in situations that vary both physically and in the markedly dissimilar traits of the local communities indeed the difference in character and outlook of the welshspeaking miner of the eastern valley and of the lanca shire working man whether miner or cotton operative is so great that the two schemes are working in a totally different environment their development whether in similarity or in con trast will therefore nmake an interesting studythe cardinal aimthe cardinal purpose of a subsistence produc tion society is to set groups of unemployed men to work cooperatively to provide an assortment of products but mainly foodstuffs and clothing so that there may be the opportunity of exchange within the group to an extent that will considerably raise the standard of living nothing is produced for sale or for exchange outside the group all that is produced is for the use or consumption of the members of the group and their households the scheme will not make the members of a group collectively or individually selfsupporting nor raise them above the need for the unemployment assist ance boards help they will however be able to supplement unemployment assistance by the fruits of their own labour which are first put into a common pool and then drawn upon to an extent which will always be limited by the rela tive contribution of work each participant has made the groups are not engaged in an econo mic enterprise and are not subjected to the discipline of a paid employment the hours of work are optional and only governed by an understanding that  hours a week are a fair share on two days of the week there is the obligation to report at the employment exchange because the condition of unemployment assist ance as well as of benefit is that a man should be genuinely available for work of course in addition to the material advantages shared according to deserts in a society where all work of equal duration is deemed to have the same value and grades of skill are irrelevant the participants in the scheme derive the physical and moral benefits of useful occupations and practical interests each day brings its duty and its promise of reward in place of vacant and valueless hours but there is no examination of motives for joining the societygroup work on land cultivation is the basis of the schemes but dairy farming and horticulture pig keeping poultry farming and bee keeping are important and desirable extensions of what would otherwise be no more than magnified allotments so that a sufficient range and balance of agricultural products may be secured a limited number of industrial occupationstailor ing boot repairing a little boot making machine knitting carpentering jam making and presently bread making and coal gettingstill further im prove the balance of production and make room within the scheme for men whose aptitudes are not in agricultural pursuits land cultivation can be organized to advantage in comparativelv small plots there are three plots around wigan and seven in the eastern valley between cwmbran and blaenavon with a little cluster of plots round pontypool the plots have not all the same character vegetables and poultry are the staple products pigs are added at griffiths town monmouthshire and upholland lanca shire while at pontypool in the centre of the eastern valley glasshouses covering an eighth of an acre are producing tomatoes and mav yield also a snatch crop of lettucecost of landwhile group allotments can be planted wherever suitable land can be had it is necessarv to centralize the dairy farming and the small industries the lancashire farm of  acres is at parbold and the monmouthshire farm of  acres is at llandegveth in the pleasant country that slopes to the valley of the usk beyond sight of the mines in the west land was found to be much dearer in monmouthshire than in the neighbourhood of wigan on the average the price of the allotment land in the eastern valley was � an acre valley land is difficult to get and a mere suspicion that the government or the commissioner for the special areas was behind the negotiators brought about a sudden appreciation of values the cost of the lanca shire farm worked out at � an acre but the farm at llandegveth cost between � and � an acre the difficulty of obtaining land delayed cultivation scarcely any of the monmouth shire land was available before april and some was not entered upon until may progress with cultivation is rather more advanced in lanca shire but in neither district have the anticipations of the promoters of the scheme been realized in the first season the desire was to have  men enlisted in subsistence production in each area in fact there are fewer than  men engaged in the eastern valley enterprises including the small industries and not more than  in lanca shire as there was delay in getting land so there was inevitably delay in establishing small industries for in the organization of the scheme the land work necessarily comes firstan adequate industrial centre has not yet been found for lancashire better fortune has attended the society in the eastern valley which was able to acquire a disused although not old brewery at cwmavon equidistant between blaenavon and abersychan this large build ing and the adjacent managers house with some other property were acquired for � the house is being converted into administrative headquarters anid the brewery into industrial workshops with a canteen and a bakery equipped with an oven which working at full capacity could bake  loaves a day the alterationo me premises will cost f and the work is also absorbing a considerable amount of group labour which enters into the scheme as  capital labour and not productive labour this fact explains in part the greater amount of benefit which the participants in the wigan scheme are deriving from subsistence productionas compared with those in the eastern valley schemc the permanent organization is beinadvanced more rapidly in monmouth shirewhile the immediate gains are rather larger in lancashireagreat deal mustbe done in both areas before the schemes reach full working order at present the estimated weekly cash saving on commodities to members of the wigan scheme is about s d while inrthceasternvalleythe aimibunt is only about s dthese figuresdo not how ever represent the ultimate benefits the schemes are onlyin partial opefation much more land is needed and the figures already given indicatethat many more men must bc enrolled to bring the societies up to strength exkierienceis teachirig also that theeconicd organization mfayprove to be a aociety of  menandnot of  the need for supervision is greater and more specialized and therefore more costly than was originally expected but a supervisory staff of the sizerequiired for a society of  would p rbbably be adequate  for a society twice as great meanwhile the estimate of � for staff supervision and headquarters expenses in connexion with the two schemes has been revised and the fiure f � is substituted  the system of

pricefrevery commoditycalculated in terms of hours of work and cash a certainnumber of hours work has been required for the raising of each crop and a certain amount of cash ex penditure has been incurred for seed and so on only working capital comes into this calculation capital outlay is dis regarded members of the society are not paid for the work they do nor is there even a bookkeeping estimate of the cash value of the work a man is credited with the number of hours he works and all work is regarded as of equal value if then the cost of a crop has been � and  hours of wok the compound price for a single cabbage or a pound of potatoes is ascertained and the purchaser must pay in cash the cash price of the commodity and draw upon his credit of hours worked to meet the hours price therefore it comes about that a man can only share in the total produce in propor tion to the contribution of work he has given the purpose of the cash price is to recover the working capital

allowance possible with the present yield of the herdit will be seen that these are still early days the schemes are incomplete both on the agricultural and the industrialsidc they are in the early experimental stage and another season will be necessary to test their capacity and the value of this method of organizing occupations primarily for those who are really although not nominally outside the ordi nary labour market the schemes promise well but have still to be provedas also have the men who find in themi a refuge from idleness  f
