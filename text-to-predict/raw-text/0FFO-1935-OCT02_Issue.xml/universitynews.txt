mainly for the benefit of the botanic garden in the estate of mr alfred corner for the bio chemical laboratory in the estate of mr william emerton heitland for the library and the fitzwilliam museum in the estate of mr thomas henry riches for the fitzwilliam museum and in the estate of mr arthur john presslandreferring to the reconstruction of the cavendish laboratory the viccchancellor said it was urgently required but it would need an expenditure which the university could not be expected to provide at the present time the problem would be brought before the university association within the next few weeks in the hope that an appeal might be made by them to firms and persons interested in electrical developments the possibility of an extension of the museum of archaeology and of ethnology was in much the same position except that some subscriptions had been made to a fund for that purposethe financial board had initiated an important change in the administration of the many funds for which the university was responsible hitherto each fund however small had held its separate investments and it was difficult because of the number of the funds to give proper consideration to each when market condi tions made a change of investment desirable by combining a number in one group which held investments for them in common each fund having its proper fractional share in the income of the amalgamation it had been possible to overcome this difficulty by spreading the risks of investment it made the income of an individual fund less liable to fluctuations it made it easier to deal with the investment of small balances and easier to provide for a sinking fund to meet the capital depreciation which might arise when a security was redeemedin conclusion the vicechancellor said i now lay down the otfice of vicechancellor in which  am proud to have served to my successor the mlaster of clare i offer my best wishes for a successful year he had already great experience in university affairs but never theless in february of this year he resigned his seat in parliament in order the better to prepare himself for the duties on which he is now entering it is to me a
