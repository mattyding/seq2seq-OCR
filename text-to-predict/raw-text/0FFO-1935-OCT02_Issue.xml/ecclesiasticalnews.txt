ecclesiastical newsdr lang on wickednessof threatened warunder the heading of the crisis in europe and africa the archbishop of canterbury dr lang writes in the canterbury diocesan gazeufeas i write the council of the league of nations assembled at geneva is awaiting with tense anxiety the reply which italy moiay make to the efforts of the league to meet whatever measure of reasonableness there may be in her claims and to prevent a war the mere possibility of which has bcen a shock to the conscience of the world the situation is changing from day to day words written now might bealredy out of date when they are published i can only say two things first i believe the strong and able speech of our foreign secretary expressed the opinion of the overwhelming majority of the people of this country secondly i trust that in all our churches and indeed by au christian people the prayers for whkh i have publicly asked may be continually offered for the statesmen of our own and other countries that the folly and wickedness of the threatened war may even rnow be averted and that the cause of justice and of respect for treaty obligations solemnly under taken which is the only basis of peace may be vindicatedthe bishop of chelmsford dr h a wilson at the chelmnsford diocesan conference at chelnisford yesterday said that if the league of nations failed to intervene successfully in the italoabyssinian dispute it would be proved a failure and it would be discovered that the signature of the various nations to the covenant of the league was a mere sentimental demonstra tion of no practical value the failure of the league which would inevitably bring about its collapse would simply mean that in the near future a general outburst of war of the most hideous kind would face europe ihe lead britain had given in the unhappy business had been perfectly magnificent referring to this countrys pledges to the league of nations the bishop said our undertaking to accept collective responsibility for collective security did not mean that we had to pull the chestnuts out of the fire for fellow members who repudiated liability nor did it necessarily mean the taking up of arms by the contracting nations against italy althouglt as a last resort this course was cearly indicated in articlc  of the covenantthe duke of gloucester andleatherhead schoolit is announced that � has so
