imperial and foreignwarriors ofabyssiniagen virginsestimatefrom our correspondentstockholm oct ithe abyssinian warrior does not at all know the danger he is running in a fight with a modern equipped european army states general eric virgin the political military counsellor of the abyssinian emperor who has left abyssinia owing to illhealth in an interview with the correspondent of the stockholm tidingenz in addis ababa he will attack without fear or trembling even when he is to advance against tanks under the prptection of fire from machineguns and artilleryhis strength lies in his indomitable courage the general says if it were merely a matter of human qualifications this army would be able to take up the struggle with any european army whatsoever it is arms and ammunition which settle the problem of war for us it will not do to judge the abyssinian army from the euro pean standpoint but experience shows what unique capacity for cooperation these people baveoften incomprehensible to us who are brought up on quite other systems and accord ing to different traditions and who represent quite a different mentality three different cate gories constitute the army which in the last few months has been gathered together in abyssinia the old original army was formed like the present one by chiefs and officials in diffcrent parts of the country they are quite the same lines on which the feudal armies were formed in medieval europe when the vassals joined up with their men abyssinia is divided into  provinces which correspond to the kingdoms or dukedoms or principalities of which the country at one time was formed and each province is rulcd by a governor the latter was and still is in some provinces entitled to collect certain taxes by way of compensation for this service he had to keep an army for the emperor whose strength and armies as a matter of course were quite in proportion to the size and wealth of the provinces in the same way the governor split up his province so that iiis subgovernors or chiefs in the villages in the different districts had to set up armed forces in compensation for the right to collect taxesexcellent soldierssome districts are still being governed on these lines but this entails as history has shown a certain amount of risk the troops had not come under the direct influence of the govern ment and the present emperor has therefore done away with this system every new governor now appointed gets from the emperor a certain army which is paid for by the state he has this at his disposal to keep order within the province and in case of war he has to place it at the service of the emperor but it is now a state army paid by the emperor from the taxes which the emperor and not the governor imposes upon the peoplebut it is a mercenary army in so far as that the soldiers get a certain pay and are volunteers of late months there has been established a rule that every man without fixed or permanent em ployment must go to the front therefore there is no jlonger any problem of unemployment in abyssiniathe emperor can dispose of  men all of them excellent soldiers but it is impos sible to make use of all the reserves because the supply of arms and ammunition has been cut off nevertheless these people possess a warrior tradition which of course has nothing in common with what we in europe call modern warfare and which may show some astonishing results they have an instinct which in a surprising way turns them into good soldiers this was seen at walwal their cooperation there was on a par with the scientifically calculated european war technique wherever they may have got it from in fact it is not so easy for us to grasp and understand this it depends upon deeplyrooted inherited traditions it is in spite of every thing misleading to maintain that the abyssinian soldiers lack military training this is only correct if we look at the matter from a european point of view the weak point is that this army will have to fight against acroplanes tanks and artillery and it is quitc true that the abyssinian army in these respects is not only without arms but also without any kind of training in a modem sensethe lesson of adowaif it should come to a war the striking force of the army must be based upon its peculiar traditions the famous battle of adowa was won by this curious ability of manoeuvring i am unable to understand how they did it the abyssinian troops were grouped in such a way that any european general would have had reason to be proud of the achievement un civilized people have a special ability and flair to circumvent an enemy they make use of signs and signals which are quite on a level with the aids offered by telephone and wireless and in a marvellous way the abyssinian army at adowa prevented the three advancing italian columns from cooperatingdid the italians make use of modern military equipment at the engagement at walwal  they made use of both aeroplanes and tanks and the fact that apart from the tanks three airmen could hover above the foremost fighting lines just as the action started must seem rather puzzling to those italians who want to make out that it was a question of a sudden attack it was found then that the abyssinians did not run away in terror at the sight of the aero planes although these men had never seen flyingmachines and were believed to be terrified from the first moment instead of that they charged straight at the italian tanks climbed on to them at full speed and shot at the crews inside nothing but death can stop these people when the lust of battle grips themduring the six months that i was here before the affair at walwal i got to know sufficiently about the italian movements in eritrea and italian somaliland to understand that signor mussolinis occupation of abyssinia would be a fearful tragedy for every free man in this country italian policy in the east african possessions was one day to fraternize with the natives and the next to try to regain the lost respect and power by means of kicks and blows the experience of this has fully convinced me that in the name of humanity the world is bound to oppose italian policy which is only the result of an im pudent desire for power and in case of victory vuould bring in its train only misery and misfor tune it is not the italian people i stigmatize in this way but the policy pursued by its leaders i have been called the enemy of the white race i too have my ideas of how the white race will best be able to preserve its leading position not by opportunism and undue expansion but by example
