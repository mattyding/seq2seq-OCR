englands duty tothe leaguesir j simon on risks offailuresir john simon home secretary speaking at a demonstration in support of the national government at oldham yesterday said that the international situation gave ground for grave anxiety british policy was prompted not by self interest but by world interestsir samuel hoares remarkable speech at geneva had been received with universal approval by every section he was expressing the views of an absolutely united cabinct thcir general attitude was likely to be overwhelmingly supported this week from quarters so opposed as the labour conference at brighton and the conservative conference at bournemouth and this broad agreement extended not only over their own island but throughout the dominions and colonies under the british crown the strength of british influence was immeasurably increased by these striking factsit could not too often be repeated that the british attitude was not in the least antiitalian it was proleague the british people had given repeated proof in the past of their sympathy with the italian people their present attitude was due simply to their wish to be faithful to the new intcrnational system which had been embodied in the covenant and to collective security founded on international agreement for the safeguarding of general peaceslavery in abyssinianor were they proabyssinian abyssinia was one of the most ancient but it was also one of the most backward countries in the world it was the only christian country in which the abomina tion of slavery was rampant it was a country with which we had had difficult controversy from time to time and recently we settled a boundary dispute between abyssinia and british somali land by a joint boundary commission without firing a shot that was the right way to settle such disputes as for slavery the league com mittee had made proposals which abyssinia had in principle accepted for assisting the reform long overdueagain and again our government had declared that british foreign policy was fundamentally based on support of the league of nations the british attitude had nothing to do with any opposition or rivalry to reasonable italian aspira tions in that region or to any calculation of british interests in that corner of africa that did not appear to be everywhere fully understood for example the italian cabinet had declared its willingness to negotiate agreements with us which might eliminate any uneasiness  so far as the legitimate interests of england in east africa are concerncd wve were grateful for that in timation but the league of nations was bound to look at the whole problemf from a wider point of viewit was a point of view which was not limited to the case of abyssinia but involved as a dispatch addressed by the british government to the french govern ment which was published yesterday stated  a general principle of internatonal conduct to which britain will firmly hold so long as the league remains an effective bodysir john simon proceeded we have laid down the necessary condition that  if risks tor peace are to be run they must be run by all there can be no question of our acting alone whether war breaks out in africa or not any nction by the league in the interests of peace must be collective decided by the league itself and actually carried out by its members as a whole as for risks the british people are steadily and wholeheartedly devoted to peace the last thing which we desire is to see conflict in any quarter but are there no risks to be run if the league were to fail  you do not necessarily avoid future dangers by a policy of pure inaction the league will emerge from this trial as sir austen chamber lain observed either strengthened or seriously and perhaps irremediably weakened british policy therefore is prompted not by self interest but by world interestby loyalty to the covenant and by a sober resolve to preserve in cooperation with others the influence of the international instrument which was the best out come of the great war
