cars of a revolutionaryrollsroycecylinder v enginefrom our motoring correspondentthe rollsroyce company announce today a new modelphantom iii which will make a fresh page in the history of motorcar design this vill be easily understood when it is stated that the engine is a cylinder vunit with self adjusting tappets and that the chassis has independent front wheel suspensionthe cylinder v engine shows the latest features in design and construction the cylinders are in two rows of six arranged as a deg v the capacity is  cc and the nominal hp is  which compares with  in the case of the sixcylinderinline fhantom ii unitwhile making comparison it is interesting to note that the wheelbase has been shortened to llft in against the former measurement of ft in and that instead of the gearbox having second and third silent gears the new box has all gears silent including reverse the cylinder skirt or water jacket is cast integral with the upper half of the crankcase forming a rigid foundation for the engine separate castiron liners are fitted having their outer surface in con tact with the cooling water there are two valves per cylinder carried in detachable aluminiusn heads these overhead valves are all operated by a single camshaft mounted in the vee of the crankcase through the medium of push rods and rockers interposed in the rocker mechan ism is an ingenious hydraulically operated auto niatic adjustnment giving quietness throughout the ranges of speed and temperaturesuppression of noisean important point in the suppression of noise is the rollsroyce design of pistona product of years of research dual ignition is provided by battery through the medium of two inde pendent electrical contact breakers and distri butors also two separate coils the ignition timing is controlled automatically by a centri fugal govermor wlhich is incorporated in each ignition distributor unit the engine is fitted with four carburettors placed in the vee formed by the cylinders two carburettors feeding each row of cylinders the design is of the single jet senmiexpanding type the induction depression operates a piston the movement of which con trols the main feed orifice so that the fuel supply is automatically adjusted to suit the requirements of the engine there is a small independent carburettor for reliable slow running of the engine for starting the strength of the mixture is incfeased by a control lever mounted on the instrument board the single air intake connected to the four carburettors is of large pro portions and has been developed with a view to reducing to the least ttic sound made by the air entering the carburetterslubrication is by a gear pump driven by tlle engine three pressures are obtained by spring loaded release valves arranged in series the crankshaft and connectinig rod bearings are fed at the full pressure of b per square inch the overhead valve rocker shafts at b per square inch and the timing wheels at lljlb per square inchfor the cooling there are a centrifugal pump and a fan the temperature of the water is controlled by thermostaticallyoperated radia tor shutters the engine is attached to the main frame by a mounting which is torsionally insu lated by rubber from the chassisa distinctive feature of the enginestarting system is the rollsroyce magneticallyoperated main starting switch the electrical connexions of the starter motor are so arranged that the starting pinion is fully engaged with the teeth on the engine flywheel before the full power is switched on to the turning motor this switch is operated by a pushbutton situated in the switchbox on the instrument board incorporated in the switchbox is a master switch with lock controlling all electrical circuitssteering is by worm and sector the worm engaging with a groovcd roller carried at the end of the sector armn frictional losses are further reduced by the mounting of all moving parts oft roller bearings the rear axle is fully floating and final drive is by hypoid spiral bevel gears the use of these bevels makes it possible to reduce the height of the whole chassisto obtain the highest degtee of riding comfort with additional improvement in steering and directional stability rollsroyce have after ex tensive development adopted the mounting of the front wheels as independent units the wheels are carried at the outcr end of a lever system of the wishbone  type controlled by helical springs working in a closed oilfilled hous ing this housing also contains the shock damper and riding control mechanism the firm have found it necessary to grind accurately to size and fit together on its end bearing surfaces each plate of the rear road springs the springs themselves are encased in leather gaiters and by a special arrangement of oil holes and grooves in the leaves the ends of the three longest leaves of the spring are lubricated by surplus oil from the eye of the master leaf which in turn receives oil from the chassis lubrication systemowing to this arrangement and the use of absorbent material inside the gaiter the springs arc entirely selflubricating and rcmain free from squeaksthe braking systemthe rollsroyce fourwheel braking systemn is operated from the brake pedal through the medium of a mechanical servo motor this servo is in the form of a friction disk clutch rotated by the transmission and mounted on the side of the gearbox while pressuireon ihd pedal applies the rear brakes directly in the usual manner it also engages the friction clutch on the servo which in its turn operates the front brakes the pull from the servo is distributed between the front and rear brakes but in the caseof the rear brakes this is in addition to the direct pedal effect with the leverages provided the result is that slightly less than half the braking power is imposed on the front wheels this combined with the fact that during brakinig greater weight is thrown on thc front axle when tbe car is moving forward renders it practically impossible for the front wheels to become locked the equalizing of the servo effort to the front and rear brakes respectively is effected by a special t shape balancing lever a separate rollsroyce type equalizer is pro vided for both pairs of front and rear brakes to ensure even brakine on both sides of the car a pneumatic damper is fitted in order to suppress any sound which the release of the servo levers would otherwise produce the braking effort is equally available when the car is moving back wards or forwards also even should the servo be allowed to go out of action through neglect the rear pedaloperated brakes still pkovide the same braking capacity as was available before the introduction of front wheel brakes the handbrake operates an entirely independent set of shoes working in the rear wheel brakedrums here again the special type of rollsroyce equalizer is used to ensure that the same pressure is applied to both wheelsthe frame is built of deep box section side members braced with a builtup prcssed steel cruciform crossmnmber the greatest rigidity is obtained for a comparatively low weight of the completed unit a complete arrangement for the lubrication of all important working parts is comprised in this systemthere is a gallon petrol tank at the rear petrol is supplied to the carburettors by an electricallyoperated duplex petrol pump and a fuel level indicator and warning light are on the instrunment board the tyres are dunlop  by lin the chassis is priced at � the touring limousine from � and the pullman limousine from
