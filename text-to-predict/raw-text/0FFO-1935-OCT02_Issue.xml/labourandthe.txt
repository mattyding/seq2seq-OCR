labour and theleaguesanctions debatebegunmr lansburyspositionfrom our special correspondentbrighton oct ithe labour party conference at brighton today considered the socialist attitude to sanctions in relation to the dispute between italy and abyssinia both the morning and afternoon sessions were devoted to the discussion in which prominentmembers of the labour and trade union movement took part and the debatewill be continued tomorrowmr w a  robinson the chairman intro deced the subject by saying that they would ptceed to what waspossibly thc biggest and the most important discussion that the con ference had ever had to deal with he indicated that while the debate was based on the report on theinternational situation presented by the national executive committee the decision of the conference had to take would be on a resolu tion framed at margatc by the executives of the labour party the parliamentary labour party and the trades union congress the resolution approved lastmonth by thetrades union con gress was put before the delegates today in the following termsthis confercnce in full accord witr the views cx pressed by organized labour wherever frcedom of expres sion exists is gravely disturbed by the violation of the law of nations thrcatened by italy urider fascist domina tion in preparing a war of conquest upon abyssinia the conference declares its profound conviction that such violation of the sanctity of intcenational treatics is deslructivc of the foundations of civilizationit condemns in the strongest terms thc provocative and defiant attitude of the head of the italian govern ment towards the lcague of nations it appeals to the italian people to honour their pledges to abandon war as an instrument of policy and their acceptance of rcsponsi bility iointly with all other members of ihe league for the maintenance of peaceunited and determined in its opposition to the policy of imperialist aggression this confercnce calls upon the british governmcnt in cooperation with other nations rcoresented at the council and assembly of the league to usc all the nercessary measures provided by the cove nant to prcevnt italys uniust and rapacious attack upon the tcrritory of a fellowmcmber ot the league the conference plcdges its firm support of any action con sistent with the principles and statutes of thc league to restrain the italian government and to uphold the authority of the leaguc in enforcing peaecwhile resolutc in refusing to countenanec any resort to war in flagrant violationof international treaties or to permit talyb to profit by any act of aggression this conferensc recogtnizes the imzperative necessity of eradicating the cvil and dangers arising from the econo mic exploitation of colonial territories and peoples for the profit of imperialist and capitalist powers and groupswe therefore call upon the british governmcnt to urge the leagueofnatinns to summon aworldeonomic conference and to place upon its agenda the inter national control of the sources and supply of raw materials with th appliction of the principc of econo mic equality of eportounity for all nations in the un developed regions of the eanhipooled securitycollective action againstaggressormr hugh dalton said that they were facing tremendous issues literally of life and death and they had to take their responsibility of decision each according to his deep moral conviction and to an honest study of reality the only division between them was on the question of how best to preserve the peace or how best to reestablish peace if it should be broken by the italian dicta tor none of them had any bitterness against the unhappy italian people but rather a sense of pity at their plight under the leadership ofthis fascist megalomaniac he asked the conference to accept the executive committees report and to endorse the declaration jointly framed at margate last month by the three executive com mittees of the labour movementthe policy of the declaration was pooled security plus pooled plenty as socialists they recognized the economic causes of war and they sought to remove them by establishing socialism in this country and throughout the world as a first step towards removing them they sought to establish even within the present economic framework of the world an approach towards equality of economic opportunity for all nations and therefore they desired a world conference to explore the ways and means of achieving this end and establishing the international control of the sources of raw materials the labour partys policy on pooled security had for many years been clcar and consistent they stood for strong and collective action in defcnce of peace against any aggressortheimmediatc question for them to decidc was did they stand firm in this crisis for the policy to which they had so often pledged them selves or should they run away repuidiate their obligations under the covenant of the lcague and signal  all clear   to mussolini in his barbarous and longpremeditated assault upon abyssinia  who was for running away  they would count at the end of the debatesanctions and warsanctions did not necessarily mean war on the other hand the scrapping of sanctions as a reserve force behind international law certainly meant warwar soon and in a far more terrible form than even a war between italy and abyssinia a threat of sanctions might be enough to prevent war if not the use of economic and financial sanctions without any military and naval action might be sufficient to reestablish peace even if mussolini should break it if mussolini was so lunatic as to resist the united league of nations by force ict it be so he would order the firing of the first shot and he would take the consequences of that order mussolini had led italy into a desperate position she was financially and economically weak and her foreign credits were exhausted the italian army in east africa had a line of communications passing through a narrow ditch in the egyptian sand which could be blocked easily in more ways than one italy was without an ally in the world today and without command of the sea at either end of the little ditchthe present british government was crimi nally tesponsible for the present crisis cheers it had taught mussolini to rely on arms signor grandi had said on behalf of mussolini at the disarmament conference that italy was ready for any amount of disarmament provided that others would disarm as well if the british government had then supported the proposal to disirm to germanys level the proposal would have gone through by their conduct in the sino japanese dispute the british government had led mussolini to think that what was right for japanwould not be wrong for him if sir john simon had then made the same speech as sir samuel hoarc had made recently japan would have turned back in the far east when mr macdonald and sir john simon met mussolini at stresa the question of abyssinia was not even mentioned their failure to take that wonderful opportunity when mussoliniwas not yet so deeply committed was one of the greatest diplomatic crimes committed in this century the british government had made its deathbed repentence largely because of the result of the peace ballotcapitalist policysir stafford cripps andthe leaguesir stafford cripps mp who was given a mixed reception but was particularly cheered by visitors in the balcony of the hall opposed the policy of the executive committee he said that he was very anxious not to magnify differences which separated him from views put forward in a resolution with a large part of which he could agree whatever those differ ences might be they were as nothing compared with the great gulf that divided them from the capitalist parties of this country their own objectives of peace and socialism through democracy were far too great and vital to the workers to allow any question to risc of a split in their ranks let thlem get that idea outoftheir headstheir decision he submitted must turn not so much upon h hat we as a country should or should not do as upon who was in control ot our action he could not rid his mind of the sordid history of capitalist deception and the empty and hollow excuses of  which he alas was then fool enough to believe could they trust the conservative party backed by the great industrialists and capitalists who con trolled the national government with the lives of british workers there was no man in the conference who more cordially detested mussolini than he didor morc passionately desired the frcedom of the italian workers if he could feel that british imperialism had turned over a new leaf and had beeome internationally socialist then his difficulties and doubts would largely disappear they all knew in their hearts that however fine the phrases used as to support of the covenant of the lcague the driving force behind the government was and must be the urgent necessities of the capitalist economic system itselfhe did not believe in the theory of deathbed repentance nor in comforting themselves with the thought that the risk of war was very remote and unlikely to matcrialize if sanctions were used he profoundly hoped that that risk would not materialize but they were bound at least to consider an assumption that war might come if it did what was it they would be supporting in the terms of their resolution  behind economic sanctions because they werc inseparable would come military sanctions when economic sanctions were applied a state of war automatically existed and we must be prepared to defend those sanctions against military attack  the military machinethat mcant the use by our government of the workers for military action against the workers of italy they would have to supportthe necessary recruiting the manufacture of armaments and the whole paraphernalia of capitalism that always surrounded a state of war theywould have helped to initiate that state of affairs and thereafter they would bc without power of control or recall they would have committed the workers to the capitalist military machine andexperience from  to showed the extrememeasutcs that were taken tosuppress any antiwar action once the militarymachinetook chargehadthey a workers government in this country as they had in russia the whole situa tion would be completely different with  a socialistgovernment there would be no risk of imperialist andcapitalistaimsbeing pursued as today it was certain they were being and would be pursued then there would be a power of recall because the workcrsand not their class opponents wouldbe in control of foreign policy and the militarymachinenolcague system he added was a reality within imperialism in  the early years and during the period of a labourgovernment he took theview that something could be made of theleague he had been accused of changing his views on this topic he replied that he had changed them because eventshad satisfied him that now the league with three major powers outside it hadbecome nothing but the tool of satiated imperialist powers france and britain determined its useafter contending that in the present situation mussolini would not be crushed but would drive a satisfactory bargain  with his fellow members of the international burglars union sir stafford cripps begged the conference not to ordain by its decision that the labour movement should join without power in the responsibility for a capitalist and imperialist war which sanctions might entailmr john marchbanks national union of railwaynmen submitted that sir stafford cripps had made an eloquent speech against capitalism and imperialism but had said nothing with regard to the real issues at stake it was too late he said for them to go back on their own deci sions nothing had changed decisions taken in   and  except that they were now up against realitylord ponsonbys positionlord ponsonby said that atticle  of the covenant was drafted by men who visualized many conditions which had not been fulfilled three great nations were outside the league the nations had shown themselves to be actuated by selfinterest  and force had not crushed gcrman militarism if partial sanctions  were to be imposed they must be very drastic sanc tions which meant the use of a fleet and air craft and these would have to be supplied chiefly by great britain by force they would strengthen such movements as fascism and would not crush them since  he had never altered his view thc word war  was vulgar and  sanctions was more refined but it was the same thing the great capitalist govern ments in their imperialist scramble knew how to disguise the matter to deceive the workershe would not join in asking his fellow countrymen to take partin what was after all just a contest between militarist nations for a slice of territory in africa this sham inter national war was distracting the labour move ment and preventing it from building up the society that it wanted the war to which he would be faithful was the war against the grim injustice of a society which allowed one man to leave � and another man not to leave enough money to be buried with the labour movement ought to be saved from taking a step which was going to lead from a quarrel between mussolini and abyssinia into a european war hc wanted to prevent them from widening the scope of the tragedy and he regretted that they should have allowed themselves to be carried away by a natural hatred of fascism into sup posing that they were going to crush fascism by warmr lees smith said that to say that thlere was no difference between our government and the govcrnments of hitler and mussolini was to put all realities aside if in italy at present there were even a vestige of democratic govern ment mussolini would not have carried on his policy of the last few months without opposi tion this was not only a conflict on behalf of the league of nations but a conflict against fascism if mussolini carried his policy through it would be the greatest triumph which fascism had achieved and would prove the effectiveness of fascism in the field of foreign affairs if they wanted to fight fascism and imperialism they had got to fight mussolini now no party in this country was so completely committed to sanctions as the labour party if they now abandoned the whole thing what credentials would they have left for the difficult task which lay in front of them a final betrayalsir c trevelyan on labours conditionssir c trevelyw said that they had all de nounced the tame acquiescence in japanese imperialism a few years ago and it would be a final betrayal of the purpose of the league of nations if at this juncture it made no drastic attempt to stop mussolini in his attack upon abyssinia his defiance of international under standing was more cynical and more reckless than that of japan no one pretended that there was any other way of preventing him cxccpt by the action of the league of nations our obliga tion to support sanctions was the inescapable result of our being a member of the league if we did not believe that wnchad no busincss to belong to the leaguethe labour party however ought not to give the governmcnt any blank chequein support ing its policy there should be two conditions of their support in the first place if they helped to impose sanctions this must be an un mistakably international action by all the league governments not onlyapproving but acting together it was not for this country to act alone if mussolini were to be stopped it must be by a world tribunal in the name of thenations of the world labour ought also to insist that it would only support economic pres sure on italy and would refuse to support any military attack on her unless mussolini retaliated by armed violence there should be no need of war labour should declare that it was ready to join in a general strike against mussolinis warto say that the proposed coercion of musso lini was imperialist in its nature was a ridiculous misreading of the situation it did not deny that imperialist motives might arise during the crisis and that the ends of justice might be dis torted when there came to be a settlement how ever if the labour party representing half the nation as it already did could not hold the government to its purpose labour had no right to talk of governing this country within five yearsmr j wilniot said that the party ought not at the very moment when its pressure on the government was beginning to show results to say that it would now apply that pressure in the opposite direction unless the labour move ment showed itself consistent and capable of responsibility it would put itself out of reach of power and even of moral influenceoneway traffic mentalitymr jack williams mineworkers federa tion said that it was idle as well as misleading to  apply a  oneway traffic mentality to the subject of sanctions but that was the position of the socialist league miss lucy cox prospective labour candidate for pudsey and otley opposed sanctions she did not think any conference delegate would berprepared to starve italian women and babiesmuch less to drop bombs oa them what was wanted she suggested was not war but an international luriatic asylomprofessor catlin said that he did not thlink the workers were prepared to shed their blood for sanctions unless they knew the kind of peace to be introduced after sanctions had been applied and that that peace was not going to be one of imperialist deals he hoped however the policy of the executive would be approved if mussolinis bill were to be paid now hitler within two years would present a bigger bill for paymentdr a salter suggested that great britain should say frankly to italy that we had done wrong in the past as she was attempting to do wrong now and that we were prepared to givc up our tropical colonial possessions to bc handed over to an international regime so that other countries would have equal rights in them with ourselves the methods proposed in the resolu tion would only create new problems and dangerslord strabolgi said that the sanction pro posed was an international boycott which had never yet been tried the only way in which such a sanction could be converted into military sanctions would be through italy attacking us if the british government ran away now the league of nations would go to piecessocialists united abroadmr g dallas said that the socialist parties on the continent ivere showing on this question an unparalleled unanimity at the recent con ference of socialists at geneva a resolution was passed unanimously declaring that the imminent danger of warplainly indicated the supreme duty of the league and made it interative that the wholc covenant should be now applied including the sanctions provided for in the covenant inface of the menace of mussolini and hitler the continental socialist parties were changing their attitude and abandoning the principle pf nonresistance to an aggrcssor they had to face realities and theywere facing them in a manner entirely different from that of the scialist leagucmr w mellor said that it was a profound mistake to believe that the league of nations had rid the world of power politics the league was an alliance of powers dominated by great britain andfrancea delegateand russiamr mellor continuing said that the soviet union had become a member of the league of nations because it was compelled in the present situation to play thc dangerous game of power politics laughter the soviet union entered the league of nations not because it believed in the principles of the league but because it was necessary to join the lcaguc in order to have some security the conference was being asked to support the interests of british imperialism under cover of the league of nationsmr charles dukes general and municipal workers said it was a godsend that the tuc conference had preceded that one if it had not been held and the speeches made from the brighton rostrum had been delivered in the absence of the margatc declaration mussoliniwould have marched there would have been  no restraintan effective leaguemr c r arrlee mp speaking as a member of the executive committee said that the line they had taken was that the league must be an effective body he was at a loss to know why some people thought this question of sanctions had only just arisen it was as though a man had been a member of a trade union for years and believed that the question of leaving work arose only when strike action was takendealing with some of the fallacies which had been put forward in the debate he said that sir stafford cripps in effect stated that they could not join in enforcing sanctions because a capitalist government was in power would the same reasoning apply with antisocialists if a socialist government was in power  in the case of the league there were those who said they would not go forward because capitalist states were represented on the league similarly then capitalist states might saythey would notact because the soviet govemment and scandinavian countries were representedanother fallacy was that by supporting collec tive security they were departing from the real work of their movement the building up of socialism he denied this cntirely or that the movement had lined up behind the national government the government had now very tardily and doubtfully begun to do what labour had demanded for the last four years sanctions were only onc small part of their full programme but he urged that they should stand with the organized socialists of the continent and with the peace opinion of the world against the aggressorparty leadershipmr lansburys disagreement on policywhen mr lansbury rose to speak lhe was received with loud cheering and with musical honours the delegates rising to their feet mr lansbury said that he was in a very difficult posi tion only the exccutivc committee and his cclleagues knew how often he had disagreed with policy because he was a member of the executive and latterly because of his other position he had remained silent during the con ference he wished every one to understand that it was bitter and difficult for him to stand there and publicly to repudiate a big fundamental piece of policy if he were in any doubt about that policy he would not take the line he was taking but he had never been more convinced that he was right and that the movement was making a terrible mistake than he was todayhis only difficulty was about his relationships with the party he agreed with those of his friends who thought that it was quite intolerable that there should be a man speaking as lcader who disagreed fundamentally on an issue of this kind next tuesday the part of the movemcnt that elected a leader was meeting inlondon and together they would discuss this mattcr he hoped that they would arrive at a satisfactory solution cheers the conference was con stitutionally unable to deal with the matter except by some kind of emergency motion making a recommendation to the parliamentary party or expressing itstopinion on the situation hc would not consider an expression of opinion hostile to his continuance as leader as anything more than natural and perfectly friendly he hoped that that statement would make itabsolutely clear where they stoodforce no remedyduring the conference scores of candidates had askedhim to speak and most of them pro foundly disagreed with thc position he took up he had agrced to speak buthe was worried about what he was to say and how hc was to say it however this disagreement serious as it was was not the overwhelmiingly fundamental question that brought the party together he knew that he was consistently inconsistent one could not live today without being inconsistent and hehad learned not to go through life look ing over his shoulder at the ghost of what he had been he had had an overwhelming con viction cver since he was a boy that force was no remedy during thelast six years hehad been in the position of a doctorjekyll andmr hyde he had had to speak for the party and each tinie he had seen sir samuclhoarc he hadtried nonhatty to state thepartysposition perhaps it was inconsistent of him to have joined the labour government and equallyin consistent tohavc becomeleader he believed that force never could bring permanent peace and permanent good wiltin the worid  helhad gone into districts wherc peopic were starving and had told them thatthey must not riot but must trust to thei winning ofsocialism through public opinion lie had noright to preach pacifism to starvingpeoplein this country and to preach somethingelse in relationtopeople elsewhere he n rt tone whgmhe regarded as the greatest figure in human history had put it on record that they who took up the sword should perish by the sword  history had proved it yetihere would very soon be muchgreater armaments in this country than before the war some of the schoolswere going to be movedinland from the south coast there was talk f removing woolwicharsenal to wales and children were being drilled against gas attacks what was all that for  war became more beastly every day and he could not sce thc difference between mass murder organized by thc league of nations and mass murder organized by individual nations pooling empires resourcesif he had the power to go to geneva backed by the people he would say there that great britain had finished with imperialism and was willing that all peoples under her flag wherever govern ment could be established should be free to establish their own government he would also say that the resources under our control should be pooled for the service of all mankindcontinued at foot of next columnunder the control of an international commis sion he would say further that we should be willing to disarm unilaterally for he believed that the first nation with oversea possessions which would put into practice the rule of doing as one would be done unto would lead the world away from war and utterly defeat itmr e bevin said that the specchcs made against the resolution ought to have bicn made a ycar ago and that those who opposed it ought then to havd tabled a resolition that this comjntry shouldwithdraw from thc leagucof nations mr bcint suggested that when at miargatc fhe tuc was invited to a meeting of the thrci labour organizations to consider their policy the differences of opinion had not been made fully apparent sir stafford cripps had only spoken for two minutes and had said nothing just as he had said nothing that day every
