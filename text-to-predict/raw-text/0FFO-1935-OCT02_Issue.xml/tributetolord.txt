personality of the recipient their lord lieutenant occupied a warnm place in the heart of every lancashire man and woman of whatever political calling to whom he had endeared himself as a great loyal and true english gentlemangreat traditionslancaster like the rest of the county was proud that lord derby had kept the name of stanley in such high repute by carrying on the great traditions of his noble houseloyalty patriotism and personal service the mayor added that he could only recall of the actual onnexion of the prcsent lord derby with lancaster that he was honorary colonel of the th

cities and boroughs and by douglas in the isle of man in this to him wonderful year the seventyfirst of his life alderman curwen he said had used the words s it takes a bit of doing he wanted to borrow those words and say that to believe all that the mayor had said about the present earl of decrby  indeed takes a bit of doing he hoped how ever in spite of his  years still to be able to do something for lancashire and for those throughout its length and breadth who had been so kind to him latelyrecalling incidents in his life he said that until he was  years old he lived at knowsley in the time of his grandfather one of his earliest recollections was his grandfathers excite ment over the races which the children of whom he was one used to have with cork boats with coloured paper sails on a little stream ncar knowsley then he was taken to live in west inorland and he remembered thebuilding of witherslack now the home of his son and daughterinlaw by a lancaster architect mr paley one of whose descendants he was glad to know still lived in the townlord derby added that he was brought to lancaster by his father in  to hear the declaration of the poll at the general election of that year but he did not even remember being amused later on in life he served with the militia in camp at lancaster and had cheerfulrecollections of the canteen in the corner of the town hall square it was nice to come back to lancaster and bc reminded that he was honorary colonel of the territorial battalionhe was not going to refer to a certain regrettable incident  of a military nature in which it seemed that a predecessor of his had appeared at lancasterlaughterbut he did remember that one of the two surviving lan caster honorary freemen was his friend archie hunter sir archibald hunter whom lancaster knew as a very great general and a very respect able mp but whom he lord derby remem bered quite otherwise in those militia days laughter archie hunter was then then in lancaster at the depot of the kings own and there never was a wilder subaltern laughterlord derby ended with a graceful reference to his other fellow honorary freeman lady ashton whom he said he remembered from his militia days then as cver since and still she was a lady without an enemy in the world and one to whom everybody could tum in time of trouble lord derby concluded with a sporting reminiscencenamely that the sire of his best horse was john of gaunt of timehonoured lancasterlady ashton was among those present at the ccremony today sir archibald hunter was unable to attend as he
