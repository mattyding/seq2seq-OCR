abbot on behalf of the conservative candidate in this division mr george lambert your liberal member is taking the chair supporting him is the conservative member for the totnes division and the conservative candidate tickets are obtainable from all conservative agents and it is in every way a conservative meetingthe totnes division liberal association wish to make an emphatic protest against this excur sion into our divisionobn behalf of a conscrvativc candidate by a neighbouring liberal member of parliament we believe sincerely that this action willifind no approval with the liberalsof souttlmolton on the contrary we believe they will join with us in condemning such a mischievous policy we of course have no right to dictate to the member for south molton as to his political actions that is for those whom he represents to do and we feel that they are the right and proper persons with whom to register our protestthe presence of sir john simon we regard with equanimity for we believe him to be a liability and not an asset at the present time to any party in this division however mr george lambert had his political  tuition and was brought upon the liberal principles for which our present liberal candidate still stands since the last election we have been working excecdingly hard to perfect our organization and wc believewe canwin this scatwhen the time comes for these reasons we arc protesting to mr lambert for his action and sincerely hope you will bring what influenccyou have to bear to prevent at any rate in devon and cornwall socalled liberal  support being  given to conservative candidateswe sutggest that you join with us in writing to mr lambert asking that his political influ ence shall be given to the party under whose flag he was elected and

 sept   dear mr tyrrellyour letter of the th instant protesting against my taking the chairat sir john simons meeting at newton abbot impels me to make my position quite clear for over  years i have been actively associated with the liberal party and far from fomenting i have endeavoured from  onwards to compose the differences that have so distracted the partys unity but unhappily without avail circumstances today compel me as a liberalto face facts in my judgment the only possible alternative to the present is a socialist government a socialist government kdthe country tothe brink of disaster in  and then collapsed  a repetiticin would inflict irreparable damage to agriculturc industry and employmentunddr the present national government a great recovery has been made butthat recoveryis far from coniplete a continuance of the presentcombined efforts is therefore to mymind essentialyou invokethe national liberal fcderation novv a survey of recent electoral records compels

supporting the government can influence policy liberals outside and opposed to the government are not in that positionit is to rescue liberalism from impotence and ensure that liberal thought shall
