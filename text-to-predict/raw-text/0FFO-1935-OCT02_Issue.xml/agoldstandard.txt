and the agricultural problem in central europein welcoming the delegates on behalf of the british section the president said that it would hardly be possible to find a solution for all the problems but there should be a full and frank expression of the respective national views if the present troubles were to be met they must remove the illeffects of exchange control and currency manipulation and agree to pay for what they boughtmr chamberlains speechthe british government was represented by mr chamberlain chancellor of the exchequer who said that after the nine years since the con ference last met here we seemed to be little nearer to the atmosphere of good will and con fidence among the nations which was essential to a return of prosperity with little in the way of precedent as a guide we had all been dis posed to rely on methods of trial and error which sometimes had set back rather than forwarded our aims the problems of the world in these nine years had been intricate and diffi cult beyond imagination but in spite of apparent strong differences of opinion he thought the world was nearer agreement today than at any time since the war about the direc uon in which we ought to set our faceshe was interested to note that the first subject of discussion was to be currency stabilization though he looked forward ultimately to the re establishment of a gold standard he did not feel that conditions were yet sufficiently favourable to enable us to make so difficult an experiment in the present tense condition of affairs in europe even the most tentative approach to stabilization was quite unthinkablespeeches were also made by m albert devkze belgian minister of national defence and by the leaders of the french hungarian japanese dutch and czechoslovak delegations expressing the determination of the conference to continue its efforts on behalf of the world economy undeterred by adverse conditionsthe work of the conference which is con ducted mainly in french began in the afternoon with a meeting of the finance committee which was held in a committee room of the house of commons under the chairmanship of sir assheton pownall mp m germainmartin france submitted as rapporteur a compre hensive survey of the working of the gold standard before the war with london as its centre the course of the economic crisis that had since occurred and the present position waith regard to stabilization of currencies he urged the conference to impress the urgency of stabilization upon their governments though he freely admitted that the likelihood of stabilization in the immcdiate future had receded rather than advancedthe role of the conference today he said was to be the informers of public opinion which looked for a lead he suggested that a small committee should be formed to meet in london which should act as observer in stabilization matters seek to avoid at all costs a currency war and prepare the way for stabilization when it ultimately became possible progressive pre paration was neededsystem of free exchangesir john wardlawv milne mp said that there was not much opposition to a return as circumstances permitted to a standard based on gold but he was firmly opposed to the gold standard of the past which forced countries when faced with increased imports to correct the loss of gold by harsh deflationary measures the gold standard of the future must be a system of free exchange with a fluctuating tariff he took a middle view between those who pressed for stabilization first and those who claimed that stabilization should only follow renewed freedom of trade he was against the immediate calling of another conference but agreed that stabiliza tion should be urgently studied by the authorities concernedhe proposed the following resolutionthis conference believinr that one of the ultimate objectives of governmcnts should be a return to an inter national gold standard and that to make this possible effective steps are required to remove existing impedi menisin the international exchangze of goods welcomes the resolution passed by the lcague assembly at geneva on september  and asks parliamentary delcates to usc their influence with their governments lo encourare such freer tradc by thc conclusion of btaleral agreementsm w m van lanschot holland said that de jure stabilization at present was impossible he suggested that the british authorities should aim at a de facto stabilization as a first step by pegging the pound at about its present level by intemational agreementm paul reynaud france complained that the british delegates were content to let stabiliza tion come later because their affairs were prosper ing and therefore they spoke of it as an undesir able experiment and expressed satisfaction with the league of nations resolution if that were all they need not have come to london he pre ferred the broader proposals of m germain martinthe discussion was adjourned till today
