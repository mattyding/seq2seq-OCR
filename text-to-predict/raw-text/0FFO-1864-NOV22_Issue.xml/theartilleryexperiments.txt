the artillery experiments atportsmouththe competitive firing with the naval pounder guns at portsmouthone wedge breechloading armstrong one shunt rifled muzzleloading armstrong andone whitworth muzzleloaderwas brought to a close with the exception of some few rounds from the whitworth gtm to ascertain the penetraton of shot under water with the shell firing at tbe alfred target ship on the th inst and the labours of the special committee which have conducted the experiments throughout at shoeburyneas boxhill and portsmouth having been au but concluded a brief analysis of the general resultsof thesecostlyexperiments sofarasrelates tothefiring at portsmouth and from a nonprofessional point of view may be interesting before however further noticing the general results atportsrmouth it may be as well tosay a few words on the composition of tho special committee who have conducted the experiments and who have to present tlheirreport the question to be decidedthe future arma ment of a certain description of her majestys ships of war is a purely naval one and yet the military element pre dominates in the committee and an offlicer of tbe royal artillery is its secretary in thus referring to the com mittee none of its members cati with justice complain for as already stated the question to be decided is one purely naval and must have been found by the offeicers of the ar tillery engineers and infantry on the committeenot even excepting its respectedand energetiepresident imjorgeneral randall rumleyas profoundamystery as itwould have been to almost the veriest landsman this special committee which have had now for some time to conduct and have now to decide upon a vitaly important naval question bave been in fact an  anomaly from first to last but they have certainly not been a greater anomaly than the present laws and arrangements which includes the armament of the navy in the army annual estimates these anomalies have led to errors and confusion ia relation to the outfit of her majestys ships have had a most preju dicial effect upon the important question of their arma iiient and have very nearly rendered worthless the facts obtained from the experimental sheu firing bv these  pounder guns at portsmouth auy assertion of this kind must necessarily be supported by presumed facts and these facts can in the present instance be indisputably cited without fear of disproof iu the first instance the trials at portsmouth hava been generaly understood to be a trial of the armstrong and whitworth guns and their shells as against an enemy whereas it has been in fact but a trial of fuzes and even then a lamentable mistalce and failure if a comparative trial of the guns and shells had been simply intended the use of the  petman  fuze the best known description of per cussion fuze we possess would have given the required comparative results and results which might have been implicitly relied upon for theircorrectness instead of this course being taken however the committee unfortu nately allowed the fuzes to be supplied with the guns and shell and hence the trials degenerated into a trial of fuses leposing the main features of the trialsthe merita simply of each gun and its shell to this serious deviation from the straight course which it must be supposed was laid down in the official programmne of the committees duties was afterwards added the additional error and consequent confusion of a wrong selection of the whitworth fuze for sheu firing en ricochet it is of course well known that colonel boxer has supplied all the fuzes for the whitworth sheus or that they have been constructed on a theory approved by that offieer these fuzes we understand to have been supplied oftbree different descriptions as follows wood time fuzeto act as a perfect percussion fuse and alsto to stand ricochet firingi mfetal percussion fuzeto act immediately after striking or aftera small interval and to resist ricochet on water metal coneussion fuzeto act on ricochet either on water or on land and to accomplish this it has been made as sensitive as possible aud intended to fire the shell on the latter striking the waternow it must be evident to a mind of the moat ordinarv intelligence that nos  or  fuzes might in all propriety have been selected by the committee for the whitworth shell when the latter was fired en ricochet but that no  fuze should not have been used for the same purpose the fact is however that no speciallv constructed to ex plode the shell on striking tho water was selected by the committee for ricochet firing and if reference is made to the returns of that firing it wil bo seen at once what a prejudicial effect this course had upon the action of the whitworth shells the ricochet shell firing commenced from the stork gunboat over the horse and dean shoals off portsmouth on the th inst and firing alternatelv with the shunt gun the shel of the latter being fitted with the elswick experimental fuze the results of  rounds fired from each gun gave the whitworth shell eight bursts on grazing the waterand the shunt shel only one burstout of the rounds as the object of the firingoverthe shoals was to as certain whether the shells would withstand the force evolved by the contact with the water without bursting it will be understood how really prejudicial in the minds of the comumitteethiscontinuous bursting of the wbitworth shells en ricochet must naturaly have been on the th inst this unfortunate error in the selection of the wrono fuze for thewhitworth shell was more forciblyillustrated in the ricochet shell firing at the alfred targetship in porchefter lake of  shells fired eignt burst on or after grazing the water as intended by colonel boxer andi two which hit the ship direct burst in the ship there were no means at hand for accounting for this sip parently extreme sensitiveness of the fuses at the time but now that the explanation is given respecting the fuzes the wonder that existed in the minds of the committee that shells should explode on their first or seoond graye en ricochet mustvanish when it is fouid that the fuzes with which they were fitted were  concussion fuzes intended to burst on striking waterthe shells from the shunt gun burst in many instances prematurely but this is believed to have been owing to a slight excess of sensitiveness a fault that could be easily remedied by the elswick ordnance company and the more readily so as the fuze was experimentala comparative analysis of the effects of the elswick and whitworth shells would have been most interesting had they both been fired as they should have been with the petman fuze or had the right fuseno l or been selectedby the committee or their representative for the whitworth sbell in its ricochat conrse of firing in the direct firing the whitworth small shell with its b of bursting clharge produced results which contrasted very favourably when compared with the hb bursting charge of the shunt or ilb bursting charge of the wedge shell while the seven inch shells from the whitworth gun with their b bursting charges created a greater amount of de struction in the alfred targetship than any other like num ber of shells fired throughout the whole course but we understand theselarge shells however effective they proved were merely i experimental and will therefore not be al lowed by the committee to join issue with the other shells in the official report which will be confined to the shells as laid down in the progrmme this course reduces the competing shells to three kindsthe wedgewith rb bursting charge shunt with b bursting charge and whitworth with its b charge the wedge and shunt shells would most undoubt edly kill and wound a greater number of men on the gun deck of an enemys wooden ship in action than the small whitworth shell would under like circumstances owing to the fact of the armstrong shell with its greater diameter and nearly double bursting charge breaking into a greater number of pieces than the whitworth on explodiug if any comparison is to be based upon the rale that a shells destructive powers must be measured by its bursting charge this rule does not appear however to alwayshold good for in several instances on board the alfred where solid timber was met with by the shell previous to exploding the wlhitworth shell had exbibited a greater rending power than the softer shell from either the wedge or shunt gunsit would be futile to attempt any further compara tive analysis of the effects of the armstrong or whit worth shells on board the alfred targetship for if the statement respecting the supply of three descrip tions oiuze for the whitworth gun and the selection of the concussion fuze by some one for ricochet firing is correct then it becomes a grave question for the oonsidera tion of the committee whether the whole of the ricochet firing with the rival guns has not thereby become nulified and whether it wiu not be necesry to go over the whole course againin the independent and quick firing the difference in time between the whitworth and shunt both muzzle loaders was too trifling to be of importanoe either way but the wedge breechloader was in advance of both ihe other guns in pointof time and proved itself eminently suitable for rapid sheu firing at a ships upperdeck gun for sweep ing an enemys works with shell in passing along the face of works on the shore orin forcing the entranceof anharbour it is however unsuitsble as a maindeck gun as three qr four snch weapons fired on a ships maindeck with any rapidity would stifle all the ships crew it is also a inu requiring considerable attention its key or locking bolt being a rather delicate mratter in eonnexion with its wedge pieces and the latter being also liable to work stiffly every  or  rounds from the certainty that the grooves in wvhich the wedges work must foul after a certai numuber of rounds have been fred a fault which car be certally temporfly remedied with a bucket of water anda wet cloth the fouling of the whitworth vent we have fully referred to in the trials and it will be sutlicient to remark furtherhere that no difficulty whatever was experienced ith it in its after firing when tho commonsense precaution ot passing the  pricker wire through the yvat was resorte to in accuracy of shooting so far as this was tried in the  independent firing the viwhitwoith certainly beat both the shunt and wedge gun and in ease of loading it almost if not quite equalled the ordinary smooth bore the arm strong hunt and wedge guns are as near perfection perhaps as shell guns ns any gun cau possibly be reudered if their effects are only considered when fired against the sid of a wooden ship earthen parapets wooden stockades or ady other like yielding substancethe whitworth gun with its large shell possess an equally destructive power with the shunt and wedge guns against like yielding substances but with its small shell the other guns would appear to have the advantage if the rule is to be retained that the destructive power of the shells must be reckoned in proportion to their bursting chargesas a shot gun the whitworth gun far excels both the shunt and wedge gunthus far the gunshave onlybeen spoken of in relation to their effects upon wooden ships anl earthworks c if they are consilered in relation to ironplated ships and iron plated fortifications the future fighting material of every firstclass power at sea anl on their coasts then it must be at once admitted that these pounder guns are as uselesm as a schoolboys peashoorer
