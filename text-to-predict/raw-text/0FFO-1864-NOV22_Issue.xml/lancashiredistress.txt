committee of the balances of subscriptions to the central pelief fund not remnitted but which were re turned by the collecting committees all of them in places situated outside the cotton districtsa discustion ensued on the question of the publication of these returns on the one hand this publication was urged in justice to the committees wbo had faithfully re mitted all the subscriptions confided to them for the relief cf the distress in the cotton districts and to the public on whom further claims had been recentlv advocated on the other hand it was suggested that tbe motive for coe tribution to the central fund whether from individuals or districts onght to be spontaneous and to arise out of a con viction that the condition of the workmen in the cotton dis tricts and the tendency to the exhaustion of the resources available for their relief constituted a legitimate claim on public synmpathy as however the amount of the balances unremitted was reported to be upwards of

long foreseen and to meet which therefore it has husbanded with care the central faud being unable to determilne how long the present wrant of employmuent will continue and beinf sure tha similar crises will from time to time recur t e central committee feels it to be due to those committees which have sent to the central fund the entire amount sub scribed and to the public on which the renewal of claims far assistance has already been advocated to sav that it trusts that the local committee of will regard the balances now in its hand as a fund on which the central executive committee may depend for the relief of the indi genco of the cotton districts
