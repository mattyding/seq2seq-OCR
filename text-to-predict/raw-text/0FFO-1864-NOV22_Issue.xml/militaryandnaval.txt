aiilitary and naval intelligencl ia board of oficers consisting of a field officer of cavalry presideni an engineer officer and a veterinary surgeon aaembled at the royal engineeroffice in the south camp aldershott a few days ago to inspect and report as to tho fitness for occupation of a sixtyhorse stable just completed for the military train at that station and one of those in tended to replace the temporary wooden stables burnt last year the new stable is situated at the bottom of the r lines south canip and is one of three in course of erection for the use of the th battalion mbilitary train there wiu also be a new stable appropriated to officers horses be tween the stables and distinct a forge is erected for the carrying on of the farriery c in connexion with the bat telion the material used for the buildings is known as perazie it is composed of sand shingle and lime mixed together and dried between boards this new composition has all he hardness of stone and great economy to recom mend it it is of a light cream colour the flooring if such it mav be called of the stables is of a very peculiar descrip tion good paving bricks are usedeach being set in separately and with a cemented channel aboat an inch deep surround ing it the little trenches thus made all run transversely to a central channel the advantages of this system of paving applied to a stable where there is a large number of horses are considered very great and to have a beneficial effect upon the hoalth of the animals other arrangements in the interior of the stable are of an improved yet econo nical character the cost of erection owing to the use of the compositiou abovementioned has been comparatively small and both the design and workmanship displaved in the construction favourably reflect the abilities of the royal engineers officers and men and of other corps engaged in the work besides the stables abovementioned there are two others in course of erection at the bottom of w lines for the nse of the d battalion military train these will bo built in a manner similar to those already described and when finished will exhibit a great superiority over the wooden stablidg long used in the
