mayor mr alderman hiale mr russell gurney the re corder mr chambers the common seijeant mr alder nian salomons mp amr alderman rose mp mr alder man mechi mr alderman waterlow and ar alderman stone mr alderman dakiu and mr alderman besley shesk of ndon and middlesex and the undersherr s mr septiraus davidson and mr de jerseythe calendar codtains the names of  prisoners a num er beow the average  of them have been committed from the city of london  from the county of middlesex  fromn kent and  from surrey with afew exceptions the crimes charged are also below tho average in point of heinousnessthe judges on the rota are the lord chief justice mr baron bramwiell and mr justice vlesthe recordiru in addressing the grand jury of whom mir james adams smith was foreman said the cases to be brought before them at the present sessions were not nu raeroils and that he thought all or most of them were of a very simple character reqirring no observations on bis part he was sorrv to observe that there were two charges of wilful murder in the calendar one was against a young wouan namned strangeways for the murder of her infaut child as some of the parties in this case were too ill to attend it was probable the biul would not be submitted at these sessions and even if it were ready he would not have been able to say anythin upon the subject as he had hitherto been unable to read over the depositions the se cond case of wilful murder wasagainstamannamedrichard havelan the circumstances here were somewhat peculiar it appeared that the prisoner and another man thad had a dispute in a publichouse that both were the worse for liquor that the other person struck the prisoner and that the prisoner seized a poker and struck him in return the poker was taken away and then both parties sat down the deceased and the other person both apparently fell asleep and then the prisouergot up seized the poker again and with it struck two violent blows on the heads of both theso persous but principally on the head of the deceasednot the pelson with whom he had been previously quarrelling the effect of that blnw was that the unfortunate de ceased lost his life if the case were established as set forth in the depositions he could not tell the grand jury that the case did not come within the offence of wilful murder it mnight be that on a more minute investiga tion it would be reduced below that offence but supposing that nothing beyond the cireumstance de tailed in the depositions should transpire then it would undoubtedly be the duty of the grand jury to find a true bill for wilful murder the next case of any importance in the calendar was aainst a woman named elizabeth thompson for wounding with intent to murder this was a painful case the prisoner who admitted that when she inflicted the wounds she meant to destroy the life of the child had frequently been confined in a lunatic asylum and therefore she was not perhaps responsible for her acts of course if she were not responsible and that fact was distinctly proved then she would be aequitted by the petty jury on the ground of linsanity inlwhich case care would be taken of her and she would be prevented from committing similar atrocities in future the next charge was against two men named alfred field henery and wil hiani anderson for conspiring to extort monev bv threaten ing to publish anexposure tis was averyimportant indict ment the offence being one of a most serious character but he was unable to detail the circumstances because the case must mainly turn upon the letters which were written and these were not annexed to the deposi tions the only other charge to wbich it was necessary to direct attention was against thomas bowes for haviun ob tained goods by means of false pretences the case was this the prisoner was a stockbroker doing a considerable business and on the day when the accounts became due he received a number of warrants and gave in payment for these warrants a number of checks on a bank these checks were to a very large amountto the anmount in fact of thousands of poundshe having at that time only a very smau sum there aud no means therefore of satisfying the checks and he absconded during the course of the day if these facts should be established it was a very gross case of fraud bat under the circumstances a sues tion might arise as to whether the charge of obtaining goods by false pretences could be established in every case he seemed to have received the articles and after wards gave the checks if that were so he could not see that he had actually obtained them by false pretences for he received the difterent warrants and sometimes in a few minutes and sometimes shortly after he gave the checks whatever offence he might be guilty of ia point of morals it coald scarcely be said that the charge in the in dictment could be borne out if these circumstances should be established but the point was one to which the grand jury would direct their attention there were no other cases in the calendar presenting any difficulty but should any arise the residing judges and magistrates would bepy to affor every assistance in th werlthe grand jury then retired and s after returned a number of true billsedward fuuer a respectablydressed man of middle age was indicted for stealing property to a considerable amount belonging to

richards llajor laurie mr brett sergeantmajor hunt and peter mill the atmourer of the corps went to show that they were well acquainted with the prisoners handwriting and that they believed the order

the order for the checkbook was written corresponded with that on the sheet of notepaper given by him to the prisoner  and ser geant funnell who apprehended the prisoner at his lodg ings in the

by the womran knight hereniinded the jury that the possession of it had not been traced to himtho recorder having sumnned up the eidence ob served that the case was one calculated to excite strong sus

marlboroughstreet police districtthe common serjeant said that from the depositions and the evidence of an officerconuected with the clerken well house of correction it appeared that twn of the pri

the sameit appeared that on tho th of november inspector brennan au officer of the mint received certain privateinformation which led him to a beorshop in the lnew  cut lambeth where he met the male prisoner drink ing at the bar brennan told him the charge and assed if he had any bad coin in his possession he replied in the negative whereupon he vas searched and in his trousers pocket were found

silver watches a jemmny and a life preserver there was no counterfeit coin found ulpon the wzoman but it was beliered that she was the wife of the male prisonerthtbe jury found the male prisoner guilty and acquitte czbrennau then statedthat this was an exceedingly bad case because the prisoners had a child of verytender yearswho had been repeatedly emploved by them in passing tad coin at the shops of small ttrdespeople for the last four months the male prisoner had been actively engaged in the manufacture and circulation of counterfeit coin but so adroitly had he carried on bis nefarious practices that he had succeeded in completely baffling all the attempts made by the polico to discover his acts it was a somewhat re markable circumstance that from the watches found at southwark the original names of the makers had been effaced and other names were sabstituted upon them and there was very little doubt that theprisouers had been carry anon a most extensive system of receiving stolen propertyhe coitoron serjeant said the case was a very bad one and that there was the greatest reason to believe that both the prisoners had been carrying on the manufacture of ounterfeit coin to an extraordinary extent at al eventsthere was no doubt that if they were not the actual manu facturers they were iu intimate connexion with some of that extensive gang of coiners who infested the metropolis the prosecution of whose offences occupied the atten tion of that court for about two entire days at every wesions with the view of making an example and pre venting hundreds of small tradesmen from being plundered td alarg extent by  counterfeit pieces being circulated among them itwas unezessary the male prisoner should be punished with severity that punishment being that he be
