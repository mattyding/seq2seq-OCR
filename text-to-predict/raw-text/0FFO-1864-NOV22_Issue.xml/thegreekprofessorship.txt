ie greek pbofbssorhip at oxford itho subjoined letter on the subject of the en dowment of tho greek professorship has been cir culated by the dean of christ churchl mr freeman hs ochrist church oxford nov r freeman has published a letter with the purpose of showing that an obligation to endow the professorship of greek lies upon the dean and chapter of christ churchin mr freemans letter it is saitl i read in the ox ford galendar published yearlv that the professorship of gieek with certain other professorships was founded by king henry viim the account goes on  to each of them he assigned a yearly reven ue ot  to be paid by the dean and ohapter of westmirster then newly founded but they rather thiu be subject to so great a charge made over to the king certain lands manors c which were given to the dean aid chapter of christ church who in consequence were bound to pay theso salaries to the pro fesors of divinity hebrew and greek if this statement be inaccunate it shlows great heeilessuess on the part of the dean and chapter if it be accarateand i never heard anvbody deny iti go on to snake certair deductions irons it the calendar in whichl mr freeman read these words must have been of a date prior to  if he had consulted the calendar publishedl iu that year or in either of the year following he would have insteadof the words cited these to each of themu he assizned a vearly stipend of  to be paid by the dean nnd chapter of wvestminster then newly foweded but they relieved themselves of the charge by making over to the kingz certain estates with which he had partly endowed them and the dean and chapter of christ cnurch wvere then chargcd by the kiuz with the pnayrmntt g k  r w  swoaus ut vlmuyily juedretv ants  the statement respecting professors oecurs in that psrt ote calendar which cencerns the univerity rather tpan ciirist church and wvas corrected as soon as attention was clireated to it since this was done three years ago the charge of heedlessness belongs muore perhaps to ofher per sons than to the dean and chapter and if the correction bas beeni rightly made the deductions founded on the uu corr ected passage fau to the groundthe facts so far as they have been ascertained are these in  henry viil granted lands to the dean and cbapter of westminster and charged them with the payent of  to each of  professors fve in each ujni ersityvis divinity hebrew greek law medicinei in  the dean and chapter of lvestminster sur ondered to the king lands worth  a year and were re eved from payments to the professorsin tho same year the king charged the new founda ons of christ church oxford and trinity college cam wrie with the stipends of six of these iu professorsivinity hebrew and greek in each university the apends of the remaining four he ordered to be paid out ofe excheauerwhat may be the case with trinity college i know not bit after repeated examinations we cannot find that christhurch receivedl any of the surrenderedl lauds a com parison of all the lads granited to westminster in seo wjddtes afonug i p  sqi ed  with thoso grantel to christ church in b ibid ii p  sqq snws that no one of the westnminster estates came into the possession of christ church nor can we discover that at any later time christ churelh received any of these estates or any other estates in lieu of them the belief that some of these lands were made over to us seemns to rest on a statement indugdalei p  col  that a part of them was iven to trinity coluege and a part to christ church dugitmle refers to wvidtnore hist of lyctminerabtey p   but widmore only smys a part of which last lands were given to trinity colege in cambridge and others i bhink to christ church in ox ford the account given by wood anmas ii p  omits this statenment altogetherif there is an obligation on christ church to augment the salary of the greek professor why were not the pro fessorships of divinity and hebrew endowed by increased money paymuents rather than by canonries and livings  wliy was not trinity college called on to augment the salaries of any of the professors charged upon her revenues why hns not the crown which accepted the lands surren dered by weitminster and apparently kept them uot in creased tho nmoney payments due to the professors of law and mledicine in each university i may add that the presumed liability of christ church was investigated at the time of the uaiversity commission and i have been assured on the best authority that the commissioners were satisfied that no legal claim could be niade out but it is alleged that ten years ago the chapter itself adnmitted not indeed a legal but a moral obligation to in crease the professors salary and a passage is cited from a miemorial drawn up in answer to a circular from lord pal merston in which the dean and chapter express an opinion that  if it should be deemed expedient to make any further disposal of the colleoe fmnds for academical purposes thor ofessor of grcek is  best entitled to benefit by it  and on this supposition the dean and chapter propose that they should be empowered to set apart an estate for the future endowment of the greek chair but it was not deenmed expedient to take the step pro posed when one of the presont canons was examined before the comnimsioners reference having been tnade to the endowment of the greek chair the commissioners stated their opinion that since five canonries of christ church had seen emlployed in endowing professorships enough had been done out of the funds of the college for tho service of the universitytthe present question is not new it was brought before thedean lind chapter privately some months since and we investigated it carefully we have now repeated the inves tigatiou and still find uo evidence of an obligation but if it can be shown that we hold lands specificallv granted for the purpose of paying the professor i will immediately propose to the chapter to augment the stipend now p aid to the professor according to a fair estimate of the changed valuo of inoney and ifeel little doubt that the chapter vill accede to the proposalllem y g liddell dean of christ
