mr stayvlbld mrp on mohanicninstitutionvsthe members and friends of the halifax mlechanics insti tute held a aoirjc followed by a public ineeting last friday to celebrate the extrication of the institute fromn debt the building and fittinrgs have cost oool the whole of which has been cleared off by voluntay subscriptions and donu tions lord frederick cavendish presided at the meeting shich was aidressed by his lordship mr joln crosslcvthe m ayor of halifax mr w j rloldsworth sir f cros ley mp mr e akroyd archdeacon musgrave andmr j stnsfeld mp who said that the sentiment which had been intrusted to him ran in these words mechanics institutions as an educational agencyand their i relation to a manufacturing population their relation to  a manufacturing population might he thought be shortly said to consist in this that they were best calculated to meet the wants and most likely to have a successful career in the midst of populations intelligent asi manufacturino populations were and congregated eosely together as those populations generauy were found to be aud when thev gave as a sentiment mechanicsinstitutions as an edu cationac agency he took it tllat they proposed to themselves to declare their belief in the advantages which they were calculated to confer and to express their hope for their success and for their spread through out the countrv applause they had just heard from mr crossley and from his worship the mayor the very gratifying intelligence to some of them probably new that this institution was out of debt and that that beautiful and commodious building coudd be now said to be opened to the public in a sense in which it had never hitlherto been opened and to be committed for the future perhaps even more fully than they had hitherto felt entitled to say that it was committed to the care the energv the public spirit and the sense of responsibility of those classes for whose benefit it was intended and for whom it had been constructed applause now it seemed to hini not unnatural or unfit at such a momient as that that they should if he might use the expression take stock for them selves of the capital of conviction of energy of conscioms ness of benefits to be derived and of a desire to attain them upon the part of those classes in the commuunity to whom this institution miht now be said to be handed over by those who kad watchea over and who had out of their ample means contributed so largely and sau generously to its erection and success and in entering into that discussion it was a kind of consideration which he thought came natu rally to them all that they must begin and it was safest to begn with an admission they were all he thought con scious more or less of a kind of toning down of the enthu siasm which accompanied the first conception of these insti tutions in spite of their mechanics institute unions in spite of the countenance and support of the wealthy and benevolent be thoughttheyhad a sense of difficulty of some thing like uphill work tocontend against and if they could to explaintothemtiselves nowhe would like thattheyshould ask themselves that night hy thisw as so and wlat it really meant he had heard ix said that a thought when it became popular property so to speak seemed to lose a por tion of its virtue there was a fire of enthusiasm which possessed pioneers which gave place naturally in time to the stider steps of those who camue after them to reap the fruits of their labours and to possess the land applause it was the history of al great movements they began with a void and a want of which those who suffered froni it were barely oonscious save in the case of genius which rose through the difficulties which opposed it all the more potent and au the mnore intense because of the efforts which it had to make and shone like a star through the night with the greater brilliancy for the darkness which was around applause in due time came what ho wouldl call the dawn they had a general sense of the want arise they had it proefaimed they had the remedy preached argued endeavoured to be attained with all the enthusiasm of a new object and of a new faith with all the imaginings for the future which it was calculated to excite and perhaps they had also the stimulas of some opposition not always liberal or enlightened and the selfsatisfaction of asserting a right which was denied the next stage of this progress was the actual struggle and the strife and then came the victory and then the accepted fact aud then when they hal conquered their ground when all difficulties bad disappeared before thtem sometimes came what they looked upn as a reaction and they wondered what it might meao to his mind it simply meant thisthat au these adventitious motives whichstimulatedthemnto exertion in the commencement of their movement were naturallv and inevitably at an end and that they were left to prove to tbemselves and to the world the value of the principle and the estimate in their own minds of the objects which they proposed and which if they estimated rightly that principle and those objects ought to be sufficient to secure their permanent efforts in its behalf to bring these general views home that ap peared to him to be the present condition of this mecbanics institute movement let them take the case of this building in their own town that building was freafrom debt the doors were open there was no satisfaction to be rainedby asserting a right which nobody denied orwhich nobody even deubted no working man of this population could join this or any otber kindred institution withoutbeing better thought of by his employersand by the best educated minds of those who surrounded him applause he would say such being the condition of things at the time at which they met that night he did appeal to his fellowtowns mento the great masses of those who ought to seek and to be glad to get the benefits which this institution was calcu lated to affordhe asked thein to respond to the efforts which had been made on their behalf to take this as it were into their own hands as it was offered to them to accept the responsibility of its future and make it a credit to their town and an example ro the rest of the community applause what ought they fairlvto expectoftheir working fellowcitizens when theyasked themtotakethat responsi bllityandwhatoughttheytothink ortosayamongtheinselves about the future management ofrbuch an institution ss this if it waa to succeed the first thing he would sayechoing in thisrespect the observations which had fallen from his lordship was thislet those of them who were lookerson and friendly critics if he might say so begin by modifying their expectations let them be reasonable and then per haps they might not be disappointed he did not think it was the habit of any but a few even among the best educated of theni to spend their leisare moments in those severer studies which somepeople thought ought to be the exclusive occupation of the members of a mechanics institution how ought such an institution to be managed because he felt it was a problem of some little difficulty upon what system should its alringements be made if he were asked that question he should be disposed to answerin the first place avoid the pedantry of any svstem he would say that what they wanted in an institution of this kind above everything was life and if this institution was to be a living andi a growing thing it must not be moulded upon a stereotyped form for all the future nor wovenuintoan endless pattern like a piece of carpet or of stuff he met the other day with what he thought a very sensible passage in the regort of the west riding union of mechanics institutions and he would read it it was that part of the report which spoke of other and somewhat niore popular institutions which had sprung up as rivals to their eldersistersand which mingledi miore of amuse ment though always of a refined and elevating kind he would say of an educational characterwiththeseverer studieswhich these mechanics institutes first eommenced to offer to the public the right thing to do is to avoid eithereextreme and to offer the opportunities for both to be followed in a reason able manner it is not only the intellectual wants but the physical and social instincts that must be cared for the cricketground the gymnasium the room for social chat the opportunity to listen to good music are hardly less valuable in promoting the great objects at which alleduca tional mnovements must aim than are even the classes themselves as far as individual opinion was concerned he adopted those words as being sound catholic sense and he would sav and refuse to be bound byanyrule whichwould prevent them from entertaining any proposed arrangement calculated worthily to occupy and to interest minds which would otherwise be less well employed but he would not forget the origin and intentof theseinstitutions he thought that their leading features must stiul be the class the news o om and the librarv lectures he believed did not attract as they used to do ntow he would accept at once that fact if itwere a fact and he attributedit aid hethonght theyrll attributed it mainly to the immense increase ofethe habit of reading and to the facilityrof obtaining books of a good and of a standard character  hear hear and applause the admnissions he had felt obliged to make of a lkind of toniu down of enthusiasm of perhaps a diminished sense of the afsolute need of such institutions in many places and a feelng that it vas advisable to modify their arrangements were not he thought to be considered as disheartening for another reason this mechanics institute system was after al only a part of a much greater educational movementof the great educational movement of the country and that movement itself had limits much wider than those which were nominally and formally its own why our very material progress and the growth and knowledge of ideas and their popularization through the cheap press were in themselves educational influences of the greatest potency and of he widest influence and effect nothing could give one greater and sounder cause for hopefulness for the futureof the great masses of our countrymn than the spectacle which this generation had vitnessed of the remarkable growth and development of the popular press hear hear and he did not speak here at all exclusively of the daily political or even the weekly and serial press he would include the cheap publications addressed to the million of the old standard and popular authors in which by the way he might say that their own town among provincial towus stood preeminently forth applause now the amount of production speaking of the press had enormously in creased and yet the standard of productionhe did not think any one would deny itwas undoubtedly raised hear hear the press must be conducted as a rule with a view to profit the cbeap popular press must be addressed to the million it might have been fearedhe believed it was feared by men by no means without great intelligence that such a press would pander to a low taste the fact remained that the press directed mainly as it must be with a view to profit and addressing the million had not lowered but had positively raised the standard of taste of those to whom it was addressed applause he attri buted this remarkable fact fullas he had said of the greatestpromise and hope mainly to another fact and to what he would call a lawv the fact was this that the population of this country was iiot a decaying or a corrupt population but one that was sound manly and vigorous hear bear and the law was that great law which seemed to him to lie at the basis as it were of all humau progress and of what he would call the educatabilitv of man by virtue of which the morality and intelligence of the community of any con gregation of men gathered together for a good common purpose were higher than the average of the morality andntgllieenceof those who opposed it hear hear and those who had to addres it did instinctively even an thevoice rose in addressing such numbers ae saw be fore bim address it in alugher moral key applause this fact and this law were sources of the greatest hope and promise and if for no other reason he would hail such in ptitutions as this without reference to the detailed educa tional arrangements they might afford because they were tsociataons of men banded together for a good common pur pose and they were in themselves and in thq highest andbeat sense an educational influence for all cheenr mani fold and varied to those who were habituated to dwell upon these subjects were the signs of hope and of proress in the future for the peopleofthiecountry applauseuegislation and the enera current of events teuded more and more to raise their material their intellectual and their moral condi tion free trade haa given an immense expansion to industry and the whole community had reaped more or less its share of the benefit legislation with respect to the hours of labour had been enacted amounting to a statutable declara tion that there was something more than the mere produc tion of wealth to be sought for by a true political economy cheers and the feeling which dictated that legislation lived in the hearts and the acts of the great employers of labour and producers of wealth for which there were men upon that platform whose names to them and to england were a guarantee renewed applause then look at the elenientar schools the question that was now raised was whether after all it might not be middleclass ex amination which would prove a laggard in the race then think of the way in which ideas information facts were communicated rapidly from place to place from country to country and permeating all classes by means of those great inventions which seemed to come like all great events in their due time in the seat scheme of the progres of mankind then he would say of emigrmtion that it was leadingforth our countrymen to found uew nations spcak ing our tongue andinheriting more or less of our traditions giving to our people a sense of dignity aud of power and a consciousness of a great future aun immediatelv tendiug to elevate the condition and states of those who remain behind he wouldadd that association was free that everything whicl was lawful in itself remained lawful however great the number of men might bs who cotnbined to carry it into effect and to learn a all best learnt by the lessons of experience the best method of attainiug any great object they might seek great indeed were the prospects before the people of this country and he coultl not but think looking at the nature of tbis meeting though the sentiment he ha been askel to submit to them had neces sarily been somewhat limited in its formlooking at the character of those whom he saw before him the most in fluential of their citizens gathered together upon one plat form without distinction of party or of sect applause to testify to their interest in a thoroughly popular educa tional institutehe thought he was entitled to inter pretwidely the signs of that gathering and saythat it nmeant on their part and on the part of all goodl men a sincere desire that that future which be believed would be great would asio be goodthat those who had these great opportunities and great powers opening to them tnight feel the responsibility which always accompanied the enjoyment of powers newl attainedapd that they might so act as to raise the character of the great mias of the people in this community to raise the standard of english character throughoutt the country and to offer an example to the world loud cheers
