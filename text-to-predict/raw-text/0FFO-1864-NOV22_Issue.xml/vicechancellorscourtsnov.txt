our abstain from doing that which they do doubt might have doneviz by an action there was the demand and the promise only and that was perfectly true the question was whether it was necessary that there should be such a promise in order to make what took place a sufficient con sideration it must be observed that aecording to the state ments in the biu there was a demand for security and a promise of apreement by the debtor that he would give that security on certain galthough it might take some days and be would get the warrants and hand them over to the creditor what was the effect it appeared to his honour that when a creditor demanded payment of his debt and in consequence of that application the debtor agreed to give cer tin securityalthough there was no promise bythecreditorto abstain for any given time the effect of that was that the cre ditor did in fact give and the creditor did in fact receive the benefit of some degree of forbearance although forno defi nite or specified period it was trao that at any time not witistanding lhatpromise the creditor might if he pleased insist upon immnediate payment even after the security had beeu given but the very res gstee and circumstances did necessarily imply andinvolve the acquisition oa the part of the debtor of a certain deree of forbearance which he would not have derived if he had not given the agreement for the
