thank you sir robert for the kind and genia way in which youave proposed my health and you ladies and gentletuen for the handsome and cordial manner in which you have respondled to the toast i dont think i quite deserved all that sir robert has said of me but i must say i like it laughter and cheers its only human nature cheers my nature has been called a hard one but believe me it softens at your kindness sir robert has told fou that we were achoolfellows  years ago i wish he haa left out the  years but as i am a married man with nine children it doesnt much matter well it is quite true we were at school together  years ago at a place very famous in his tory londonderry cheers and laughter celebrated for de fending itself against great odds well perhaps some of the old north irish blood flowed in our veins for we came from that part and when the time came that in india we found ourselves fighting against ste greater odds the blood of the old defenders of derry warnmed within us and like old war horses we buekled to ourwork cheers but gentle men i think that whatever i may have done nuyliente nant sir xobert moontgomery did almost more cheers i gentlemen and ladieswhen i think of those terribledays i hardly know whether to think of them with pride or with sorrow when i remember the glorious deed of our army before velhi i feel prend of my nation and my countrymenirush english and scotch but when i think of tne genius and bravery which are buried therei feel that our tnumph was indeed dearly cought there was john nicholson i think of him without whom perhaps not even englishmuen would erer have taken delhi i can hardly say any more cheers but this i will say that as lon as an englishman survives in india the name of john nichoi son will never be forgotten i had in those days under me a body of officers in the punjab who for zeal energy and ability were as good as india ever has or ever will produce if we were in any way an example to the rest of india we have had our reward ladies and gentlemen six years ago i left this country with a shattered constitution after many years hard work but i left it in the hands of sir robert montgomery mfy mantle could not have fallen upon lbetter shoulders and when i look around mb and see the smiling happy faces of a contented people and tho material improvements which have been made under his guidance it sometimes seems to me that it would have been well had the mantle fallen upon him sooner cheers it has given me the greatest pleasuro to return to the punjab i have been much pleased with what i have seen and i wish that had the time to go over the whole of it it has given me much pleasure to meet you all here tonight again i thank you for the kind way in vwhich you bave re eved noe and i wish you aulhealth and happiness loud and prolonged cheerswe extract from the same paper the following account of the spectacle presented at the durbar  to the north of lahore between the walls of the fort and the branch of the ravee which flows by the city stretchles a level plain green with closeenglishlooking turf and studded here and there with clumps of darkleafedl trees here the tents for the durbar of the viceroy had been pitched it would have been diffienlt to have found a more picturesque or impressive spot for a great spectacle on one side is the badami garden once almost the moat beautiful for its size in upper india and still though neg lected and half deserted filled with rare trees and shrubs to the south of the plain stretches the city of lahore here is thle pa lshai masjid with its three white marble domes and four tall rinarets the fort which has resisted more than one assault the samnion burj where resided ranjit sing and his successors the roshnatgate where prince nao vihal sing was kiued by the fall of the parapet and where raja dheyan sing was murdered and the tomb of maharaja runjit sing himnself nor is the plain itself without its history here a hundred years ago the army of ahmed shah burani lay encamped  here runjit sing used to review his army and seated on this hinhest roof of the shish mahal with the young raja hira sing first cousin of the present mlaharaja of kashniir seated be side him and auri sin malwa fakir azizuddeen janna dar kussbal sin raja itheyan sing and other courtiers standing arouns used to direct their msnceuvres and criti cise the drill and bearing of the troops but never in the past history of the punjab has there een so vast a gather ing of the chivalry of the country on this plain as was yes terday assembled there to pay their homape to sir john lawrence maharaja runjeet sing never held durbar for his whole kingdom and even had he done so the chiefs of the cissutlej and belhi were not under his authority and the chiefs of peshawurandthederajat mighlthave been summoned many a time by any sikh before they would have cared to answer lords dalhousie and canninghelddarbars at labore for theneighbouringchiefsbutat ambalapesha wurand lera ismael khanthey received the chiefs of those districts but on thepresent occasion from everypart of the punjab territory raias chiefs maliks and sirdars had been summoned to lahore and they all with very few exceptions came soine who were infirm and ill some who were sopoor that they had to mortgage their hatnds and houses to procure the near for presentation hut all came for they wished once more to see the great viceroy whose name is feared and loved throughout hindortan the hour fixed for the durbar was  am and two hours before that i timc many of the smaller chiefs arrived and took theirassigned seats the chairs had been arranged in the larger tent in the form of an euipse the throne of the vicerov on a raised platform spread with cloth of gold and covered witlh a canopy of gold and crimson was at the extreme end about  the independent chiefs and rajas began to arrive first eanme the raja of jheend dressed in white brilliant with diamonds and emeralds with a yellow turban and sen paejamas then mandi smauest of rajas in red and green with a red orange turban the third to arrive was maler kotla tal and corpu lent in black and gold with a green turban and fourth the raja of faridkot dressed like a true khalsa chief in yellow the raja of kanurthalla who arrived fifth was perhaps dressed withbetter taste than any chief in darbar in white with blue paeeamas and the insignia and blue riband of the star of nd then came the maharaja of pattiala niost superbly dressed with emeralds and pearls swhich almost hid his dress of ricb lavender silk last of all arrived the maharaja of jumnuu with his son and heir they were dressed much alike in white with yellow and red turbans diamond and emeralds the maharaja also wore the insignia of the star of india of which order he is a knight all these ralas wecre conducted to their seats by officers specially appointed for the duty and now that all have taken their seats andare yaiting the arrival of the viceroy let us look round the vast assemlbly and mention some of those the best known tofamo or best worthy of mention for their brverv their loyalty or their iong descent for here met together for the first time in the history of the punjab are the rajpoot ohiefs of the hllus the sikh nobles and the wild pathans of the northwest border here is all that the province has to show of manly strength and beauty of courage and wisdom and devotion to the state and perhaps in no country in the world could so fine a body of men have been called together here is the jat of the manja large of frame ready to cul tivate his little field or to buckle on his sword and go forth to fight the battles of the ehalsa he is not so clever as some here but he is genial affectionate and manly and his clharacteristics remind those who know him best of john bull himself and here is the derajat imalik washed and clothed and in his right mind not always in his own hiuls savoury or pleasant to eye or nose nmixed up in numiberless hereditary fends careless of the life of himself and others and never so bappy as when engaged iu a raid on the moun tain sicle but staunch hospitable splendidly reckless goriously brave  i young subalterns passing college inalcutta drinking your sodavwater and sending tile country and the natives to the devil come and see what manner of men are these here are thews andsinews bone andmuscle these are men whom it is mnost unsafe to kick or to abuse  these are men by honouring whom you will best honour yourself and whom you may call friends and brothers with out disgrace i for here alre the men who fought agistu at sabiaon and chillianwala and with whombut tieot her day we recovered hindostan who when led by suchl mnen as probyn and fane will ride fomrvard to the death aginst any armyin theworld withoutone look or thought behindj
