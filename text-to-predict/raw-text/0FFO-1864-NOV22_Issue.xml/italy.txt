italyfrom our own dorrespoxdentturin nor iyou have been informed from vienna of the little importance attached by the austrian govern ment and generals to those attempted disturbances in venetia which the latter have very justly de scribed as an act of folly the following note translated from the official gazette of the italian kingdom will showr you the opinion entertained of those attempts by this government including and headed by the principal italian general whose de sire for the emancipation of venetia from austrian rule cainot be for an instant called in question even by the most ardent of his antagonists the gazette says on the first outbreak of the insurrectionary movement in the friuli some persons endeavoured to profit by it in order to agitate the country in favour of a party and to drag the government into a struggle of the oppor tuneness of which it alone can be judge newspaper pro clamnations public meetings subscriptions of various kinds exaggerated or fanitastical news of successes attempted enlistmentsau means have been employed to incite courageous but inexperienced young men to cross tha frontier and join the insurgents the goyernment coulld not remain indifferent to such proceedings which were of a nature to compromise the safety of the country it con sequently senit fitting instructionsto thepolitical authorities lepende nt on it to make known that it disapproves these inconsiderate movements revealing at the same time the stratagems employed and exposing the real truth in order to dissuade credulous young men from imprudent attempt unfortunately such means of per suasion and a constant watchfulness have not sufriced to hinder certain unreflecting young men from seeking the accomplishment of hazardous designs the conciliatory manner in which the authorities have hitherto proceeded has been disregarded the agitators have even profited by it to spread the report that while appearing to impede the movement the government in reality favoured it thev were thus enabled to get together a considerable band of armed men and to send it off towards the froatiers of friuli and tyrol but the government was on its guard and gave the necessary orders to defeat this inopportune enterprise yesterday more than  persons belonging to that band were surprised and disarmed by our brave soldiers and by the roeval carbineers and justice will take its utsual course with respect to them according even to the broadest prin ciples of liberty tho frontier cannot be left open to a work of manifest invasion such is that which is now attempted but which will not be realized at any price the govern ment will not allow itself to be either led away or compro mised wthe party of actionthe mazzinians or garibal dians or whatever they may style themselves  have as good a right to their owii opinions as the most moderate and ministerial of their oppo nents but the means they adopt to forward their views are too often those of deceit unscrupulous and reprehensible regardless of the lives of those whom they led away as well as of the vexations atid persecutions they were sure to entail upon the italian subjects of austria they have used every species of incitement and have done their utmost to give a factitious importance to the socalled in surrection in friuli it was high time for the government to speak out upon the sutbject and the noe in the gazette and the arrest of the misguided volunteerswill have a good effect in opening the eyes of some and in deterring otliers from rushing upon destructionfollowing the patriotic example set by the muni cipality of brescia that of caserta has decided to advance the landtax for  on account of the proprietors within its jurisdiction it is announced that milan gaeta and formio will do the same and that various other places are likely to follow in their footsteps indeed now that the impulse is given it would not be surprising if a large sum were to be advanced to the government in this way whereas individuals who had not the money at their command would in many cases have to pay a very high percentage for a loan the corporate municipal bodies will be able to borrow on much more favoualble terms the country has evidently the will to assist its governmnent and to maintain its credit and all it desires is to be shown a practicable way of doing so it was latelysaid that with a little more timne to turn in the patriot ism of the italian people might be efficaciously re sorted to in the form of a voluntary loan the plan of anticipating a tax that yields so large a sum as five millions sterling per annutm was looked upon at first with great disfavour but the more reflectingr portion of the population pondering on the difficulties of the situation and feeling convinced that the minister has recourse to so extreme an expedient only becaiuse he is utterly at a loss for a better be stirs itself to furnislh the much required aid from the very day when the financial distress of the country was laid bare before the chamber the deputies of all parties expressed themselves will ing to stibscribo to any sacrifice necessary to preveut insolvency itis gratifying to believe that in so speaking they did but give utterance to the feelings of their constituents and that these seem disposed not only to echo their declarations but to come to the rescue with their purses this is one of several excellent symptoms now observable in italysymptoms that give the best hopes for her future and prominent among which must be placed the gratifying assurance lately given by general della marmora of the extent to which a fusion has already been accomplished among the various italian peoples to the completion of that tiost desirable fusion all the observations i have lately been able to make induce me to believe that the transfer of the capital to florence will materially tendmeanwhilethat transfer and the convention are stil the topics on which many words are being ex pended in the chamber of deputies signor mosca reporter of the committee on the bill spoke yeser day edefendinr the project against the nutmerous opponents anassailants it had found his speech was sensible enough but unnecessarily and unmer cifully long considering the weariness of the cham ber and of thte public the only good reason for prolonging the debate is to give the opposition full and fair opportunity of expressing its views in order that it may not hereafter say tiat the bill was scampered through the house and that it had been overridden by a majority which abused its strength fresh arguments and further declama tion on the government side of the question are altogether superfluous and indeed may now be termed impossible mosca combated vwitlh close rea soning and to the satisfaction of his friendsthe objec tions that had been raised to the bill concluding by reiterating the conviction of the committee that the roman question would be settled in a way conform able to the wishes of italy his speech terminated the general discussion but there still remained the orders of the day and amendments on the different articles of the bill the president has divided the orders of the day of which there are about a dozen into four series the first of the first series is signed by signor crispi and by  of his political friends and runs as follows the chamber considering that the transfer of the capi tal to florence is a guarautee given to france that rome shall remiain to the pope considering that such an act cause and condition of the treaty of the th of september violates the national constitutive compact which has for itsbasis the pljiscite of the st of october  postponlng to a lime when there shall be freedomn frum all foreign pres sure the discussion of the provisional seat of government adapted tothbe political and military exiaencies of the state until rlome shall bgecome the capital of ntal passes to the order of the dayin support of these opinions signor crispi made ahard energetic vehement speech comprising sharp censures on the late cabinet and on all the men who during the last four years have misgoverned the state and shed blood in piedmont and in sicily the treaty of the th f september is according to the opinion of crispi and his friends a violation of the plbiscite the minghetti ministry having made itself odious and impossible in piedmont re solved to change the capital in order that it might govern elsewhere that was the secret of the con vention the real object of which was to keep an in competent cabinet in power and not to take italy to rome the partytthat now governs is in signor crispis opinion the party of fear he con clhided with an appeal to the democracy of piedmont to join the party of which he is one of the chiefs signor bozzio rose after crispi to withdraw his proposition which all things con sidered he was decidedly judicious in doino his vote he said would be against the bil but if the majority decided to hoist sail for an inknown port he for one would not abandon the ship in which he felt that the destinies of all were insepa rably embarked re believed the convention preg nant with danger but he and those who thought like him would not shirk the encounter though it had been in opposition to their wish and voice they would be willing on the contrary to work with their political opponents to conjure the storms that threaten italya patriotic resolution of which the announcement won the approbation of the chamber the report on the finance bill having been then brought in by deputy georgini signor sella urged the necessity that it should be discussed and voted by both chambers before the tlh inst and proposed that the deputies should sit twice today and again tomorrow he chamber finally decided to meet on these two days at  am and to sit intil night with an hours in tervalfrom noon until  oclock general avezzana a very old gentleman then rose and amid signs of disapprobation fulminated against the men who had dyed the streets of turin with blood and signed the shameful and fatal convention the president had to request him to keep to the question before the house and the deputies showed little disposition to listen to his violent denunciation and soon afterwards separated in the course of sionor moscas speech in one of the intervals of repose commonly taken by orators in this parliament the president announced the death as having occurred only a few minutes before of general alexander della rovere minister of war in the last cabinet it caused very great regret the lamented officer hav ing been much esteemed for his excellent qualities general della marmora manifested much emotion on learning the loss of an old friend and romrade the family of della rovere is of great antiquity and traces itself back to ancestors who woa laurels in the crusades the deceased marquis was born in  was brought up at the turin military aoademy served in the campaigns of  was intendant general of the sardinian corps which won so much credit by its excellent condurt in the crimea served in lombardy in  was promoted to the rank of majorgeneral in that year and was appointed in april  the kings lieutenant in the sicilian provinces on cavours death he became minister of war in the cabinet formed by baron ricasoli was made senator of the kingdom when that ministry went out and was again minister of war in the farini and in the minghetti cabi nets he was grand officer of the military order of savoy and of that of st maurice and lazarus knight ofthebath andruight comnmander of the legion of honour he was a man of culti vated mind and of firm and upright character and that he was beloved by his comrades is shown by the fact that more than one general who sits in the chamber of deputies was seen toshed tears when surprised by the sudden and most unexpected an nouncement of his deathniorrthe chamber met at  this morning signor minghetti rose to protest against the offensive at tacks made yesterday upon the late ministry attacks which he repelled and which he left unan swered only for the sake of concord and ofthe public good sundry  orders of the day more or less extravagant reasons for the rejection of the bill wrerethen brought forward one of these due to deputy pineltiwas justly defined bydella marmora as a declaration of war against austria deputy laportaasked the president of the council if it was true that the french government had replied to his note of the th inst della marmora laconically replied that he should not answer the question the proposers of the various amendments tantamount to throwing out the bill all spoke more or less in support of their motions and a good deal of time was consumed in a very unprofitable way deputy minervini took the premier to task for the confi dence he hadlately expressed in the emperor of the french a confidence which he desired to prove ill advised and most fatal be was desired bythe pre sident to leep to the question the majority got im patient and minervini shouted out that they were resolved not to hear tha truth there was some what of a row and minervini at last sat dovn after having spoken at great length nicotera made one of his tirebrand speeches if to morrowv he said  we were to try to go to rome you would drive us back with volleys of musketry and understand that by tomorrow i mean when the french shall no longer be in rome and if i were to ask the hon della marinora whether such would be the reception he would give us he whose loyalty i well know would reply  yes  della marmora made an affirmative sign to the great amusement of tne chamber  perchance said nicotera  tie convention was made in order to change the system of government i and that would also be an advantage since italy in my opinion now suffers from three misfortunesthe french in rome the austrians in venetia and the government in the hands of the moderate party laughter several deputies withidrew the motions of which they had given notice another skirmish took place towards the end of the sitting in consequence of deputy brunettis motion that  the chamber being of opinion that the con vention of the th of september implies no renunciation of the legitimate aspiration of the italians to have rome as their capital passes to the discussion of the articles this gave rise to another row the left shouting the president calling to order brunetti protesting quiet being somewhat restored lanza again reminded the chalmber of the extreme urgency of the financial question a noisy unprofitable sitting terminated at an unusually late hour
