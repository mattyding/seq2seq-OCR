which there were many and among them the following deserve mentionex pabte the surveyors of tee highways ofaskerton in cumiberlahdin this case there had been a summous before justices of cumberland for anorderon thesurveyors to repaira highway ataskerton or that they should be indicted for its nonreair the surveyors had attended and obected that the road was not a highway vhich they were liable to repair the justices considered that tbeywere not bound to determine whether it was a highway and tht it was a question to be decided onthc trial of the indictment they therefore directed au in dictmnent to be preferred against the surveyors for nonrepair of the roadmr serjeant hayes movedon theirbehalf for a certiorari to bring up the order to quash it on the ground that the justices should have inquired whether the road was a high waythe court granted a rule nisiraynes v croydena troublesome difficulty here arose on the execution of an inquisition uuder a writ of elegit the writ of execution under which a debtorsfreehold lands are taken upon that writ there is an inquisition or ez parte inquiry by the sheriff as to what lands the debtor has and in this case it appeared that he was heiratlaw of a person who died seised of certain lands but leaving an uitterly unintelligible will which had caused all the difficulty the will devised the lands without saying to whom to be divided not say ing among whom share aml share alike the sheriff and jury were of course perplexed by this extraordinary will and found specially that the debtor was entitled onlv as devisee and as one of the children under the will without saymi to vhat estate lie was entitled the plaitiff the judgment creditor now found himself in this diffculty that as the inquistion makes his title upon which he is to recover the lands in ejectniient and as it showed no title he couldl do nothing until he got rid of this bad inquisition and substituted a better one accordinglymr r jarxs now moved ou his behalf to set aside or vacate the inquisition with a view to the taking of another it was plain he said that the absurd devise was void and that the debtor took as heir but upon the inquisition the plaintiff could do nothing and was deprived of all remedv until it was got ridof hie found that according to the practice and the authorities in such cases the plaintiff was entitled to have the

advantage of itthe court grauted a rule nisi for a prohihitionwells v nathantthis case raised a singular question between debtor and creditor the plaintiff the creditor a mlember of the society of friends had a demand for the sum of  against the defendant a hebrew the debtor unable to pay in full but desirous as it appeared to pay all he could went round to his creditors one by one and got them to takce a composi tiou of ls in the pound which be had fully and fairly paid to all of them having gone to all the creditors but the plaintiff and got them to take the compoition he then came to the plaintiff who as the jury found also agreed to take it and accordingly receired it to the amount of f giving a receiptin fulof all demandls having thus re ceived the composition he then sued his debtor for  the residue of the original debt the debtor pleaded the composi tionthat is that it was mutually agreed by and between the plaintiff and the other creditors to accept the composition tlhe case was tried before the commouserjeant and it was clearly proved that the debtor had previously got the other creditors to accept and receive the composition aud though the plaintiff denied that he had agreed to take it the jury expressly found that  the plaintiff assented to take the s in the pound on being assured that the other creditors had taken it it was objected however on the part of the plaintiff that on the ancient doctrine of law payment of a smaller sum was no satisfaction of a larger unless it was ac cepted by all the creditors in consequence of a mutual agree ment between them and that here as the other creditors had taken the composition singly before the plaintiff was ale pliid to and they had not taken it therefore in considera tion of his taking it there was no such mutual agreement and therefore he was not bound by the composition the common serjeant thought there was no evidence of such mutusl agreement and therefore directed the verdict to be eiftered for the plaintiff for the amlount of the residue of the debt a rule had been obtaiued on the part of the de fendant to enter the verdict for him or for a new trial on the ground that there was evidence of a compositionmr h jahes showed cause and adverting to the fact that the dreditor the plaintiff was a quaker and the debtor a hebrew admitted that his client the quaker had certainly got the best of it whatever might be thought of the morality of the claim there could be no doubt he con ceived as to its legal validity nothing could be more clear law than that except in the case of a mutual composition a smaller sum was no satisfaction of a greatermr justice mlellori confess i never couldunderstand the reason of it i never could see why two persons quite able tounderstand their own interests should not agree together to settle their affairs as they may think propermr el jaï¿½estill such is the law and the only ex ception is that of a composition but here there was uo composition a comoosition implies a mutual agreement between the creditors to accept it but here the other credi tors had all received it before the plaintiff was applied to and therefore they cannot be said to have received it on the understanding that he would receive itmr justice mellot that doesnot appearand i should rather infer the contrary because they were led to sup pose from the very offer of a composition that all the cre ditors including the plaintiff would accept it it appears that it was represented as a compositiontihe ord chief justicit would probably be suffi cient if the others took it supposing that he would take it unfortunately that is not distinctly found this verdict however clearly cannot standmr macnamara argued on the part of the defendant that in substance it was a case of composition and that this was a good defencethe court were clearlv of opinioa that the verdict as it stood could not be maintiined but the question must be submitted to a jury and so there must be a rule absolute for a new trialex parte thompesonin the xaiter of an xlection for the town council of efgatein this case there had been an election for the office of town councillor for the borough of reigate and the number of votes as declared was for thompson the applicant  and for one lazden  one voter for thompon had been rejected by the presiding aldermau as drunk and incapable  and two days after the election the alderman alone and in the absence of the assessors struck off two mnore of thompsons votes and then gave the casting vote in favour of mazden and declared him to be duly electedblr h jasres now moved on the part of thompson for a quo svarranto against mazden on the double ground first that the vote of the elector was wrongly refused next that the alderraan had no right to strike off votes as he had done under the municipal corporation act th and th of william iv cap  sec o with regard to the first point as to the refusal of the vote the learned counsel re hed on the affidavit of the elector that he handed in his voting paper and that the alderman would not receive it and he insisted that the alderman had no right to refuse it on such a ground and that if the elector was sober enough to hand in his voting paper it was sufficientthe lord cnise justice said hp could hardly assentto that voting was an act of the mind the exercise of a deliberate choice and if a voter was not in a state to un derstand the nature and effect of his vote the mere fact that he was just sober enough to stand and hand in his paper would searoely be sufficientjr mes said he did not know what amount of intel lect was required to qualify a man for voting at an election of town counciuorsbmr justice ctoxmptxat al events it is not enough that he is not quite so drunk that he cannot standthe lord hiaef justice the mere act of handing in thevoting paper is not the act of voting and it does not a ppear that the elector was in a state to understaud the act of votingin the resultthe coubt refused the rule on that ground but granted it as to the two votes struck offthe queen v jones and anotherthis was the case tded at the last liverpool assizes of an indictment under the foreign enlistment act for pro curing persons to be enested at liverpool in the confederate servime the meu were eugaged by the defendants at liver pool to serve as crew of a vessel on a voyage to china but off the coast of france a confederate officer came on boardand as was alleged with the privity of the defendants engaged the men in the coufederate service it was objected for the defendants that there was no act done in this country against the act but the lorl chief justce who tried the case was of opinion that if the defendants enlisted the men here with the view and intent that they should be elsewhere enga edfor the confederate service it would be an offence within the act and he left that question to the jury who found the defendants guilty the point of lawv being re served for the opinion of this court in the event of the defendants being called up for judgment it was desired however on the part of the defendants without waiting for that to raise the auestion of law whether they had beeunguilty of any offence within the act and the case was mentioned in the early part of the term when the court said it might be brought on at any timemr edward jamzs qc who as attorneygeneral for the county palatine ot lancaster had conducted the case for the prosecution now appeared ia court and having he said the sanction of the attorneyeneral desired to know whether when the case came on it would be argued out at once or whether there would merely be a rule nisimr tetplae qc who with mir melish qc ap peared for the defendants suggested that it might be in iconvenient for the defendants to come up onseveral occa sions and in criminal cases they mwut be presentm james said he was not sure if that was necessary there was he believed a statute on the subjecta memberof

as sizesexcept in cases of informations filed in thexings bench by the attorneygeneral where he prays that the judgment may be postponed or unless the court in the first six days of term grant a rule

arguted out aua disposed of at oncethe joitd chief justice said if the counsel for the crowntasented toithat course he supposed there would beno objection whnch no doubt would be more convenientit was uuderstood that this course would be pursuedlloyd v hasrrjsothis was the case partly argued the other day and con sidered by the court to raise a question so difficult and im portant asto require tobefully reargued the question was thisthe plaintiff having recovered judgument against a debtor issued a writ against his person upon which he was arrested thedebtor produced the certificate of the regis trar iu bankruptcy of a deed of arrangement registered as entered into under that act but wich it was admitted was invalid the bankruptcy act  providing that such certificate should be a protection from execution the sheriff upon the production of the certificate let the debtor go feariug an action by him for his detention thereupon lie was sued by the judgment reditor for letting the debtor go the sheriff set up the ertificate as an excuse and the reditor set up in answer the admitted iuva lidity of the deed the deed was bad because onlyfor the beneft of the reditors who should execute itwhereas the bankraptey act it has been held requires that it should be for the benefit of all the creditors assentin or nonassenting the certificate does not set out the deed and therefore did not disclose its invalidity on the con trary iu stating its effect it so stated it as rather to imply its validity statin that it was a deed of assignment for the equal benefit of alithe creditors of the debtor whereas in fact as already mentioned it was only for the benefit ofart the laintiff the judgment creditor asked if he was to lose his debtor and his debt by a deed admitted to be in valid without remedy theaefendant the shieriffs officer on the other hand asked if he was to be held liable for mis tating the effect of a deed he never saw and for acting on a certtiifiae of the court of bankruptcy such was in ssb stance the nature of the question in dispuite between the paisties and it will be seent that it was one of sufficienit diffculy ndmorover asthee dedsare very

mivald eed a yet aot be auswerable to damages to the creditor the sheriff he argued would not be liable for refuing to arrest or discharge the debtor if the refusat was bonflide and because of any doubt as to the validity of the deed and therefore there was no hardship in his bein liable to the creditor if be tookc upon himself rashly the responsibility of discharging the debtor on a deed which turned out to be invalid all that the actsaid was that the protection should be  available rwhich did not imply that the officer would he liable to an action for not acting upon it provided he hesitated bondgjie and in a case of difficulty the remedy for the debtor was to apply to the court of bankruptcy which would de termine on the validity of the deed thus the pro tection would be made available if valid to the debtor and on the othler hand if it was not valil there would be protection to the sheriff and security to the debtor the act of the court would even if mistaken protect the officer not so the mere act of the registrar which was purely ministerial and nothing more the mere ministerial act of one officer would not protect another if the sheriff had acted hodestly and not wilfully in refusing to dis charge the debtor he would not be liable to action at the suit of the debtor but if he chose on his own responsibility to discharge the debtor without applicaion to the court he would be liablemr justice caomrtoro observed that as a general rule the meaning or motive of the sheriff would not bemnaterial aud the question was whether the act was legal there was a difficulty in the apphcation of the word  wilful  in such a case in one sense the act was  wilfual  as a deli berate act of the wiul aud in auy otlher sense it was not material whether he act was  wilful for if not legal itwas wrongfalmr baylsthe oflicer is not liable to action if his act is not wilfulthe lord chrif justicewhat is meant by  wilftl in sucll acase you dont mean an act wilfully

as to whether the deed has been executed by the requisite majority  the sherilf has no maeans of taking judicial cognizance of the facts the certificate is either legal and binding upon him or it is notmr baylisthe protection is only to be on a certificate of  such deed as is before described that is a deed valid under the act no doubt there is great difficulty in the cou struction of the act owing to the way in which it has bees drawn probably the fraruer forgot the preceding provi sions on the subject i admit the great difficulty in which the sheriff is placed but then i say that on that very c count he ought to have applied to the court for directio before discharging the debtorthe lopad chif justiczand the court is placed ia a position of no less difficulty and indeed is placed betw eea two alternatives either of which would be attended by mose mischiievous consequences if on the one hand we hold that the sheriff must take his chance of the dleed being valit or invalid then if it turns out to he valid he is liable to the debtor for detaining him on the other hand if it is a pro tection to the debtor it is so to all time for it is not  mere interinm protection and if therefore the court set asile the execution then this strane and anomalous consequeuce would followthat the creuitor might in action aaillst the debtor for his debt effectually resist the defenos foundedou the deed and recover his judgment andyet coult not have execution  the sheriff again is put in this posi tionthat he has no means of ascertaining whether the det is valid antt yet he is made liable for a mistaakemr baylls could only submit as to that point that there was no real hardship for the sheriff could apply to the courtmr justice croaprton observed that the court of bank ruptcy would have no power to sct aside the certificate  tba debtor would have a right to itave the validity of the deed legally determninedthe lord ciultf justice pointed out thattbe protectiovx was to be after notice of the filing of the leed as aforesaid but there was no provision as to filing at all in the act so that there was to be  notiee of something which was not done a laughmr justice ceomctptoithe fact is that the framers of the act have evidently taken a number of provisions out of previous acts and jumbled them together a laugh they found some clause in another act as to dotice and cut it out with a pair of scissors and put it iu this ac with out knowing what effect it would have l tughter there is certainly nothing about fiiling the deedl in the act antl yet here is provision for notice of such filing as aforesaidmr baylis said that was so certainly but lie argued that the  deed meant a valid deed not one which was in vald it was to be such a deed as before described that is iu accordance with the providion of the act it is slo doubt a serious case for the sheriff that i admuit but it is equaly serious for the creditor it is serious oa both sidesthe lord chief justxc no doubt we must strike the balance between two great mischiefs on the one hand it is hard upon the creditor if he is to loe his lebt by that which is no defence on the other hand it is hard upoa the sheriff that without the means of ascertaining whether the deed is valid or not he is to be liable to proceedings either at the suit of the creditor or the debtormr baylis observed that the sheriff was in no wyorse position after all than in the case of a mnistake in taking the wrong person under a writ of ca sa the interpleader act gave him protection only in cases of taking the wrong persons goods there was no relief or protection if he took the wrong personthe lord crtef jusrtcxbut then he is only liable to one person the wrong person here he is in a position of double peril if he discharges the debtor he is liable to the creditor if he detains himu he is liable to the debtor aud he cannot therefore help himnselfr baylis said the statutes of interpleader passeil for the protection of sheriffs showed in whata position of hard ship they were at commuon law and as there was no pro vision for his protection in the bankruptcy act they were left liable as thiey would be at common law and without positive and express provision to that effect the creditor was not to be deprived of his debt and his executioa against his tebtor without any remedyir mellish qc with hiim mr r g williams argued on behalf of the sheriff thathe was not liable the question he said was whethter the act made it the dutv of the registrar to examine into the validity of the decd if so the sheriff coull scarcely be liable to action for obeying his certificate nor was it at au correct to say that the cre ditor was without remedy for under sections  a dis sentient creditor could apply to the court of chauceryandr set aside the deed if invalid and so aet leave to issue exe cution there was therefore no difficulty at all in the position of the creditor whereas in the position of the sheriffthere was the greatest difficulty and hardshitin the learned counsel citedl at some length the judgment of the lord chancellor in a recent case expoundingi the act antil in which he said that  priad facie a creditor is bound by the registration of the deed and that the act afforded tlia utmost facilities to creditors for applying to the court of chancery to determnine whether a deed was valid ex parte brooks s lc j touinel and baakraptcy cases and exz pertcs mtorisan ibid in the latter case the court gave leave to the ceditar to issue execution not withstanding a deed valid on the face of it but it wvas a the lord coer justiceboth those eases were cases of dleeds valid on the face of themmir mellisitbat is so no doubt but the principle appears to be that the creditor can apply to chiancery xj determuine the question of the validitv of the deedthe lord hiref j ustice observed that it did not follow inat because a credlitor could po to chancery that therefore he was bouud to go it might have been a beneficial thinto give the courr of chancery or banikrulptey entire juris diction over all these matteis but it had notbeen douemr justice cromefrox observed that it was a great pity that such jurisdiction had not been given to the court of bankruptcy to leterinine all these questionsjast as the court of probate decided all questions incident to or arising out of nmatters and proceedings in that court but that had not been done and as the lawv ow stood and on the act as it was framed the court of bankruptcy could not by its suiniilary orders bind the rights and remtedies of creditors or the liabilities of debtorsmr meltlsh saidl it was the dutv of the registrar not to issue his certificate uuless he saw that the dleel was valid it did not follow that he had not sach a judicial duty merely because the proceedin before him was to be cx partc he ought to look at the deed and see if it was such as the act requirelthelobd cmiefjustice observed that its validity wotdd depend on many mnatters of fact and law nvhich he couldi hardly determine he could only see what it purported to be so as to enable him to enter the particulars of it in a boolcmr mellish urgedthat his duty went further in this case for instance he should have seen that the deed pur ported not to be for the benefit of all creditors and there fore he ought not to have registered it but when once re gistered it was a protection aud if not so should be seb ideethe lord cieftjusticelhovmr mellisilin the conrtof badkruptcaor chancern as in the cases citedthe lord cahe justice said that was not the effect of the judgments of the lord chancellor in the cases cited andlin which he perfectly concurred the judgments fell far short of that there is no jurisdictiou ia bankruptcy to set the deed asidemr mellish contended that whenever a deed was to be registered in a court that court had jurisdiction to determine whether a particular deed is proper to be registered and ought to be so and therefore has jurisdiction to order it to be taken off the registry it is so in the commnon pleas ia caues of acknowledgments of married women which ara registered therethe lord chief j ustic said the debtor had got hisprotection and was not to be summarily deprived of it by a decision of the court of bankruptcy on the other hand the execution creditor has a right to his execution if the deed is not vaulid the debtor sets it ip and the questioca is raised if it is validmr justice cnodtox referred to a recent ca ia thtcommon pleas where lord chief justice erle said that the certificate of an invalid deed was as bad as the deed itself that seemed the very pointthe lord chief justic observed that in the court of bankruptcy there was jurisdiction to determine mattes i r cidental to the proceedings
