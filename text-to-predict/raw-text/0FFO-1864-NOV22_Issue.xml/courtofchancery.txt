of the above legacy on the death of the survivor of his parents dithiculties arose in the admninis tration of the estate of sir thomas alostyn in consequence of the personal estate sutpplemented by the term of  years being insuflicient for the payment of the testators debts and there being therefore no fund for the payment of legacies and in consequence of this deficiencyall the abovenamed legatees except eliza mostyn disclaimed or released their legacies in order further to facilitate the administration of the estate a private act of parliament called the mostyn eistate act was passed in july  whereby the corsygedol and pla heu estates together with certain other estates were vested in trustees in fee simple upon trust to sell such parts as might be necessary and to pay the

purpose of obtaining a return of the legacy duty which had been paid and to in duco the parties more readily to consent the present lord mlostyn offered in consideration of the fanily connexion between himself and eliza brooke to give his bond or cove uantfor the payment of the full amount of the legay in u it being his desire and intention that it should be paid in full although he s tenant for life of the estates was in no way liable to pay it in con sequence of the above negotiations a biul was filed on behalf of the plaintiff who was then an infant and it was referred to the masterto report vwhether the proposed arrangement would be beneficial to the infant the master having reported in favourof theprooposed arrangement it was carried out as proposed the legactes being formally re leased by charles clemeax brooke and eliza brooke andby the trustees of their marriage settlement by the direc tion of the court and the resent lord mostyn covenanting to pay the sum of  in  with interest as  per cent till payment elizn brooke died shortly after the above transaction and interest on the above sum of  was duly paid to charles clements brooke bs the present lord bostyn until the year  when lord mlostynecame embarrassed and was unable to nmke any further aymenjts in  the sum of  became payable by iord mostyn under his abovementioned covenant and an action was brought against lord motyn by the trustees of the brooke settlement and jadgment was obtained for the fulamount the trustees were however unable to re cover anything under the judgment as the life estate of lord mostyn in the estates ht been some time previously taken possession of by mortgagees and sold for valuable consideration to thomas mostyn the eldest son of lord mostyn various atteatpts were made from time to time by charles clements brooke to obtain payment from lord mostyn or from thomas mostyn of the amount secured by the covenant and offers were made by thomas mostyn to compromise the matter by payment of a composition of onethird of the debt but this offer was not accepted and in february  the present suit waa commenced in the name of the plaintiff charles hyde blooke then an infant but who had since attained his ma jority against lord mostvn and thomas mlstyn for the purpose of having the compromise declared void and the legacy declared a good charge tupon the estates the suit was resisted by thomas mostyn who was then virtually the owner of the estates on theground that the compromisewas made bondxjde and that even had the compromise not been made the plaintiff would still have been entitled to nothing owing to the insufficiency of the fund provided by sir thomas amostyn for the payment of his debts and legacies pending the suit thomas mostyn died having devised his estates to his wife tady augusta mostynreginald oust and ralph neville upon trust for sale and the suit was accord ingly revived against the trustees of thomas blostyn who became the priucipal defendants to the suit the master of the rolls iu giving judgment on the th of march held that no case of fraud or misrepresentation had been made out by the plaintiff and that inthe abseneo of fraud or misrepresentation the compromise of  was binding upon him and that therefore the bill must be disnmissed but havion regard to the circumstances without costsfrom this decree the plaintiff appealedlord justice turner in an elaborate judgment entered into a full statement of the facts of the case and into a copious reiteration of the deeds documents and evidence occupying from  minutes beforeo untilfive minutes be fore  oclock and concluded nearly as followsthe questions raised by this appeal are of no ordinary impor tance the object of the suit was to undo a compromiso arranged uuder the order of the court such compromises the court in the exercise of its discretion had frequently made and the practice resulted from the control that the court exercised over trustees and the property entrusted to their cbargo and to say that ilt was not in the power of the court to make such would cut at the root of its jurisdiction no doubt could be cast on the power of the court to make such nor could acts done by the trustees under the bondfide exercise of their powers under the authority of such be lightly disturbed it was not the habit of the court to disturb what had been done by itself except under very strong circumstances anl in his lordships mind the ground on which the court would alone proceed to set asidle such an arrangement must be fraud or acts amounting to fraud on the part of the person claiming the benefit of the compromise by fraud his lordship said he did not speak of moral fraud but that species of conduct which in the eye of the court would be called fraud if there was no fraud the compromise must stand but if there was a know ledge by the arties on the one side of facts which were kept back from the parties on the other side facts important to guide them in the conclusion they ought to come tothis in the eye of the court would amount to fraud and on the proof of the same being given the court would set aside the compromise the plaitiff in the suit is not to be entitled to relief from this court unlesshe snake out a case of fraud the bill impeached the compromise on the ground that representations which were untrue unfair and dishonest were made to parties who repre scted tthe plaintiff he lord justice turner wassatisfied thai these unfair iepreentations didnolt ex tend to the releases of these claims which were givenby the other legatees and the question at issue was reduced to thiswhether the representations made respectin the value of the personalty and the estates which were asgned to trustees for  years term were untrue unfair snd dis honest  and this question turned upon the facts and re presentations maae to the parties representing the plaintiff he lord justice turner bavingpointed out that theparties representing the plaintiff were never supplied with the state mentof thegroundsonw hich thevaluators had estimated this estate  andc there was therein a suppression of material facts which were witlhin the knowledge of lord mostyn and his advisers but which were not within the knowledge of the plaintiff the parties who had this knowledge within their power withheld it and if it had been given it might ma terially have altered the conclusion such information having been withheld amounted in the eyes of the court to fraud owingto the nonproauctionof the document the compromnise could not stadand the decree of the coartbelow could not be supportedlord justice kngnt brijce concurred
