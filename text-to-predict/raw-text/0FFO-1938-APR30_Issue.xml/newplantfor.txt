new plant forsteel tubesengineering projectat chesterfieldtype new to britainfrom our special correspondentchesterfield april a notable advance in the british steel manufacturing industry is marked by the approaching completion of new plant here the largest and most powerful of its kind in the world which will bc used for thc production of weldless hollows of a size and weight never before made by this processthe firm concerned is the chesterficld tube company limited a constituent of the group under the control of tube lnvestments limited of birmingham of which mr arthur chamberlain is the head  the general description of the firms products covers a very wide range of articles of fundamental importance in many of the leading engineering manufacturing shipbuilding and chemi cal industries in this country there is howevcr no direct relation between the new plant at chesterfield and the rearma ment programme for this project comes in the ordinary course of the firms develop ment and was decided on long before the rearmament programme was announcedton maximunithe new plant has been designed to produce as standard weldlcss steel hollows tp to in outside diameter with a maximum lenigth of sft also specials  up to in outside diameter by ft maximum lcngth the maximum bilict or ingot weight that can be operated will be  tons and the weight of the heaviest finished hiollow approxi mately  tons weldless steel hollows un precedented by their size and weight made by this method of british maniufacture can be applied readily for a considerabie number of purposes in enumerating a few of the appli cations for which there is a universal demand the following many be mentioned steami pipes lor higlipressure steam installations water and steam drnms for marine type bioilers high pressure bottles for the storage of liqueliable and permnanent gases cylinders for carbonic acid gas convertors diesel engiine air startingbottles highpressure bottles for airloaded i accumutlators sttbmarine air vessels super hieater headers mud drums torpedo body forgings and shell forgings it will be possible to prodttce any or all of these in calibres far exceeding those hitlherto procurable in this country the company anticipate no ditei culty in expanding from locally available supplies of skilled labour their present staff of  workpeople as the new plant comes into ftill operationthe new shop has a main bay and a smaller bay the forme ft iong ft wide and ft high to the eaves the small bay ft iong ft wide and ft in high the two covering floor spaces of  and  square feet respectively owing to the great size and weight of the principal elements of the plant to be installed extensive excavations and deep foundations in reinforced concrete have been necessary the difficulty and expense of this portion of the work were greatly increased when a seam of coalof poor quality it is truewas encountered at the spot choszn for the soaking pit the largest fturnace in thle works of cottrse such combustible material could not be left in such a position iti had to be got out and was displaced by concretefrom steel billetsthe manufacturc of weldless steel tubing requlires binets or ingots of steelthe raw niaterial of the chesterticld tube company rcadily obtainable of coursc in such closc proximity to slield the successive steps of the process are briefly as followsfirst a block of suitable weight and shape is cold sawn oif the solid billet this is heated in a furnace to forging heat and then guided under the piercer of a vertical piercing press hydraulically operated which reduces zfle cubical lump to the shape of a cup the cup shaped piece is thcn elongated and its hollow narrowed on the hydraulically operated draw bench thtis the main instruments of thic process are the press and the drawbench and a series of furnaces with the necessary sources of power for thieir operationin the newv main bav at chesterfield the plant installed or now beilng completed includes a bogic tunnel ftirnace for the prinary heating of the raw material a soaking pit for which an excavation ft cleep was made and which wvill have its heairthi ft helowv grolind level  and a tube rleheatinig furnace all threce furnaces are fircl by cokeoven gas brouglht in a lin main fronm collieries withlin five or six miles of the works two of the furnaces will each have a gas consumption of  cubic fcet an hour and the reheating furnace a consumption of  cubic feet an hourthe hydraulically operated vertical billet piercing press and the horizontal tube draw benich are operated by a hydraulic power unit situated al thc cnti of the small bay consisting of threce pumps eachl riven by  hp  volt threephase synchronous motors using current supplied from the chesterfield corporation electricity mains the accumu lator in this unit is of the airhydraulic type consisting of air bottles and watcrbottle of large dimensionscrane equipmentthc small bay will be used for maiitcnance operations and will contain electricity trans forniers to give the working voltages required by various equipment machine tools lathes turning and boring mill draw bars bushes drawing dies guide rings bush bottoms forged steel punchcs punch ends c the clranle installation comprises four powerful cianes onc with  tons main and  tons aiixiliary hoist a smaller ton crane of the guided type for guliding the heated billets direct from the soaking pit to lhe piercinig press and there is also a ton general purposes crane in the small bay and a ton die crane in the daytime the shop is excel lently lighited by more thani  square feet of glazed surface in the roofs the artificial jighting wvill be from the roof and side columns carrying a total of  onethousand watt lamps
