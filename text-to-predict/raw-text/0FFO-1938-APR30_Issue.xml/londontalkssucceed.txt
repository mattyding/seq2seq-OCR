halifax in fact saw the italian ambassador and the german counsellor within a few minutes of the end of the anglofrench talkssecondly a new and determined effort is to be made by great britain and france to find a peaceful and orderly settlement in central europe particularly in czecho slovakia it was recognized that the whole problem of the german minority in czechoslovakia was far from concern ing dr benesh the czechoslovak presi dent alone it directly concerned herr henlein the leader of the national socialist party in the sudeten areas it also concerned the headquarters of the whole nationalsocialist movement furthermore france is bound by an explicit treaty to help czechoslovakia if attacked and great britainas mr chamberlain and lord halifax made clear again vesterdayis directly and imme diately interested in the preservation of peace in central europeit was therefore agreed in a problem in which such large issues were at stake that fresh diplomatic approaches should be made not only in prague but in the capitals of czechoslovakias neighbouring states notably germany and poland with a view to helping all parties con cerned to reach an orderly and peaceful solution of the pressing problemczechoslovakiacentral europe occupied most of the mornings discussions aftcr having spent the night at windsor castlc the french ministers arrived at downing steet at  and the morning confer ence opened with a long statement by m daladier on the french commitments to czechoslovakia he spoke with the utmost frankness not only on the threats wlhich in the french view face the czecho slovak state but also on the difficulties which would face any allies of czecho slovakia that sought to come to her aid butspeaking as the prime minister of france and as the minister of national defence and expressing the view of the french general staffhe gave again a definite assurance that france would come immediately to the aid of czechoslovakia if she were attackedm bonnet then dwelt at some length on the economic difficulties of the central european states and he urged great britain and france to help them to stand on their own feet he continued in fact the arguments of the long french memo randin on the  economic strangulation of the central european countricsnot a family matter for great britain it was said that the government were certainly not oblivious to the economic difficulties but it was suggested that emphasis for the time being should be plaecd on a determined effort to help in solving the minority question notice was taken of the tendency in some german quarters to suggest that the whole sudeten german problem was a family matter or a purely regional problem wbhizh concerned the german nation alonc fieldmarshal gorings solemn assurances to respect czechoslovakia made at thetime of the march into austria were felt by the mtinisters to be an almost sufficient refutation of the plea that the problem was only the concern of one large family they also expressed their realization afresh that if the czech problem were rudely or harshly handled there would arise a threat to the peace of europe in which naturally great britain and france would be immediately and vitally interestedfor all these reasons the ministers deter mined on the fresh effort at a peaceful settlement the details are to be the subject of further study but it is hoped that all parties concerned will be per suaded to exercise their utmost good will in helping to reach a lasting solutionbefore the talks ended shortly after  oclock in the afternoon the whole two days work was passed under review and seen atresh in the light of the constructive effort at appeasement decided on yester davfirst there had been the congratulations of the french on the results of the anglo italian negotiations followed bv a full british explanation of all the details and implieationis of the agreement then the french had reported on their own negotia tions with italy both sides readily agreed again yesterday that the two dieentzes were a solid contribution towards diminishing international tension and as the british ministers declared to the french a practical frenchlialian agreement would he the means of immediate progress in the problem about which the frenich ministers expressed so much anxiety during the talks thc problem of spain and the with drawal of foreign volunteersthe french ministers certainiv did not hide their anxiety at the continuance of the civil war and at the extent of foreign intervention they laid some emphiasis on the value of a simultaneous withdrawal of  volunteers  from both sides by categories that is an officer for an officer an airman for an airman rather than simply by numbers a man for a man but after some discussion they admitted the difficulties and the risks of deception inseparable from a scheme for a with drawal by categories a private soldier for example could easily be dressed up to pass as an officer and it was agreed to press forward in the nonintervention committee with the british formula for simultaneous withdrawalsettlement in spainthe british ministers explained again that the angloitalian agreement wouid not come into force until a settlement was reached in spainand by settlement they explained they meant not merelv promises but performance in the withdrawal of volunteers in other words a substantial number from each side must have been withdrawn under the application of the british formulaat the same time the british ministers made it clear that the government would recognize abyssinia as soon as a spanish settlement had been reached and the angloitalian agreement was ready to be put into operation a general agreement was reached on the procedure to be adopted at geneva when the counil discusses tile beritish recommendation that league members should be free to recog nize or not recognize the italian con quest of abvssinia but the details ot procedure are to be worked out at geneva itselfabyssinia and leagueon the british side the governments attitude to the recognition of italian abyssinia was made clear again yesterday it is not in their mindsnor in the french ministers mindsto ask the lcaguc to go back on the question of principle already recorded nevertheless in the difficulties of the world the government feel a need to be realist and to face facts and the elementary fact is thatjust as only force or the threat of force would have prevented the invasionso now nothing but force could undo what has been done the government feel and here they were fully supported by the french that the time has come when the league members should be freed to take what action they think properyesterday afternoon there were soeic short discussions on other problems the japanese occupation of some frencn islands in the pacific was reported the swiss desire to be declared a neutral state while still within the league was debated and a resolution for submission to the league council was agreed on but the genera feeling was that central europe was the pressing problem of he hour and it was tackled in the spirit of what mav be called the three watchwords of the talksdefence appeasement realism in diplomatic circles last night it was declared that the success of ihe talks was due directly to the equal emphasis which the four ministers placed on these three bases of policy
