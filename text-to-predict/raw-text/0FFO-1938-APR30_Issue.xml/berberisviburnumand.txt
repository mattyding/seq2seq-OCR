berberis viburnum and cotoneastera select listfrom a correspondentnovices are soon lost in the maze of names in tree and shrub catalogues pages and pages of speeies and varieties seem equally desirable so major lionel de rothschilds paper on the berberis yiburnumn and cotoncaster families which was read at this weeks conference at westminster on trees and shrubs will be of practical useeach of the three families includes many plants that are of little value where room is precious each includes species that are very much alike to the untrained eye and except viburnunz each is in a confused state botanically this is because techni cal elucidation has lagged behind the torrent of new species which has followed the efforts of plant hunters in asia and south america it is perhaps too much to expect that nurserymen should label a plant as second rate but anything that helps amateurs to pick out the best of each genus at once is to be encouraged cost is of relative moment and hardiness is all important in places away from the south and wvest coasts it decides the garden value of a plant the fact that here and there shrubs and trees not generally tough flourish in what seems inhospitable conditions is nothing to go bybroadly the barberries and cotoneasters are of slight floral value their foliage and berries are their chief attractions in none is all the virtues combined and major de rothschild stresses the strong points of each no novice can go wrong with the old berberis dalrwiniii lovely in leaf flower and berrv though it may temporarily suffer in a hard winter or with b stenophlvila though it needs room a hedgeof it is impenetrable and a fine sight thunbergs barberry ber beris thrunbergii is neat and in a good autumn of incomparable colour the ever green b aquiifoliumi var inagnrifica is one of the best of lowgrowing evergrecn shrubs especially under trees the others in major de rothschilds select list all have their pointsthe list of cotoneaster species and varieties is equally comprehensive and holds nothing that is likely to displace the chinese c horizonitalis from favour in small gardens where room admits c salicifolia var floccosa is invalu able and wards c conispicuia pro mises well every type of gardener will find one or more plants that are worth having in the list and all of them in both families have the merit that they are at home on chalky soilsthe vibiurnumlzl genus is different from the other two and though it is less popular it includes plants that appeal more to the critical faculty it includes also the lautrustin uis one of the most useful of evergreen winterflowering shrubs which would be priceless were it a recent discovery in tibet fragrance is a strong feature in the family and in none is it more marked than in vibuirinuml f ragrans or the korean species v bitchliuentse the last two are shrubs that any gardener can grow carless viburnum is less generally manageable than its hybrid v burkwvoodii and the japanese v tomentosa var mariesli is rightly high in the ranks of fine hardy shrubs in flower and fruit the guelder rose v opuilus is the most familiar of the race and the several that are more re markable for their autumn fruits than for their flowers or leaves will appeal more to experts than novicesin all three families the merits and weaknesses of newcomers have been set out where there has been time to discover them
