need for state surveyof commonssafeguarding publicrightsa plea for a national survey of commons is made by the commons open spaces and footpaths preservation society in a statement issued yesterday on land subject to rights of commonthe society states that the enforcement of section  of the law of property act  and other statutes which prohibit or restrict the enclosure or appropriation of common land is often hindered by the difficulity of proving that a particular tract of land is sub ject to rights of common or in the case of section  of the act of  was so subject on january   rights of common though expressly preserved by the law of property act  which effected the extin guishment of so many manorial incidents are not exercised in these days to the extent to which they once were and in some cases particularly where the common is suburban or is crossed by motor roads the rights have altogether fallen in desuettiderights of common are not lost by mere non exercise except in certain circumstances and after a considerable period of time but non exercise makes the proof that they exist more difficult and it will obviously become harder as time passes to prove that a particular piece of land was subject to rights of common commons are of such importance to the nation as open spaces that it is much to be regretted that no national survey of them has ever been made since the time nearly  vears ago wien the tithes were commuted under the tithe act  and for that purpose nearly every parish in england and wvales was surveyed and the then extent of the common land was ascertained and recorded on the tithe maps that survey because of subse quent events is not sufficiently accurate for present purposes though it often provides valuable evidence and it is desirable that it should be brought up to datcin present circumstances where land which is reputed to be a common is threatened with enclosure or development the society has to investigate the evidence and advise in the particular case and this its special know lzdge and experience enable it to do but if all common lands were officially surveyed their general position would be far more secure at a time when the importance of outdoor recreation as an aid to physical fitness has received statutory recognition and is admitted on all hands is it not reasonable to suggest that the state should undertake such a survey
