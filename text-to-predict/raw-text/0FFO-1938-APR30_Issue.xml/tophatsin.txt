another as they did in the pages of ouida romance has not altogether gone from diplomacv the recent visit of hm ambassador to china sir archibald clark kerr to chungking where he pre sented his letters of credence to the vener able president of the chinese republic was an interlude in the formal processes of diplomatic representation sufficiently unusual to merit description the more so since it offered a glimpse of the citv which is now the de jire capital of chinathe diplomatic imlission left hankow on april  the aerodrome at wvuchang on the south bank of the yangtze looked very peaceful in the sunlight a gang of coolies at a distance of some  yards from the passengers waitingroom were filling in a large hole from which thev had thriftily exhumed an unexploded japanese bomb our big seater took off smoothly and roared westward above the yellow yangtze soon the river in its waterish green plain was blotted out by clouds it is an old saying of the province of szechwan that when the sun shines there the dogs bark in consternationwve slid down through the cotton wool towards a dark irregular carpet of small mountains between which terraced oblongs of paddy showed tigerstriped in a bend of the twisting yangtze was chung king set on a peninsula formed by the confluence of the yangtze and one of its tributaries the kiating the american pilot an overworked man for one of his three colleagues was sick and another had died of typhus four days ago circled cautiously pagodas and temples revealed themselves on the little peaks around the city we landed on a runway built alona a mudbank in the riversedan chairschungking rose steepiv above us a sub fusc maze of buildings clinging to a bluff its normally cheerless aspect was cnhanced by the black paint which clothed for fear of air raids such of its houscs as wcre not dark grey already the acroplane came to a stop the band attacked with zest the intricacies of the chinese national anthem and the ambas sador and lady kerr posed for the chinese cameramen a moment later the whole party found itself transferred to sedan chairs substantial structures of wicker work and bamboo with four coolies to each the twin engines of the douglas  hp each had done their job the twentieth century receded as the coolies hoisted us with the formal grunted adjurations which chairbearers have used for hundreds of vears in szechwan the procession wound its way at the pace of the middle ages up a zigzag flight of steps in the steep cliff face between ranks of military police each man with a luger automatic drawnin his right hand we were carried slowly up into the capital of chinachungking was given that status in the days when nanking was clearly doomed and chinas hopes were low official circles then believedand admittedthat the fall of hankow was only a matter of time the general feeling was not very far removed from panic and the capital clisappeared as far up river as it reasonably could from one point of view chung king was a good choice if its promo tion cannot be said to havc materially strengthened the central governments hand throughout a chronically recalcitrant province it has at least created an island of central government influence in szechwan and the island is not likely to contract in size or in significancefrom most other points of view chung king is ill qualified for its new eminence communications are poor the gorges are navigable only to small steamers and junks road connexions with other parts of the interior are inadequate as yet and overland traffic is hamstrung by provin cial transport monopolies which are a cloak for corruption and inefliciencywithin the citv itself the lie of the land is indicated by the story of an american consul there who re ceived a letter from a firm of motor manu facturers asking what were the prospects of marketing their vehicles in chungking the consul replied at length giving esti mates of the number of inhabitants who werc rich enough to buv cars the various uses to which cars could be put the con ditions governing their shipment and many other details bearing on the market in conclusion he pointed out that the cars would have to have square wheelsa medieval capitalchungking has a few miles of motor able streets which were driven through the labyrinth of houses five or six years ago cars use them with a peculiar reck lessness and rickshaws descend them with the uncontrollable momentum of a bobsleigh they are flanked by shallow fourstorey buildings in a utilitarian modern style as unbeautiful and insecure as the worst soviet architecture but for the man in the street in chungking the street is still a flight of stone steps nmade slippery by the wobbling of the watercarriers wooden buckets and the ordinarv means of locomotion is a chair in the new thoroughfares a good manv of the shops have plateglass windows but cisewhere there are few civic concessions to modernity true the policemen swaying like matadors to avoid the charging cars wear tin helmets but they rcally are of tin and they are cut in a demurely elizabethan style the popu lation of the city is about the ambassador presented his letters of credence together with the letters of rezall of his predecessor sir hughe knatchbullhugessen the president mr lin scn received them in his palace which was until vcry recently a school the president who rarely appears in public is a benevolent and dignified old gentle man and the simple ceremony was im pressive two days later the ambassa dorial party left chungking on board the ss wanliu a tubby but commodious british steamer of the type used on the upper river that night we anchored at wanhsien after a pleasant run between steep green hills with capricious contours on which the wood oil trces were inblossom wood oil which goes mostly to america for varnishes and the likc is the principal export of szechwannext day we entered the gorges in driving rain and saw what many have seen and written ofbefore the trackers straining statuesquely at their long bamboo rope the junk nosing its slow but reasonably sure way upstream  behind them the temples whence gods invigilate from a height over the worst perils the tremendous wvhiripools made by the lash ing of tails of dragons the occasional wreck and the occasional bloated corpse the huge and awful walls of the corridor down which the river tortuously plunges for us in addition the gorges held a keen subsidiary interest for the past month british steamers on the upper river had drawn fire on almost every run from sol diers in charge of junks carrying supplies for the military they let fly not in any spirit of ill will but as an ignorant pro test against the steamers washhalfwav through the gorges the wan lius sister ship going upstream passed us displaying a blackboard  fired on at points  and  but we were lucky we came unscathed out of the last gorge into the broad river at ichang and thence took seaplane to hankow we arrived in time to watch in the early hours of the next morning the clawing searchlights pin the silver bombers among the stars and to hear the dull wooden shocks which meant the extinction of a few more peasants lives it was easter dav but there was also a full moon
