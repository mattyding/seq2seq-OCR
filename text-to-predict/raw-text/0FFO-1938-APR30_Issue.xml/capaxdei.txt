capax deiman and his creatorfrom a correspondentthe word creator occurs only five times in the bible but the whole outlook of the biblical writers rests on the assumption of the creative activity of a living god the world is gods handiwork and as such reflects his mind and reveals his pur poses in studying it men find themselves thinking gods thoughts after him and through the things he has made discern his everlasting power and divinitythe writer of the first epistle of peter bids his fellowchristians under trial commit themselves unto a faithful creator to a god who will be ever mindful of his covenant the creator of the ends of the carth may be trusted not to suffer his aims to be finally defcated he is faithful and will not allow his creatures to be tempted beyond endurance he re deems as well as creates he made men for himself and they are restless till they rest in himthat god is a faithful creator may be seen in the natural world the uniformity of nature and the reign of law so far from thrusting god out of the picture as they were once thought to do only go to show that there is nothing arbitrary or haphazard in gods creative activity there is some analogy betwecn the work of the divine creator and that of any creative artist among men the human artists work may often fall far short of his design yet even then the onlooker may discern something of the mind that conceived it and of the purpose it was intended to serve how much more is this true of god who made everything beautiful in its time and at the wonder of whose creation  the morning stars sang together and all the sons of god shouted for joy there is room enough here for wonder and the sense of mystery the modern physicist draws his map of the universe to a much bigger scale than that of the hlebrew prophet but nothing he reveals either of the infinitely vast or the infinitelv little need disturb the con viction that  the heavens declare the glory of god and the firmament showevth his handiworkgod also made man and made him in his own image and in this respect agamn he is a faithful creator it is man who is faithless who fails to keep his part of the covenant and misses the mark of his high calling it is no wonder that the tragedy of mans fall and the spectacle of his persistence in sin and error should constrain many to believe that there is nothing divine about this human nature of ours but that it is altogether alien from god and from goodness this is not the whole truth both human experience and biblical revelation tell another story man may be fallen as indeed he is but that does not mean that he is hopelessly depraved or finally lost in the christian gospel the word lost means capable of being saved though man cannot save himself by any effort of his own there is that in him which enables him to respond to the saving grace of god and meet him as it were half wayhence the incarnation that the word became flesh and tabernacle among us is evidence not only of the greatness of the divine humility but of the high potentiality of human nature in the perfect humanity of our lord we see something of gods intention regarding mankind in general the incarnation is but another pledge of his fidelity to his great plan of salvation he made men for himself and in christ he draws them to him with the cords of love his creative activity thus culminates in his becoming  the great companionthe fellow sufferer who understandsfinally the belief that god is a faithfui creator serves to justify and reinforce mans hope of immortality no human artist or artificer does his work simply that it may come to nothing it must carry out a purpose fulfil a plan realize an ideal otherwise the labour spent upon it is in vain if this is true of man and his feeble efforts how much more of god it is no part of his intention that his creatures should simply be  cast as rubbish to the void it is not for nothing that he made man in his own image and put eternity into his heart man knows he was not made to die and the ground of his assurance is the charac ter of god as faithful creator for the christian ill arguments for immortality depend in the long run on the nature of god and his relations with men as these are revealed in jesus christ human personality has an intrinsic worth in gods sight and it is not to be thought of that the love which created these values will ever suffer them to perish itis true that man can and does spoil gods handiwork and frustrate his aims but the fact that god redeems as well as creates and has provided a remedy for siii is a further indication that he works not for time bu for eternity
