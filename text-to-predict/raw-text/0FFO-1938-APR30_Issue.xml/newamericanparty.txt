new americanpartychallenge to theoldfrom our own correspondentwashington april president roosevelt when ask ed this morning to comment upon the announce ment at madison wisconsin last night of the formation of a national progressive party of america was content to refer the questioner to his remark made earlier this week that there cannot be too much organization in this country for liberal actionthe new party however has been born if birth means the choice of a name and an emblem this latter being a blue cross indicating multiplication sur rounded by red circles as the symbol of unity the whole against a white background governor la follette of wisconsin who had called the meeting and made the announce ment told his enthusiastic hearers that neither the democratic new deal nor the republican party offered anything to day president hoover had tried and failed president roosevelt had tried and the country had returned to depression the vicious circle had swung full again and a black plague was upon the people a strong government neither socialist fascist ror communist striking at the roots of the national problems and sup ported by an aroused populace was mr la follettes solutionthere is to be a party convention later and it is to be assumed that then there will be forthcoming that translation of aspira tion into a practical programme which was not offered last night no help can come from outside who shall save us  asked mr la follette  france torn and distraught with strife and indecision  britain coldly concentrated on saving her empire  no   in america alone is the vigour vitality vision stamina and courage to fight it out no matter how long it takesa doctrine for farmersthrough the speech as a whole blew the winds of the progressive doctrine of  and  as though the intervening years had brought no changes there was little or no indication that anv social theorv not implicit in the behaviour of the anierican farmer could be acceptablesomething of the possible effect of this new movement if it should develop into more than  pressure politics was indi cated today by senator george norris of nebraska himself a progressive to the ith power but dubious of the wisdom of a third party president roosevelt s election clearly showed he said that the majority of the american people approved his programme a combination of torv democrats and republicans had brought that programme to frustration and if this combination endured the american people might force mr roosevelt to stand again if this should happen the intervention of a third party might give the victory to a  reactionarydivided ranksa good deal of water must flow under the bridge before the divisions in the labour and liberal ranks and other pre sent obstacles to agreement can be washed away and the real third party float clear but there is a chance that a boom for mr la follettes nomination on the democratic ticket in  can be started there is a chance that the national progressives  can cohere sufficiently to prod mr roosevelt and his supporters into new energy and simultaneously frighten the tory democrats out of their present recalcitrance but these are no more than chances and conditions are such as to confuse political movement more eachdaymr roosevelt for all that his enemies say he has lost his old vigour addressed congress today on the subject of mono poly he has asked the social security board to prepare for submission to the next congress suggestions as to the  liberalizing  of the social security act and there is talk of the revival of the measure for the reorganization of the executive arm of the government his  pump priming  programme seems likely to go through for alt that the opposition can do and the need of some such measure seems apparent from the state ment this morning by mr harrv hopkins head of the works progress administra tion that the national income has sunk in the last six months from s to s and that  men have been thrown out of work in the same periodantitrust messageto congressmr roosevelt andprivate powerwashington april president roosevelt today recommended to con gress a  Â£ooooo appropriation for a comprehensive study of the con centration of economic power in american industry and the effect of that concentra tion upon the decline of competition the presidents longpromised message on antitrust law revision also proposed for immediate enactment legislation i to control effectively the operation ofbank holding companies to prevent holding companies from acquirina control of any more banks directly or indirectly to prevent banks controlled by holdingcompanies from establishing any more branches to make it illegal for a holding company or anv corporation or enterprise in which it is financially interested to borrow from or sell securities to the bank in which it holds stockthe president recommends these measures to provide for  the gradual separation of the banks from holding company control or ownershiphe further declares in his message that this programme is not the beginning of  any ill considered trustbusting activity but is de signed to  preserve private enterprise for profit by keeping it free enough to be able to utilize all our resources of capital and labour at a profitdeclaring that the concentration of power in private hands today is  without equal in history mr roosevelt says that the one lesson in events abroad that has  hit home  is that  the liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerate the growth of private power to a point where it becomes stronger than their democratic state itself  that in esscnce is fascism he addedreuter
