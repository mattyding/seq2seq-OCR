the nd divisionexercisesveiicles easily spottedfrom aircraftfronm our special correspondentsandhurst april the threcday exercisc by troops of the nd division was continued today and it is now permissible to publish that the main movcment was from the area north of salisbury to two concentration areas east of fleet two routes were used the northern route via amesbury andover whitchurch and the basingstoke bvpass a good though narrow and winding roadand the southern via old sarum stockbridge sutton scotney to win chester and basingstoke and thence by narrow byroads to odihamvehicles moved in groups at wide intervals with varying densities within the groupssome being at five somc at  and some at  vehicles per mile on each route were four regulation posts whose duty was to report the passing of the heads and tails of each group and to hold up vehicles where congestion was reported aheada series of artificial traffic blocks were arranged by the directing staff unknown to the regulating posts one of whose duties was to arrange for deviations from the routes in case of need within three hours of the start of the exercisc a whole series of these devia tions had been arranged at a speed which would hardly have been possible save in a well wooded country or without the aid of the excellent lin ordnance mapavoiding congestionit had been arranged that so far as pos sible deviations should be directed outwards so as to avoid the possibility of groups diverted from one route clashing with vehicles diverted from another this could not always be done and late yesterday the sergeant left in charge at one regulating post on the southern route in the absence of his officer who had gone forward to superintend the clearing of a hold up was surprised by the arrival of a whole group directed from the northern route hlow ever hie proved fully competent to deal with this complicationthe air reconnaissance and bombing carried out by machines of thle raf were effective in spite of all the care taken to conceal the march during last night air reports showed  identifications and seven bombing attacks and in spite of dimmed headlights the pilots stated that the vehicles were easily to be seen even witholit flares being dropped certainly by day however aircraft were flying far lower than they would normally be able to in warthe th battalion royal tank corps which was switched off lhalfway along the southern route to wooded lyingup areas near michel dever remained hidden there all day without being spotted from the air and the nd medium brigade ra also carried out a long deviation unseen bv enemy airmena highly successful holdup occurred in the narrow streets of andover where a long column of th infantry brigade lorries met an obstruction eaused by bombed buildings and had to turn and reverse out of it under con siderable difficulties the congestion would have been worse had not a civilian petrol lorry  interposed  into the column some miles west of andover and caused it to open out considerably thus affording its head more room to manoeuvrechanges in indianarmyreorganization ofcommandswidespread changes in the organization of certain military commands and districts in india have been approved according to the press association and it is stated that the changes will take place during october and november of this ear the object of such changes would be to increase the efficiency of the armv for war and save in expenditure in peace timeit is believed that the western command will be abolished and will be replaced by a western district with headquarters at quetta this new district would comprise the same area as that for which the western command is now responsible and would include the sind independent brigade area which would lose its present independent statusthiree brigades of covering troops wotild be for med in the new district and allotted a task similar to that of covering troops which already exist in the military districts of the northwest frontier the task of covering troops is to control the frontier tribes to cover the mobilifation and concentration of the field army and to protect the lines of com munication of the field army in the event of active operations beyond the frontierit is expected that the present lucknow nd class district which has its head quarters at lucknow in the winter and ranikhet in the summer will be raised to the status of a st class district and will include the th lucknow th bareilly and th jhansi infantry brigades and the allahabad brigade areathe responsibility for the mobilization of the rd indian division it is understood will be transferred from the meerut district to this district and the headquarters of the new lucknow district will become the headquarters of the rd indian division in warthe meerut ist class district which has its headquarters at dehra dun would then become a nd class district and would in its new form include the rd mcerut cavalry brigade the th dehra dun infantry brigale and the delhi brigade area which wouild lose its independent statusit is thought that such changes in organiza tion would not involve any appreciable
