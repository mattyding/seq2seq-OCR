evil in these days of gigan tic armaments said we must get rid of the idea tbat the army was to be a kind of eleemosynary institution for the benefit of the intellectually destitute of the upper classes captain barcbard returned thanks dr g w medley gave  the two houses of parliamentthe earl of daljiotsi replying for the house of lords remarked that the reception which had just been given to this toast in spite of all and after all that hadeen said during the last six months by liberal orators and writers some of the most eminent of whom were pre sent was highly gratifying to him and complimentary to the house of lordsoir thorold uogouxs responded for the house of com mons leferringto the question of the pacification of lreland be said the task now before the fhouse of commons was one which individual memberamightwvell feel aghastathandling butthere was he hoped a general feeling of trust and cont dence in the most powerful administration that had ever guided the destinies of tha country whikh would keep the liberal party united and make the government successful it was the wish of the liberal party to make ireland as happy and prosperous as she was at present poor and dis contented but those whom they wished to serve endea voured to thwart them in every way making it difficult to be just and almost impossible to be generousmr w t iarpaiotr gave  the liealth of her ma jestys ministersmlr oseoane morgan said there had seldom been a time in which lier majestys ministers stood more in need both of the health which had been wished them and of the support which had been promised them he hoped it was unnecessary for him addressing a body of robust liberalsnot the less robust perhaps because they had not recently been enervated by overmuch prosperity to defend the government against the charge of having hoped against hope and baring put off to the last possible moment the painful duty of proposing exceptional measures in ireland cheers coercion was an odious word hear hear but there was one thing more odious still and that was the condition of anarchy and terrorism vwhich necessi tated its application and no man felt this more keenly than mr forster who in the teeth of a storm of most un just obloquy was fearlessly and manfully struggling to dis charge the most thankless duty ever imposed on a states man loud cheers bat when they found that out of b agrarian outrages committed last vear in ireland only  had been detected and punished wyen it was boasted that the queens writ did not run in minster then he main tained that no administrationbe it tory whig or badicalno not even a  joe cowen  administration laughtercould hase shrunk from the responsibility of asking parllament for powers not to coerce but to protect liberty they must not be too squeamish in these matters hel loved liberty s much as any one but he loved her too wvell to see her tram pled under the feet of ruffians cheers heo believed that the land bill of mr gladstone than whom no english statesman had shown quicker sympathy for the wrongs of ireland would prove to be a full measure of justioea measure down pressed and running overfor the irisb people but to say tha disorder was to go on un checked until that bill could be passed was like saying that yon must not ban a man for murder till you had passed the criminal come the house was rightly jealous of freedom of debate but there was a sense in which freedom of debate meant paralysis of the house of commons they bad sat for nearly three weeks and where were they  da after day night after night  stick nor breath nor motion as idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean iit would be a bad day for england and above all for the liberal party whose proudest triumphs were entwvined with its history if the hiouse of commons were to be reduced to a mere belpless log drifting to and fro in a boundless ocean of barren talk hear hear he referred to the measures which they had passed to the measures which they had promised to the progress made in settling the eastern and afghan questions and above all to the revenue returns as establishing some claim on the part of the government to the confidence of the liberal party a conservative friend of his had complained of the good luck of the liberals who always managed to come into office just when trade vas beonning to revive might theynot rather saythat trade always managedtoreivewhenthe liberals came into offlce hear hear possibly that explained the liberal victories gained lathe great indus trial centres of england but how was it that some of the greatt netropolitan and suburban constitueucies whose nterests were the same should bave gone over to their opponents there was an old classical legend in which tha goddess of the night was represented as standing still in mid career in order to gaze on the exquisdte features of a beautiiu youtb could it be that the constituencies of surrey and kont had been struck by a similar madnems and that tney to had stood still like the moon spellbound ny thefascinations of a modern endymion laughterbut let them not deair he was old enough to remember the days of bing and acock when the place of east surrey was in the vanuard of the countlas of england what had been might ce again and he enttfred to predict that before very long the constituencyreinforced it might be by the frosh blood poured ino it by a new reform billwould resume its ancient place and that his friends who so gel lantlg contested the seat last a prl would rise in that hall to respond to tho t of  the eznbers for
