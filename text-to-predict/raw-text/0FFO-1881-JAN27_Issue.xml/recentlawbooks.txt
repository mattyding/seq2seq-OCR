rbcbnt la tv booksthere are few more interesting branches of our law than that which relates to merchant shipping its many archaisma are removed from technicality are mostly good anglosaxon and the whole verbiage is redolent of the sea and the infancy of the british marine among the numerous legal works on shipping which have sprung up since mr abbott afterwards lord tenterden wrote a treatise on the subject in  none bave gained a wider reputation than mr mlachlaus work of which we have before us the third edition by him self william maxwell and son  fleetstreet  since the last edition in l there have been passed the merchant shipping amendment act  and other statutes which are now in corporated into the body of the work mr mlachlan falls very foul of the decision of the house of lords in the case of  lohre v aitchi son which turned upon the construction of the socalled  sue and labour  clause in the lloyds policy in this clause the insurers eugage to cnu tribute to the expenses of the insured in  suing labouring and traveling  to avert loss the iouse of lords decided what strangely had not been settled before that the words  sue labour and travel travail do not include the meritorious services of third parties for which recompense in the nature of salvage has been decreed by the courts mr mlacblan thinks that the lords mis apprehended the force of the archaic idiom  sue labour and travel which he accordingly illus trates by numerous extracts from the paston letterswritten circa  the period during which the policy known as iloyds is said to have come into use the result of his examina tion is it may be inferred to fix the phrase with the meaning of to solicit a service of any one to be paid for with money mr mlathlan would seem to be right in his interpretation but he pours out his wrath upon lord blackburn in a way that is hardly decent or suitable to the dignity of a text wvriter the mnoral of dhe case is that for the lloyds policy which bas been judicially pro nounced unintelligible aud incoherent there should be some statutory form substitutedanother work on merchant shidping is the th edition of  abbott lord tenterden on alerchantships and seamen by mr prentice q shaw i and son fetterlane s the first edition was given to the world by that celebrated lawyer in  and though alterations of the law have neces sitated large additions and recasting by subsequent editors the present scheme of the work as revised by mvlr prentice is mainly the same as that of the original lord teoterdens learning is shown in the copious references to the old maritime codes of europe and the treatises of autbors like roccus pothier and emerigon english maritime law is of course founded primarily on national usage but reference is made to uuiversal principles and european usage to settle points yet undecided hence the importance of a maritime lawyer having some acquaintance with the ancient codes of wvis buy oleron with the consolato del iare and even with the greek jhodian and roman usages thus the principles of the law of  general aver age  are founded on the  lex rhodia de jactu incorporated into the code of justinian si levanide navis gratia jactus mercium factus sit omnium contributione sarciatur quod pro omnibus datum est mr prentice seems to have done all that was requisite to bring the book up to date and the miercharnt shipping acts are clearly set forth and annotated if thework presents a rather composite appearance it is owing to the different hands which have been successively employed in the labour of editorshipthirty years is a long interval to elapse be tween the editions of a law treatise and it is not surprising that mr miackeson has in his own words not so much reedited as re written r cootes treatise on the law of mortgages stevens and sons r sweet w maxwell and son  legislation has been at work withdrawing special branches of the sub ject from the operation of the common law while many important decisiods have extended or altered the fabric of caselaw to quote one or two of the statutes which have been incorporated into the pre sent edition wo bave the merchant shipping the bills of sale and the mlarried womens property acts not to speak of comparatively old acts such as those introduced by lords st leonards and cranworth and mr locke king the decisions in the courts again are broaght up to date and in clude those of the year just expired among these we notice the important case of  mills v jen nings reversing  tassell v smith the lords justices in  imills v jennings  deeided that a mortgagee of one estate cannot consolidate his mort gage with a mortgage on another estate as against a purchaser of the equity of redemption of the firstnamed mortgage who purchased before the second mortgage was created mfr amackeson had already indicated the dissatisfaction of the pro fession with  tassell v smith  before  mills v jennings was decided mr mackesons labours are characterized by a thorough clearness of treatment and arrangement and fully sustain the reputa ion enjoyed by mr cootes treatisemagistrates will find a valuable handbook in messrs greenwood and miartins agisterial and police guide  stevens and haynesof which a fresh edition has just been published the last edition appeared in  since which time statutes and decided cases have accumulated in abundance of course the most important feature in the bool is the embodiment of the summary jurisdiction act of  by which extensive latitude was given to magistrates within certain limits in adjusting the punishments of minor criminals it was quite a revolution in magisterial law and perhaps justices and police magistrates hardly avail themselves suficiently as yet of the discre tionary powers which it affords with regard to cases the  guide  includes all the latest de cisions and even by means of addenda those reported while the book was in the printers hands for instance we find the important educational cas of a mellor v denham  the case of  cor bet v haigh in which a justices decision was affirmed that a licensed victualler cannot con vert those who were his customers into private friends in order that thev may stay on bis premises after closing hours and that of the  pharma ceutical society v the london and provincial supply association which established that the word person  in the poisons act does not primd facie include a corporation the editors wisely steer clear of the unsettled question of the punishment of juvenile offenders beyond giving the enactments treating of the subject actuallyin forcea treatise on contentious probate practice from the pen of such an expert as dr tristram butterworths fleetstreet  supplies a want of the profession upon a branch of practice which has hitherto not received much attention at the hands of commentators the work of imr justice williams on executors and administrators did not touch upon many parts of the oontentious business of the probate court while mr  c cootes standard treatise on the comnmon form practice of the probate division is expressly limited to non contentious business in mr dixons booktoo the contentious is somewhat oversbadowed by the non contentious business dr tristrams presentwork is of course in a large measure a transcript of portions of the judicature acts but whereas an action in the probate division has hitherto neces sitated reference to many sources of information lawyers will now find all their materials for this purpose collected into one volumetie vast amount of capital embarked in the undertakings of companies is a guarantee that the second edition of mr palmers  company precedents  stevens and sons  will not lackattention from shareholders directors and counsel the additions that have been made to the pnsent edition are not of secondary interest  they comprise such essen tials as directions for the composition of pro spectuses and for practice in windingnp and in arrangements with creditors the framing of aprospectus as mr palmer observes requires great skill and judgment the object heing to throw arn air of attractiveness round a project while not omitting any material fact and not pushing hope fulness into misstatement we doubt hontever wkether in the art of attracting investors without entangling themselvesastute projectors in the city have much to learn from lincolnsinn or the templex another feature in the new edition is the collection of orders and judgments in actions and proceedings by and against companies the forms and
