photometpical statidardsseveral attempts are now being made to construct a standard photometer or rather a standard sensitometer as it is ratiher barbarously termed since the attempts referred to are being made by photographers and are for the purpose of measuring the actinism of any light rather than the actual amount of the ligbt itself one of these is by mir wvarnerke and a brief description of it is given in e recent number of the british journzal of pwtography mir wyarnarka proposes to emaploy ditterent vcrieties of luminous paint forthe pur pose lt hns tean ascertained that the different metallic sulphides emuloyed for this purpose are sensitive in dif ferent degreei to the different parts of the spectrum and it is further said that a similar difference is found in different specimens of the same silphide the journal of paotegruphy states that from the most generallyused eulphide calcium sulphide sit is possible to prepare diflerent mnaterials  as to give off a phosphorescent light varying very greatly in colour from violet aud blue to red it is not stated precisely bow mr warnerke applies these principles  but supposing it to be possible to produce a material of standard sensitiveness it is not dificu t to imagine that it might be possible to construct both a standard unit of lihtthat is to say a surface of given area covered with a material which might be equally sensitive to afl sorts of light and vould shovw merely the amnountand also to construct a seusitometer which would sbow the amount of blue and red rays in ang iven light ed consequently the actinism of the light ml leon vulal has also recently brought ab seleniumphotometer before the laris photographical society from the description given it does not really differ from the selenium eye of dr isiemeus the pritish jousi of pkotogrojhy gives a description of a selenium cell mounted on tbe topfa photogrphic studio and arranged so as to show on a galvanometer within the amoant of light falling on the selenium at any moment so as to enrble a photographer to judge the amount of exposure necessary for his plate it is hardly possible to doubt that this errangement is at present purely imaginary as is also the suggestion that an automstic arrangement should be attached to the camera which should expose the photographic plate a varying length of time according to the amount of actinism in the light m vidal states that he has not found his selenium subjectto the sfatigue whicb bas been so commonly noted by all wbo have had the slightest experience of the action of selenium previously he further states that whatever be the colour of the light thrown on the selenium it appears to make no difference here again he is eitirely at varance with the authorities in this country
