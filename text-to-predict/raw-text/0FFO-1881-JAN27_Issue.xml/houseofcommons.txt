palliaentary intelligencehouse if comions wdsday jm business of the houseounr eport of the debate upon mr gladstones motion broke off at  oolock this morning txhe following part of which appeared in the second edition of the times of today is a continuation of our reportmir hraly regretted that the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster and the prime iinister had liuked their names vith this policy of coercion those honoured names had thus become a hissing ard a reproach laughter the prime iinister said that the proposition he had made that evening was a very grave one and in that he quite agreed with the right hoa gentlemn but how could such a grave propositioa be properly debated at a sitting xvicn might according to the threatv which had been held out last from tuesday afternoon till friday night thus viping wednesdayendthursday comoletely out ofthe calendar as tuesday would get anl tie credit or the dis credic of the continuous sitting  he did not thinmi the go vernment would obtain any advantage from the pursuit of their present tactics forwshatever opposition befor onehad intended to offer to the coercion b li of her majestys go vernment would be rendered ten times greater by the course that was now being pursued the hon mnember was refer ring to the subject of crinme in irelandmore especially with respect to the sending of threatening letters wi enthe speaker said the hon member vwas not confining his remarks to the question before the house and he called upon him to do somlr yhealy then referred to another class of crime which had been referred to in the course of the debate neamely the cutting of telegraph wiresthe speaker pointed out that the hon member was not speaking to the question before the housemrhealy went on to say that the right hon gentlemnra at the head of tht government had not shown any prece dent for the course be called upon the house to adopt if they came at once to the consideration of the coercion bill thb would be obliged to leave unstudied tle blue booksthag had been issuedoneofevhichavolumeof  pages had been distributed that very morning instead however of givng them the necessary tirme the prime minister of course with a revolver at their foreheads ordered them to go through the lobby continuously till the bill was passed that he submitted amounted to a contempt of parlia ment  oh oh b  if they were not allow d to read the bluebooks he might as well sit down at once cheers and he knew that hon members opposite would be glad if he did so but he wished to trouble the laouse for a few moments more  question he was endeavouring to keep to the question as ciosely as the lateness of the hour and his own rather obfuscated faculties would permit he was about to suggest that the prime minister should refer the matter to a select committee so that search might he made for precedents  hear and a laughthe kpeak ri must call upon the hon member to address himself to the chair and to the question before the house the hon member constantly addresses himself to sections of the house a practice that is quite disorderly iiear hearmr hbaly concluded by saying that if hon members would only make some allowance for the difficult position in which the irish members were placed the letter would not be reduced to the devices with which the house was acquaintedllr t p oconnor who vas received with cries of dividesaid that the length of his observations would depend on the patience of the house the prime ainister had taken up an unsafe and untenable nposit on he did lot shrink from the disecssion of the details of the government returns of crime in ireland on the contrary he desired it and be was anxions to know whether the prime bminister when he resolved upon coercion had those details before him or only the mendacious totals but he felt bound to teke part sn the present debate because it raiseda most important constitutional question affecting not ireland alone but this country also it was the ques tion whether a minority of members in that house were to be overruled at the will of a despotic government and in raising that question it seemed to him the irish mem bers who were condemned always to be in a minority in that house aere performing a patriotic duty he did not believe that the public opinion of england wvould support the government in their policy of brute forcemir odonniell remarked that this debate had de generated into a mere question of relays it was in no spirit of bravado that be entered into a contest of this kind he remembered that on a former occasion when irish members endeavoured to prevent the discussion of important businessat au improper hour all resistance utterly failed bhufore the majority that backed up the government of the day the triumpb that wvas gained over some of the irish members a few years ago ought to be a warning to gentlemen whowishea to get a triumpb against irish members now if the i views of tee minority had been successful on that occasion i tens of thousands of lives millions of money and future disaster to ths empire would have been spared hear irish members had made no preparations for the present struggle they wvere not going to make any preparationsagainst the government relays but as surely as the go i vernment would win on this occasion so surely would irishi members vin in a few weeks or months or years for the irish cause that had lived for centuries divide hte heard an hon member cry  divide and be agreed that it was time to come to a decision hear hear but the decision that ought to be arrived at was that at that late hour the debate should be at once adjourned he told her majestys governreeut that if they did not they would be open to the charge rof de siring to prive private members of their rights and privilege in silence and obscurity so far as the outward world was concerned tha certainty of triumph tended to close the ear and conscience but it was true nowas it ever was that it was alway the vanquished who won  because the wrong that was done always worked out in time if not its remedy at least its retribution the primae miinister in one of his oratorical sleights of hand had stated that the reason for his exceptional proposa ls would bh efound in a then pending debate in that statement he could not followr the rigt hon gentleman but he asked what coald be more unfair than that a motion of such vast importaneie as the present should he interposed in a debate of the fiirst magnitude  the tactics of the right hon gentleman at the head of the government took b arst thed form of prejudicing the rouse the right hon gentleman p had primed and charged the p ro se with onesided accounts as to the horrible condition of ireland ar d had thus created a feeling which the irish members had as yet had no opportuniyof dispeling a lausgh theu thespremier asked the house in a paroxysm of panic and prejudice to destroy the foundations of ld grliamentary law and when the irish members protested against his gï¿½agging resolu tioms the right hon gentlemn pointed to his mechanical majorityi i hrase which kt emers of the present govern ment and their supporters were so fund of throbing id the face of lord besconsfields government but there the governrenti svt nowindtheiropaces not as extinct vol canoes without a fliker to be seen upos their crest butrather filled with dire designs against pubiic rand privatej liberty scorning wilth indignation the opposition of the irishi party hut rapt in the stateliness of their oen interitions the policy or coercion was unworthy of a liberal govern ment and he varned them it would not be a successful one mr dawson referring to what had occurred earlier in the evenng said that the icident was unexpected end un premeditated and had not arisen from any desire on the part of the hon memuber for cavan to waste the tirne of the house the course of action that the government had pursued was in the circumstances extravagant and beyond the necessities of the casemr grvan as a supporter of the government had come to the conclusion that it was the duty of the govern ment to adjourn the debate  hlear hear  and  o no the irish peuple being very sensitive it vas right and proper that inuorder to satisfy then their r presentatives should have time to study the question by tbh light of tha official statisticsmir a moore also appealed to the gove nment to ad joura the debate be had seen several allnightsittings and his experience o them vwas that they did not increase the dignity of the ouse h ear hear se suggested that the motion of the prime minister should be passed on the understanding that the cgovernment would not proceed with the bill until thursdaymr gray sapported the proposed compromisedr lyons wvhile heartily condemning obstruction thought the arrangement would be satisfactory to all partiesmhr litton urged the government to accept the com prmise proposed as a means of saving time without deroga tirgfrom their own dignitymr h samuelson remarked that to postponethe bills tillthursday was incompatibe with the terms of the resolu tionmr w e forster said the house if it adopted the suggestion of the hon member for clonmell would iu fact stultify itself there was no question of hurrying through important measures without debate for hou members would have ample time for discussion on the various stages of the bills in their passage through the house the question now before them was really this whether an enormcs majority of the housewas to be allowed to de cide the mode in which busines should be carried on that was a very important question and if it were not decided mn the affirmative a very had precedeat wuuld be formed he was sorry he nas unable to give effect to the wellmeant suggestion which had been thrown out for an amicable settlement of the present difficulty but the housesould see that the thing was impassibler j mcarthy assured the house that the honmembers with whom he acted bad no thoughts at the open ing of the sitting of discussing the motion of the premier at unreasonable length the unfortunate exacerbation of felin now previling oz both sides of the honse vvascwing entirely to the unpremeditated inoident which lad occurred in the course of the evening and to the chapheroism displayed by the prime minister in refusing an adjournment of the debate the demand for an adjournmeut seemed to him a perfectly reasonable one the irish members believed that if time were afforded them thev would be able coutpletely to demolish the statistics onwhich the government based their demand for coercion that was the object with wvhich they had entered upon the debate that nigbt and if that purpose had been departed from and many valuable hours wasted the fault did not lie with them hear hearair d lki suggested as an alternative acceptablo to both parties that the debate should now be adjourned on the understanding that it shonld be brought to a close at the usual wednesday sittingmr findlatir sulopoted the appeal for an adjourn mnent on the ground that the refusal of an adjournment by the governm ent vould produce a bad effect in irelandir laboijcherbe also urged the government to enterinto some understanding with the irish members cries of  no no he did not understand the feeling which prompted hen members to sboat  no no the irish nembers were not lepers but had a right to expect to be treated as the equals of any other section of bon members in that house ilear bearthe flouse divided at  oclock when there appearedfor adjournment of the debate    against      majority     mr dillon then moved the adjournment of the house he had no doubt that the intelligent portion of the people of englnd would justify the action of the izish members who ere acting bndzjzde he would offer every opposition which the rules of the house permitted to the coercive measuresof the chief secretary for ireland thelrish rnemlbers had a right to demand at least two niahts for the discussion of the motion of tce prime minister they con ten ed that no ease of urgency had been made out for coer cive measures against ireland and that the longer coercion iwas delayed the better ti right hon gentleman who no doubt knewv all the precedents of the qouse did not quete a single precedent for the extreme measures oof cercion against ireland ms it wise for the government to enter into an international siren gle in which english and scotch l members vereto crush irish members on a question that dealt with ireland alone  was urgency to be given to the coercive measuresof the chief secretary for ireland or to the remedial measures which the irish members were naxious to bring before the house  the irisb members knew the condition of ireland a great deal better than the ohief secretary for ireland did tue prime minister pointed out the inconvenience af jumping froru monday to thursday with the debate on the coercion bill but there were measures which the irish members considered of far more importance than that of the government and the progress of waich ocght not to be delayed he did lot deny nay he asserted that the coerdon bill was an impotant one in a uegatin e sensenamely that it was importaue that it shoud not pass what they were desirons of was to facili tate not ihe coercion bill but the general business of par litrment and they protested against tbe rights and privi leges of private mem bers being indenitely postponed and all the powers of remedying tue grievances of the people not of lrelana only but of england and scotland also being sus pnded the irish mnembers would be urged by the motion before the house into a discussion of that coercion bill for an indefinite period meanwhile it was sougnt to coerce the lrish members just as much as the coercion i bill would coerce their constituents for they would for a i period of perhaps two montbs be reduced to a position ofpassive resistance and helplessness and be unable to bring t ortward measares to heal the grievances of the irish peoplethe ogorain laion seconded the resolutionmir a oconnor said it was nine hours since he ven i tured to submit his amendment to the motion of the premier and they had seen in the interval howv much the dominant mnajority of the house had showyn itself the ready instrument of immediate coercion the delay which had taken place was not to be attributed to the action of the irish members but wvas to be traced to the want of tact and managementhe miget say the want of knowledge of the forms of the housewhich was manifested by her majestys governmvent if they had assented to the offer which was made to them at  oclock last night they could at once have proceeded with the debate on the bill of the chief secretary to the lord lieutenant they preferred howeverto depend on their docile mechanical majority and hoped tbereby to silence the irish members and prevent them disebarging the duty which their constituents had sent them there to fulfil for his part he had a great contempt for obstruction he regarded it as the most contemptible form of parliamentary tactics he looked rather to steady patient pressure scientifically applied a laugh end to that pressure they should resort when they saw an atrempt made without sufficient reason shown to deprive the irish members of their rights and privileges and of the opportu i nity of doing their duty to their constituents they knew why the government were holding out against all compro mise it was because they were content to see the house occupied by a number of sleepin figures who resembled legislators a laugh but who in reality were only members on guard to outnumnber the defenders of irish interests and those sleeping members were waiting their turn to be relieved by others who had gone home to rest for a certain number of hours well the government having arrangedthat relays of members should come back the irish members i felt bound to continue the debate and if possible to induce the members still on the benches to surrender at discretion he considered the conduct of the government to be degrad ing to the house they had for instance shown themselves singularly unmindful of the long hours which mr speaker bad been kept in the chair and cof tle time the officials of the house had been kept uniiecessarily in their places if the irish members gained they would gain with credit if the government gained they would gain with etiscredit on tbe other hand if the irish members faiied their failure however great thestrainmight be would iot be without its recomupense and they vould know that they had doiie that which englishmen in their places would certainly do they ad in tlieir hands the fate of a large number of people in ireland they knew thast if coercive measures passed numlbers of innocent men  ould be imprisoned while iiuuibers of others would live in fear and trembling and that throughout the leegtb and breadth of the land many homes vould he rendered desolate it was their duty toavert those dangers as long as they could and until they l received some assurance fron her majestys governmen tthat the coercion bill would iiot be forced on except at ai rate which would enable the english people to become ac quainted with its true nature they would be justified in continuing the struggle and till then he trusted the present opposition would le carried on as long as the forms of the house allowedsir w harcourt wished to draw attention to the statement of the hon member for tipperary to the effect that he had heard the proposal of the lion member for cionmell with dismay and was glad that it had been rejected by the members among whom he sat  no no unmistakably the lion member had distinctly expressed his disapprobation of that proposal bear harl and he spoke of the hon member for longford as having also disap proved it whben therefore it was said that the govern ment rejected proposais mtade by irish members it should be reminembered what was said by the hon members for tipperary and longford of the proposal made by thie hommemiber for clonmell but it was asserted that the irish  members hlid been wiling that the debate should conclhde on that day wiednesday but what said the lion mei aber wbo had just sat down  he said that it was the inteation that the debate should be continued until the government gave some undertaking that the protection of life and pro perty bill should not be proceeded with except at such a rate as was satisfactory to the people of ireland  ho no frolm mr a oconnor that certainly nias the impression the words produced uoon him hiear hear he liad heard it said before too that the bill of coercion was to be defeated upon this motion cries of no from below the gangway it was certainly a singular thing that vhen themeaning of plain words ivas gathered and repeated it nwas i at once repudiated hea r hear it was quite idle to state now that assertions of that character had not been made over and over agaii cheers lhy had it not been said on the original motion for adjournment last evening that it was meant that the present debate should terminate on wednesday not a word had they heard upon that subject until  oclockonwednesdaymoning hearhear no one could possibly avoid the conclusions he drew from the dbate as his right hon friend the prime minister had stated at   he could iot accept the motion for ad journment because of the obvious intention to protract the dbte hear hearmr aicairthy began to think the prolongation of the debte ias producing its natural effect of mutual mis understanding he had neter accused the right hon gentleman of speaking in a passionate tone but of a ceitain haughtiness anu disregard of a section of the house as for the suggestioii of the hon member for clonmell he had not regarled it witb much favour as what they wanted was a full discumsion of the question of urgency ltay bad never supposed that the governmnent would be so unreasonable as to refuse that discussion nor indeed did he think they would hav e done so if the untoward incident that they all regretted had not occurredmr mlcoan complained that the prime ilnister had l taken a wvrong view of the offence of the bon member for cavan whose conduct however he did not wish too com pletely to extenuate the tone of the right hoii gentle man was not conciliatory and the few words spoken later by the home secretary were so imperious that he was now ready if necessary to continue the debate till midnight tomorrov the governmnent clearly intended to exhaust them in the next few bours but he believed they were lreckoning without their bost four liberal mnembers fromthe north of ireland had deserted the government and tney were now   as fresh as they had been many hours before besides their education in the forms of the house would probably enable them to continuo the debate for some tine longer hear her and olh oh at any ralte when the debate was read by the public the verdict given would be on their side laughter larned pro tessors might laughir rogeiis rose to order did the bon member allude to him  lie bad not heugheci but was on the con trary ashamed of those disgraceful proceedingsmr callan also rose to order and asked whether the lioll genlemans use of the word  disgraceful  was par liamentary teie speaker pointed out that the word had not been applied to any member of the housemr rogers said be used the word to characterize the whole proceedingsmir coan resumnjg contended that the fault lay with the government and not with the irish members wvhen the coercion bill came to be discussed he hoped thlat none of them nwould forget the decorum of debatecheers but vithin those lines he promised tle govern mnent as firm a fight as  irishmen ever offered to a ministerial majority hear her and  oh oh the hon member uas proceeding to comment on the cohesion of the irish party whenthe speakeur raled that such ohservntions vmere irrelevant and out of orderm dr mcoan apologized and said that his conceptions of order were rathler loose laugliterforwant of parliamentary experience ie wvould no longer occupy the time of the housemr daly maintained that the want of time to examine thorouglly the latest returns was a perfectly legitimate grouud for the opposition now oatered to the motion of the prime lminister he held that it was the duty of everyirish man in that assembly to drop from exhaustion upon the ficor rather than submiit to the despotism of the governmentthe spealier at this point five minutes to  oclock left the chair ancd ws succeeded by dr playfair the deputy speakermir barry supported the motion for adjournment in order to afford the governmnent time to reconsider its position and to obviate the humiliating spectacle of a trial of physical endurance between the contending parties in thehousemr osullivan urged that the question should be adjourned first because the return on which the govern mentrelied as making out a rase for coercion wasonlyplaced in the hands of members yesterday morning andsecondly because the leader of the home rule members was absent he suggested that the question should be ed journed now halfpast  oclock and taken up again at  olock if that course were adopted no doubt a division could be taken on the question when a quarter to  arrived but if that course were not adopted the government would perhapx find that they could not arrive at a decision without a much longer debatemr odonnell said the people of england would dad that the government were proposing to make an attack on the constitution and wellconducted people in ireland were being driven by the conduct of the government into the ras of the extremest party in that country the course which the government w ere proposing with regard to ireland they would not propose with regard to england the ground on which the government alleged that coercive measures should be promptly applied to ireland was that statistics showed that the state of that country was sucb as to require that treatment but the go vernment had not given members time to examine those statistics this question ought to be adjourned to allow time for the study of those statisics wvith tht exception of a speech srom the liome secretary they had been favoured w ith no ministerial utterance during thenight save fromthe chief secretary for irelandr w only rose to reject all idea of compromise altbough the overturs for such came from his own side hler majestys government in fact seemed to despise reason to reject argument and to reply to protestations whether coming from their irisn or their english supporters by the single argument of party discipline which was the parliamentary word for physical force of course her maajestys govern ment would win a victory like that which had been simi larly won by her majestys government of lamented memory laugher but passing a motion under such circumstances would only contribute to still more deeply depreciate the credit of the govern ment at least in ireland and would furnish fresh arguments to the opponents of their measures everything that happened underlord beeconsfields govern ment was outheroded by the proceedings of the head of the present linistry  question  would it not be better for the premier instead of prosecuting his present proceeding to introduce a short bill to prevent the appear ance of the irish memsbers in that heouse  hear hearand  qaestionthe deputyspeaeic pointed out that the hon gen tleman was not speaking to the questionmr odoxnnell concluded by expressib  bor thz the debate would be adjourned to a period when it could be conducted with some degree of effectmr healy said when hon members opposite went again to their constituents they would find what his countrymen who bad votes in the boroughs they repre sented thought of them  oh and  questionlord e fitzmaurioe rose to orderthe deputyspeaker called upon the hon member to speak to the question before the housemr healy said that no satisfactory ceuclusion could be arrived at on the question before the rouse inasmuch as the majority of members were in bed cries of  divide after those loud cries he was disposed to change his mind and say that the majority were wide awvake  questionlord b fizmaurice again rose to orderthe deputyspeaker did not think the expression used was out of order but the hon member could not be surprised at the impatience of the houseas from the nature of his remarks he seemed to be speaking against time cheersxr healy resumed his address and was commenting upon the absence of certain members whensir r cross rose to order the observations of the hon member he said had nothing to do with the question before the house and the house would he was sure sup port the chair in any ruling that might proceed from itoheersthe deputyspeakerthe hon member is out of order in going beyond the terms of the motion and i must caution him not to do so again hear hearmr healy proceeded to say that the prime minister had relied on statistics in support of bis motion  but they could not exanine those statistics if they were kept up all night they had asked the llouse on behalf of the irish people for bread and they were offered a tone they had to appeal on behalf of the irih people and if hon members opposite persisted in their present course the sooner the irish members were turned out of the house the betterr iv cartivwright rose to order andthe deputyspeaker stated that the hon gentle man vwas again travelling beyond the question hear hearmr healyi will not speak any more mrchairman mir leamy said that the minority might be beaten in the long run but the victory of the government would not redound to their honour hon gentlemen opposite seemed to think they were obstructing the course of public business but nothing was further from their minds laugbter irish members had good reason to com plain of the conduct of the government in forcing them into an immediate and premature discussion of their billmr callax deeply regretted the occurrences of the night he hoped that his remarks would not be disturbed by any cries from belowv the gangway on the iniiiisterial side four years ago the house had spcnt a similar nigbt over the south african bill the present undersecretary of htate for tbe home department beiiur one of the chief opponents of the then government but no good result was obtained and a calmer and more moderate discussion would have saved the country many disasters the hon gentleman was discussing the land question and referring to the infamous lansdowne leases whenthe deputyspeaker said that such allusions were clearly out of orderbmr callan continuing his remarks advousted the compromise proposed four hours earlier by the hon member for cloumellmr gray remarked that the government must neces sarily succeed sooner or later but what would be the result if the motion nvere carried without some arrangement being made with the irish members  even if the bill were pusbed through with all imaginable despatch the fact would not be creditable to the government wvas it he asked the serious intention of the government to bring on their bill immediately they had carried that niotion when the irish members were too exhausted to be able to go on with the discussion of the measure  the real cause of that allnight sitting was not the obstruction of the irish members  oh oh  but was the unexpected incident which occurred last night they ought at least to be aliowed an interval of rest between the first and the second stages of the measuremr finigan again urged that the ordinary powers of the law were sufficient to enable the government to deal effectually w ith alleged crime and outrage in ireland he was proceeding to argue that coercive measures vould pro duce a distrust of the ordinary lavw whenthe deputypraker called hintto order for not adhering to the question before the bousemr filingan went on to complain that no oppor tunity was given to the irish members to examinethe statistics contained in the bluebooksobefore theyaereasked to consent to the abridgment of the liberties of debate and to sacrifice the privileges of private members in co elusion he earnestly appealed to the government to come to soene reasonable compromisemr nelson did not rise merely to waste time but to tbrow oil on the troubled waters a laugh he boped that the noble marqtus might see some mode of solving tlhat diflicalty by which they might at once presere the dignity of the hliouse and the liberties of the subject the coatest in wbichl they were now engaged was one of mere physical endurance and they might as uell be ar rayed against each other iu the field of mortal combat as to be carrying on the prcsent conflict in the spirit which was now aroused it was not a good spirit interruption the way to prolong a mans speech was to go oni interrupt ing him  hlear and a laugh he supposed thart be should be expected to w aste time hut he could not do it laughter le had too much reaspect for himself and for the house to do o the bon memberwvrent onto make some discursive remarks in the course of whichthe deputyspeaker repeatedly reminded him that he was straying from the questionmr nelson rejoined amid some laughter that he woald submit like a larib to whoever occupied the chair adding that be was only endeavouring to learn the forms of the house
