the ciiinese in centbal asiaiox our cophespoidzwrbag hai dec in spite of the renewed transfer of the negotia tions between russia and china to st petersburg the chinese government insist on tso taungtang the governorgeneral of kansuh and commis sioner of the new dominion going to pekin to advise them in their present difficulties when he first received the orders of the emperor calling him to court he begged to be excused on the ground that he had nobody under him fit to take the reins of government during his absence a second edict was thereupon issued appointing yang changchiin formerly governor of chekiang to act as governorgeneral in eansuh and tso was commanded to hand over charge to him with out delay and proceed to pekin in terms which ad mitted of no trifling once arrived there his in fluence is certain to be given to prince chun and the war party for he was of all the chinese offi cial body the most unsparing denunciator of the treaty of livadia and the loudest accuser of its framer chunghow i am told that in one memorial which he wrote at the same time as chang chib tung and other fireeaters he was bold enough to say that if the government did not repudiate the treaty he would settle the question himself and march on kuldja by that bombastic sentiment he meant that he would order his generals to cross the frontier and seize by force what could only be ob tained by diplomacy in return for most galling conditions for it must be remembered that tso so often styled the victorious generalissimo the conqueror of the northwest and so forth has never commanded his troops himself and has never had his headquarters nearer the scenes of the massacres which he dignified by the names of vic tories than suchau a frontier town of kansun proper he may fairly claim the merit of having selected and retained the best fighting generals in the ohinese army for his serviceof having supplied them with as many men as he could find money to pay for and of having raised as far as shanghai is concerned the least possible amount of money at the highest possible rate of interest as far as re gards the actual subjugation of sungaria and xashgaria he was much more indebted to heaven than to his generals good men though they un doubtedly were for the death of yakoob beg was followed by chaos in these regions and the country tsos generals were called upon to reconquer was not a country united under a powerful and warlike prince but a beargarden where the hands of rogues simpletons and fanatics were daily turned against each other tsos reputation as a general has been in great measure built up by himself and his literary secretaries aided in no small degree in europe by various writers on central asia who have supposed the marches sieges and massacres of kinshun liu chintang and others to have been the work of tso tsungtang himself with the stamping out of the mahomedanrebellion within the confines of inner kansuh tso had auch to do but with the aotual overrunning of yakoob begs dominions which followed he had nothing except supplying the meanshis departure for pekin makes therefore no change in the military situation in outer kansub and in the new dominion liu chintang is in command of all the troops outside china properhis headquarters being at kashgar where he has a body of troops estimated at from  to  only under him though only nominally are the famous kinshun and liu changyo who have about  more troops either garrisoned in sungaria or engaged in maintaining the long line of com munication between hasbgar and kansuh these  soldiers are indifferently armed and aro scattered in small parties over the immense region comprised between the two limits i have named there are also large numbers of disbanded braves engaged in tilling the soil allotments of land having been made to them free of all expense partly with a view to secure provisions for the troops and partly to compensate the braves for not being sent back to their homes after the expiration of their term of service supplies are often obtained from the russian side of the frontier when they cannot be obtained as is often the case elsewhere and on the whole the chinese in central asia however fit they may be to keep the territory of which they are in actual possession as against the wandering tribes from whom they have wrested it are not only not in a position to make the rush on kuldja which tso once threatened but will have the utmost difflculty in holding their own the moment a few thousand wellarmed russian troops move south and cut off the kashgar force from its communications east chinese strength in central asia has been just as much exaggerated by european writers as their strength in china proper for to tell the truth they are as unprepared for a campaign on the frontier astheya dmittedly unable to cope with russia on the seaboard qconcentration of troops at shan ha kwan ges on apace thirteen thousand troops have been sent from hankow in steam transports but all are armed with matchlooks this is a perfect example of chinese progress in military matters of the absurdity of hurrying together a crowd of undrilled men armedwithrusty old gingallsforthedefenceof the country against a power like russia they know nothing  but they dwell with great complacency on the fact that they have steam vessels at their command for the transport of their soldiery the commanderinchief is tseng kuo chiian a brother of the late celebrated governor general at nanking tseng kuofan and uncle of the present popular mimster to england i have seen several letters from chineso ofieers at the shan hai kwan camps but the news current there is mainlv founded on translations of paragraphs from european papers reference is made for ex ample to the recall of m butzoff to st petersburg and to the utter impossibility of ever giving in to russias demand for the cession of the is land of formosaregarding the prospects of war or plans for war the chinese military mandarins with whom i have conversed know very little the fouoving is the substance of a conversation i had with an admiral the other day a man of more than ordinary intelligence as military mandarins go the viceroy bas sent me a list of the russian leet of the size of its ships the weight of the guns carried and thenumber of their crews they number about  men in all and are stationed at a place i never heard of called viadivostock how far is that from russia is it in china the russians caunob possibly come up the yangtsze said peng our admiralinchief has written to the emperor not ro be afraid peng guarantees with his head that not a single russisn ship will ever go up the mlimto fooohowi thevbangpoo to shanghai or the yangtsze the embouchure of the grand canal at kwachow and the conimuding positions at chinkiang are being well looked after and liu kunyi the viceroy at nanking has orders to stake the yangtsze if necessary if your foreign mer chant steamers are stopped it cant be helped you need not laugh at our troops being armed with matcblocks i consider it a great advantage if we fight we shall beat the russians and capture their rides and our soldiers will use them because they knowv rifie drill but it the russians beat us and capture our matchlocks they wont be able to use them because they do not know matchlol drill so the advantage is clearly with us i am a hunan man and ninetenths of the chinese army officers and men are runan men over  men have been enlisted in my province during the last few years and there are plenty more ot us who do not fear deatb the recruiting agents of three provincial governments are busy getting more mne nolvhe war party as against the antiwar party at peknn is simplyhunan against the rest of china at the present moment in our bmpire there are four governorgenerals eight imperial commissioners and seven generals all eager for wvar and every one of them is a tunan mau liu

worthy admiral here got very abusive and tocalm him i showed him a winchester repeatin rifle but he would not look at it althoughassured him that it fired  rounds and that each russian carried sixmy informanta opinions are not valuable on their intrinsic merits but they are not without importance as showing the views with regard to probable hostilities held by the leading military officers in china these officers are sometimes as in this case bluff manly fellows whose conversation has an honest ring of healthy patriotism but they are invariably ignorant and unteachable in time of peace and if there can be degrees inignorance so dense as to be absolutely inconceiv able in men who have ears to hear the most con servative and stupid are the same hunan men whose readiness to die and ability xto serve theircountryare so much vaunted by y friend the admiral among them of course theaiare notable exceptions such as kwo sungtaos tli late ambassador to england and the different mcmbers of the great governing family of taing but as a rule hunan mengentle and simpleare ignorant to a de gree and invariably rude to strangers andforeigners no foreigner has shown himself inside the walls of chang shafoo the capital of hunan since the treaty of tientsin was ratified  years ago with out having his head broken and even at this moment englishmen only travel in the province at the risk of their lives tad just as the coimnonseopls are norant and boisterous in their acts so unan officials are rude and boiaterous in their opinions and if any section of them should ever become the guiding spirits of this natien as ap pears not at all improbable and be allowed td overrule the counsels of men like prince kung and li hungchang they are certain to adopt a spirited foreign policy that can only end in disasterthe moral of the whole of this letter is one that i have again and again had occasion to drawviz that chinas strength as at present developed for purposes of war is much overestimated even colonel gordon himself who returned to china expecting to find a wonderful change in the country from which he had been absent  yeals and who had during that time read of chinese arsenals fleets torpedoes and foreign drilled troops had a rude waking up and had to confess that the new china he had heard of was after all the old china he knew with a little veneer
