ireblandtme land avipaitnovdublin jan at tho weekly meeting of the land league held today at the offices in sackvillestreet under the presidency of sir t d sullivan mp one of the jurors in the recent state trials was proposed for membership an attack was made by sir davitt on the chief secretary for ireland be cause of his speech in introducing the coercion bill and it was resolved to form a ladies committee under the leader ship of bliss anna parnell for the distribution of funds which have been already received and may yet arrive from aneric the first evidence of the new departure was the presence of several ladies the vives and relatives of mem bers at the meeting alr patrick egan treasurer an nonnced that they had received since last weeks meeting � s d for organization parposes and � os d for the defence fund the larger figure included � s d from the irish national land and industrial league of aerica applause sir davitt said it afforded him considerable pleasure to propose as a member of the irish national land league mr patrick slacken north ling stre at vintner one of the jury in the state prosecutions air slacken came that morning and told him that until he read the rules of the lanwl league during the trial and heard so much of the work it had been performing he was not aware there was such a spirited organization in ire land hear lle added rbat because of the knowledge he had gleaned during the trial lie was very desirous of becoming a member of such a useful organization hie sir davitt now proposed him and his name would come up next week for acceptance smr r j donnell suggested tbat the usual rule should be waived in this case so as to dmit mr slacken forthwvith but the chairman said he was informed that could not be done in reference to this mnatter he might add that it seemed not ab all unlikely that the effect of the recent trials would be to bring in many geutlemen besidrs amr blacken hear from that point of view they might thank the government for having rendered a very important tlough upon their part a very unintentional service sir egan said lie had learned that sir hopkins of graftonstreet and sr hurse of capel street two of the gentlemen on the jury in the late trials had been subjected to some annoyance demonstrations were madeoutside their business establishments on the previons night under the impression that they were the two jurors who held out for a conviction he mir egan cold not name the two gentlemen who did so and he would be sorry that any gentleman should be inconve nienced for the eaercise of his opinions much less held up to odium but he would like to convey to the public that the two gentlemen named were not the men whin held out against the majority of the jury hear mr davitt said that when they wvere denouncing coercion by the whig go vernment of ireland they had no right to encourage coer cion here at home hear  and wvhile they regretted that the two gentlemen who held out against them did not come to a better conclusiontley had a perfect right to act according to their conscientious belief hear sir egan did not wish to say anything more on the subject but in his opinion one of the dissentients was not guidted by a conscientious belief dir peter gill moved  that considering the important crisis at hand in this country and the great necessity of the friends of the land league to redouble their exertions in order tg guard the people from coming by any accident into contact with the british troops now scouring the country for imaginary crime with a view in some way to justify the weak radical liberal government of sir gladstone in the introduction and passage of their wanton and uncalledfor coercior bill we deem it advisable that the prudent eloquent and masterly speech of mr davitt at kanturk be published in pamphlet form by the llague and circu lated through its various branches for the guidance of the people sir dennehy seconded the resolution mr davitt said the briefs prepared for the recent trials and the speeches of counsel vwould furnish better imaterials for such advice after some conversation it vwas resolved to republish the memorandum of instructions adopted some time ago ur davitt said in the face of what was now taking place in the house of commons and what they might expect in a very short time in ireland he thought they wvould not be doing their duty to the country if they passed over in silence one of the most infamous and lying speeches ever delivered regarding irelandthe speech delivered by the chief secretary he would ask them to follow him through tle speech although he did not intend to wade through the mass of exaggerated crime to be found in it ir forster at the opening of his address called attention to the fact that the population of ireland now was five millions and that in  it was eight mil lions and he wanted to deduce from that startling fact that crime was more prevalent in ireland now than when ireland had the larger population he wvanted in fact to show that outrages had increased in proportion to the ditniiution in the poplation who was responsible for that diminution  was it not the landlords of ireland  he had nothine to say about those three millions murdered in ireland byxandlords he had nothing to say about those who met untimelydeaths crossing the atlantic nor about those dying in the fever ships nor the innocent girls driven to roin ly irish landdordism no  and no one was found in the house of commons to comment upon it a few out rages on cattle a few homicides and these could be exag gerated to excite the wrath of england but there vas not one word said about the loss of three milhions in the irish population since  sir forster declared that his statis tics vere not gathered from newspaper reports no they were not they were gathered from reports sent in by the irish policea force distinguisbed more by its inventive genius than by its capacity to detect crime ihear hear it was eli known tliat in the memorandum of instructions issued by the league some few months previously that classof cowardly outrage wvas condemned in emphatic language i by the organization another statement made by ir fori ster was tbhlt the league reigned supreme by tbreats and terror in ireland that they all knew to be a deliberate untruth thev knew very well that they had always dis countenanced anything in the shape of intimidation or coer cion from t e beginning of their movement to that hour they had appealed to the reason the common sense and the patriotism of the country they had iot appealed to its svorst passions  if they had chosen to do so there would be a differr nt calendar of crime before the house of eom mons and before the wvorld again mir forster went to another class of outragethe maiming of cattle r t pi oconnor in his admirable address in the free tradehallmauchester some weeks ago proved that those outrages i did not rank as  to  in ireland to wthat they did in i england and he felt assured now that the hlouse of com  mons was sitting the same eloquent member wouldl return the same answer to sir forster as he had to the same slanders on the irish people in manchester sir davitt said lie had bad a conversatior some weeks ago with ir rarrington the president of the castletown bearhaven branch of the league who told him that a number of those outrages had taken plice in that district but that the league wvas doing its utmost to discover the offenders ir harrington told hins furthermore thiat there was a wide spread belief that they were committed either by the police or by the hangerson of the rentoffice hear hear that statement having attracted the attention of some of the irish members was mentioned iu the house and strange to say not a single one bad occurred in that district since laughter ir forster had used words meaning that the local leaders of that organization throughout ireland were dissolute rufflans and blackguards that wvas not the first time irish chief secretaries hnd endeavoured to raise wrath in that house against the people of ireland but a more barefaced lying statement was never made by an irish chief secretary hear hear it was vell known that throughout the west and south of ireland and throughont this province many llomau catholic priests and curates were found on executive branches of the land league it was also known that the respectable traders and intelligent men throughout this province were om the executive com mittee  and as for the north of ireland thev had their priests and mninisters and orangemen cheers every where thpy found the respectability ancl intelligeuce of the dsstrict represented in the local orancecs of the land league yet smr forster that rladical meomber of the wving cabinet could find no better language to designate those gentlemen tbzoughout the country thanl by calling them dissolute contemptible ruffianusand blackgouards the bitllto he introduced vouldd deal with men suspected of treasonable practices  because the govornmeiit had infor mation that there wyas danger to be apprehended in this direction those men wvho ivere generally known as fenians were making use of this agitation for a purpose wehich might become dangerous sir davitt did not in tend to cast the slightest reflectionof course he could not upon the class of his countrymen wzho were designateid as famous but he might state w hat wals known to every ens in ireland and in a merica that the irishl nationa lists had held aloof from this movement simnply because it was a constitutional movement he uas stating a fact without comnmenting upon it these men had honestly slated soand no one had a greaterzrespect f or their honest convictions i than he had he only made this statement in justice toi them and in refutation of the fatse charge made by sir t forster in the house of commons again fr forster came to abusive langtage and made a charge that these league braneches had secret committees that as a charge first made in the house of commons by a man who now finding it impossible ever again to he accepted as the representative of the county gaiway fell in with the wfhig coercionisls itchell henry wbas toe first man to state that there were secret commsitteesa statement met at once by an emnphatic denial on the part of bir parneil the president of the orgrasnization ir daint gent on to assert that every maen i her of the alague going through the country felt it to be his duty tocall uo thempeopleto abstaingfrom a ay muthrage or the commisston of any act that would giveto the enemies of the league an argument to be used against tbem crime they knew had diminished and he hoped it would continue to dinminish after the governmnent had passed a coercive measure filled the country with flying trcops and probably suspended trial by jury but if it did it would be contrary to all past esperience hear hear then the worst passions of the people would be let loose and as it had been declared over and over again it would not be the irish people but the english government that would be responsible for any outrages that might oc cur hear hear if tbe land league were struck down what would the victims of landlord injustice do for the relief or assistance which it had been in the habit of giving s when tr forster passed his coercive measure and struck down the liberty of the people nod let loose the passions of the victims of landlordisom throughout the country he would have to be answerable not only to the civilized world but to almighty god for every murder and every crime committed cheers he did not supposeat least he scarcely hoped or believedtdhat it would be his pra vilege to address another meeting of the land league but in the meantime  he could do to help those who would remain behind sbould be done they knewv very well that since the organization had been established they had had a relief department in communication with it when famine threatened the country the league were thefirsttospzak out it wws very important that that relief department should be maintainle and he proposed that they should ask the ladies of ireland to come to their assistance in this charitable work cheer ur foratermight bring in another bill to prevent this action on the part of the ladies it only required that to markthe statesman equal to theoccasion and capable of grappling withall the difficulties of the fraudulnt adminstrtion nowvin irelanid missanna parnell wouldbe withlthein in a short time and what they proposed to do was to ask mis parnell to give what assistance she could and to re quest her to cal to her aid the patriotic ladic of ireland and that a circular be issued to all the bnaucbes of the league throughout the country requesting tho executive of those branches to furnish miss parnell with the names of such ladies in their districts as would be wiuing to co operate in the useful work he concluded by proposing a resolution to that effect mr rettle seconded the resolu tion which was adoptedit is novw stated that the two dissenting jurors in the state prosecutions were mtr corcoran

act brooglht against mr m buckley by patrick obrien one of the galtee tenants was decided today at clonmel quarter sessions by mir mall o county court judge obrien claimed seven years rent the jdge inl delivering judg mnent said he was forced to decide this case without the aid of any decided case under the act the question was not discussed in any of the hooks on the act except mr butts and it was there laid down that the court should take into consideration the eqtcifus betwseen landlord an d tenant the court found in this case that the tenant audhis predicessors had been paying the rent of � for seven acres of land tor over  years and that the tenant v as paying rent when the present respondent became onner of tha property he wvas celled on to certify tbat the rent w asexorbitent it was true that the rent was double the valuation but  exorbitant  wvas a very indefinite word and its mening had not been defined by judicial decision on the whole case although sympathizing with the tenant he felt that he was hound to carry out the law hoc did not believe the rent to heexorbitant within the meaning of the aict and therefore he felt forced to dismiss the claim but without costs ele sugsgested to the landlord the propriety of not seekingr to enforce the claim for rent due or the ejectment costs the respondents solicitor said he was satiscied that mr buckley ould act on this
