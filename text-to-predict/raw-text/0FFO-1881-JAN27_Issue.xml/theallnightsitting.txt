tbhe anight srtttygthe discussion in the house of commons which began on tuesday evening lasted without intermission till five minutes past  yesterday afternoon the aspect of the house varied little during the night there were never less than a dozen irish members presentusually as many as  and there was always a fair sprinkling of members upon the ministerial and the opposition benches while ministers and exministers main tained thronghout the night a considerably fuller muster than is seen on ordinary occasions sir s northoote left the house immediately after the uncompromising deolara tion of the prime minister on the subject of adjournment leavingon the front opposition bench sir p cross sir al hicksbeach lord sandon mr gibson lord e cecil sir h selwinibbetson and others most of whom remained tt their posts with little intermission until the leader of the opposition returned at  oclock in the morn ing the composition of the treasury benob was more changing mr gladstone lefr at  oclock not to return till halfpast  andthe leadership of the house in his absence devolved successively upon mr forster who remained till nearly  r childers wbo came dowvn a little earlier and lord martington who baving left the house early in the night reappeared at  in the mornihg sir w harcourt the solicitor general for ireland mr dodson mr courtney mr blundellamrashleyand others came and went at different times mr forster returned at  for the rest bon mem bers seemed to drop in and out pretty much as the fancy took them some remained in the liouse the wvhole night througb keeping tolerably wide awake till  or  odock but after that timne dozing off in their seats these were mostly alinisterialists not one of the obstructives sac cumbed to fatigue ia the house although on he irish benches the same members were constantly reappearing and speaking in all the watches of the night the speaker gave up at  oclock having been in the chair continuously with the exception of one short interval from  oclock on the preceding dayand was succeeded by dr playfair who pre sided over the debate until its adjournmentin previous allnight sittings of tho hrouse there has been a frequency of divisions such was not the case on tuesday night owing no doubt to the operation of the new standing oder to which mr biggar fell a victim and under which individual mem bers are allowed only to make two motions for adjourn ment the obstructives took care not to exhaust to any appreciable extent their right of moving that the house adjourn or that the speaker leave the chair for only three divisions were takenone at  oclock another at  and a third just before mr gladstone consented to an ad journment of the debate the speeches were not so long as might have been expected few of them exceeding  minutes probably their merit in this respect was due not so much to the desire to save the time of the house by whicb many hon members professed to be aninwated as to the strictness with which the speaker kept spealers to the point vhenever an hon member relapsed into a too dis cursive vein he was sharply brought up by the speaker aud with the example of mr biggar before their eyes whose suspension was t frequently referred to as the  un fortunate event the  melancholy incident and so forth few bon members ventured to incur a second or third re buke from the chair the greatest offender was mr healy wvho vwent so far on one occasion as to recoeive a caution on the whole the debate was singularly de void of incident there was little to relieve the inter minable ow of talk except the frequent calls to order of private members and the rarer intervention of the speaker himself it was dificult at times to avoid the suspicion that underlying the oftrepeated expressions of indignation on the part of the irish members and the impassioned protests of ministerialists there was something like a vein of good humour at all events the springs of indignation were never far removed from those of laughter the weariness which gradually overcame the house as the morning ad vanced was dispelled between  and  oclock by a large influx of new members and from that time forward there was no want of animati or good spirits on either side new arrivals were greeted with hearty cheers which were lavished unreservedly on mr gladstonesir stafford north cote and mr parnell the lastnamed entered the house shortly after mr gladstone having arrived that morning from dublin by the mail he was enthusiastically wel comed by his supporterswho hare appeared to suffer some what from the want of leadership and in return the hon member ccrdially shook hands with those who clustered round him as soon as the mnorning broke the window curtains were drawn but the pale feeble rays which peue trated the fog prevailing out of doors were unable for some hours to comupets with the blaze of artificial light in the roof of the chamber it was  oclock before the gas was extinguished and the depressing effect of the chauge as the house scood revealed in broad day the floor littered with torn paper and the benches occupied by nnrbtrs of hon memters wliose unwashed unkempt appearance showed unmistakably that they had passed the night out of bed had probably something to do vith the adjournment nvhich speedily followed
