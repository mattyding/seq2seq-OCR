yjatest intelligencetutrkey and greeceby tzeraphcfrom our coesrodetpariso wzessday jan   pmthe yellowbook to be issued tomorrow is chiefly interestingasthrowing light on the ques tion of the respective shares takon by england and frahce in the later phases of the greek question thus on the d of april general chanzy reports to m de freycinet a conversation in which prince gortchakoff after explaining that russia was too much concerned on other points to take the initia tive on behalf of greece added  england seems desirous of playing an important ro in this cases for it is she who in the name of the powers is now asking the porte for leave for the commis sion to be appointed to act on her territory general chanzy adds  the new english cabinet will assist in the solution of this question in a clearer and more effective way than has hitherto been done by the cabinet about to be superseded on the th of mlay m de freycinet directs m leon say to press england to take the initiative in ex pediting the delimitation commission inasmuch as the scheme being her own she was bound to bring it to a practical conclusion m say replying on the th says lord granville replied that he shared your opinion and thonght that to effect a speedy meetin viz on the th of junethe powers should select as commissioners the ambassadors resident in the town fixed on subject to adding other technical and special commissioners it seemed to him that paris or berlin might be chosen as the place of meeting i said ou wvere readv to accept any place except constantinople or athens i beg you to let me know whether to tell lord granville you accept paris or berlinm de freycinet replied in the affirmative and on the th of miay he communicated to the french ambassadors the translation of a circular by lord granville received from lord lyons in this circular lord granville said her majestys go vernment had taken into consideration the despatch of the th of april in which lord lyons had informed them that in m de freycinets opinion the delimitation commission if the porte raised difficulties as to its sitting on turkish soil might meet in another country at least for its opening labours the government tbought it would be advantageous in communicating this proposal to the porte to submit the alternative and had conse quently instracted their agents to insert a passage to that effect in the identical and simultaneous note which lord granville in his circular of the th of may had requested them to address to the porte her majestys government thought that berlin or paris would be very suitable as a place of meeting and that a conference might first be beld in which the representatives of the mediating powers should take part assisted by functionaries possessing special knowledge and also that the porte and greece might be asked to lay their re spective sechemes before those representatives it was desirable to fix the date of the conference in case the porte should delay giving a definitive reply and her majestys government wisbed that date to be before the end of june the decision of the conference should beyond doubt be taken by a majority as was arranged for the local delimitation commission and when a decision had been come to a commission might repair to the spot to settle all questions of detail on the th of may m de st vallier writes from berliny esterday lord odo russell made an official communication on the greek affair of which this is the substance lord granville declares that to respond to the desire expressed by the french government to hasten the solution of the question he proposes to the cabinets the despatch to con stantinople of a collective note summoning the porte to carry out protocol  this note would be couched nearly in the terms of the english circular of the th of may in case of the almost certain refusal of the porte a commission of ambassadors will meet at berlin if prince bismarck agrees or at paris if he raises objections to berlin this commission will order a local inquiry by technical delegates after which it will definitively decide it should hold its first meetine before the end of jume prince bismarck assented to this step and replied that the selection of berlin was agreeable to him and seemed naturalon the same day m de freycinet writingto m say en the simultaneous summons to the porte proposed by england sayst as regards the settlement of the greek frontier turkeys dilatoriness in pronouncing on the commission of delimitation scheme com municated to her by the marquis of salisbury does not appear to us a suflicient ground for arresting the action of the mediating powers in the form concerted by them we think as you have already been directed to intimate to the english government that the international meeting proposed by the london cabinet may and should be constituted without waiting for the portes reply to lord gianvilles circularas turkey is not to be called on to share in that meeting at least with a deliberative voice her consent is not necessary for the commission to be constituted and begin its labours    there would he some inconvenience in offering the ottoman porte as an alternative either the despatch of a commission to the spot on turkish territory cr the convoking of a european con ference at berlin or paris the probability is that the sultans ministers would pronounce if tbey had the cboice for the local commission in the hope of gainidg time througb the difficulty of finding a suitable place we tbink therefore it is preferable to leave notking to the judgment of the porte and immediately to constitute the international meeting as i told vou in my reply to the english circular of the th of may as for giving that meeting the form of a conference between the ambassadors of the powers in one of the capitals of europe that is an idea to which we adhere the more willingly because from the outset this way of proceedin has seemed the most advantageous and we were disposed to recommend it onrsees there seems no need moreover to wait till the end of jume to realize such a scheme nor any serious reason for delaying its execution after the conference is formed and when its deliberations are in proper train it will be time enough to seek an agreement with the turkish government both for their submitting to the conference simultaneonslywith the greek govern inenttheir proposals concerning the frontier and for the ulterior despatch to the spot of the technical delegates intrusted with putting into execution the frontier adoptedon the th of may m say writes to m de freycinet i have communicated to lord granville your yesterdays despatch replying to his circular of the th and i urged that the meeting of the ibelimitation comnmission should be held without awaiting the portes reply lord granville replied that he was as anxious for despateh as we but he desired to show all necessary forbearance to theporte which moreover would have to pronomnce without delay germany however suggests that the porte should bave the option of forming part of the meeting or not on condition if it does form part of pledging itself to submit to the majority i remarked that if the porte formed part of the meeting greece would bave to be admitted but lord granville thnks the posi tion of the two powers very different seeing that the one has to cede and the other to acquireon the th of may m de freycinet writes to  de montebello at londonas to the german suggestion respecting the atdlission of tuikey to the conference of mediating fowers it is contrary to what had been hitherto areed to betwueen the cabinets unless greece be treated lust in the same way whatever the ad vantage of oinding the porte beforehand to the erdict of the muajority we cannot admit that the two interested narties shonld not be placed exactlyon the same footing an inequality between them would produce the worst effect would destroy the authority of our mediation and would be calcu isted to cause the powers selious embarrassmentshere it should be observed that germany on the st of may expressed an opinion that mediation excluded the presence of the interested parties and afoitiori of one of them for turkey could not be both judge and party in her own case but turkish and greek delegates might be at hand to give the commission any information it solicited austria likewise made it a condition that the disputants should be excluded on the sanme date m de montebello reported a russian suggestion that the conference on greece should settle all the pending eastern questions lord granville had not yet replied but thought of refusing not liking to give this special conference the character of a con gress but he thought that if the conference solved the greek question it might then be directed to settle tbe other on the st of may m de monte bello reported the definite proposal by england of a conference of ambassadors assisted by special delegates for technical questions and vithout the participation of turkey or greece and on the th germany agreed with england in substituting for the alternative to be submitted to the porte the proposal pureand simple of a conference of a n bassadors on the same date al de st v slier writes to m de freycinetlord odo russell informs me that on the ob servations of the paris cabinet the english go vernment have abandoned their proposal of the alternative to offer to the porteand that they have accepted a french proposal consisting in simply acquainting the ottoman government with the immediate meeting of a conference of ambassadors ecarged with deciding on the question of the greek frontier lord odo russell having received in structions to commend this proposal to the german government has spoken of it to prince tlohenlohe who replied that he had not cognizance of it but was ready to second any proposal emanating from the french government on the greek question i promised lord odo russell to inform bim when i received instructions to make to the german go vernment the overture which according to him i am to make and wbich he will bave to support i added that i had not hitherto had to take the initiative of any proposal our rdle having been confined to accelerating the solution of the greek affair by adhering to the english seheme of a conference and by recommending the london cabinet to promote its meeting without awaiting a reply from the porteon the th hi luon say writes to m de frey cinet lord granville abides definitively by the idea of a conference pure and simple at berlin  there is no longer question of an alternative and if turkey does not present herself to furnish explana tions the tbing will go on all the same it is pro posed that the meeting should take place before the end of june it seems impossible to stipulate fora fixed date earlier the english minister asked me what were your intentions as to the frontier i replied that you woould act in concert with the british government and that while striving to give satisfaction to lreek feelings you had no in tention of taldng what might be called the lead of the movement lord granville then said that the first point was settledviz that the two govern ments desired to be in agreement he wished to give satisfaction to the feelings of the greeks but it seemed to him very important that the frontier should be sketched out in such a manner as would render it easy for greece to take possession ofthe districts to be mado over to her he seomed to me disposed to go as far in favour of the greeks as was practicableon the th of may m de freycinet forwarded to m say a copy of the instructions to mr goschen it is to this effect as regards the ques tion of the rectification of the greek frontiers the queens government bad come to an agreement with the other powers on the following points viz that the delay of the porte in replying to lord salisburys proposal must be regarded as a refusal and that consequently seeing that it was desirable both in the interest of turkey and of greece to effect a speedy settlement of the ques tion the ambassadors declare to the porte that the powers proposed the meeting at berlin of a con ference of the representatives of the mediating powers assisted by officers possessing technical knowledgea meeting which should be held so as to commence its effective labours before the end of june and which should be charged to study and determine by a majority of votes the line of frontier it was desirable to adopt  and that tho governments of turkey and greece should be in vited to send delegates to support before the con ference the arguments of their respective govern ments lvhen a decision had been adopted by the conference a commission should proceed to the spot to settle questions of detailm de freycinet on the d of june writes to count daubigny c harge daffaires at st peters burg the ambassador of england has communicated to me on the part of his government tho scheme of instructions destined for the new representative of great britain at constantinople and relative to the conferenee of ambassadors for the settlement of the greek question we fully approve its terms and i am sending to m tissot similar in structions lord granvilles scheme as it was when he made me acquainted with it on tho st of may contained in the first place a passage in which he said turkey and greece would be invited to send delegates to uphold before the conference the arguments of their respective governments wec have thought that instead ot specially inviting the interested parties to submit observations to the conference it would be preferable to wait till they themselves testified the desire to be heard the germlan government had some days before in eormed us that their opinion was similarto oursand prince orloff communicated to me yesterday a telegram from m de giers consenting to the sup pression of the passage relative to the turkish and greek delegates these observations have led the london cabinet to modify its original text lord lyons informs me that lord granville has purely and simply removed from the scheme the sentence which gave rise to our objections i take ad vantage of the present courier to acknowledge the receipt of your report on the russian scheme con ierning the extension of the attributes of the con eerence prince orloff had not laid before me the proposal of his government i knew that germany and austria had not shown themselves favourable to it the austrohungarian cabinet according to count beust has even been assured that russia renounces the idea of extending the powers of the conference this news is confirmed today by m de st vallier it is therefore an understood thing that the powers at the conference are ex clnsively to exercise the mediation which will have devolved on them by virtue of clause  of the treaty of berlin when that mission has been accomplished it will be time for the powers if they deem it desirable to pursue certain delibera tionsand to adopt thereupon such resolutions asappear to themn opportunem de freycinet sends on the th of june the following despatch to m de st vallier accord may be considered as definitely esta blished between england and us on the subject of the line to be proposed at the conference at berlin for the new turcogreek frontier general sim mons has arrived in paris provided with precise instructions from lord granvlle and he was in aposition to make kaown to me in the presence of or lyons who brought him to me the definitive views of the queens government already in london in several interviews between the technical delegate of england and captain de la ferronnays a satisfactory understanding had been slketched m de la ferronnays whom i havesummoned to paris and whom i fixed upon to accompany colonel perrier to berlin was with th e latter presenat tmy interview with lord lyons and general simmons after some explanations we drew up with the aid of the map of the austrian staff a definition of the frontier which we agreed to regard as that to be recommended by the mediatory powers to the two interested paities this line follows from the adriatic the course of the kalamas up to the sources of that river then the watershed from the pindus rocks to theolympus rocks descending from the vid of the latter to the egean sea the vast and fertile plain of thessaly comprised in the basin of the peneas aud its numerous affluents is thus made over entirely to greece with the secondary basins of a few streams which descending from the southern slopes of olympus flow direct to the sea but in reaity belong to the same topographical system as the affluents of the peneus my instructions have already authorized you to take as vou were soli cited the initiative of the proposal for the rectifi catior of the turcogreek front ers on the meeting of the conference of the mediatory powers i think it advisable that you concert befrehand with your colleagues to that effect there is reason to believe that the work devolving on the meeting of the ambassadors at berlin wiu be neither compli cated nor long the summnary description of the new frontier may be embodied in a few lines which will lead to no ambiguity if the scheme dravwn up in concert with kngland is adopted seeing that according to tbese data it will be necessary to follow on the one hand the course of a river and on the other the lines of the chasms which shed the waters among a certain number of basins localized some to the north others to the south of the heighton the th of june gormany issued the insita tions to the ambassadors to the conference for the purpose of exercising the mediation provided for in the treaty of berlin on the th of june m duchatel reports baron elaymerles favourable view of the frontier recommended by france and england but addshe is anxious however to know how the decision arrived at by the conference will be carried out and asked me whether the french go vernment had any views on that point on convers ing with my english and russian collearues i noticed in them the same anxiety it is to be pre sumed indeedl that turkey will resort to all direct or indirect means of proventing the territorial ag grandisement of greecetowards the end of june france dissuaded greece from pressing for an extension of territory on the coast opposite corfu up to butrinto and she agreed with germany in deprecating a reply to the portes answer to the identical t ote an ex change of notes with turkey during the conference being undesirable thereupon lord granville abandoned his contemplated reply on the th of june al de montelello reported lord gran villes concurrence with france as to the note to be presented by the powers to turkey and greece viz that it should contain simply the notifica tion of the decision of the conference  aveclinvit tion  chacune des puissances interessdes davoir at sy conformer on the th of july the french agent at athens acknowledged m de freycinets announcement that the republican government had obtained at berlin a european verdict in favour of greece and he described the satisfaction of the greeks mingled with forebodings of loeal resistance to the annexation covertly encouraged by the porte then follow the attempts of the powers to dissuade greece frcm calling out the reserves and on the th of august m de ereycine t informs m challemellacour of his declining englands request that france should take the same initiative in the note to the porte on greece as england had taken as to mfontenegro mr de freycinet told mr adams that after the berlin conference french initiative had ceased the con cert of the powers taking its place  that france had no more reason for special action for greece than russia would have for armenia  and that all these questions should remain with england whose initiative was aecepted by all europe the yellowbook winds up with the despatch on the arbitration scheme ef which you give an outline to dayvienna jan the idea of ondeavouring to ascertain the extent of the concessions svhich turkey might be disposed to make before replying definitively to the turkish proposal of the th inst appears to have been after all adopted andinstructions are said to have been sent to the ambassadors in constantinople by their respective governments to sound the porte in this direction and to impress upon it the neces sity of going to the utmost limits such an action if carried into effect by the representatives of the powers singly would seem to promise a better result than any official sumnons would have had as it is devoid of all semblance of pressure and is therefore more likely to secure a more unreserved enunciation on the part of turkey the informa tion thus gained may be of some moment in framing the final resolution of the powers but owing to the form chosen for its acquisition it cau in no way prejudice this decision as might have been the case with an official summons although it would be too much to expect that these preli minary soundings will be so successful that a fair compromise as to the frontier line may be arrived at still a basis may be formed for further negotia tions as far as the pourparlers in this respect have gone there seems to be a disposition to make as little use as possible of any formal diplomatic apparatus and as for anytbing like a regular con ference which after all does not appear to have been the intention of the porte it seems as yet not even to bave formed the subject of the negotia tions all this looks as if the powers had arrived at the conviction that the question of form was en tirely of secondary importance and that the real problem to be solved was to find a compromise as to the future frontier line in this respect the first step would be an understanding more or less among the powers themselves and it appears that efforts are being made in this direction and that germany above all is exerting herself in finding such a compromisewith regard to greece despite tha alarming news which has been sent out from athens it is not believed bere that there is any imminent danger of an immediate rupture or that greece will remain deaf to the warnings of united europe the correspomdencs de peth publishes the text of a note addressod by the greek mlinisterpresident to count mouy on the th of january this note acknowledges the receipt of the despatch of thefrench minister for foreign affairs and expresses  the great surprise caused in greece by the circular of the th of december how can it be it is asked that the illustrious ohief of the french foreign ofice should see in the th article of the treaty of berlin and the formal decisions of the conference but simple advice to tarkey how after these solemn acts can the french blinister upbold that the territories awarded to greece are still the property of turkey i it is probably the first time that a european great power has recognized the legitimate right of turkey to hereuropean possessionis this is quite a new theory for in the name of eternal justice there must be strong opposition to tbefour centuries of usurpation whinh could never have the charmter of rightful occupation has any one ever thought that the other awards of territory made in berlin were not obligatory for turkey  why then the difference about epirus and thessaly  this is the only reward to greece for not having given in  the coup de grdre to the ottoman empire in the consciousness of her right confirmed by europe enthusiastic greece will not reckon with the possi bility of a defeat and if this defeat should follow it is a question whether the emancipated peoples on thebalkan peninsula will remain passive specta tors no less peaeeful than the greeks and less confident in the juatice of the powers they will with greece unfold the standard of liberty these are the considerations which the french nzote has suggested to the hellenic governmeent they will be worthy the subject of a note to the powers in the meantime the note expresses the hope that the french government will remain faithful to itstraditions it will remember what a great errorit committed when it forsook a policy of justice with regard to the snmall state of denmark that was an error whicb the illustrious thiers the first president of the republic ccasidered as the siart ingpoint of the misfortunes which have befallen france the note to the powers mentioned in this reply of couraoundouros does not appear to have been sent off at any rate it has not been presented here so possibly the idea has been given upconstanitnople jar the native press has no confidence in thesuccess of the greek frontier negotiations and urges the government to accelerate the solution of the ques tion by preparing energetically for an armed con flict at the same time it daily reads lectures to the albanians on the folly and wickedness of their creating difficulties for the government and there by aiding the enemies of the empire tinfor tunately it gives us no information concerning the nature and extent of the albanian insurrectionary movement there is no doubt however that the insurrection or whatever else it mav be calied is causing great anxiety both at the porte and at the palace hitherto it has been confined to the valley of the vardar and adjacent districts but fears are entertained that it may extend to the tribes in the sandjak of scutari which lately resisted the exe cution of the april convention and objected to the cession of dulcigno if these fears should be realized the government will be in a very difficult position and will be conmpelled to adopt a con ciliatory attitude in the greek question the tosirs or southern albanians who are chiefly in terested in that question are known to be in comi munication with the northern section of thq league but nothing has yet transpired regarding their relations with the insurrectionary movement
