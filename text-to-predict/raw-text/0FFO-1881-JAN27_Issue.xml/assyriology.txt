assybiologyeight years have now elapsed since the world ot science was startled by the brilliant discovery made by mr george smith of a chaldean legend of the flood which presented a remarkable agree ment to the scripture account  this discovery followed as it was soon after by the recovery of the cosmogonic legends of the priests of babylonia awakened a new interest in the work of the small band of assyriologists few works were more anxiously expected than that in which mr smith was to lav before the world the result of his study of the newly recovered legends and his chal dean account of genesis which was published shortly before his departure for the east was eagerly read by all students it was a book to which as professor sayce states in his preface to this new edition  all those who had a theory to support ora tradition to overthrow turned eagerly and which possessed an equal interest for tbe students of history of religionandof science im portant as this last contribution of mr smith was to almost every branch of oriental research few works ever appeared under more unfavourable circumstances written on the eve of his depar ture and therefore hurried in its composition and dealing with an entirely new class of inscrip tions having a vocabulary and literature of therown the translations then furnished by the discoverer were naturally of a very tentative character and failed in many respects to bring out the trae meaning and importance of the in scriptions the five years which have elapsed since the publication of the first edition of this work have seen a great advance in the study of assyriology both in england and on the con tinent fresh students have joined the ranks and au have laboured assiduously to open up the rich mine first pierced by mr smith many of the texts obscure and doubtful at the time of mr smiths death are now by critical study rendered almost as clear as a page of the hebrew scriptures in the new edition of the  chaldean genesis now issued after revision at the hands of professor sayco the orientalist will have a work quite up to the present standard of assyrian research and one which will take its place in the bibliography of comparative mythology and religions develop mentin this new edition we notice many important alterations and revisions of translations especially in that important series of legends forming the babylonian epic poem of  ldubar the hero in these legends we find an early and oriental version of the greek nmyths woven round the story of fjercules and the student of comparative myth ologywill find a rich harvest of matter in the inscriptions the legends of persephone circe vjenus and adonis as well as the story of the firestealing prometheus have now their babylonian versions added and we may certaiinly consider that a new and earlier cbapter has been added to comparative mythology to the student of the bible the legends of the creation and the deluge and the numerous parallel passages in the inscriptions wiiu be of great value and will render much help in the elucidation of many of the hitherto obscure incidents recorded the close similarity of tho phraseology of the inscriptions to that employed in the bible in many cases shows that not only the traditions recorded in these tablets but also the similes and phrases were the common property of the semitic racetho above work deals entirely with the inscrip tions of the extensive class of religious and myth ological documents  but the more practical and less fascinating historical texts do not lack students and exponents the late mr george smith inhis histories of sennacherib and assurbanipal fur nished two valuablo volumes to thc series of his tories derived from the contemporaneous records of assyrien kings and small volume now issued with the other works contained in the  oriental series  published by messrs trtibner and co forms a connecting link between the above works the volume which mr budge has just completed contains translations of most of the important documents relating to the reign of esarhaddon son of sennacherib whose reign of  years bc  was one of great importance in the historyi smitb

the history of assyria are more wufortonately placed than thae of esarbaddon in that the most important events and those of most universal interest are the open ing snd concluding chapters in the

only the closing incidents of the great battle in north mesopotania the account of the war in egypt wvhich led to the overthrow of the ethiopian dynasty and the establishment of the  satrapie under the court of assyria can only as yet be gained from references in the inscriptions of the kidgs victorious son assurbanipal the contem poraneous annals of the period being probably in the later palace buried beneath the lebby yunus mound in the volume now before us we find full details of inany of the wars which the king waged during his reign in the north he forces back the incursion of the

lists of the kings of egypt syria arabia and cyprus who paid tribute to the great king affords us an insight into the political state of western asia in the seventh century before the christian era and indicates very clearly the great power of the court of nineveb the list of the rulers of the provinces of the island of cyprus is most valuable and the careful and revised copy from a new fragment
