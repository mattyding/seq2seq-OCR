befor te rncorder iadolphus salita a welldressed goodlooking lad rurrnn dered to take his trial upon an indictment charging him with the manslaughter jf robart woodruff by striking him un lawfully with his fistdr platt prosecuted and mir ballantine defende the prisonerthe circumstances of this case were of rather nn unusual character and the facts were involved in coneiderable obscu rity it appeared that the deceased was a lad about the samn age as tho prisoner and he was in the service of a tradesman at camberwell he came home from his masteres on the th of september and complained that on his way he had been struck on the head by a boy but did not mention his name and he pointed tobehind hisear where there appeared to ba a lump the size of a nut which he said was the consequence of the blow be had received from this time the deceasedbecame graduallyin a very dangerous state and about a fortnight after the day mentioed he for the first time said that the prisoner was the boy wsho had struck him he continued to sink and shortly before his death mr norton the magistrate of the police court at lam beth attended upon him for the purpose of takiig his deposition and then in the presence of the pri aoner tho deceased boy said that as he was going along the road to cambervell the prisoner without any provocation or quarreuing and indeed without a word being said came up to him and struck him a blow behind the ear and then rax away the deceased lingered from the h of september until the th of october when he died and according to the evidence of two medical gentlemen named cox and flower the death was attributabte to some extent to the blow received upon the head but at the same time it was stated that the deceased was in a very uuhealthy sondition and the immediate cause of dissolution appeared to be dysentery and fever when the prisoner was appre hended he denied most positively having struck the deceaed urging that he had never auny quarrel or dispute with him and therefore could have had no inducement to do so and he repated the statement when he was before the ma gistratedr barrantine at the close of the case for the prosecu tion inquired of the recorder it he thought there was suffi cient evidence to go tothe jury the reoortmp said it appeared to him that there was very great doubt in the case in the first place the death was by no means satisfactorily shown to have been the re sult of the blow and even if that had been proved the evi dence did not at au prove that it was the hand of the pri ower which inflicted that blow but on the contrary that point was left in great doubtfr ballntine said that the only evidence upon that sabject was tho deposition of the deceased when in a dying condition but it was very extraordinary if he really knew who it was that struck him that he should have told his aunt that he had been struck by a boy and thac he did not mention the name of the prisoner until a considerable time afterwardsthe reconrdn thought it was highly probable that his miind was wandering at the time and that knowing the pri soner he mentionel him as the boy who had struck bim it appeared to him that there was so much doubt in the case tbatthe jury would not convict and therefore he should relieve the learned counsel for the prisoner from addressing themthe jury said they entirely concurred in the observations of his lordship and they at once returned a verdict of notbefore the prisoner left the bar he again asserted that bs never struck the deceased and the recorder told him tbat the jury had acquitted himu and he would leave the court without the slightest stain up m his characterthe prisoner was then given up to his friendsfrancis shew  andcqatherine shea  his wife were indicted for cutting and

defended by mr cooke evansfrom the evidence adduced it appeared that the prisoners are irish people and they occupied a room in the house of the husbanud or the prosecutrix in georgecourt snow hilt they were in arrear of several weeks rent and the owners of the house were anxious to get rid of them but according to their statement the prisoners would neither pay their rent nor go and in fact set them at defiance on the th of september a broker was employed to put in a distress but the door of the prisoners room was fastened and he could not obtain admis eion and went away leaving his warrant in the bands of the prosecutrix in the course of the same day the female pri soner came dorn and told the prosecutrix to go up to their room and her husband would pay her the prosecutrix ac cordingly went upstairs and the moment she entered the room she was attacked by both the prisoners and knocked down and the male prisoner kielt upon her white his wife kicked her she at length got up when both the prisoners repeated their violence and struck her on the head with a shoemakers hammer both of the prisoners having a weapon of that description her screama for assistance brought up her husband but directly he got into the room the female prisoner felled him to the ground by a blow of a hammer which instantly rendered him ineensible and while he was in that state both the prisoners commenced kicking him the prosecutril was then enabled to get to the window which she threw up and screamed  murder  the female prisoner immediately went to her and after throwing some garden pots upon the people who had assembled in the street she renewed her attacic upon the prosecutrix and struck her again with the hammer while this was goisg on the male prisoner commenced nailing up the door exclaiming while he was doing so  death or glorywe are sure to be hung and we will kill every one who comes in and the female prisoner joined in the exclamation the polico arrived in i short time but they were compelled to break open the door before they could obtaiu admission and when they did so a most dreadful sight presented itself the prosecutrix and her husband being covered with wounds and blood and the room according to the evidence of oneof them looking more like a slaughterhouse than a human i habitation the hammers with which the injuries had been inflicted were produced and they appeared to be completely covered with blood the prosecutrix was in the hospital for a fortnight and shewas an outpatient to the present time and was still suifering from the injuries she reseived on the occasionthe jury found both the prisoners guilty upon that count of the indictment which charged the intention to do some grievous bodily harmthe recorder in passing sentence said that the pri soners had been convicted of feloniously wounding the prosecutrix with intent to do her some grievous bodily harm and every one who had heard the circumstances of the case must see that they were of euch a character as ren dered it impossible for the coutt to refrain from passing a severo sentence upon persons convicted of such an offence as anu eample to others persons of their country wvere un happily too ready to resort to such proceedings and it was high time that they aud all others should be taught that such atrocieus acts could not be peroetrated in a civilized couatry without
