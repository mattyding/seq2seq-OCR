the punjaubhaving given particulars of iooltan affairs under a sopa rate head sikh matters elsewhere are so mixed up to gether that one division will suffice for them the state of the punjaub throughout is at present most unsatisfictory though to us it appears that the alarms regarding it are greatly in excess of the occasion commencing with the extreme northwest corner of the country we take up the notice of affairs in the peshawar and hazareh pro vinces in the latter of these a mutiny occurred some weeks back amongst the sikh attillery by whom their commanding officer was wounded for a time this was thought lightly of when it turned out that the malcontents were headed by chuttur singh a sikh nobleman of distinc tion and governor of the province and as it was feared countenanced or encouraged by gholab singh the maha rajah of jamoo and cashmere the britieh officers in the province at the time of the outbreak were captain abbott mr ingram and lieut enanttobinson

the loyaltyof the other twothirds is some what questionable when the hazareh troubles began the fidelity of the garrison at attok seemed somewhat dubious and a detachment of  trustwuorthy mahomedans was sent to reinforce it it now contains  affghans whose faithfulness may be entirely depended on chuttur singh having managed to collect airound him some  of the country people in addition to the

determined de tachment immediately procesded to his rliief ee was afterwards joined by lieutenant herbrt with sorne addi tional men chuttur singh was at this time  miles from attok advancing in full expectation of gaining andmission into the fort finding attok provisioned for three months and maintained by above  sturdy affghans he paused to deliberate what he should do nextwhen lienterant nicolson resolved to quit the fortress and proceed to join the levies  miles off that had formerly attended him it was now the turn of the insurgents to retire and they fell back accordingly to rawul pindee on the th of sep tember lieutenant nicolson determined to attack the de tachment of insurgents posted in the miargtlua pass with a view of occupying the attention of the rebels and preventing them from assisting the troops in the hazareh country where an insurgent brigade was blockaded by captain abbot and his levies he did not succeed in obtaining possession of the hold which commands the pass but after a severe struggle in which he himself was wounded was able to take up such a position as completely to interrupt the movements of the enemy two sikh regiments were now despatched at our desire by gholab singh to attackthe insurgents instead of this they are reported to have gone over and joined them a strong force was on the d of september moved from the juuun dhur doab into the iazareh country consisting of her ma jestys st foot a wing of the th regular and the d ir regular cavalry the d troop st brigade horse and th company th brigade foot artillery and the d and d native infantryabove  in all we have not as yet had time to hear further of their proceedings returning to peshawur we find that on the th of september major lawreiice was informed that the ceidency was to be at tacked by the sikh regiments at that stationlin the course of the night having set spies in the camp it was conal dered prudent from what was observed by them to secure all the artillery over one party companies of trustworthy infantry were placed the mahomedan cora mander of the other gave his men to understand that the first sign of misconduct he saw amongst them he would ealute them with a few rounds of grape the assurance proved sufficient to keep them at peace beyond this nothing has occurred at pbshawur to occasion annoy ance though there is little doubt but that the sikh part of the garrison are watching with intense anxiety the suc cess of the insurgents and that they are ready to turn on us so soon as the auspicious moment arrives we must at present while taking all the care we can employ to protect ourselves watch them for so soon as our success becomes known and our poweronce more shows itself irre sistible our doubtful friends will endeavour to veil all their treason on the mountain frontier of the doab to the northwest of jullundhur the chief of noorpore began to take the opportunity of giving us annoyance ram singh son of the vizier of the noorpore rajah having been somewhat summarily removed from office by the commis sioner betook himself to the hills and collected around him a band of freebooters who began immediately to plunder and assail all around them a strong force consisting of four companies of the nst one company of the th  men of hodgesons sikh corps with strong parties of the th and th irregulars and  of the bill sihh regiment were sent against him on the evening of the th of sep tember they arrived ia camp outside noorpore the llsar gent force was encamped on a low spur covered with thick jungle surrounded on three sides by the dry bed of a rive it was accessible only by rude paths traversabla by one man at a time on the fourth side it was connected with the hills by a narrow ridge of jungly broken ground with thick coppice and brushwoodoneitherside the attackwaslanaedby major fisher and most gallantly carried out by the troopa parties forced their way up the steep on all sides and met on its summit the insrrgents were met in with they fought with the utmost courage and coolness loading and firing as they retired they wvere completely routed and defeated leaving out of  between  and  killed and wounded behind them fifteen prisoners were taken the leader escaped we had one man killed and eight or ten wounded the news of the defection of shere singh on the th reached lahore on the th and though it might have been supposed that the chiefs at the capital were corresponding with the malcontents in the provinces up to that date everything was quiet and peaceful about  oclock at night just after the iuomenel tidings reached the residency orders were sent to her majestys d foot to hold themselves in readiness they occupied the huzooree bagha gardea connected vita the palace by a vaulted entrance long since blocked up the passage was immediately opened up and a durbar assembled in the citadel it sat from  till  in the morning of the th during all which time the entranca to the citadel was guarded by our troops all the commanders of regiments were in attendance ready to receive instrua tions at the quartermastergenerals till the meeting was over the troops were ordered not to quit their lines the sirdar gholab singh son of the insurgent chuttur singh and brother of the traitor shere singh was arrested ia the durbar and all his papers seized the maharajah dhulleep singh had been betrothed to his sister and gholab had inconsequence au intiaential post in the palace it had been said some time before that in consequenco of the appearance of a planet english influence was nearly over in the punjaub and the familythree members of which have not been namedproposed to carry off the young maha rajah expel ue and reseat him without trammels on the throne four other arrests took place during the th european sentries being placed over the arrested parties the impression had gone forth that the maharajah had actually been made away with and to counteract this hs highness took a ride in public in the evening near the large sikh city of umritzir stands the strong fortress of govindghura palace a fortress and a prison the faith fulness of the garrison of this stronghold having become doubtful it was resolved to occupy it with lbritish troops and accordingly a regiment of infantry and skinners irregular horse were despatched to capture it a party of  of the guide corps first obtained admission on pre tence of escorting prisoners the cavalry followed when the garrison were made aware that their services wero no longer required govindghur is now com manded by colonel msheery the cavalry have left the infantry remain behind it will be seen on taking a summary viewv of the whole that mooltan is the only ouarter where the enemy has as yet appeared in force or threatened to make head againse us the maharajah of jamoo thouh suspected has not been convicted of treason and all the evidence of his guilt we as yet appear to possess is founded ox the presumption a life of treachery affords that when traitors are in the feld he will soon be found in the midst of them he is at present in the province of cashmere the report that chuttur singh has a force of  men attendant on him seems so monstrously improbable as to be unworthy of belief even of those wno followed shere singh into the camp of the enemy a balf at least seem to repent of what they have done and to be desirous to return our omn gross mis management it has been that has tempted the sikhs to treason in all likelihood none of al this would have hap pened had colonel lawrence been here
