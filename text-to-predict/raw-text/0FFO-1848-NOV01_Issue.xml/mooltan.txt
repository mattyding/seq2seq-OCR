fired on them and then retired was stationed the troops now drew up in line tlhe dowan hearing the firiug made immediate arrangements to rein force the outposts and sent orders to them to maintain their ground as long as possiblo some sharp skirmishing appears to have ensued when tho mooltanees were driven back at au points and obliged to seek shelter in a ravine close to the town the

number of guns were brought to bear on them the practice was beautiful and the shot fell close beside them one struck the temple another struck the wau under the feet of dr thorp of the irregular horse and passed just over the head of the general another fell amongst the sappers but luckily did no harm major na pier ascended the minaret and had a fine view of au the works and of the ground immediately around the fire becoaning disagroeable the party returned by a detour some  yards from the ramparts the guns firing on them au the way the distance being such thtt the shot nearly au feu short it was now apparent that the place was much stronger than has been imagined the fort is about a mile the city two miles in circumference the former is aurrounded by a ditch  feet wide at bottom and the defences are regularly constructed tne wall of the own joins that of the fort the approaches are difficult in consequence of the groves of large trees the enclosed gardens and mounds formed by old brickkilns which everywhere abound the latter furnished exceuent positions for the guns of the defenders and will probably require to be taken in detail the number of watercourses cutting the country in all directions was incrediblescarcely could a rider stir without faling in with some of them in dicating the extreme care bestowed on cultivatioa and the great capabilities of the country it was free of marsh and mostly well adapted for encamping ground at this date headquarters were about two miles from the east corner of the fortress edwardes lake and the bahawulpore troops about

on the morning of the th the siege traia arrived and took up its positioa in the open space reserved for it it consisted of  pieces of heavy ordnance it was accompanied by an escort of the th

had been placed from which the enemy used to fire on our pickets so soon as daylight allowed them the a threw out its skirmishers and the artillery got into a position weu sheltered from the guns both of the fort and city after some sharp firing in which the rifles played a conspicuous part theenemy at least five times as numerous as their assailants were driven from their position they took shelter in a village right under the guns of the city and fort from this they were quickly driven at tho bayonets point by our troopsnor did they slacken their speed tiul fairly within the town the dewan continued to play his guns unceas ingly from the walls the shots passed over the heads of the parties for whom they were intended and came rolling down towards the camp the sappers and miners

directed that the moment a man showed himself he was sure to be hit it afterwards appeared that they had here strongly en trenched themselves and as soon as night drew on and the european soldiers of the th began to excavate a new parauel a furious and deadly fire was opened upon them this they immediately returred but with smatl effect in consequence of the denseness of the thicket and the shelter around the officer commanding in the trenches at length attacked the garden and village from which the enemy were annoying us some companies of the d here joined in the fray and at first the enemy were driven out of their cover the post in the garden was a strong one in the village one large house fuu of men was loopholed and though the donr was forced by lieutenant richardson the troops failed to effect an entrance so hot meanwhile was the fire of the enemy that the european soldiers were compelled to seek shelter and ultimately to retire the enemy pressed on them until they had fauen back on the entrenchments they then moved off in line to reoccupy the garden from which they had at first been driven the fire was not it is said surpassed in fury at moodkee or abraon out of

of the d all night long the enemy continued to cannonade them but luckily without doing much mischief at day break on the th some guns were got into position and a tremendous discharge of round shot grape and shrapnell was maintained for three hoursto all appearance how ever without effect the enemy were well protected from danger and seemed not to suffer from alarm in the course of the forenoon a battery was goc advanced to within a very short distance of the post and a heavy fire recommenced but without better results than that which had preceded during the whole of the th a virtutl armistice was maintained on both sides but the insurgents were now aware of the strength and importance of theirposition and of the effect of night attack upon us and began to establish a regular battery in the garden aa order was now issued by general whish directing an attack to be made on them about  oclock on the morning of the th the attacking force to consist of a troop of horse

regular approaches in less than a week about  oclock in the morning of the th a furi ous attack was made on edwardes amnp fortunately with out effect on the th the british troops carried the hummund ghurree or outwork having previously occu pied a position cose beside it from this new post the batteries were supposed likely to be able to fire into the fort and town without impediment and everything now seemed drawing to an auspicious close it was hoped that breaching might be begun almost at once and considering that we were withih almost point blank distance of the wals it was supposed that in  or  hours at the outside the assault might be commencedwhen a sadden act of treachery on the part of our alhies blighted au our prospects and compeled us to raise the siege and convert the be sieging army into one of observation it has been repeatedly stated that shore singh a sikh officer and nobleman of dis tinction was despatched early in may by the durbar with a force of  men with a view it was said of keeping the moolraj in check we know little of his proceedingsuntil we find him in company with colonel cortlandt and lieutenant edwardos before mooltan it does not appear that he took any active share in military operations and his fidelity was said to be held more than questionable early in july his father chuttur singh governor in the hazareh province at the other extremity of the punjaub headed an insurrection still in progress and said to have been pro moted with a view of taking advantage of the absence of our troops from lahore about t oclock on the morning of the th information was brought to lieutenant edwardes that the rajah shere singh had gone over to the enemy taking with him above  sikhs with  guns and howitzers and  of the lighter pieces called zumboorucks the movement appeared to have taken both parties equally by surprise latterlywe had in some measure ceased to sus pect and so dubious was the dewvan of the trustworthi ness of his new allies that he for a time assigned them quarters beyond the walls but under the batteries of the town with so formidable a defection from our strength so largo an accession to that of the enemyit be carae at once obvious that it would be imnprudent for the presont to continue the siege we had already seen vith what desperation our opponents were deter mnined to resist us and with  added to their numberemen bvlgpqing to tho ol siklk iry vi wlhosuch are the bitter fruits of vacillation and hesitation i while we were debating onthe size of the army to be sent and tho most fitting time for sending themcalculating how much cost or inconvenience might be incurred or probable sickness occasioned by a march one month compared with that by another we were tempting traitkrs into the field and holding out a bribe for insurrection a strong brigade half the size of the army of observation under general whish would if despatched in may have settled the matter in a weeks time by delay and vacillation a chance explo sion of anger and haphazard attack accompanied bymurder where the deed was hardly done when the actorswere horror strnck at their position has waxed into a widelyramified and deep rooted treasonfast rooted to the spot whence it sprung and extending itself throughout every part of the sikh dominions the saughter that may now be looked for as the denognieat is tremendous we have to contend with brave highly disciplined and perfectly desperate men fighting under the joint influence of religious zeal and the knowledge thattheir lives are forfeited we cati under such circumstances neither expect nor exhibit mercyon both sides it must be war to the knifeand after the victory if ours our artiuery inust complete the carnage which other wise would devolve on the bands of the executionerknew that now they fought with haiters round their neck and could not even look for quarterit was vain to proceed until reinforcements arrived general whish therefore had bis camp removed to v safe distanco from their batteriea while the gun and all the working parties were called in and our force was transformed into an army of observation occupying a fortified camp our rear was annoyed but not much damaged by tho enemy we had been but a short time in our new position when it became evident that wo should find ourselves much more agreeably situated a considerable way further from the town we accordingly once more decamped and on the lth took up a podt  miles from mooltan in tho direction of bahawvulpore particulars of is movement have not hitherto reached us farther than thisthat the material prepared for the siege a large quantity of ammunitien and a months supply of biscuits had fallen into the hands of the enemy animadversions on the atrangements of general wyhish are very severe we are said to have per mitted the enemy to strengthen himself at every point most strongly and elaborately in the suburbs and then to have proceeded as if there were no obstruction in our way a considerable portion of the troops which went over with shere singh seem disposed to quit miooltan with as little delay as possiblethe moenint the tidings of this unfortunate affair reached headquarters preparations began to be made to rein force tho besieging army the bombay government was written to by express and orders immediately issued for assembling an army of  men at roree under command of brigadier dundas of her maestys rifles of these  are europeans it is not likely they will be required to domore than perform the duties of an army of reserve or observationperhaps they may afterwards be caued on to occupy the city after the siege is over should the bengal troops be needed eleewhere they can hardly reach mooltan before christmas and if the town is not ours early in november it fill be strange indeed at ferozopore there are about  at lahore about  men and these wiu be reinforced immediately to  and  respectively the siege train from suklckur is said to have been ordered up this in addition to  pieces of hoavy and asmany of light ordnance now in camp will make the artiuery arm of the force very powerful indeed a force of  men of which details have not as yet been supplied is meanwhile being formed on the lahore side under the command of general gilbert and this will without loss of time move on mooltan so that the army before the place will shortly be as strong as that which fought at moodkee or that with which in april  general pollocl forced his way to cabul the dellhi acette states that the army to be formed at ferozepore will consist of five european regiments  witlh  corps of native infantry say  each  and six regiments of cavalry  nine troops of horse artilery and five field batteries in all above  men whether this includes the force now at fe rozepore or whether the whole is meant for service does not appear it certainly is a strange display of tactics to send  men to take a town which on the desertion of a de tachment whose faithfulness from the first was doubtful re quires a reinforcement of  our latest news from mlool tan is brought bysteamer aad comes dovwn to the th this is two days later than that received by the delhi route the in tercourse in this direction appearing for the present to ba in terrupted at present the accounts which reach us from many quarters bear the impress of such excessive exagge ration that we are compeued very carefully to sift them omitting au that seema improbable or transparently untrue we think the correctness of the greater part of what has been stated may be relied upon we muat caution the european reader against believing much more than has been set down the statements of the alarmists may prove cor rectwe have hitherto for the most part found them to be the contrary and at present most assuredly we entirely dis believe them
