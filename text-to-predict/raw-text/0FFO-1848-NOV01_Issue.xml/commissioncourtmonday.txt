tee case tor the presecution which bas been published fully on the two former trials it was but right observed the learned gentleman that he should inform the jury that the prisoner had already been tried by two juries of his countrymen and that on both occasions the juries had disagreed as to his guilt he should remark that the evidence gven upon the first of these two trials was not precisoly the same as was given on the second but the evidence adducedfor the crown on the second trial was substantially similar to that which wouild be given in the present investigation now no one could entertain a more sincere respect than he did for the opinions of a jury and if he found when en gaged in the dis charge of his official duty that one two or three jurors only had come to a conclusion that the rmlsoner was guilty he would certainly not have put him ori his trial a second time but uch he bad reason to believe was not the case and his present impression was that they had then an opportunity of considering with greater care than before a new doctrine which was propounded at tho last commission and if pos sible effect a final settlement of the law which related to the responsibility of newspaper proprietors under these circumstances he felt it to be his duty to submit the case of mr odoherty to a third jury in order to asertain whetherunder the directionof the
