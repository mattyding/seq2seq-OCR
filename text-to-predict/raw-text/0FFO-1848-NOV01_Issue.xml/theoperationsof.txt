of the bank in the event of its thinking proper to resume the payment of its rotes in specie in accordance with the advice given by the minister of finance at a recent sitting of our national assembly the calculation may easily be madethe amount of its circulation is f let us add thereto the amount of the deposits in that we may have the entire amount of its poritive liabilities and we shall have a sum of f the metallic reserve amounts to gfequivalent to  per cent of the debts for which it is liable it is seldom that the banks possess in their coffers a metallic capital proportionably so abundant nor is it alwaysfar fronm ita sign of prosperity it is only right to add that the bank has g ranted for the advan tage of the state a loan of tf of which oily f havebeen paid it is therefore

one of financial crisis and it is wellknown that the english cabeiet thought proper to suspend the restric tive clauso of peeps bank act in order to provide against the scarcity of speciewe have already obsenved that a great accumulation of speciein the coffers of the bank is not always a sign of prosperity this is proved at the present moment by the fisanncis state of things in london as well as in paris if the money accumulates in the cellars of the issue depart ment it is partly because england refuges the orders of the continent when they aro for time she will not give credit to thc trade of franoc or germany and for our own parts we cannot find fult with thia determination this is one of the causes that explain the enormous difference exkibited by the last returns of the english customhouse between the imports and the exports she has sold us but libtle foe the last six monthsfirst because we were hardly in a situation to buy and secondly because she would only seu for ready mruey if she has imported more there is a reason for this fact alsoviz the depreciation of all articles of mer chandise in the markets of france and germaij  it appears to us that it would be incorrect to attribute this result solely to tho premiums on exportationwe have heard much talk lately of mutual dependence behold the mutual dependence that revolutions inflict upon nations they dry
