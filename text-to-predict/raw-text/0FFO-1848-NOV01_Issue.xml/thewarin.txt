indiathe war in mooltanwe have received by express from marseilles our advices and papers from india in anticipation of the overland mail of the d of ootober from bombay the dates thus received are from cal cutta to the d of september madras to the th and bombay to the d of ootoberfrontier affairs have ksumed a much more serious aspect the intelligence is unsatisfactory alike re epecting the operations before mooltan and the gene ral state of the punjab our forces in that direc tion have suffered a check in consequence of the defection of the auxiliary sikh troops just as the operations of general whishs brigade had commenced in the most brilliant manner shere singh with the force of nearly  men under his command went over to the dewan evi dently upon a prearranged plotan event which compelled general whish instantly to change his tactics to raise the siege and having made a retro grade movementto unite his forces in an entrenched camp at some  miles from the citadel there to await in a more favourable position the junc tion of the reinforcements from ferozepore and scinde two engineer officers had since it appears fallen into the hands of the enemy roolraj by shere singhs defection had aug nented his adherents to about  men with the probability of a further accession of nearly as many more chutter singh the rebel leader in the hazareh was marching with sbout  men to join the dewan and although gholab singh had not more positively thau heretofore gone over to the conspiracy two of his regiments with stores and baggage had left to join the hazareh sikhs at lahore the features of this frontier rebellion were not less pronounced although happily from our excellent measures of defence there the circumstance occasions no ground for ultimate apprehension as to our hold upon the capital we find however that several other sirdars of the durbar had been found to be mplicated and that in consequence of this fact the resident on receipt of the intelligence from mooltan had at once secured under a guard the per zsonxd dhuleep singh as a hostage to iufluence those who wavered as well as to frustrate attempts made ty the sikhs in arms to get possession of the maha rajahs person the resident had also wo are told laid hands on the famous kohinoor diamond as a measure of similar precautionxroops were being poured into scinde by sea from tombay to occupy the line of the middle indus and to maroh should their services be required upon the ptuijab the bombay force when united would amount to about  men some of the bladras regiments would reinforce the bombay tations at the same time that a general advance was preparing from the bengal frontier from the latter direction a wellapportioned force amounting to about  men would march upon mooltan under general gilbert no troops could it appears be spared from lahore but it was considered the cavalry regiments still left in ferozepore would be quite sufficient to keep open the line of communication with the camp of general whish in other words to frustrate any ising between him and the capital under these circmanstances the position of the british force in the field strongly entrenched with a park of ar tillery of  guns and their flank on the river at some  miles from mooltan may be regarded as eecure under any contingencyon the whole happily there appears every ground for belief that the preparations announced from all sides of india to retrieve the check we have de scribed are on a scale of magnitude probably commen urate rather with the extent of past supineness in its exaggerated reaction than the actual degree of danger such at least is the opinion of parties who from the first were urgent for the adoption of active tneasures and who at present are the least alarmed by the ultimate features the outbreak has assumed or inclined to doubt of a speedy and successful ter mnination mooltan would now be attacked by eepa cate armies from the south and from the north whenit has been afilrmed mere detachments in the iearlier months would have sufficed but it is added that there now appears every probability that long before the bombay army shall have reached the seat of war the few regiments that have already arrived vithout orders from headquartersnamely the lifie brigade from scinde and the european ca valry from ferozepore will supply what is wanting to our troops who are in the presence of the enemy and that general whish with a body of picked in antry european and native and some  ca valry an arm hitherto deficient which will have teached him with a park of field and siege artillery and under the prsige of recent success wiu certainly rcap the honours of the campaign should the temerity of the dewan or the precipitancy of lib forces tempt them as is not unlikely to an attack this opinion seems borne out by other de tails which have reached us as to the recent conduct of our troops who in the siege operations stormed the outworks forestalling the work of regular ap proaches and up to the hour when breaching dis tance had thereby been attainedan hour marked by the instant defection of the sikh chiefevery reocozre without exception told the same lesson of superiority in strategy as in conflict that edwardes and his pathans before taught the insurgents under earlier and still more desperate circamstancesthe following officers had fallen in the
