custom condemned alike by religion justice reason and the best interests of the people that the governments of europe and america should bo urged to introduce provisions into their treaties for settling national disputes byarbitration and thatit was most important that a general national congress should be held for tho purpose of framing a welldigested and authoritative national code as the unanimous adoption of such a code would be an effectual means of premoting universal peace the congress also urged the necessity of a general and simulaneous disarmament as a means of greatly diminishing the financial burdens which pressed upon this and other countries and of promoting an inter change of mutual good offices two important addresses were agreed upon by the conrressone to the

balls with delight the presence otf x viischers who with the various sizepresidents contributed so largely to g ve effect to the dellberalonds of that asseemblyhe did not support the objects of the peace society on any grounds of political expediency he was a man of peace because he was a christian  rear and cheera there was in the neighbourhood in which he lived an evangelical clergyman who ir speaking the other day on the question of peace and war adrmitted that the prindiples of christianity were destined ultimately to establish universal peace in the world but how did this gentleman practically carry out his principles  one of his sons vwas educated for the army and another for the navy laughter and cheers if it was said that the objects of the peace sodety were im practicable he would remind the meeting that the diminu tion of capital punishments the abolition of slavery and the proress of the temperance cause had au been declared impossile without great consequent evils but

any other country in the world that was ever taxed so hilbly as england  loud cheers supposing a governiment was set up which the people did not like there was a very easy way ofgerang ra or i ta laugg their neighbours on the other side the channel had got rid of their own government though they had made a sad mistake in resorting to physical force to gain their liberty and he believed that the people of this country might easily get rid of any government that did not auit them by exerting moral instead of physical force heao hear the great point to which they should look in order to advance their objects was to influencing public opinion it was useless to find fault with the go vernmment  the government could not keep up an immense standing army if the people did not find the money loud cheers to necomplish the objects of the peace society they must have recourse to that christian inslruction which subdued the passions and brought into subjection the pride and animosity of the human heart he placed his cou fidence upon christianprinciple alone and if the clhljtchurch in this country would consistently do its dutv ifuyuy fwx wu awm  sup lrsical precepts of christianity

was glad that the feeling of the english people had been so strongly manifested vhen a scoundrel called a soldier had the other day ventured to commit a robbery upon a member of the na tional guard hear hear  and he was sure that the indignation which had teen excited by that outrage was general throughout this country he had been much struck bythe circumstance that whilo they disarmed their owvn soldiery when not on duty such was their confidence in tbeir french brethren that they had been allowed to walk the streets of the metropolis with their swords and bayonets andnot a word of reproach had been uttered against them theresolution wasthenunanimously agreed to wmvysscnsvwas then introduced to the meetingaws reelivdwith loud cheerng he delivered a brief address in

eyeing the opposite ceast with a glass of sin gular power a laugh let the heart of england be set on universal peace let us hold forth the arms of universal brotherhood and set a bright example which the rest of the nations would finally follow cheersmr b buurrtt who was received with much cheering said that there seemed to be a sentiment aboad a latent thought permeating slowly the minds of the most depressed of the worlds population whispering its bright promise in the ear of dejected labour and sometimes even giving to the slave a song in the burning hours of his unrequited toila thought that was helping millions of the poor to bear the pressure of their poverty theres a good time coming cheera  there was in every christian community an im presaion that we were approachine one of the grand realitiea in the destiny of humanity predicted by the ancient pro phets artd poets the youngest of the listening thousands present might not live to enter upon the fruition of that reality but when it should come they who should see it would attest that it was not a fortuitous condition into which humanity stumbled in tho progress of its genius but a condition prenared for mankind before the foundation of the world hear hear whatever that glorious day might bring to the future ages of the race they who should possess its goodly realities would confess that they were all embraced in the condition described by the prophets noation should not lift up saword against nation when their officers should bo peace and their exacters righteous i ness hear he ir the advent of that day ws not a newborn illuion of modern fancy it was secured to the world by the unwavering verities of the word of god and there were before us principles which secured itprinciplesof great antiquity principles that had lasted the years of god if thine enemy hunger feed him  resist not evil butovercomne evil with good  love your enemies  they that take the sword shall perish by the sword rlear hear these principles though long foolishness to the greekwere mighty and would prevail the principalities of earth should yet bow to the power of those princinles the truth that  god hath made of one blood all nationis of men should yet be written upon all the standards of pe pular progress and before it the bestial emblems of nationality sbould hang their heads for shame cheers was it in the middle of the th cen tury too early to issue from the verge of waterloo as the congress did an appeal to mankind to raise from the dust that principle which had been trampled down by the demon of war what fitter place could be chosen than the neigbhourhood of that spot on which was perpetrated the most stupendous fratricide that ever fillei the world with lamentation and woe  hear hear one could almost fancy when the congress wats deliberating that there were plaintive voices coming up from that field as from a world ofmoaning spirits sighing in the midst  god hath made of  one blood all nations of men and pleading trumpet tongued to have that great truth preached abroad over themr g  w alexandea briefly moved the second reso lutionthat pernanent and universal peace is the only
