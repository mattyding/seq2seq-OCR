been perfectly properly directedmr a t denning kc and mr h c leon appeared for the appellants mr j g trapnell kc and mr e clarke for the respondentsmr dennrng in opening the appeal said that the main

persons using only once previously had that act come before their lordships house for considerationpowell v kempton park race course company  tlze times lr   ac  since that time the decisions of the courts had given rise to fresh difficultiesdrawing the distinction between credit betting and readymoney betting counsel said that in credit betting no money was paid down  before the race the parties waiting until therace was over and then paying what was due to be paidon the other hand in ready money betting money was paid down by one party sometime before the race in the case of credit betting there was only an obligation of honour to payreplying to lord atkin mir denning said that if members of a club used the club to make bets with each other on the premises that would not be illegalproceeding counsel said that at the time of the prosecution mrs milne had for over four years carried on the business of a club known as the byculla club on premises in bartholo mew close mr boundford was her step brother and for two years before the prosecu tion he assisted her in the management of the club of which he was also a memberabout  membersthe club had approximately  members who paid a yearly subscription of s d until january  after which it was reduced to is meals and refreshments including alcoho lic liquor could be obtained at the club which opened at  oclock in the morning and closed at  oclock at night there were facilities for playing dartsone of the rooms at the club was extensively used by members for making bets by telephone mostly with a bookmaker called payne but also with other bookmakers there were two coinoperated telephones on the club premises and mr paynes office was in little britain some  yards from the club premisestwo months before the prosecution mr payne engaged a member of the club a mr green as a settlement clerk and installed him above the club premises on the second floor the rooms rented by mr payne on the second floor had in them an ordinary post office tele phone which he rented none of the appel lants had any control over mr paynes pre mises on the second floor and there was no ready money betting on thc club premises or on that floorobservation was kept on the club premises between may  and june  last year and during that time it was cstablished that many members while at the club premises made bets by telephone with mr payne at his office in little britain on no occasion was a single stake heard to exceed sthe amounts won or lost by members on those bets were communicated by mr payne to mr green by telephone to the room above the club premises and after the days racing members settled their accounts with mr green in the rooms on the second floorthere were occasions however when mr green came down to the club premises and settled with mrs milne the winnings or losses on bets which she had previously made by telephone with mr payne to his office mrs milne had an account with mr payne but for convenience a member might ask her to make the bet for him and put it through her account she would then put the bet through to mr payne in her own name and if the member won she would pay himmr denning submitted first that judge beazley and the court of criminal appeal were wrong in saying that using a telephone in a club was equivalent to speaking face to face and therefore meant that the premises were being used for betting secondly he con tended that judge beazley was wrong in saying that such use of premises coupled with the permission of or arrangement with the owner or occupier of the premises constituted an offence under the actreferring to a portion of the judgment of mr justice humphreys in the court of criminalappeal lord atkin said that it was stated that using the telephone was the same as a man being there and using thc premises if my grocer telephones to me is he using my house   his lordship askedthe word  bettingmr denning submitted that the wbrd betting  used in the act meant the actual making of bets and not the paying or receiv ing of winnings or losses on bets and that the words  persons resorting thereto  meant persons physically resorting to the premises and did not mean persons making a bet over the telephone from premisessince  it had been held that a book maker was not  a person using a room  unless he carried on his business by permis sion of or arrangement with the owner or occupier of the roomcounsel went on to argue that judge beazleywas wrong irr directing the jury that if there was some express or tacit arrange ment with mr payne pursuant to which members of the club telephoned bets to him at his office and pursuant to which his agent mr green at mr paynes room above the byculla club paidmoney orcollectedmonevlost on bets previously made the appellants were guilty of the offence with which they were chargedtha t doctrine of  permission provided the jumpingoff place for the statement of the law made by judge beazley and the criminal appeal court which he challenged the only arrangement which would be material would be an arrangement under which the appelants were the agents of mr payne to make bets on his behalf with persons resort ing o the clubbit was lawful for a bookmaker in his own office to receive credit bets by telephone and to encourage that business by advertisement or circulars of arrangements with clubswhat was unlawful was for a bookmaker or his servants to control a place on which there was a telephone for the purpose of persons resorting to that telephone and making bets
