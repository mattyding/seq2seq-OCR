a policy forpeaceconfidence as theobjectivemr edens three pointsmr anthony eden speaking at brid lington last night outlined a threefold peace policy which included the marshalling of all our forces in wealth manpower and industrythe world could not continue as at present he said staggering from day tb day under the constant threat of universal catastrophe such a state of affairs was intolerable everywhere the nations were borrowing with reckless extravagance thatthey might arm with ruinous haste comrnerce could not flourish in such conditions nor reason hold its own nor peace endurc confronted with such a challenge there was no question what our course should be the world wouldrally to apeace leader ship the initiative could be no longer left to those who worshipped force and practised violence faced with the doctrine that might is right we could reply in the words used by abraham lincoln  years ago when he said let us have faith that right makesmight and in that faithlet us dare to do our duty as we understand itthere was a policy for the  peaceloving to pursue it was clear definite and positive it should be threefold first it should be made plain that aggression had had its day that acts of force whether against small nations or large would be met by force we must get the fuliest value outof such a policy and that fullest value was as a deterrent such a policy needed neither explanation nor apology it was a matter of selfpreservation for what remained of the civilized world secondly it could not too often be empha sized that the objective in the creation of a peace front was the restoration of confidence in international good faith this was the indis pensable prelude to all progress we had to restore confidence to this uneasy world so that nations everywhere might go about their daily business free from the ear that they might at any moment be called upon to  stand and deliver  or be destroyed such a policy was aimed against no nationand need be a threat to no nation it would only be operative against those who by flagrant acts of aggression invoked it against themselvesthirdly in order to lend the maximum weight to such a policy we should put forward the maximum effort of which we were capable in every sphere domestic and foreign  we were not yet doing so we should marshal all our forces in wealth in man power and in industry at such a time neither party politics nor personal differences made any sensea supreme effortwe had to giveof our best all of us the british people had a greattradition of service and endurance given vigorous and imagina tive leadership no effort was beyond their strength they proved this in the last war they could prove it equally inma supremeeffort to organiie the forces of peace to avert war we could not hope to do this successfully on a basis of businessas usual good progress was being made theywere told antd he had nodoubt it was true with our armaments on the sea and in the air but europe still thought in terms of armies and in that sphere they all knew how much remained to be undertaken his own conviction was that the british people were ready and willing to make the greatest possible national effort but they asked that the risks and sacrifices should be shared equallyby all they had indeed every right to ask thisby his most recent initiative president roosevelt had once more given expression not only to the sentiments of the american people but to those of every section of the british people and indeed of peaceloving nations everywhere  they were all glad to note our governments immediate welcome it was significant that the presidents action had also been endorsed by the wbole american continent that action had been met hy a tirade of abuse in the german and italian press to many this would seem a tribute to the accuracy of the presidents analysis and a measure of the uneasiness of the ruling factions in those two countries
