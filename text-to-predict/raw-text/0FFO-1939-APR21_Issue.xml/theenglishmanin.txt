the englishmanin politicsan interpretationto canadalord baldwins faithfrom our own correspondentotrawa april lord baldwin delivered at toronto university today the first of three lectures with which he is inaugurating a lecture ship founded to perpetuate the memory of sir robert falconer who became presi dent of the universityin  and held that office for  years hespoke of the character of the englishman as he had known him in peace and in war and of the value of british political institutionsfundamentally said lord baldwin the cornmon stuff of the english people was a stout individualism yet with the power of cooperation and a broad and tolerant humanity they bad also humournot wit which was of the intellect but humour which was of the heart in practice they were a kindly hearted folk they want to be at peace with the world and they could not hate for long never theless when they had to fight their tenacity was unbreakable but after a fight they were always ready to make friendslord baldwin exclaimed on the characters one met in england born of this spirit of individualismi have heard people sveak of dickenss characters as though they were caricatures he said but i have met them myself in all walks of life in the streets in country alehouses among my friends and until the day when we have massproduction of men as well as of motorcars may that precious individuality continue  the individual i admit does grumble we do grumble at the weather at the government at home and abroad but that is skin deep we never worry worry works internally and affects the nervous system in times of crisis the grumbling ceases and the nerves holdnot arrogantlord baldwin denied that the english were arrogantthat we live in an island he confessed has undoubtedly kept us apart from that free intercourse with foreign nations which we should have enjoyed had we lived on the con tinent no one could as it were peep over our garden wall i rather think the englishman admits that the other fellow may be right but he is so intent on justifying his own conduct to himself and ultimately to his god that he feels the impossibility of any outsiders know ing enough of his circumstances and ways of thought to justify his expressing an opinion or attempting to influence him his direct responsibility for his conduct is impressed on him if not by his own study and inclination then by his heredity and subconscious belief and that individual relationship to a higher power is one of the deepest motives to pre serve the individuality of the human souland that preservation demands freedom some of these english qualities lord baldwin said had played their part in the great work of the reconciliation and union of french and english in canada might not this be an object lesson to europe at this moment if she could learn it  in the empire as a whole the real bond was the sharing of common ideals the love of freedom in its highest sense and the pursuit of peacebut let us not he added hold these ideals for selfish motives only but from a deep con viction that these are ideals in which thewhole world can share and by the exhibition of which we may inspire others to walk in the path that we have chosen those qualities which inspired both leaders and people in securing unity and represenrtative government for canada are what we need today and in the years to come loyalty sympathy and understandingnow i can weu imagine it will be said that in speaking of other countries being persuaded to tread in our patb i am assuming the english complacency and selfrighteousness and that the gist of my remarks may be summed up  we are better than you nothing is farther from my thoughts we are not better than other people but there has happened to fall to us an experience which has not fallen to other people we in our empire after much experiment have adopted the method of mutual cooperation in attempting the solution of our problerns we have happily been able to show that difficulties can be resolved by discussion where we are certain they could not be by force we have found that this method of cooperation can be adapted to domestic needs as well as to those of wider imperial import there is nothing of com placency or selfrighteousness in holding that such methods may be employed in a wider sphere and in failing to see why they should not be employed with success every country can make its own peculiar contribution to the progress of the world and that progress is retarded if countries with a great traditional culture cease to make their contribhutionthe party systemlord baldwin went on to discuss cer tain peculiar features of british political lifeour party system he said is not one of rival ideologies nor of imported innovations adapted to a structure unfitted to receive them the parties themselves have been rather fluid organizations without any logical process they have the faculty of adapting themselves to changing conditions and they have arisen out of the social circumstances of centuriesthe danger to our constitution will come on the day when our party system is changed to that of a system of rival ideologies neither of which will suffer the very existence of its opponents any attempt to change the basis of our constitution whether from the left or from the right might easily strain it to break ing point that is why internally we can have no dealings with fascism or communism either would destroy the soul of our people and theforms of our constitutioni have no fear myself you will never get a fascist movement with us until you have a disintegration caused by communism if such disintegration appeared the forces of law and order would win to what form of govern ment such victory would lead us no man can tell but it rests with us to see that these things do not happen and i do not think they wiltthe house of commons is a remarkable institution it is the true home of democracy it is a body of some  members in which a man is judged solely by what he is sincerity is the main test and no one whatever his views however unattractive his personality however feeble his power of speech will fail to get a hearing if the house is convinced of his sincerity but there is no shrewder judg ment of human personality than the house of commons no finer sifting of the essential qualities of the individualand as the house is moving into this strange new world as it debates the problems of to day and tomorrow still is it conscious of tradition still it realizes that it is not a creation of today or of yesterday it is carrying on the daily work of centuries and in its datily life it is carrying on traditions of courtesy and good mandets that have been handed down by word of mouth and by example from generation to generationthe position of the crown is perhaps one of the most difficult features of our constitu tion to appreciate in the course of time the crown has been shorn of most of its preroga tives but never in my opinion has it stood for more than it does today in our view it is a tremendous thing to have as the head of the state a man who is independent of and is out side politks his presence as the copingstone as it were of our constitution is in itself a guarantee of the stability of our democracy
