the training ofteachersradical change urged by nutthreeyear inquirythe report of a committee appointed by the national union of teachers which since has been examining the pro blem of training teachers is published today national union of teachers hamilton house mabledon place wc  on theevidence of  witnesses including principals of training colleges acting teachers and members of the young teachers committee of the union pro posals are made for radical changeand the appointment by the board of education of a committee to consider the questionoutstanding among the proposals are those advocating closer control of the entry into the profession of unsuitale candidates from schools closer connexion between training colleges and universities and the extension of twoyear courses in training colleges to three years emphasis is placed on the ideal that teachers should enter their lifes work with a sense of vocation and that the profession should be regarded as a whole and not as a graded hierarchythe report agrees that training must be of diverse types but recommends that there should be parity of qualifications gained at the end of the course pupils in secondary schools who intend to become teachers should follow in postcertificate years a wide course of study including music practical work speech training and physical trainingthere are several indications in the report that the nut is beginning to see the draw backs of a too literary or too spetialized pre paration for the tgacherx itis recommended that during secondary school holidays future teachers should learn something of the work of elementary schools  to facilitate  such changes it is proposed that not more than  per cent of the timetable should be allocated to the main subjects for the higher certificate t is also suggestedthat the universities should accept for higher certificate purposes a group of  social studies covering the economuic social and educational factors in the lives of children and young people it is urged that the head teachers and staffs of secondary schools should refrain from encouraging un suitable boys and girls to enter a fouryear approved course merely because it provides an avenue to the universitythe verdict of head teachers it is suggested should be checked by the responsible officer of the local education authority whose judg ment should be based in part on the perform ance of the applicant during a spell of service in elementary schools undertaken during secondary school holiday periods the authorities of training institutions sbould arrange to interview applicants at convenient centres throughout the country the pupil teacher system should be finally abolisheda wide trainingalthough all teachers in trairiing should acquire a knowledge of basic principles the professional course should provide for differ ences in their application as required by various age groups special preparation for teachers in junior schools is proposed for postprimary work the teacher should follow one or more subjects to an advanced stage but he should not be a narrow specialist since the work demands adaptability breadth of information and keenness of interest the subject must not be so taught as to hamper the full development of the pupilthe committee think it unwise to limit the teaching of academic subjects in postprimary schools to university graduates and suggest that the training course should not be narrowly confined to work in postprimary schools but should provide practice in boih primary and postprimary wori it is urged that undergraduates who intend to become teachers should be connected with the educa tion department of their university through out their academic careers faculties in educa tion should be established in all the universities with general courses for honours degrees and facilities for further study by teachers in practice who should be allowed to take a deferred fourth term without loss of salary in university education departmnents more use should be made of tutorial and conference methods and graduates should no longer be allowed to qualify as certificated teachers by taking a course in a selected schoolspecial attention is given to the training of teachers of specialist subjects such as techno logy handicraft music and physical develop ment briefly the recommendations provide that teachers who enter technical institutions from branches of industry should take a course of training in suitable centres the course to be taken during the first three years of teach ing and to cover three monthsloans to studentsmusic teachers should first attend a college of music and prepare for a degree afterwards proceeding to a training college but teachers of physical training should not be segregated but should take a third year special course in an ordinary college teachers in schools for the blind or for defective children should spend at least three years in work with normal children before entering the special school service all teaching qualifications should be university awards the connexion between training colleges and universities should be strengthened and broadened so that gradually every training college may become part of a university the university course for teachers would thus be analogous to the courses in medicine engineering architecture and agri culture all students in training should be resident in a college or hostelwhere local authorities grant loans to students these should not be conditional on the recipient entering the service of the local authority which grants the loan the period of repayment should not be less than five years and the interest charged should not exceed the administrative expenses involved grants as distinct from loans should be uncondi tional though subject to a means test and paid only whenthe applicant has been accepted for admission to a college or university in making first appointments local authorities should send representatives to the colleges instead of summoning applicants for interview
