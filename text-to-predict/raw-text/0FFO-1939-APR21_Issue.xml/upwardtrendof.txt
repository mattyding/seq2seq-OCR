chairman referred to thevisitwhichhad recently been paid by mr hudson to the northern capitals and said they all hoped that out of that trade tour would come con siderable benefits to british industries but they had to recall a visit that did not take placethat which mr hudson and he were going to make to berlin it was well worth remembering when they heard as they did today a lot of talk about encirclement stranglehold the right to live and the com plaints of certain countries of their right to trade and prosper that just before the czecho slovak coup not only representatives of industries but ministers of this country most intimately connected with trade were going to germany they were going to try to arrive at an agreement in the matter of trade which would be of mutual benefit to both countries and which would have given both he believed a better life andcontributed to international trade and an international peaceeverywhere whether it was in the trade of the country or in the life of the individual all was overshadowed today by the anxiety in which we lived what was  the good of quoting statistics of the past year when statistics of the past no longer provided any criterion for any goveinment as to the pros pects for the future  if it were not for that he would be addressing them that night as a comparatively happy president of the board of trade the gigantic effort on rearma nient was bound to have an increaririgeffect on the industrial production of the country  some ofthem might have read inthe times acouple of articles by mr j m keynesin which hewent so far as to say that in the next few months we were going to see un employment coming to an end without going to quite that length he thought he could say that without the greatest catastrophe of all there was no reason at all to anticipate any recession from the higher rate of productivity that was going on today if there were any relief of this tension we should see a marked upward swing of british industryswift actionspeaking of the governments scheme in relation to the insurance of ships andcargo mr stanley said it showed it was possible if they desired to adapt democracy with all its elaborate system of safeguards to the swiftness of action which was necessary in the times in which we lived the events of the last few weeks must have made them feel that our efforts in the last three years had to be redoubled todayone of the first signs of that feeling was the creation of a ministry ofsupply and the appointment of aminister to that post all would agree that every effort now must be made our strength was our security and the strength of the british empire was the peace of the world he wished figuratively to step out of the government for a moment and say a thing particularly in regard to the new ministry of supply it was that our financial and commercial strength contributed not a little to the military strength of this country above all our export trade should catastrophe come would enable us to win hewas glad that the new minister had had in hiscareer a connexionwith the board of trade and had acquired a very real knowledge of business and industry because he would have a better realization of the imrortance of trade to the defence of this country than he mr stanley had found in more spectacular minds our present efforts were bound to make further calls on industrial capacity it was absolutely essential that we should make the fullest pos sible use of what was left of the export tradewe had claims on no one and we threatened no one there was no one we wished to exclude from international trade no one we wished to prevent fromworking out their own national salvation in their own natural way butif they threatened no one let no one threaten us let no one mistake our love of peace for fear of war all in that room knew what war meant and had counted the cost people called us soft there was no vainglory about our decision when we came to one and there was no bombast about it we valued the material things of life ease and comfort which advancing civilization had brought yet there were other things we valued still morenamely our liberty our ideals and our heritage if others sought to dominate the world by force and force to threaten that liberty ideals and heritage then just as readily as our ancestors we should be prepared to resist and just as surely as our ancestors we should know how to succeedthe high commissioner for india sirfiroz khan noon acknowledging the toast of  the british commonwealth of nations
