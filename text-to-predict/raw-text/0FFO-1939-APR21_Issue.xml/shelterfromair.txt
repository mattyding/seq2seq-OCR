shelter fromair raidsdeep retreatscondemneddispersal saferthe report of the lord privy seals con ference on airraid shelters was issued yesterday as a white paper stationery office d cmd  the conference which was convened on february   to advise the lord privy seal on airraid shelter policy consisted of lord hailey mr george hicks mp sir clement hindley mr f j leathers dame louise mcllroy sir william mclintock sir frederick marquis and professor r v southwellthe report opposes the suggestion of deep or bombproof shelters for the whole civilian population and favours the policy of dispersed shelters while making no recommendations about active defence which was outside the province of the con ference the report speaks of the close interrelation of active and passive defence pointing out thatactive defence by keeping the enemy away from their objectives can not only protect directly the lives of the inhabitants but can protect also their homes and the factories means of foodsupply public services and the like in proportion as more elaborate and expensive proposals for passive defence are brought forward the question must arise more and more insistently whether craftsmanship and material resources could not better be utilized on the improvement of active defence or in some other direction where they would better contribute to ensuring victory it is of some significance also as one observer impressed upon the conference that the public morale during the air raids on barcelona was greatly sustained by the knowledge that the raiders were being actively engaged by the defending forcesno full immunitythe problem of shelters cannot be regarded in the light of a contest between a deep shelter policy and a shallow shelter policy the universal provision of complete immunity fronr risk is impossible what has to be sought is a balanced programme of reasonable protec tion bearing in mind first that the factor of time is of vital importance and secondly that it is essential to avoid an immoderate diversion of the nations effort from other activities directed to the maintenance of its own existence and the successful prosecution of warthere are many regions where it should be possible to trust more to the unlikelihood of attack than to the provision of shelters which would in such cases represent a diversion of public funds and energies from more legitimate objectives at the other end of the scale there are certain localities which must be regarded as particularly liable to be heavily attacked and where special measures may therefore be justified it is necessary to aim in general at the provision of an equal degree of pro tection by one method or another for areas which appear to be approximately equal in their liability to dangerthronged streetsthe experience ofbarcelonathe technical difficulties of access to deep shelters is discussed at length after pointing out that the length of the warning by determining the distance which can be covered during its currency has a direct and controlling effect upon the distribution and size of shelters the report says that the conference arinclined to accept as reasonable the view that it would be wrong to count on movements ex ceeding  yards by day or  yards by night and in most cases it would be the latter which would be the controlling factor so far as night conditions are concerned the population may if the effect of evacuation be ignored be gauged by the census figures it is only in a few cases that the population as so measured reaches a density of  to the square mile thus the conclusion is reached that it would only be in rare cases that more than  per sons would be found within a distance of  yards equivalent perhaps to a little over  yards measured as the crow flies which is taken to be the reasonable limit of movement by night this apart from other considerationÂ§ must be conclusive against very large shelters for use by nightthis is not a field in which a margin of error erring on the side of optimism can be allowed if experience in barcelona has taught anything it is the danger to persons thronging the streets and it is unnecessary to dwell on the situation that would arise if a considerable proportion of the public were left still struggling towards their refuges as hostile raiders appeared over headramps or stairsthen the report discusses the type and capacity of shelters on the assumption that people have reached the entrancethe first question is whether entrances should take the form of ramps or of stairs the con ference feel very strongly that ramps are to be preferred not only are they better adapted to the movement of a crowd in a confined space but they present less difficulty to the re moval of casualties should need arise gradi ents should not exceed i in  a figure which indeed in the opinion of some is too steep to be consistent with safety stairs are likely to lead to confusion and unless provided with frequent landings even to disaster spiral stairs should be excluded altogether from con sideration it has however to be appreciated that ramped entrances of a gradient of i in  must in the case of deep shelters be of great lengththe entrance should be so designed and con structed as to exclude any possibility that early arrivals may by taking up their positions there hamper or prevent the entrance of later arrivals doors or gates intended to be closed at a given moment possibly in the face of late comers must be viewed with grave apprehen siona further question arises in those cases where the means of access proposed is by a long straight ramp or sloping tunnel or where the design of the shelter itself consists of a single large spiral ramp in such a case if a bomb bursts near the entrance so that the opening of the ramp becomes exposed to the blast then in the absence of suitable baffling the full effect of the blast might be conducted without diminution throughout the length of the ramp and everyone therein at whatever distance be killed this is one of the points on which re search is requiredrate of intakea further question is that of the width and rate of intake of entrancesin providing accesses to an airraid shelterit would seem unsafe the report says to allow for more than about  persons entering per mninute through each foot of width of entrance it would also appear to be requisite that each individual entrance should not be less than sft wide nor more than ft and further that wide entrances must in any case bc divided by barriers into lanesa number of reasons are advanced against theluse of  focal  shelters the use of parks and similar open spaces one being the risk which is inherent in the concentration of people in large shelters should the protec tion afforded fail through the use of excep tionally heavy bombs or for any other reason a single bomb might wipe out the whole ofthe occupants of a shelter disasters in civil life have shown that such mass catastrophes have a far greater effect upon the public mind than a similar number of isolated casualtiestunnel difficultiesthe conference find practical difficulties which seem to them to be so great as to pre clude construction of  ramified  shelters tunnels following the lines of the streets on anything like a large scalefrom the evidence of a consulting engineer who had had exceptional experience of tun nelling work two points seem to emerge clearly in the first place it may be assumed that con ditions in the majority of streets in our large cities exclude the possibility which was ex ploited to some extent in barcelona of surface working an assortment of mains gas elec tric and water generally occupy the whole of the undersurface of our main streets and below thisto a depth often exceeding ft lie the sewers construction must therefore be effected  in tunnel namely by driving vertical shafts and working laterally from their bases extensive experience of underground railway work in london points to a very defi nite limit to the maximum rate at which taking into account plant supervisory staff and labourwork could be carried out even if other demands on this section of industry were substantially reducedthe engineer referred to addressing himself to the question of tunnels of the ft diameter for which the readily available types of exca vating plant are adapted gave it as his view that we could not confidently count upon con structing in london within a period of two years  miles of such tunnel shelters this length of tunnel would have the capacity to house some  persons he explained that by making tunnels of ft in diameter capable of accommodating refugees on two storeys the number of persons for whom such accommodation could be constructed in a given time would be considerably increasedit is doubted however whether this expe dient would be of practical value for wbiile a ft in tunnel is estimated to hold about  persons per mile there must be few if any places where the corresponding concentra tion of population say  to the square mile would be located near enough on either side of the tunnel to enable advantage to be taken of the additional accommodation so available indeed a tunnel of such large capacity must approximate in character to a typical focal shelter and be subject to the difficulties and drawbacks already shown to be associated with such sheltersit seems clear therefore that the construc tion of tunnel shelters must if they are to be completed in any commensurable time be restricted in extentunderground railwaysdiscussing the tunnel type the confer ence refer to the london underground railway system  much of which affords a high degree of protection on this the report sayswe doubt whether having due regard to its extent and to the comparatively limited means of access the system could make more than a partial contribution to the general shelter problem it may however lend itself to a special usenamely the treatment and clear ance of casualties it would seem worth con sideration whether by making additional ex cavations at or near existing railway stations it would not be possible to provide protected casualty clearing stations from which evacua tion of the wounded after treatment would be comparatively easydispersed shelters a retreat readily athandturning from the question of public shelters to that of dispersed shelters for the protection of people in their homes the conference favour the latter type as they provide protection readily at hand at a moments noticemoreover they represent the means by which measures affording a considerable degree of protection can be completed within a reasonable time a fact which seems to the conference to be of crucial importanceno figures need be adduced to show that it would be impracticable for such shelters the numbers of which would run into millions to be of so strongly protected a character as to withstand the direct or near hit of a heavy bombshort of this the question is one of degree the aim must be to provide such shelter as will by protecting the occupants from blast and splinters and from injury from falling debris give immunity from the effects of any bomb that does not fall within a very limited radius it must not be overlooked that once such a degree of protection has been achieved in many cases it will be susceptible of further strengthening as need and opportunity arisea substantial advance towards the general provision of such protection can be secured by the use of i the householders own shelter ie a separate unit to be erected on or near the premises whether in steel or concrete and ii existing house basements strutted where necessary to withstand the fall of debris it is already the policy of the government that in the more exposed portions of the country steel shelters and basement strutting material should be supplied so far as there is a scope for utilizing these methods of providing protectionuse of basementsthe steel shelter of the type distributed by the government possesses high protective value as a shelter against splinters it has been tested against the collapse of adjacent buildings of a two or threestorey type further investiga tion should be made into the completeness of its efficacy against blastsuitable domestic basements if strutted as necessary offer approximately equal protection to that provided by the steel shelter and they often have the added advantage that they can be occupied without leaving the house muth that has been said in derogation of the use of basements the conference do not accept it appears to exaggerate the risk to the occupants of basements from the bursting of water mains in the street in all save exceptional cases the occupants should have time to escape from such a dangerbut it is not by any means every basement that is suitable for the purpose in view in particular many  semibasements  which have considerable windowspace could not safely be used unless this space were suitably filled in  and it is essential that a basement re fuge should have a second and independent means of exit this might in many cases be contrived by the opening of a passage into an adjoining basement the aperture being covered by a section of lightly built wall which could be quickly demolished in emergencythere are however areas where the absence of yard or garden space or of suitable base ments make it impracticable to apply either or the two methods discussed above the conference recommend that alternative methods suited for application to such areas should be devised and that no time should be lost in putting them into operation the majority of such areas are likely to be densely populated by people of small means and as they are frequently found in industrial neighbourhoods they will in some instances be dangerously near to targets particularly liable to attackground floorsa solution which if valid offers the possi bility of wide application would be the use of ground floor rooms such as sculleries and the like to fill the part played in other areas by basements the validity of this solution has strong backing in some responsible quarters but it has the substantial drawback that the advance preparation of ground floor rooms must in general occasion a much greater dis location of ordinary life in any event the conference feel that further investigation is required before the matter could be made the subject of a confident recommendation the possibilities latent in the suggestion are how ever so great that they trust that its considera ion will be treated as a matter of urgencyin some neighbourhoods it will probably be found necessary to purchase and demolish one or more houses in a group or street and erect on the site for the use of the inhabitants of neighbouring houses an air raid shelter proof against blast and splinters in other cases where there are in the vicinity industrial or other buildings with large basements suitable for the purpose arrangements might be made for these to be adapted and made available as shelters for the occupants of neighbouring houses in yet other cases there may be thepossibility of constructing gallerics or mode ratesized concrete shelters on small plots above or below groundthe report also considers the protection to be afforded to those engaged in certain activi ties the carrying on of which during raids will ue of crucial importance it recommends the provision of an adequate scale of protection for surgical services the working of casualty clearing stations telephonic communications key points in the direction of active and passive defence and the like special protection is also urged for key workers in essential occu pations such as workers in certain engineer ing works in vulnerable areas or again dock or port workers similar arguments may be applicable to some other organized units where the loss of personnel might be irreparable for instance surgeons in hospitalsthe costwarning against underestimateson the question of cost the report declares in an issue of such vital concern to the existence of the nation the problem of cost is of relative rather than of absolute import ance the measure of justification for shelter expenditure lies in the extent to which it can contribute to the successful conclusion of the war and the preservation of the life of the nation it must therefore be assessed in the light of the other commitments of the country for the provision of defence we ourselves in formulating our conclusions have given less weight to cost as such than to other factors such as for instance the period within which any given scheme of detnce cenuld be completed or the availability of the labour and i materials requiredwe think it right however to enter a word of warning against a too ready acceptance of some of the estimates of cost which have been put forward especially in respect of deep shelter propositions we have good reason to believe that many of these are substantial underestimatesa raid picturedealing with general considerations on the subject of deep shelters the report says we must record our conviction that a uni versal provision of strongly protected public shelters would be far from making the com munity   per cent safe let us consider the position of an average household on the occurrence of a raid by night within seven minutes of the warning every member must be safe within the public shelter there are members of the family to be awakened the need for finding and putting on warm clothes gas to be cut off and perhaps stairs to be gone down then a journey through black or very faintly illuminated streets jostling with other refugees in various states of excitement or even panicwhen the shelter is successfully reached and enteredand not all will be successfulthere is still the discomfort of being packed among a mass of strangers some of whom will be temperamentally less stable than others this is not we think an unfair portrayal of the con sequences of a policy based upon the move ment of large numbers from their homes to public shelters it is moreover a scene which might have to be reenacted night after nightit is not to be supposed that air raids can take place without great dislocation of the life of the community and we think that the ordinary citizen will realize this but we believe that most british citizens would prefer to count upon a less effective protection at their homes even though this may make no pretence of warding off direct or near hits of bombs if they can be safeguarded against the one danger which must loom largest in their minds namely that of being themselves or seeing their families buried under fallen roofs or masonry we believe that if they pause to reflect that on occasion they may fail to hear the warning signal and that the first indication of a raid in progress may be the dropping of bombs within earshot the advantages of having some shelter close at hand will be still more apparent to them
