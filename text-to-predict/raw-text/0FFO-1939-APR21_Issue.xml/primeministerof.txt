it was closed bolted and barred for reasons offensive personal paltry and un rclated to the situation he made no apology for resigning from the lyons cabinet was it cdntemptible or cowardly to keep ones word on an issue far from popular  it was one of the more respectable acts of his life he did not retract one word of his sydney speech and his conversations with mr lyons had showed that mr lyons did not regard it as an attack on himself coming to sir earle pages third chargc mr menzies said  sir earle page says with all its deadly im plications that i resigned from the military forces the fact is that i was a universal trainee like other young men of my age i did not resign but went through my term then like many others i had toask myself whether icould go to war the answer to that question cannot ind shoutcifnotbe detailed fully on the public platform it relates to most intimate personal family affairs facing this problem i found myself for reasons which were compelling unable to join my two soldier brothers i believe that the only judgment on a mans courage and fortitude having any relevance to his public life is the verdict of those who know and work with him my party knowing my many faults but having confidence in my courage and the capacity which it believes me to possess believes me capable of leading itready to negotiatetonight mr menzies said that in view of sir earle pages statement it was clear that the country party would not at pre sent cooperate in the government having regard to the sentiments which sir earle page expressed he knew that sir earles participation in any government led by himself was impossible but he would be prepared at any time to negotiate with the country party with a view to its sharing the responsibilities of the governmentwhen the house rose all the cabinet ministers of the united australia party hastened to issue a statement denouncing sir eatle pages  personal attack and mr fadden and mr corser two queens land members of the country party have announced that they will henceforth sit as independents supporting mr menzies though still opposing national insurancemr menzies becomes prime minister at the age of  uncompromising in matters of high principle he has scorned to win popularity by masking unpalatable truths and is noted for his forthrightness in the discussion of the national issues of which his unyielding advocacy of national insurance is a good example the contacts which he made with united kingdom and other statesmen on three visits to london have greatly widened his horizon and he is very well informed on international affairs one of the most modest of men he has given a splendid example of public service having sacri ficed a lucrative practice at the bar to enter politics how far he has the qualities of leadership essential to hold together the conflicting elements in a ministry only the future can tell but as attorneygeneral he has never had full scope for his gifts
