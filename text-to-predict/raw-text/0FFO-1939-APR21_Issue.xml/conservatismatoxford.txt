oxford journtal for aprit   the chairman was  surrounded by upwards of  individuals a large number of whom were of high standing in this city  but  the humblest and poorest conservative  had the opportunity of enrolling himself in the ranksthe signatories include one knight edward lock a banker and a clerk in holy orders charles william stocker dd but no exalted names a great many are tradesmen there are several described as labourers and a few illiterates have signed by making their mark there is here no evidence of that high toryism which once was so commonly attributed to oxfordno member of the university appears to be among the signatories the period was not many years after some of the fiercest town v gown riots and it seems probable that each party still kept very much to itself politically it was the time of a whig administration lord melbourne was prime minister lord palmerston was foreign secretary and sir robert peel was in opposition hence no doubt the anxiety for the safety of the con stitution which the conscrvatives of oxford expressed in their declarationunfortunately the old minutebooks can not be found the earliest that could be pro duced today was for  lieutenant commander davies would welcome any further information relating to the early years of the association
