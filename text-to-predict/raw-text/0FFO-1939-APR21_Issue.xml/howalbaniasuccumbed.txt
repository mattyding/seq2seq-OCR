how albaniasuccumbedpatriots withoutleadersa diary of holy weekthe following extracts from a diary kept by a correspondent who recently left albania illustrate the bewildermnent of the albanian population at the italiran invasion a bewildernmenit which was shared by some of the invaderv they show that the albanian people wished to resist but were abandoned by their governmentfrom a correspondent lately in albaniavalona palm sunday april a popular albanian figure was told by the italian consul here that the people must make no trouble for the italians would be landing he reported this at tirana the italian radio insisted that the discussions in which the italians pressed for a new treaty on lines unacceptable to king zog were taking their normal course and that italy would respect albanian independence   and would take no steps except in complete accord with albanian opinion patriotic rallies began   to support the government the minister of the interior moved freely among the crowd    assuring them that therc would be no surrender of their rights in face of the threat    genuine national unity began to take shape for the first timeapril the tug which came regularly from the italian island of saseno in valona bay bringing marines to market appeared this morn ing with two small guns the albanian gendarmerie officer protested and asked the sailors not to carry arms    on shore or stir up disorder since he would not be responsible in that case for their safety however there was no sort of hostile demonstrationapril nothing seen at all abnormal between valona and tiranastab in the backtirana april a day of rumours at  am when  guns announced the birth of a crown prince the people were alarmed thinking  i  the italians were already upon them the italian residents    were being evacuated and italian hotels closed   there was a succession of patriotic demonstrations of young men in the main square and before the italian legation at tirana where they protested against those who pretend to give with one hand and stab you in the back with the other and before the american greek and turkish legations ithe british legation is at durazzo no windows were broken and no one hurt    the people wanted information and an assurance that their rights were being defendedxs wife came from durazzo and said that the daily boat for bari that morning sailed late    crammed with italian men women znd children from all over the country most of them weeping and practically no baggage later we learnt that all the italians    had been ordered to leave within  hours this was the first news toconvince us that something    serious was afoot but there was not the slightest suggestion that the italians in albania had suffered any unpleasantness the upshot of all the credible news was that the king was adamant against the italian demands and was supported by his ministers parliament and above all by the peoplefor two davs the italiancontrolled albanian national bank had ceased to sell or give drafts in foreign currencv the albanian currency had for some time been at three gold francs to the dollar and  per cent covered bv gold the gold seems to be deposited in italymaundy thursday april the ameri can technical adviser to the italian oil fields at kucove near berat   said that  italians had just been evacuated to the port of valona so far as we know there have been no threats o   italians in any part of albania so that their evacuiation can only have been intended to lend colour to italian storics of disorders no damage even to the oil wells and the pipe line to the coastalbanian reservists had instructions where to report when called up but  when thcy report thev are told to wait this waiting with thc growing fear that the italians are coming and  that the government may capitulate weighs heavily upon the peoplein the afternoon   the italian air force made a mass demonstration over tirana presumably to help the albanians to make up their minds we counted  sofar frorm being intimidated the people of tirana crowded to the square    calling on the government to resist they also called for the release of the antifascist albanians who had been arrested as  com munists    mehdi frasheri who was prime minister in  in a government regarded bv the albanians as the best in recent times but which only survived a year emerged from his retirement   he invited the demonstrators furious at the italian show of force to enrol as volunteers thousands signed their names  mainly youthstechnical school students and othersand also peasants and working towns people of all ages the volunteers then formed into long columns with albanian flags and marched towards the palace european clothes both neat and ragged the peaked caps of the students the short jackets homespun trousers and white felt fezzes of peasants from the valleys and mountains all mingled in the columns stretching away down the streets as far as the eve could see the marchers were eager con fident that they would be given arms and per fectly selfdisciplinedat the palace gates the volunteers sent a depu tation to the king to beg that they be armed and organized for resistance after  minutes the deputation came out of the palace and reported that the issues were not vet decided but that the people would be called on and armed if neces sary at  next morningthe landingapril good friday now called blackfriday by the albaniansat  am troops were landing in durazzo bay they were being fired on by the albanians and the ships were shelling the town the telephone was cut by shellfire soon afterwards italian planes flew over the city dropping thousands of ieaflets in albanian which spoke of the venality of the government the agelong friendship of italy and the futility of resistance tirana was very stillat it oclock mehdi frasheri broadcast an appeal to the world to help his nation of a million people against fascist italy with her  her guns airplanes and tanks he appealed to the people of italy not to follow the fascists aloni the path of barbarism the tirana radio broadcast a telegram from him to the duce concluding  the twentiethcentury albanians are resolved to die   we havetaken your words to heart a nation that does notgdefertd jtself does not deservein ih t fte nwe hcard that the italian troops had landed sinmultaneously at four points along the coast and that the most serious resistance was at duraizo here marines and troops disernbarked on the wharf and advanced in close forma tion expecting no resistance when the albanian machineguns opened fire they were mown down twice they were driven back before the ships got into position and started shelling the town the third land ing was successful and fierce handtohand fighting broke out in the streets on the albanian side there were about  troops and  gendarmes and the cadets of the gendarmerie school these fought bravely the hero of the batile was a mare who continued firinghis machine gun for  hours in spite of concentrated swellingrifle fire and strafing from the airin tirana we heard that the town might be bombed if rsistarice continued on thc radio we heard king zogs proclania tion to the albanian people urging them to resist that was shortly before he followed his queen to greece and the government fledowing to their governments inability to supply arms to the people the prolonga tion of organized resistance has been impossibleapril  eastcr evevery fewpeople were in the strects to see the soldiers and tanks come in planes are flying con stantly overhead radio bari was moved to report that everywhere the people were welcoming the itatians in a friendly and even enthusiastic way it did not strike radio bari as inconsistent that it had announced only yesterday that nb italian life was safe in albania dangerous hostility chanrged to enthusiastic friendship overnightwhy are we here april we have heard that the albanian army had retired to burel behind kruja skanderbegs aricient capital and to the elbasacn moun tains but in tirana it is virtually impossible to find out what is going on in thehterior when we tried to drive outof town towards elbasan at midnight the troop sposted on theroads told us it was darigerousto go on so far there seemsto have been no misconduct by the italians they are on the whole trying to win favour and have told the enemies of the old regime even the  communists that they will henceforth be free every offlice and shop is being obligatorily supplied with photo graphs of victor emmanuel and musso lini liberatoiofalbania to take the place of the pictures of zg there are now posters up all over the town saying that thne handtobreast albanian salute is the salute of the mexican communist party and must therefore be givenup in favour of the fascist salutethe bewilderment of the common italian soldier is marked many of them did not know where they were going when they left italy others understood that they were to make a friendly visit at albanias invitation such remarks as  if the albanians do not want us why are we here   have been heard a number of times the common soldiers as opposed to the blackshirts realize that they are definitely not wanted and are trying to befriend the albanian peopleapril when the albanian con stituent assembly met yesterday ostensibly so that they could decide on a new government and offer the crown of albania to the wing of italy the com lnuiqu given to the press was clearly not the one intended forpublication for the edition containing it was immediately confiscated the copy had been handed to the press by mistakejfor it showed the date april  and bore the signatures of the italian minister and secretary of legation although it was supposed to be an albanian government statement issued on the th  everybody is asking why the italians are really here they were getting virtually all they could expect to get as it was new airfields are being built at durazzo valona scutari c and the tiraria field is being doubled in size can all this be required to  restore order  in albania  one of the most significant things that has happened in tirana since the italians came is the organization of  spontaneous  demonstrations to demand the return of thi albanians occupying rich agriculturai lands across the northern frontiers in yugoslavia
