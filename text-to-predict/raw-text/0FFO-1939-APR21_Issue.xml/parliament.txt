the home secretary whether his attention had been drawn to the pronounce ments of certain licensing benches against the playing of darts and other innocent and skilful games on licensed premises what was the statutory authority by which licensing justices were able to veto such activities and whether be would draw the attention of all licensing benches to the report of the royal commis sion on licensing  which found that games music and the like had a definite value as distractions from the mere business of drink ing and expressed the hope that steps would be taken to secure the discontinuance of any policy of discouragement of lawful games in licensed premisessir s hoarei have seen reports of a statement recently made by the liverpool licensing justices on this subject section  of the licensing consolidation act  prohibits gaming that is the playing of games for money or moneys worth on licensed premises but licensing justices have no power to veto any lawful games and i am in general agreement with the views expressed by theroyal commission as to the desirability of encouraging such games  as a distraction from the mere business of drinking hear hear in certain cases however in view of the special difficulties experienced by the licensees in theirarea in preventing gaming licensing justices have i believe expressed disapproval of theplaying of any games on licensed premises and i am informed that this is what occurred re cently in liverpool i have no reason to doubt that licensing benches generally are well aware of the recommendation of the royal commission and in any case i am glad to thinkthat my hon friends question has called attention to the position hear hearmr kirby liverpool everton lab asked if the right hon gentleman was aware that

minister if he was now in a position to make any further state ment with regard to the policy of the govern ment in relation to a ministry of supplymr chamberlain edgbaston u his majestys government have decided that a bill should be introduced as soon as possible to set up a ministry of supply under a minister who will be a member of the cabinet the bill introduced to give effect to this decision will be so framed as to enable a ministry of supply in the full sense to be set up for the time being however the scope of the new ministry will be confined by administrative action to the following matters it will deal with the problems of armysupply considerably expanded as they have been by the recent decisions to increase the strength of the army the ministry will take over responsibility for certain stores of general user which the war office at present already supplies to other government depart ments including certain civil defence requirements it is intended that this system should be progressively extended as found desirable the new ministry will also take overresponsibility for the acquisition and maintenance of the reserves of essential metals and other raw materials required in connexion with the defence pro grammesthe branches to be transferred from the war office to the new ministry will include the branches responsible for research design and

of transport mr burgindepartmental rivalrymr attlee limehouse labmay i ask the prime minister why it is not proposed to extend the minister of supplys activities so as to deal with other departments than the war office seeing that the question especially of the rivalry between the departments on priority schemes which was dealt with in the last war with the ministry of munitions had caused so much trouble until that ministry of munitions was set up mr chamberlainthe reason is that at the present time the arrangements for supply in the case of the admiralty and the air force are working extremely well and it is felt that to interfere with these arrange ments might have the effect of reducing instead of increasing output i have explained that the powers in the bill will enable a ministry of supply in the full sense to be set up any time we thought it desirablemr atleewill the title and scope of the bill be such that this house will be able to extend it by amendment in order to cover the full provision of a ministry of supply which has been urged so often mr chamberlainyes i think it willmr graham whitewill the minister of supply not have the general power of deciding

transport should continue to hold his present office as well and whether it is proposed to protect the needs of local authorities as to their requirements in relation to civil defence mr chamberlain

neces sity for the careful allocation of manpower for military service and industrial production respectively he would request the industrial panel to make a second report immediately with recommendations as to the wider use or expansion of industrial plants for the manu facture of munitions and as to the necessity for establishing some authority to settle the priority of the arms manufacture for the three fighting services and the civil defence depart mentmr chamberlain said that most of the objects which sir a gridley had in mind would be secured by the decision of the government to set up a ministry of supply to deal par ticularly with the problems arising out of the expansion of the land forcesthe anglogermanfellowshipmr v adams leeds w u asked the home secretary

constable that in this matter bootle was merely following other towns and whether he would issue instructions to all police forces to discontinue this practicesir s hoarel am notaware that any such

particular incident at bootle i have obtained a report from the chief constable who informs me that this special procedure was allowed because if the witnesses had been identified by certain persons present among the audience in the court they might have been in dangerof personal violence i realize the objections if this practice were commonly adopted and i am in further consultation with the chief constable on the subjectdeep shelter policyprotection at vitalpointssir j anderson lord privy seal scot tish universities nat in reply to mr graham white and mr noel baker derby lab saidthe gbverrnnent are nowvin a position to announce their policy in regard to the provision of heavily protected shelters against air attack but before stating the conclusionsarrivedat i should like to summarize the various stages in thedevelopment of the governments shelter policy so that the matter may be viewed as a whole and in proper perspective the house may recollect that on novem ber  last the home secretary indicated that it would be the policy of the governmnent to provide protection against splinter blast and the fall of debris for all in vulnerable areas who could not fairly be expected to provide it for themselves a fortnight later after certain preliminary work had been carried out depart mentally i called to my aid in settling the details of this policy three engineers of great eminence recommended for this purpose at my request by the president of the institution of civil engineersthese engineers working in conjunction with the technical advisers of my department pre sented their report on december  and before the house rose for the christmas recess i made a detailed statement of the means by which effec was to be given to that policy and of the special exchequer assistance to be made avail able it will be recalled that the policy in volved the adoption of a variety of expedients according to the varying conditions under which protection had to be provided as the house knows the first item in that policy com prised the distribution on a very large scale of a simple type of portable steel shelter suitable for erection in the gardens or yards of two storey dwellinghouses the distribution of these shelters began onfebruary  and has proceeded at a rate substantially in excess of the estimates orininally made by the enrgineers already over  unit shelters capable of sheltering up to  people have been distributed and distribution will for the future proceed at an accelerated ratepractical teststhe next itemconsisted in the strengthening of suitable basements it had been hoped that the execution of this part of the policy would proceed with equal expedition but it soon became clear that grave doubts were enter tained in certain quartersdoubts based partlv on an irterpretation or misinterpretation of experience in spain and partly on considera tions of a more technical characterwhether basements could in fact be made reasonably fafe bv the methods proposed i felt there fore that before proceeding to action on a large scale it was essential that these doubts should be cleared up by further investigation and practical terts the necessary experiments were at once taken in hand under the euidance of thethree engineers already referred to they have necessarily taken time as the results of each test had to be studied and interpreted before the next could be arrangzed the last testwas completed only a fortnight ago the result has been to demonstrate the soundness of the strengthening device proposedaccordingly steps were taken on april  to place the first orders for material which had necessarily been held in abeyance pending the results of these tests and simultaneously with rhe collaboration of the professional institutions and of the trades concerned in building and civil engineering work an organization has been created to assist the local authorities in carrying out as speedily as possible the survevs and subseouent structural work not only for the strutting of suitable basemnents but for the execution of the various alternative courses recomrnended in the engineers report in cases in which neither the portable shelter nor the strutted basement could provide a satisfactory solutionthe finsbury schemethere remained the ouestion of the deen or heavilv protected shelter whichas  have explained to the house on previouisoccasions would be in addition to and not in stibstitu tion for any part of the policy of lighter pro tection on wvhich the gvernment have already determinedwhen my department came to grips wyith that problem it speedily became clear that both technical and nontechnical considerations of great complexity were involved and that while certain broad conclusions could be formulated at once further technical investiga tions of a fundamental character would be essential before a final judgment could be put forward with any confidence as the basis of a practical policy for example the data available in this country or from sources abroad were markedly deficient in regard to such matters as the physical characteristics ofwhat is known as blast and its physiological effects and the effect of concussion on struc tures buried or partly buried in the earththe resources of an enlarged and strength ened research department were brought to bear on these problems and at the same time various projects which had been submitted for my consideration includirig what is known as the finsbury scheme and certain proposalsfor car park shelters were submitted for examina tion and advice to independent experts of the highest standing taking advantage of the time which these investigations would in evitably occupy i thought it desirable to con vene a special conference to assist me by bringing under independent review all the con siderations nontechnical as well as technical which bear upon the problemthe hailey reportgovernment decisionsthat conferencewhich met under the chairmanship of lord hailey and included mr g hicks for whose ready collaboration  am very gratefulhas now submitted a most comprehensive and valuable report this has been laid before parliament and copies are available in the vote office hon members will find in the report itself a full statement of the considerations which the con ference took into account and i need only state the decisions which the government have reached after considering the report and the results so far available of the various technical investigations to which i have referred these are as followsfirst no grounds are shown for departing from the policy of blast and splinter proof protection already announced and sum marized earlier in this statement and the government will accordingly make every effort to assure its being carried out as speedily as possible in vulnerable areassecond an attempt to provide bomb proof shelters on any general scale would prove impossible in practice and would be a mistaken policythird there is a case for providing heavily protected shelter for certain key points and certain vital servicesfourth technical advice will be afforded as speedily as possible to industrialists and others as to the form or forms which such shelters might takethese are the governing decisions which have been taken in this matter broadly the government have accepted the principles of the report of the hailey conference though there remain a number of points on which further consideration is required in parti cular it will rest with the government to indicate through the appropriate depart ments in what cases more heavily protected shelter is considered desirable in the interests of all concerned this will present a difficult problem of selection but it is hoped that by proceeding first with the most obvious and urgent cases a solution representing a fair balance of considerations will be worked out in the meantime the government earnestly hope that all concerned will proceed as rapidly as possible with the provision of shelter proof against blast splinter and the fall of debris for all people in areas exposed to risk whether at their work in their homes or in the streetsproposed powerssufficientmr graham whitemay i ask the right hon gentleman whether the powers pro posed in the bill at present under consideration by the house will be sufficient to enable
