the country safe from the dangers of aggression was expressed by sir granville gibson mp the reelected president in his presidential address to the seventyninth annual meeting of the asso ciation of british chambers of conmnerce at the hotel victoria wc yesterday we shall be prepared to support him with our lives and also give our financial assistance to the fullest extent in any policy which he recommends to his majesty designed to protect the british empire and to defend the liberties of the british people against direct or indirect attack by any foreign nation he declared speaking personally and also as president of the association he regarded it as unpatriotic if any political party or section of a party attempted to undermine the confidence of the country in the prime minister while he en deavoured to carry out a sound policy designed for our protection he protested against the veiled attacks on mr chamberlain and his colleaguesa new vigour had been introduced into our rcarmament scheme which while imposing a very heavy financial burden on the country met with their entire approval as a proper step towards the maintenance of peacebefore the presidential address the meeting sent a loyal message to the king sir ronald matthews sheffield was appointed deputy presidentexport rightsafter referring to the need for the govern ment to use every means to retain for our ex port trade a right of entry in the china market and the importance of fostering an increasing amount of trade between spain and this country the president referred to the disturb ing effect throughout the exporting nations of the world of lack of confidence thiscountry being most seriously affected there could be nto improvement in trade so long as the world remained in a state of unrest and uncertaintyone of the most insidious forms of com petition was that of subsidized exports alicy practised mainly by germany and italy vo meet the difficulties in foreign markets of subsidized exports and uneconomic com petition a deputation representing business interests recently visited germany and an agreement was signed between them and the reichsgruppe industrie with the best inten tions possible in their desire to foster a freer flow of world trade between the two countries the industries negotiated for represented only  per cent of the volume of the export trade of this country their desire was to know what was to happen to the other  per cent too small or too varied in their character to be included in such an agreementcommenting on the unemployment problem as probably our principal domestic difficulty he referred to the statement that there were  people unemployed as  a bald crude statement which is misleading and requires analysis the figures given pre sented an accurate statistical picture but not a tiueone most of the total were un employed temporarily not permanently only  had been unemployed for more than a year continuously to quote the higher figure was to create a false impression at home and in the minds of customers and competitors all over the world that we were still in a perjod of deep depression whereas today there were more people in employment than at any time in the history of the country he demanded accuratej facts presented so as to avoid selfdeception on a lproblerrm serious enough without thev addition of distortiondomestic servicelt was preposterous continued sir granville gibson that with  unemployed women and girls there should be still a large unfilled demand for women and girls for domestic service in industries such as the clothing industry too there was a definite shortage of female labour at good rates of paya reflection of incompetency upon those concerned whether govcrnment officials or trade union kaders it was the duty of labour leaders if they were critical of domestic service con ditions to work with the government depart ment concerned to find a solution of the problem wellpaid work was waiting for these women and girls and they would miss the training in household skill which they would need when they married and had homes of their ownthere were training centres provided in con nexion with the catering trades yet unemployed men and boys were not offering themselves though they are needed in those trades the government and labour leaders should in vestigate the justification of those unemployed who remained so at their own wish and find a remedy gainful work was waiting a large number of them yet it was true to say that some of these people were voluntarily without worka shortage of labour existed to meet the demands of agriculture horticulture and private outofdoor service yet some of it was filled by irishimported labour which de canped at the first suspicion that they might be called upon for defence service this im ported irish labour fell back on the english dole after having been over in england long cnough to qualify for the dole they deprived our people of work and took unemployment pay out of the english taxpayer he suggested as a condition of the continuation of payment of unemployment benefit to ablebodied and physically fit workpeople who had exhausted their contributory benefits that they should undertake some kind of national servicesuggested policyemployers on their part must provide as much work as possible their contribution was to be found in the adoption by the government of the policy enunciated in their report on export trade  if and when this policy is adopted in its entirety by the government he concluded  we believe it will usher in a new era of prosperity for the home trades and an expansion of freer world trade in foreign marketsa resolution was adopted drawing attention to the great importance of welldevised and efficiently organized propaganda in empire and foreign markets on behalf of the british export trade compared with the propaganda with which they were faced today said mr r streat manchester in proposing the resolu tion british propaganda was little more than a candle in the beam of a searchlightsir ernest simon stockport said that in scandinavia they were overwhelmed with german propaganda  there is still too much of the eton and oxford tone about our diplo matic service he said he quoted the case of a man who had been appointed minister to a country who greeted a meeting of busi ness men with the remark  i am very glad to meet you fellows but i may as well tell you that i know nothing about business and ram too old to learn it ought to be un thinkable that such a thing could happen he urged the fusion of the consular and diplo matic service it ought to be impossible for any ambassador to talk like thatin a resolution welcoming the civil defence proposals it was pointed out that it operated iqnfairly by way of discrimination between firms in vulnerable and nonvulnerable areas that the exchequer grant should be not less than  per cent of the expenses entailed in view of the statutory obligations involved andin order to spread over the taxpaying com munity as a whole expenditure incurred in the national intcrest the resolution was not voted upon but referred to the executive councilthe compilation of a complete national register  an early revision of the existing trade agreement with russia with more favourable terms to britain than at present and the sug gestion that imported goods suspected of being subsidized should be the subject of additional duty equal to the subsidy before the ordinary duty is assessed were matters included in resolutions passed before the meeting ad journed until this morning
