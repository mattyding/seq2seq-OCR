duce and mrrooseveltitalys peacefuloccupation exhibitionfrom our own correspondentrome april signor mussolini has contrived a very astute reply to president roosevelt the occasion was a gathering held this morning at the governorate of rome on the capitol to launch a new phase in the preparations for the world exhibition which is to be held outside rome in speaking to a large audience consisting mainly of fascists associated with the organization of the exhibition but includ ing also members of the diplomatic corps the duce said that the energies of the whole nation would be concentrated during the next three years on the task of making the exhibition worthy of rome and worthy of fascist italy already  workmen were busy on the site all the nations of the world had been in vited italys share would include build ings of the proportions of st peters and the colosseum which would remain as permanent memorials of the fascist era throughout the ages that being so it was ridiculous to suppose that she was cherishing aggressive designssignor mussolini spoke with studied restraint in a tone of gentle mockery and accompanied his sarcasm with facial ex pressions which delighted his audiencethis is the beginning of a  mobilizationhe said but do not let those beyond our frontiers be alarmed at this the mobiliza tion is quite a peaceful and unwarlike one and there are no arms involved other than picks and shovels if we had any intention of setting the world ablaze we should not be harnessing ourselves to a task so enormous if in spite of the stormclouds which weigh on the horizon we have dared to start and go on with this work cheerfully it ought to be considered a hopeful sign and as proof that we do not want to attack anyone but only to get on with our jobfate of conferencesconsequently it is highly unjust and from every point of view unjustified that an attempt should be made to put the two axis countries in the dock equally absurd is the scheme for mutual year guarantees not to mention the colossal geographical errors made by persons the duces eyebrows rose here like george robeys who have the most rudi mentary notions of european affairs as for the  superconference  suggested at which the united states would play its customary part of distant spectator experience has taught us the bitter lesson that the more people there are at a conference the more certain is its failureit was time he continued to silence the scaremongers the prophets of catastrophe and the professional pessimists who often used some magniloquent slogan to disguise their fears and their hatred and to defend interests which they could not well admit in public italians would not allow thetnselves to be impressed by newspaper campaigns and by m liessianic messages their conscience was clear and they had the men and means with which to defend the peace of the worldhe went on to describe the exhibition which he said was intended to be an epitome of the efforts of all civilized peoples for progress every italian must feel it his duty to work for it he described the great arch of aluminium more than ft high which is to span the centre of the exhibition and which is evidently con ceived as a permanent monument to be as characteristic of fascist rome as the eiffel tower is of modern pariswe like to imagine this arch he said as a symbol of the human will bent to achieve peace based on the firm and durable founda tioiis of a justice which reconciles its eternal laws with those of human existencethis was a fine flourish and one could not help feeling that signor mussolini had justified himself very artfully for turning down president roosevelts proposal it was a relief to hear him in such a definitely pacific vein and the world will no doubt be thankful for it it must be noted how ever that in speaking of the peaceful mobilization of italy for the exhibition signor mussolini forgot to explain the mobilization of the  italians who are now under armsinequality of wealth in one passage signor mussolini implied that a formal reply might be sent to washington it looks as if rome and berlin had not quite made up their minds on this point and as if some means were being sought to suggest officially on behalf of the axis that the way to peace lies through a better distribution of the worlds riches among the nations which can best use them the giornale ditalia com menting on the speech harps on this idea italy it says only wants to work and asks for the means to do so senator alberto pirelli the well known indus trialist addressing yesterday the general meeting of the association of limited companies brought up the same themehe said that just as inequality of wcalth and opportunity between the classes very often ied to revolutions so similar inequality between the nations was calculated if not peaceably adjusted to lead to explosions of a much graver characterit will be recalled that dr azzolini governor of the bank of italy touched on the same idea in his annual address a few weeks ago it is a matter which is evidently seriously exercising the minds of leading men in italy who have no con nexion with politicslord perth who will be giving up the embassy and leaving rome next monday will have a farewell interview with signor mussolini tomorrowamerican reactions to signor musso linis speech are
