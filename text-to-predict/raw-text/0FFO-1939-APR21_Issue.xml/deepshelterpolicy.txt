deep shelterpolicythe governmentsdecisionprotection for keypointswestminster thursdaythe decision of the government on deep shelters as a part of air raid pre cautions was disclosed by sir hn anderson in the house of commons to day the kernel of his long statement recounting what had been done already to ensure means of protection was that an attempt to provide bombproof shelters on any general scale would prove impossible in practice and would be a mistaken policy there was a case however for providing heavily protected shelter for certain key points and certain vital services and technical advice would be afforded as speedily as possible to industrialists and others about the form or forms which such shelters might takeno grounds had been shown srit jotn anderson said for departing fromn the policy of blast and splinter proof pro tection the distribution of a simple type of portable steel shelter began on february  and had proceeded at a rate substantially in excess of the original estimates over  shelters capable of sheltering up to  persons had been distributed and future distribution would be at an accelerated ratethe tests of methods for strengthening suitable basements had demonstrated the soundness of the proposed devicebroadly the government had accepted the principles recommended in the report of the conference of which the chairman was lord hailey but a number of points awaited further considerationadvice to lordprivy sealno  per cent safetythe report of the lord privy seals conference on air raid shelters a detailed summary of which appears on page  discusses the question as a part of civil defence policythe report is opposed to the provision of deep or bombproof shelters for the whole civil population among the argu ments advanced is that their provision would mean the diversion of material effort and money from active defence to passive defence active defence by keep ing the enemy away from their objectives can not only protect directly the lives of the inhabitants but can protect also their homes and the factories means of food supply public services and the like on which both the prosecution of war and the livelihood of the nation dependspeedy accessthe report considers that it is not beyond the competence of engineers to construct a shelter whose inhabitants would be safe when they are within it the real difficulty is to construct a shelter system which would guarantee speedy and sufficient access to the population which would want to make use of it the safetv of a shelter the report insists is the pro duct of its security plus its accessibility under the conditions of short warning which must be assumedif experience in barcelona has taught any thing it is the danger to persons thronging the streets and it is unnecessary to dwell on the situation tht would arise if a considerable proportion of the public were left still itrug gling towards their refuges as hostile raiders appeared overhcanother reason advanced against deep public shelters is the time of construction the  ramified form of shelter galleries or tunnels under streets corresponding with the distribution of population is considered safer than the  focal  shelter large shelters at various places to hold large numbers of people but even the ramified shelter in its most speedily con structed form tunnels of lft in diameter which could be excavated with plant already available would require two years for the construction of  miies of tuinels in londonand this lengtn of tunnel would shelter only  persons moreover the report records the con viction that  the universal provision of strongly protected shelters would be far from making the community  per cent safesafer at homethe kind of shelters favoured by the report are dispersed shelters to give pro tection against blast splinters and the fall of ddbris where people live and where they work the report endorses the advice already given to the lord privy seal about the value of the steel shelter covered with earth and the design for strengthened basements these  represent the means by which measures affording a consider able degree of protection can be completed within a reasonable time the time factor here is of  crucial importancespecial protection is urged for essential defence activities such as surgical services communications nd battle headquarters and also for key workers in essential occupationsthe cost is declared to be of relative rather than absolute importance in an issue of such vital concernthe report points to the researches being made into blast earth shock and allied questions arising out of the detona tion of large bombs at close quarters and also into the physiological effects of blast practical experiments on these subjects have been in progress for some time and wider fields of research are continuously being opened up under the direction of the research and experiment division of the air raid precautions department under dr r e stradlingit is of paramount importance says the report that alternative methods other than garden shelters or strutted basements should be devised suited for application to areas where neither of the other methods can be applied
