army serviceoverseatour reduced tofour yearsoffer to reserviststwo further arrmy changes were announced yesterdaythe introduction of a reduced tour of foreign service and the offering to reservists of an opportunity to rejoin the coloursthe army council the war oflice states have always considered a reduction in the length of time spent by the soldier on foreign service in india and at other oversea stations to be necessary in the best interests of the regular army formerly the soldier had to complete six years foreign service before he was entitled to apply for transfer to the homecstablishment because of the difficultics of drafting this period could be and often was extended up to another year making seven years continuous foreign service in all men were heldfor this extra year under a special provision of the army act such long periods spent away from home were unpopular in the army and bad a very unfavourable effect on recruiting recruits would not come because the foreign tour was too long but the tour could not be shortened without more recruitsin  the practice of holding men for an extra year was discontinued although this was a good beginning the state of recruiting was not yet favourable enough to allow of any reduction in the normal foreign service tour of six years today recruiting has im proved sufficiently to enable the substantial reductions notified by the secretary of state for war in his recent speech on the estimates to be put into effect the extent of these reductions has been notified in an army council instructionhome soonerthe intention of the instruction is to ensure that all warrant officers noncommissioned officers and men proceeding abroad on a normal tour of foreign service as from next trooping season season  will be brought home again not later than the troop ing season  this means that the normal tour of foreign service will be four years those now serving abroad will also benefit as they will come home earlier by yearly batches beginning with those who have bcen out longest so that by the end of troop ing season  all personnel on foreign service should be on a four years tour or lessit must be understood that it is sometimes necessary to send units on the home establish ment on temporary duty oversea eg palestine and that personnel serving in those units  cannot usually count such oversea service towardstheir normal four years tour abroad in these circumstances some soldiers may seriie more thian four years continuously abroadwhen hovr a soldier has completed a fouryear tour abroad and is due to be posted to his home service unit which is on tem porary duiy oversea and which is not expected back in the united kingdom during the same trooping season he will be given three months furlough in this country before joining his unit on temporary service oversea or if this is impracticable such furlough willbe granted at the first opportunity afterwardsreservists optportunityin order to enable more soldiers to make the army a career and in order to fill esta blishments the following measures have been taken as an experimentany soldier subject to a good character and efficiency now serving
