raising productionof equipmentpowers over industryfrom our parliamentary correspondentthe governments decision to create a ministry of supply with a cabinet minis ter at its head was well received yesterday in the house of commons this develop ment had come to be regarded by all parties as an inevitable consequence of the great expansion of the territorial army now in progress although the scope of the new ministrys activities is to be limited at present the task which mr burgin is to undertake will be formidable enough and the exercise of his powers will have an important effect on industryit was indicated by the prime minister that the bill to be laid before parliament will include provisions designed to secure priority for government orders it seems probable that the powers to be taken will also enable the minister to require the execution of government contracts by particular firms so that as great a manu facturing capacity as is needed may be at the disposal of the servicessupply councilthe immediate object of the minister will be to raise production for the army to the scale necessary to equip the new forces now being recruited it is expected that the whole of the existing supply organization at the war office will be transferred lo the new ministry together with responsibility for all war office arsenals and factories many details have yet to be settled but the minister wiu pro bably be assisted by a supply council on which the war office will be repre sentedthe equipment of the army presents a special problem until the early part of this year the organization of supply for the army had been related to the needs of only five divisions then it was announced that new considerations made it advisable to form a field force of  divisions equipped for use on the continent if the need should arise within the past few weeks it has been decided to expand the territorial army on a scale which will make it possible to have a field force of  divisions the armys original plan of reequipment had been substantially carried through in  years but the demands which have now to be met con fronted the war office with difficulties which it was impossible to overcome under existing arrangementsprogressive extension the war office has been responsible for supplying certain requirements of the admiralty and the air force including naval guns and certain types of ammu nition the new ministry will take over responsibility for these supplies as well as for some of the supplies required for civil defence in general the navy and the air force have solved their own supply problems very effectively but there will be a progressive extension of the organ ization of supplies common to the three services by the new ministrythe power to be given to the minister of supply to secure priority for govern ment orders over civil orders will be of the greatest value hitherto the war office has not been able to do more than request employers to give such priority with the result that civil orders have often been given precedence firms supplying machine tools have been known to quote a date of delivery nearly a year from the receipt of the order not because it takes so long to produce these tools but because they were also manufacturing for theirordinary customers there have also been some difficulties about obtaining the speedy manufacture of tanksthe new minister of supply will also take over responsibility for providing the weapons and equipment needed for anti aircraft defence it is clear that the addi tional demands to be made on industry will give rise to questions of priority as betwcen the various services in his state ment yesterday the prime minister indi cated that these questions will be settled by a priority committee of ministersone of the questions which members were asking last night was whether the new minister would be able to do much effective work before the ministry of supply bill is passed through parliament it is understood however that the bill will be treated as a matter of urgency and passed as quickly as possible the new minister of transport will be appointed immediately and mr burgin will be released to begin such preparatory work as can be undertaken at once
