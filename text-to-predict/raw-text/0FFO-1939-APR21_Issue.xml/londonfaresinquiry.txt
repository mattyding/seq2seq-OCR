london faresinquirytaking a risk onpublic supportmr picks evidencewhen the railway rates tribunal resumed its inquiry yesterday into the application of the railway companies and the london passenger transport board for increased charging powers in the london suburban area mr frank pick vicechairman of the lptb was further crossexamined by mr s e pocock on behalf of surrey ratepayers organiza tions and essex local authorities mr w bruce thomas kc presidedquestioned about the boards £ renewal fund mr pick said that obsolescence was not regular but was often accidental station buildings might have a physical life of  years but actually many lasted only  years the board had been rebuilding stations all over london he did not agree that the board should have allocated less money to the renewal fund to pay interest on  c  stockquoting from the times of may   mr pocock referred to the evidence of lord ashfield chairman of the board at the omni bus strike inquiry the application if granted said mr pocock would result in an estimated addition of £ to revenue but in  lord ashfield said he doubted if any sub stantial increase could be obtained by raising fares and any alteration might have a dangerous effect on revenuemr pickit is clear that any attempt to raise the general level of fares might not be advantageous to us and we have refrained from that we have looked on this as a matter of equalization of faresovercrowding problemhe admitted that they were trying to extract more money from the public and said they would not be doing their duty if they did not income must be expandedmr pocockis it physically possible to get more money out of the public it is a risk we have to takewhatever the position was in  the chances of getting money out of the public have not improved today  i would not say the position is worse from what the times said on monday i should regard it as favourablemr pick agreed that overcrowding was straining the goodwill of the public they wanted to maintain their goodwill it was practkally impossible to lift all the traffic in the two peaks at  and  am at morden tube station but the southern railway could not give relief owing to the physical limita tions of their tracks and terminus over crowding on the romford and dagenham lines would be remedied in  by electrification and there would be double the accommodationmr pocockin the meantime would it not be advisable to postpone the increase of fares  we must have an immediate increase of revenue to mect the extra capital chargesmr jackson wolfe on behalf of the kent federation of ratepayers opposing the pro posed southern railway fare increases only also brought up the matter of overcrowding mr pick agreed that there was certain over crowding at midday and that some people took firstclass tickets to secure a seat the board was trying to eliminate firstclass except for long distancesraising capitalmr harold b williams for middlesex county council and other authorities sug gested that instead of increasing fares to pay the full interest on  c  stock the position might be met by a reduction of the rate of interest mr pkk replied that the rate of interest was fixed by act of parliament and was beyond the discussion of the board the application was not merely an attempt to get t per cent for  c  stock they were in structed to pay  per cent further it was necessary to pay such a rate as would enable them to raise additional capital on the market they could not raise  c  stock on a  per cent basis today the stock was issued on the understanding that it would receive  per cent that was a commercial rate of interest which was still justifiedin reply to mr stanley prescott for hert fordshire county council and others mr pick said he did not agree that the board should wait before raising fares for the increased revenue likely to result from the extensions in hand they had never had adequate revenue and they had waited five years when tram ways were finally displaced they would leave an outstanding capital of £ and the increased railway fares would partly be paying for the substitution of trams in londonmr c h a lewes for various objectors suggested that overcapitalization was the cause of the boards troubles and that the board should ask parliament for powers to reduce the standard interestmr pickthere is no present approach to a solution of the problem on those lines the board has not considered that aspect a foolish thingreplying to mr jack gaster for the lon don communist party and croydon labour party mr pick said that the  c  stock holders having postponed action as to a re ceivership when the last dividend was paid could not act for  monthsmr gasterthe main bulk of stock holders have received considerably more since the formation of the board than under the old companies and if they had received full in terest they would have had nearly double  yes they never have had a reasonable returnthe chairmana lot of people may think that parliament did a foolish thing but we do not have to consider if parliament sanctioned a bad bargainmr gasteri think it is relevant to see if the board has taken all possible steps before placing a burden on fares whether they have attempted to reduce an inequitable burden of interest they could go to parliamentmr pick said they still anticipated an in crease in london traffic owing to the clearance of slums and the movement of population outwards there was talk of restricting de velopment and since september people had hesitated to start new industries in london because they got rattled he thought that when the defences of london were completed it might be safer to be in london than out of itthe hearing will be continued today
