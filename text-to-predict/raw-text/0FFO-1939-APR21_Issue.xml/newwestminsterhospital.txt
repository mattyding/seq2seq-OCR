docker expressing on behalf of the governors thanks to the king for opening the hospital said it had been his pleasure and a most interesting duty to visit with members of his committee and staff many of the modern hospitals in this country and elsewhere to learn first hand of any newmethods of organization or equipment they were immenscly impressed by the vast hospital reconstruction which was going on abroad they returned convinced that the standard of comfort and service available to the in patient in modern hospitals in this country was as efficient as anywhere they had there fore adhered to the small homely wards typical of their old hospital adding single bedrooms for those needing especial quiet they were not howecver satisfied with the accommodation available even in modern hospitals for the treatment of the outpatients and in planning their new building they had departed from tradition  in this respect  one of the finest features of the new hospital was the provision of facilitieswhich should ensure a prompt and fuller medical and nursing out patient serviceensure also a better and closer cooperation with the private doctoraiich could not fail to be of benefit to the outpatient it was their ambition to pro vide group if not individual appointments for consultations and for outpatient treat menttheir appeal for the last £ had been met to the extent of £ there were a number of friends of the hospital who had not for a variety of reasons yet had an oppor tunity of subscribing to the fund in order to give them this opportunity and at the same time to earn the generous grant of the kings fund sir edward meyerstein had joined with him in guaranteeing the balance and so he was in a position to tell his majesty in the presence of many generous donors that the cost of their £ project had been met in full mr docker in conclusion said he de sired to express his heartfelt thanks to the small committee which had borne the brunt of this gigantic task and in
