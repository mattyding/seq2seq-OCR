central criminal courtthee sessions being the first during the present mayoralty comumenced yesterday mornng before the right hon the lord mayor the recorder alderen sir c marshall dgibbs and  johnson the sheriffs undersheriff nd usual civic authonitiejin his charge to the grand jury the recorde said from the appearance of the calendar he was apprehensive that the cases to be submitted for their investigation woeld not fall short of  in it there were comprised two charges of rape and two of murder and some depositions had also been re turned to the court involving another charge of murder he should abstain from maldng any comments upon the facts of thoe cases being anxious not to prejudice their minds or antidipate the proofs which would be taid before them bat he was of opinion that after hearing the evidence they would deem it necessary to put the cases in a train of inves tigation before the petty jury although the caleadar was very heavy both in pointcf number and the nature of the offences still it frequently occurred that cases most severe in themselves were most simple in the facts and did net in volve any difficulties with respect to the law and such appeared to be the case in the present instance amongst other prisoners however he found the names of three persons charged with being  accessories be fore the fact it might be necessary to explain that an accessory before the fact as described by lord hale was a person absent at the time the felony was committed but who counselled and procured others to commit the felony and the same leared authority held that a mere tacit acquies cence did not constitute an accessorv althourh the nersonmign oe cnarged witt isrision of treason or felony there fore it would be seen thlt a person in order to be held as am accessory must be actually engaged in procurng and comun selling others to commit tbe felony with respect to the other cases in the calendar although they were very nume rous and branched into almost every species of crime still as they appeared of an ordinary character it would be unnecessary for him to detain them by any observations thereonthe grand jury then retired to their room to proceed
