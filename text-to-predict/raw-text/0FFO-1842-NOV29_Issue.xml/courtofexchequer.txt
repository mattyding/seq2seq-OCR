when the juy agreed to a speial case which embodied the facts which we have sady mentioned and which came on subsequently to be argued in the court of queens beacb the court bahing taken time to consider its judgment was of opinion that the gaestion between the parties was a question of fact that if the master had sufficient business as a notary and the xervices of the clerk were botea fid appued to the perform ance of that bsiness whenever they were necessay for the purpose such a qualification as the act of par liament required had been thereby obtained it had been admitted in the argument on the part of the com pany that such a serice was not in ita nature incompa tible with some leisure or with application to literary or scientifie pursuits if this were so it would fouow efortiori that a concurrent service as an attorney could not operute a a disqualification inasmch as a general imnowledgeof an attorneys buiness was absolutely uweful to a notary and calculated to render him mnore efficient in the performanoe of riotaial duties for these reaons the court of qaeens bench gave judtnment for the prosecutor utponboth the issues which hsa been the sabject of trial upon this judgment a writ of error was brought into thir court and the cse having been argueadupon a former occa sion the judgment was this morning delivered upon thethe lord chsef justrce of tbe common pleas having stated the facts of the cue the nature of the qaestions in issue between the parties and the proceedings which had already occurred in the case proceeded to state that this court was of opinion that the judgment given for the crown ought to be reversed upon both points and to be entered for the scriveners company who were the defendants in the court below his lordihip stated that it was the opinion of this court that the pert of the service as a notay which was concurrent with the service as an attor ney was not s a uservice to a notary as the act of parlia ment upon the subject required they conidered that the service as an attorney as entirely nullified the service as a notary as would a service with a sargeoa or with a hanker for the same perod the circumstance that both services occurred under the esame person and in the same houe made no difference in the prnciple and although this court agreed with the court below in thinking that the amount of actual inconvenience which would result from upholding such a service as the present was not considerable yet they thought it better to adhere to the principles which had been xlready laid down upon the same sabject in the caes which had been decided before the present forthese reasons the judgment which the coart below had given in favour of mr page would be reversed and judgment upou both issues would be entered for the crivenerep company
