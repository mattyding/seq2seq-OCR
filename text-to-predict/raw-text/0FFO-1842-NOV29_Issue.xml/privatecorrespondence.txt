unbridled pas gionrancorous accusationsand court menaces upon the part of the catalan membersin the hope to deter him from his ex pedition which theywell know must be one of punishment to those whom no forbearance can conciliate the regent has now learned by dearbought experience that his forbearance to the turbulent republicans who pnued down the curtains of the citadel last year was so much clemency thrown away and i am assured that he is now convincedthat nothing buttroeg and uncompromising measures of severity will pro duce the effect of maintaining peace in catalonia the grand object of their sympathizers here is to atop him as they did  months ago and accordingly we hear this even ing the most alarming rumours spreadfor example that the moment he leaves madrid to the care of the national militia the republicans will take advantage of the op portunity to effect a pronunciamniento in favour of the movement in barcelona that the ayuntamiento of madrid is in correspondence and accord with that of the capital of the prindipality and will lend themselves to the movement and that two regiments in arragon have revolted and have proclaimed the infante don francisco their leader
