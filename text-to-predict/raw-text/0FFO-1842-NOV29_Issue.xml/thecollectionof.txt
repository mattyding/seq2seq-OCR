tsr cxjllrcfon op tumbre venwfyibt report of the comumaanrmrs eie jrgut ron thi lords commissioners o himmlajest s y treasry cwhiteball peb  gy lodsit is net our intention in commencing the aeri ef reports relative to the several revenue departments which it vwu be our duty to lay before your lordships to enter upon a history of the various commissions of revenue inquiry waeemanastingfrm the crownalone other elothed witb parliamentary authority but sal with the same objects and all intended to produce the same seault which have been appointet duringthe last  years nor do we think it necessary to recapittlate their recommendations nor to call yu lordshipe special attention to the saving of expendi tnre in the collection of revenue which has resulted from their suggestions it is sufficient for us to remark that their labours bave been in many reipects attended with great be iiefit to the merchants s well as to the revenue and that the stablishments wvich have been framed in accordanoe with their suggestions are ouch as to leave little prospect for us to diminish expenses or to ipcrease facilities to any important extent exeepting by carefully considering how far the exist ing system of collecting and protecting the revenue may be simplified and how far it may now be safe when the several departments are well organized and their efficiency must necessarily be much augmented by the judicious introduction of promotion of the officers on account of mernt to abolish soma of tb se precautionary measures and diminish and consolidate to some extent establishments which were in tended to protect the revenue against external smuggling or internad fraud we are so well aware however of the magnitude and extent of the subjects of the inquiry which is confided to us by her majestys commission that we have resolved not to attempt at once to investigate all parts of the public establishbments connected with the collection or protection of the revenue nor to delty reporting upon them until we were in a condition to lay before your lord ships our opinion and our suggestions on the general system and practice of the several revenue departments but we de termined to proceed by investigating in detail particular branchee of the service an d to effer for your lordshipa con sideration from time to time and indeed in accordance with the directions in ourcommission our observations and recom mnendations in regard to each of these particular matterewe thus hope to acquire that thorough acquaintance with the business of the several departments and of the mode in which it is conducted as will enable us to recommend with confidesce any alterations in the management which may appear to us desirable and without hesitation to express our spprobation of all such portions of the existing system as shall seem deserving of commendation and which contribute to promote the great and important objects of public conve nience of an effective hut just collection of the revenue and of economy in the expenditure of the revenue departmentsit is with these views therefore that we have but curso rily examined into the censtitution or into the habmts of busi ness of the commissioners of the revenue boards and the practice of their superior officers but have entered upon our investigatlons by directing our attention almost exclu sively to the particular district of liverpool and more espe cially to the customs establishment in that districthaving premised thus much we shal proceed in this re port to bring under your lordships consideration the cns toms establishment at liverpool and to state the results of our inquiry into itsome however of the alterations in the conduct of the business wbich we shall submit are as applicable to all parts of the united kingdom as they are to liverpool although they are based on the suggestions which were made to us whilst we were proceeding with our inquiry in that great emporium of commercein forming the resolution to enter upon a personal investi gation into the revenue departments at liverpool we were not merely actuated by a belief that our going thither would afford us very usefal information of the way in which the business of the several revenue departments was conducted by the revenue officers in that district bat also with re spect to the most important branch that of the customs we anticipated that by affording to the members of that great mercantile community the means of laying before us their views of such alterations in the conduct of the business of the department as they were anxious to see effected we should be at once doing that which was just towards them and at the same time conducive to the interests of the publicnor can your lordships aware as you are of the importance of liverpool both in a commercial an in a fiscal point of view he surprised that we should hare selected it as the first place for local inspection and inquirythe magnitude of its commerce and the extent of its revenue establishments are so notorious that it is hardly re quis te to state them but we think it may not be inconve nient to present a general account of them together with some of their details ip aconcise form and we therefore sub join them to this report in the appendices a and blt wil appear from these statemnents that to london alone is liverpool inferior either in the exctent of its contributions to the revenue or in the amount and varied character of its tradethe customs establishment also is numerically so great and by its cost so heavy a burden upon the finances of the countrythat we felt it essential to ascertain by personal ex maination if it were not practicable to put the depatment on some other system by which greater economy mi ht be attained without diminishing the facilities at present afforded to the trade of the portwe must at once confess that we have not been able to discover that the establishment is excessive or the rates of salary with one exception only too high indeed all the representations which have reached us not merely from the oflicers but from other quarters have been in support of an increase of salarygto the inferior officers and although we do not think the reasoniag on which these applications are fonsded conclusive nor that yor lordships shonld accede to them it would appear that taing lndoa as the port of comparison the liverpool officers of the several grades re ceive less remuneration than those who are holding similar situations on the london establishmentwe cannot however admit that this forms a just cri terion of the ammunt of remuneration which the publie is to he called upon to pay to the officers at lver pool we do not intend at this time to express any opinion how far it may be practicable to reduce the salariss of the officers to he hereafter appointed to situ ations in the port of london there are considerations of the expense of lving in londonaznd of the proprietyof pay ing more libally the london officer on that account which wouldprobablyrenderan equality of payment of the officers in london with their payment in other ports unjust in its results however plausible it may appear in theory but we haive not arrived at the conclusion that the officers of any class on the liverpool eetablisbment are inadequately paid  and it must also be borne in mind that in some of the other large ports the salaries of several classes of officers are lower we shall however have occasion to recordmend a trifling alteration in the proportion of the salary and of the day pay of some of the subordinate classes of officers at liver pool but although we do not suggest any diminution of the numrier or of the pay of persons on the establishmext we certainly anticipate that should our suggestions be carried into effect the necessity of an augmentation of it which if the trade inereases as much as it maybe cenfidently hoped it will increase wonld wssuredly be requisite were the present system left unchanged will be prevented and supposing the trade should unfortunately remain stationary m amount we should exrpect that onr recommendations would very shortly enable your lordships to effect a considerable diminution in the establishmentit may be right here to remark that the system of ma nagement more especially in the outdoor department at lverpool appears to be good and the supenor officers to have a proper sense of the important duties which are in trusted to them for whilst they would seem to be zealous in the collection of the revenue they appear to have conei liated by their demeanour the feelings of the mercantile bodytwe waterguard or outdoor department is doubtlessly large in amount being about  l per annum but so lon as the practice of keeping tidewaiters on board of ves sels from the time of their reaching the port until the dis charge of their cargoes be adhered to it will be difficult if not impossible to reduce the number of theregularofficersit may indeed he s serious question upon which we at present forbear to express an opinion whether the protection which this system affiords to the revenue be adequate to its cost and whether or no some modification of it might not be effected which would be less exoeneive and not leass effcent the protection which a tidewaiter placed alone in charge of a vensel as is frequentlydone with regard to timber ships affords the revenue whilst he is asleep on hoard the vesse from  clock in the evening to s or ocock the next morning cannot be important but ere we close our investigations we propose again to advert to this subject mnerely now observmg that it is alleged that the duties dis charged hv the tidewaiter on the landing of a cargo from a ship could not be dispensed with and consequently his re manins on hoard if no protection causes hut little addi tional cnarge to the revenue but it is obvions that the pert of liverpool would be as favourable a port as any for a trial of somemodificationofthis system if such an experiment can be ventured upon with out subjecting the revenue to tooserious a riskwe munt howvever bere remark that there bas been an alteration made within a few years viz in  in respect to extra tidewaiters and weighers which without some modificatios will inevitably produce danger to the revenuewith a proper view to economy it has always been con aidered right to provide for the unexpected influx of vesels arising from pecaliar states of the wind the season of the year or other ascidental causes by employing individuals not on the regular establishment for the performance of the duties of tidewaiters and weighers paying them by the day for such days enly as they are in employment in periods of full employment their pay of i d and s a day resnectively is adequate to raise them above the petty tempta tions to whicb they must be hourly exposed and over which the inspectien of thae superior officers can exercise little onttol but as they are frequently out of employment at par tkuclr seasons of the year for several days in each week it would seem by no means uncommon for these men to be put in charge of vessels when they are in the receipt of worsewges than the commor labourer formerly this cls of meti as is now the case in all other ports ilu alone excepted was appointed by the colector out of the lu bourerr of good character connected with the place bute tbesrd of treasury in  sumed the appoint ment of extra me persons from all parts of england scotland and irland hate been nominated who were ignoran of the sort of situatio which the were aboutto fl sand quite unaware of the sml amount of pay which would frqueutly be their lot hilt they are unable evea if they were not forbidden to let other employment from their baring no connexion t the town and thus they are frequently reduced to destitution the letter of mr stewart deputy chairman of the boars of customs dated the d of march  to the private secretary of mr j e stanley then one of the secretaries of the treaury saunc tions thus changeandfsr frem desiringto blame it we are disposed to enforee the general adoptio of the principles on which it was foundel we think that the power o appoint ing officers tothe establishment should not he vested in the same parties to whom their superintendence and promotion ae intrusted the same favour which leads to the original selection will naturally though perhaps unconsciously tend to a partal viewv of their conduct but by placing the ap spointment of the offcers with one party and the superin tendeuce and the power of premotion with another impar tial discrimiunation and unbiassed judgtuent may be expected to a great degree and the meritorious officers may anticd pate the just reward of their real and exertion in the pablic servicewe do not thena propose to saggest reverting to the old mode of nominatmng extra tidewaiters and others of that class in liverpool we would leave their appointraent with your lordahips but we would press upon you the propriety that onethira instead of dnefifth of the most efficient of them and who axe best qualified by age and other circum stances for serviee should be selected so that they may be placed as cireumstances may permit on the lowest class of tidewaiters or weighers respectively on the establishment and we would also suggest that before the appointment of any person to be an extra tidewaiter c he should be pro vided with a written document explanatory of the situation to which he is to be appointed and of the conditions of his paymentfurther he should be called upon to sign this document as a proof of his having seen it with tkis precautionary warning of what they have to expect and with the prospect of a fair chance of beingeventually placed on the establish ment we think the appointment of these extra officers may with safety still be continued in your lordships but we would not suggest any interference with the collector in the choice of the second description of extra meo denominated glut men who are employed to discharge the samne duties when the business is augmented to a very extraordinary de gree and we have no fear if the regulation that the col lector should make a special report to the board of customs of the numbers of glut men requisite and of their namesbe rigidly enforced that he would either wilfully or injudiciously avail himself of this powerwe believe it to be unnecessary to impress upon the com missioners of customs the zlecessity of rigidly watching and controlling the exercise of this discretionary authority but we avail ourselves of thisaoccasion to reiterate the opinions which bave been expressed by all preceding commissioners of inquiry of the great importance of paying particular at tention to all expenses arising from the employment of fu pernumerary oficers the necessity of their employment at all should he sdhrected to that inquiry and the period of its continuance should ever be scrutinized with carwe would now direct your lordships attention to a slight alteration which we would suggest should be made in the proportionate amounts of salary and of daypay to the tide waiters the vteighers and the lockers at present each de scription ef these officers is divided into different classes with different rates of fixed salary and certain rates of pay for the days on which they are employed the object of this mode of payment is to eombine the respectability of a fixed salary with the check on idleness or a disposition to yeld too lightly to trifling indisposition which the paymentrthe days only on which he is employed necessarily pro duces on the officer there can be no doubt of the benefit which the public derives from this system of payment or of its propriety when the proportions of the fixed and of the flactuating pay are properly adjusted but when the day pay forms as is the case now with the lockers weighers and tsdewaiters a larger portion of their anneal emolu ments than their fixed salary we feel there is some hard ship inflicted on the officer without any real advantage to the public for it either causes the officers more especially those with large families to whom their daypay is so im portant to suffer severely in their incomes if they yield to iuness of an apparently trifling character or if they persevere in the execation of their duty maladies of no importance in themselves if taken in sufficient time not unfrequently becomre serious and thas a greater charge is thrown even tually on the public by the lengthened absence from their dtyfor theseofficerswhilstthey are detained from theirduty by illness which is properly substantiated receive the amount of their fixed salarg wfe are not insensible to the temptation to which we have already alluded which is offer ed to the officers of this class to make on insufficient occa sions excuses for absence from their duty on the plea of il ness when they receive their pay without deduction and without referenee to their presence or their absene hut we think by reduci g the day pay of the lockers and tidewaiters from s per diem and of the weighers from s d per diem to ts per diem giving at the same time to them a commensurate increase of their fixed salaries an act of justice would be done towards those officers and ns addi tional expense would be thrown upon the public there can be no difficulty in calculating the proportion ate increase for it is now the custom to assunme that they are employed a certain number of days in each year and on this assumed namber of days the deduction from their pay to defray their contributions to the superan nuation fund is calcalated indeed although their superau nuation allowance is eventually estimated on a similar prin ciple a trifling degree of hardship must accrue to some of these individuals by having the dedution made on their as sumed and not on their real receipts  for it not unfrequently happens to mrsany of these officers that they are not em ployed the assumed number of days in a year and thus a larger deduction is in fact made from their pay than from the pay of those officers who have a constant and fixed salarywe would now direct your lordships attention to the sa perintendence and discipline of the clerks in the indoor department which without wishing to remark upon it un fairly we think might be improved up to the end of no vember last the hoars of attendance for a large portion of the junior clerks were from  oclock in the morning until  in the afternoon as will appear from the examination by us of mr dean on the th of november last the time for the departure of these clerks from the customhouse is most properly by your lordaships minute of the th of november last extended to  oclock in the afternoon it is quite evi dent to us that no reason but that this extra hour of attend ance was more than was reqaired for the discharge of their duties could have been brought in jistificationof the official attendance of these clerks being limited to  oclock and if that reason did exist the infereuce that the establishument was unnecessarily large appears to rs irresistible oar belief however is that employment may be fonnd for the present number of clerks so that by proper arrangement and precaution the employment of supernumerary clerks need never be resorted toshould however a vacancy occar either among the esta blishment or the extra clerks it would be right to make in quiry to ascertain the state of basiness at that moment end tne propriety of filling up such vacancythe system of signing by the clerks the book of attendance in the morning would seem to be properly attended to  but we think that there is no sufficient check as to the heur of theirdepartureby the manner in which that is now attempeed to be enforced the attendancebook islefton the desk opposite the cashiers desk in the longroom and the messenger whose business it is to take i to the couector for his daily inspection stated that when he fetches it off the desk a little before  oclock in the afternoon all the signatures are not signed then but a good many are filled up afterwards  indeed he added  they are generally put in in the morning some of the clerks sign in the evening it is manifest from this that no practical check on too early a departure from their official attendance by the clerks is exercised and we there fore suggest that the messenger should carry the book round in the afternoon at the proper hour in like manner as he does in the morning and shall note the time at which he has commenced and at which he has concluded his circuit of the establishment it will then become the duty of the couector on the following day to make inquiry as to the cause of the absence before the proper hour of any of the clerks we would also remark that the general discipline of the esta blishment would be improved if the junior clerks of each branch of it were placed more directly under the control of their respective senior clerks who should be deemed respon sible for their due attendance and for the proper execution of their duties we do not by this recommendation intend to exonerate the collector or superior officers from any of that responsibility which belongs as of course to their situ ations in the department we make it to enable them to con duct the basiness with greater efficiency and to enforce method and attention to their daties amongst the junior officers we were glad to find that the colector entertains a simuilar view to our own of the advantages which may be anticipated from the proposed systemthe magnitude of the customhouse is justly put forward as one of the motives for this proposition for it is assuredly of such a size as to make the personal superintendence of tke collector much less easy than if in the construction of the bulding adaptation to what was required rather than to magnificence in appearance had been more attentively con isideredhaving closed the remarks which we have felt it to be our duty to make upon the establishment generallywe must now call year lordships attention to the salary and emoluments of the present collector bat in so doing we neither desire to interfere with his enjoyment of them nor to throw any slur upon am mot valuable public officer but we do wish to record our opinion that thc total sum  per annum which he receives exceeds the proper amount of remune ration for any collector of liverpool who may be hereafter appointedr arnaud was placed in the eitustion in   his pre decessor from various sources was supposed to receive from his offleial situation emoluments of  or  per an num the office was put on an entirely new footing and a salary of  per annum was appended to it bat as the couector of the customs revenue was also to be appointed to the collection of the light dues on a per centage allowance it was expected that his emoluments from that source weuld be considerable at the same time he was guaranteed to re ceive from the crown all that these emoluments feu short ofl per annum thas in reality he was assured of an official income of  per annum in fact however he is now in the annual receipt of namely  fromthe crown and  from his net emoluments as collector of the light dues we believe tlat in no instance has therown had to pay more than the  per annum the net emoluments on the light dues having always produced  perannmum and latterly having increased to  per we do not here intend to go into a minute history of the causes of this increase or of the circumstances which in duced the trinityhouse authorities onl the transference of the colection of the light dues to tthem to continue an allowance of  per cent to their collector at liverpool instead of  per cent as was in the first instance intended they seem to be actgated in this determination by a sense ef justice to mrr arnaud and an indispmition to call upon thepublic to pay any portionof the guaranteedloo per annum nor do we intend to suggest the precise course to be pur sued whenever bytmr arnauds ceaming to b coluector the ap poitment of his sucessor shall come under considerwe eitawily think that the union of the duties of collec tor of the cstoms and of collector of the duties under tbe trinityhoue is advantageous and it is certainly eonvenient to the paie who bve to asa paymarts we sbould besorry therefore at any tiue to see thlem disuniied it is also but just tht the additional labour and responuibility which thus devolves on the collector shocd be properlg re amunerated aud we are of opinion that the offcial income of the collector should be uich as to enable him to devote the whole of his time to the official duties of the two situativas and tiu to hold such a position inliverpjol as wil insure to him that consideration and respect which is so eential to their satisfactory and efficient dischage and although we are wel aware of the somewhat delicate and difficult task of arranging the roportions which sbould be paid by the crown and the trityhouse respectivey we would not shrink from offering onr opimon on this subject if the case were ouie to be immediately decided upon but various �ir caumstances may arise to render a resommerdation now made on good grounds improper at the moment when it might have to be adoptedwe will therefore only express generally our disappro bation of a fututre colector receiving emoluments exceeding in the whole ol per annum and state that whilst we consider that the situation requires to be fiued by a gentle man of great official experience as well as of talentand high integrity we think these reqasites maybe obtained without guaranteeing an official income of qi per annum or holding out the prospect of his receiving under another great and public department net emoluments of an indefi nitely large amountwe have already adverted to the benefits which we ex pected to derive from affording to the commercial classes of liverpool the means of stating to us personally as wel as in vriting any inconveniences to which they might suppose chemselves to be needlessly subjected in the mode of coilect ing the revenue and of suggesting such alterations as they conceived would be likely to remedy them or would tend to faciltate the despatch of busineswe subjoin in appendix e the statementwhich the mer chants transmitted to us for our consideration previous to their interview with us in this documeent also are inserted the names of the gentlemen who were selected by the com mercial bodies to represent the feeling nd to lay before us the opinions of the commercial and mercantile community of liverpoolit would be seen if your lordships were to refer to the minutes of what passed between the deputation and the commission that no gentlemen could show a greater desire to be candid in their statements or to be full and satisfac tory in their explanations than did those who formed this deptatioeitmayalo he right to observe that the greater portion of this deputation  in number were present during nearly the whole of the interview and attentive to the discussions which then took place we may thence infer a concurrence of opinion in regard to the various matters which they pressed on our attention and we are quite willing to admit the deference which should be shown to their wishes and the respect which is due to their statementsindeed we think we cannot better evince these feelings towards them than by proceeding scriatim through their principal propositions discussing in the first place those to which we see valid objections and which e would there fore dissuade your lordship from adopting and in the second place those which we w ould recommend either by legal enactment or by directionl to the b ar of customs to be carried into effecta question which has beea frequently before the board of treasury and which was finally brought to a dedision in the year vsze the mode of paying landingwaiters was again brought forward and the propriety of paying them partly by a salary and partly by a rate according to the work performed ves strongly urged upon usyonr lordships will of course understand that the pay ment of the fee is to be made by the customs department out of the revenue and that no saving of expense therefore woold result by this change beyond that which might srise from doing more work in the sanme timethis systeo was introduced in the year  and con tinued in force to the year  and at the period of its com mencement it was without doubt useful in promoting energy and activity creating as it necessarily does the de sire of despatch on the part of the revenue officer and in this way not merely faciitating the transaction of busiaese for the merchant but tending also to diminish by the greates celerity with which vessels can be unloaded the number ol officers requisite for that duty bat since tie year  when the payment of these officers partly by fees on the work done by them was introduced the castoms establish ment at liverpool has been placed on so very improved a footing that the evils which this system was intended tc prevent are much diminished and checks and auperintendence are established which were expected and we think the result proves that this expectation has not been whouy fallacios tc compensatefor the absence of the personal andpecaniaryinter ost which waspropogedto beprodacedbyrendering theamount of work performed soune measure of the remtneration whicb the officer was to receive consequently although mr hus kisson then member for liverpool in a letter dated llth october  addressed to mr drummond as private se cretary to the duke of wellington the firat lord of the treasury ably urged every argumeat which could be ad duced in favour of continuing the system which had been id force for i years itwas decided by the dake of wellingtoe and the treasury in that year to institute the present mode of payment by a fixed salary alone since that period therefore the landingwaiters have been divided inte classes and the silariej of    and  pei annam are at present attahhed to their several elasses re spectively and the total number on the establishment l the merchants praise the fee system as productive of acti vity and energy in the officerunited to an anxiety to despatel the business by every means within their power they asseri that no inconvenience was experienced during the   yearn this system prevailed either by the crown or the mercbant they say it prevented the absence of the officer from his dutl when trifling indisposition or indolence might incline him tc he idlethey do not believe that this system would ever produci the former evils of fees paid by the merchants to the officers nor do they admit that the work would be slurred over o executed with undue haste and that thus facility to commii frauds and to occasion mistakes injurious to the revenue would be the result they reiterate mr huskissons aser tion that the adoption of this system would be a saving ix time in unloading vesuels of three days in ten and strenu ously maintain that either a greater number of landing waiters must be employed or these means adopted for caus ing greater exertien to be put forth by the outdoor depart ment of the customs on the other hand not only do the commissoners of customs repeat the arguments which they have formerly advanced in deprecation of the part salary anc part fee system of payment of landingwaiters but their practical officers in london and in liverpool remonstrate in the strongeat manner against a recurrence to it they put forward the inducements to undue haste in the performance of their duty which areheld out to the landingwalters by being paid a large portion of their s
