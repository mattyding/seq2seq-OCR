imsproperly worded and notttallnthe soirit of sir james rahams act the th and gth william  cap  which has now been in operation upwards of seven years and is notwitbstanding most imper fectly understood by shipowners and their agents in tbis case the seaman had signed the articles for  s d per mouth and the voyage lasted from the th of may to the d of november but the articles instead of being framed in accordance with the schedule annexed to the act contained a very singular provision the voyage was stated to be from the port of london to the west coast of africa there to trade from port to port and coast to coast and to exchange masters and ships if naecessary on reaching the west coast of africa the captaix wanted to transfer some of the hands to anotber vessel belongingto the same owners but they all refused to leave the emily the captain now contended that as the seaman had broken the contract he had entered into he was not entitled to any wageshamilton who is a very intelligent man declared that he was not aware of the existence of such articles when he signed them or he shonld not hare gone the voyas ewhich he expected would terminate in the emily he had a wife and family in london and it was not likely he should have shipped for a voyage for an ineefinite periodaptain paddoul said the articles were read over to the crew before theysubscribed their namesmir brodnnpi said that ships articles were often read to the crew in such a way that they understood very little of what they contained he never saw such articles before and they were so wide that it was an utter impossibility for the xeamen to know when the voyage would terminate the men might have been compelled to go on board another ship at se and to trade perpetually all over the world like the flying dntchmgl the first thing regnired in a contract was certainty nothing was more uncertain than the articles put before him there was no certainty of master ship time or place he should like to heara further explana tioncaptain paddon said that messrs foster and co of the city who were the owners of the emily had  or  other ships trading to africa and there wvasfrequently a great mortality on board the vessels on the coast and to make good the losses so occasioned it was either necessary to ship natives on the return voyage or to transfer the hands fom the vessel ust arived on the coast to the one about to return to england nthis caseit was tintended to send the men on board the robert hill which would be trading on the coast of africa until may nextmr bitdoripyes and in may next the men would pro bably have been sent into another ship and so on for ever if those artides are good for anything it is the most ex traordinary thing i ever heard ofcaptain paddon said he shipped one more hand than was necessary inlondon whosiename was yeoland on condition that he joined the robert hill in africa hut instead qf doing so he said he would rather forfeit all his wages than join her au hands were called aft on the coast of africa and they all followed the example of yeoland and said they would not leave the emilyhamilton said he knew too much of the climate of africa and its effects on european constitutions to wish to remain there long he never heard of the robert hiu till he reached africamlr broderip asked if the special clause in the articles was brought under the seamens particular noticecaptain paddon coald not say it was brought under the especial notice of any of the crew except yeolandair brodnsapit is quite evident they did not know what they were signingmr symons the chief clerk and author of the work e law rewii to mrcant seasn was decidedly of opinion the articles were illegalmr leadley junior clerk was of the same opiniondoaglas a policeconstable and summoningofficer said all the crew were in the same condition and were outside tbe court anxiously waiting the magistrates decisionmr broderip after much deliberation and a consultation with mr symons said he hid not think the captain was justified in withholding payment of the mens wages that wa his present impression on the construction of the act sf parliament the seamen would not be held by the contract by the court of admiralty on account of extraordinarv un eertainty and for the reasons he had before given if such a contract was to be deemed valid there was nothing to pre vent the men who signed it beingbandied about the world for aver he thought the owners were bound to pay the wages and should advise that to be done as it was not disputed the voyage had been duly performed m the ship emily the case was howeverof such magnitude and of so muco imporiance that he did not as an inferior judge like to give a decsion uponit and unless the owners thought proper to pay the mlen at once which in jwstice they ought to do he should leave the crew to their remedy in the admiralty courtthe sailors were not paid by the captain and they left the court
