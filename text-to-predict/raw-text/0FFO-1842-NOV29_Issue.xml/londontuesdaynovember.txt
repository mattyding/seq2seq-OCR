london tuesday no ybmrbb  those who bave ever done us the honour of perus ing the articles which from time to time we have written on the subject of our indian war will scarce doubt the satisfaction with which we received the manifesto from lord letnotrouoono which we pub lishe yesterdaya satisfaction which we may con fidently say is shared by all england except that now small party which is pledged by its past acts to maintain the honesty and expediency of its own u ahappy war and to proclaim the honour and profit which  would have resulted from that as yet unre deemed evilof which we have been at once the authors and victims we may now hope with some confi dence that we ate at the end of the affghai war the victories of tezeen and ghnnee the flight of axhbir khan and the end and result of these movements the recovery of our countrymnen and countrywomen wereindeed clieering andinspiiing newsnews to be most thaafnry and joyfuy hailed but they did not remole mroinds of future uneasiness as long as there remaine a posibility tut we might fiad oiixst utiehcfii ia iseondoccupation of affghanistan from this appre hension lord ellinborough has released us we are far from pledging ourselves to maintain servilely every act expression and intention ol the govzrnorgiwal on details we may exer cise a judgment when those deils comefairly before us at present the attempt to do so would be tri fling but it would be ungenerous to stint our ex pression of our satisfaction with the principles gn which his declaration is framed and to whichit pledges him they are those hich we have our selves advocated two objects we have constantly proposed to the couiitry as the true ends of thos campaignthe recovery of the prisoners and the evacuation of affghanietan the former of these we have ever urged as the one and onli necessary condition of the latter we rejoice that the actual policy of government has so precisely fauen in with our own steady and constantly ex pressed desireswe hoped well from the speech with which lord elrsqsionoigi left this country sanctioned as it was by the presence of all those who were respon sible fer the welfare of india he thenpiedged him self to a poli�y of consolidation and peaceful im provement we rejoice to find that among all the temptations to conquest with wh ich the ardour and discipline of his troops the tried cou rage antd discretion of their generals and the taunts of his adversaries aurround him he is showing that those promises were no hasty or illconsidered figures of speech bsut the expresesion of a firm and practical sense of what would be for the benefit of india and therefore for the honour of this country lord eltmtuonoidge has by this highly important and decided act unreservedly staked his credit on the success of a just and pacific policy aud it will need for the future even more courage to seek eminence through the old means of blood and conquest than he has now shovn in their abandonment he has cut away the temptation to relapsethe decision and promptitude of this act mark a consciousuess that it will be approved at home we willingly identify the government with their nominee and inquire what they mean by this their act it is a renunciation as formal and pointed as words and circumstances can make it not only of the policy which is bad enough but of the prin ciples which are worse on which his predecessors founded their invasion of affghanistan lord  lunborough has not been content with a quiet substitution of one course of coiduct for another he is in a hurry to cast his predecessors overboard ffe is eager and anxious to announce the new order of things he is significantly perhaps informally clear in his public profession of dissent he shakes himself free from the ambitious plans of his prede cessors with the sudden roughness of a man who feels that be is doing it unreservedly and once for alllord elrnnbrughns anxiety is that of an honest ruler but it is also that of a wise politician the factis thatmilitary triumphs territorial acquisitions national aggrandizement are not what they sed to be in mens minds we are a calculating age men ask themselves now the meaning of words and if they quench by their logic many high and unworldly feelings which actuated former ages they at least try and condemn some of those hollow notions to which opinion alone gives strength enough for mis chief men analyse the magic words which used in former days to prove themselves we may have lost the perception of much that is good but we do proceed with such perceptions as we havef to weigh ood aud evil and we are daily less inclined to acrifice the blood of thousands to a word or a hantom philanthropy too with all its cant is aot all hollow and unmeaning there is a feeling frowng because true that the statesmans care bhough it begin ddeg not end with liis on coun trythat there is sicha tiiing as national as well as individual selfishnessthat a great evil requires a great excuseand that the iniliction of so great an evil as war requires a better excuse than the pro spect of a lawless and selfish advantagewhy did we interfere to drive from affghanistan the only ruler in any degree capable of enforcing drder and unity through its unruly fastnessesto disperse those elements of law and commerce which were rising into strength and system under the keen eye and vigorous hand of dost mohammed what justified us in replacing on a throne which he was plainly incompetent to keep our imbecile pensioner the neglected descendant of the ancient rulers of the country we feared lest an independent sove reignthe neighbour of a neighbourshould con tract alliances with powers whom we distrusted we were at peace with russia we were not at war with persia we were coquetting with dost mouam�himself whose family and countrymen had been plainly injured by our able but unprincipled ally rusjser sna we refused perhaps rightly the terms on which he offered us his alliance because he avowed an intention to seek from others those guarantees for his safety which we denied him we forthwith proclaim him dangerous invade his coun try occupy his capital slaughter his people im prison himself and exercise though a despicablepuppet ot our own supreme authority over his na tion what have been the results of this occupa tionthe cruel outragesthe bitter hatredsthe barbarous end overwhelmingrevengethe retribu tion for that revenge not less an evil because provoked all this there is little need to repeat yet there is reasontofear that those who on such grounds simply though clumsily selfishhave dared to make themselves responsible for all these frightful eventswhose neglect of the rights of otherswhose misapprehension of the dangers which they fancied of the characters which they used and of the stirength which they provoked has drawn down upon us and uponr a then unoffending nation the unparalleled disasters of the last two yearswill now further dare to inveigh against the pusilanimity which refuses any longer to follow theikguidance and to stigmatize as cowardly betrayers of the in terests of their country those who having always disclimed are now able to abandon that mixture of injustice and impolicy for which we have already paid so much we rejoice to think that they will fail bold assertion will do much but it will notpersuade the people of england to require from their rulers an adherence to that bloody course which has been so signalized by what all must call misfor tunes and most will stigmatize as crime
