wholealbrjnfantjcidpddetr obr tbbmf urderesskrrom the glomstrjournaclwelut week announced the committal of frances ben nett to our county gaol on the charge of murdering her six infant children we hversnow to record that the doom the apprehension of which tbrrified her into the disclosures which made public her unnatural and unparalleled atrocities has befallen her she died in the hospital uf the county gaol early yesterday morning after a confinement of eight days since her admiason he bad every attention paid to her which her condition reqaied and her pasage to her dread account was we have reason to believe in no way aecelerated by the treatment she received since her reception within the walls of the priaon and she could no have been so far as profesioual attention and nursing were concerned better if so well attended to ather own home it was not inthe power of human means to restore her to health consumption had made fatal ravages on her constitution and death had set hiu seal upon her and she felt she was summoned away when ahe uttered those confessioeswhich from the enormity of the crimes to which they referred have caused a sensation in every part of the kingdom year after year did this remorseless woman conslign the children of her body to death and while the murdered remin were resting under the atones over which her feet were passing day after day did she keep the horrid secret of her iniquity from the knowledge of all her neighbours till the unmmonm she re ceived to prepare for her own account awoke the terrors of a conscience which crime had apparentlysered from all compunctious warnings the district in which these mur ders wvere committed is part of one of those few places where the superstitions of byone days stiul linger and are frmly retained by many of thst class of persons to which this woman belonged among many of the poorer inhabit ants of the fornst of dean as in many other plaes where the country retains some of its originalwildness and people have not yet multiplied so as entirely to extinguish the solitude of nature visitant from the invisible world are believed in as a matter almost of religious faith yet this woman could with her own hands stop the breath of her offspring and then bury or assist to bury their insen sible bodies under the flooring of her house without being influenced by a fear which would have operated upon less hardened minds that the spectres of these innocent objects of her cruelty would rise up from under her feet and up braid her with her terrible inhumanity either the mind of this bed woman was above the influence of the feelings of others of her class of life or what is perhaps the most prprve f the case the euperatitions of ignorance only debase the mind and have no salutasv operation in deterring from crime and yet the most sceptical or strongestminded villain one would think would rather that the bodies of his victims should have a moe distant burialplace than one alvays within sight and from which even in the dread hour of the night there w no retreatieg perhaps a few words recapitulatory of this dreadful basiness may be interest ing to those readers who did not see our paper con tming the first announcement of it the woman frances bennett was the widow of a man of that name who lived at ruardeanhill in the forest of dean and who at his deatb left her a little property with the stipulation that if she married again it should pass from her afterwards a man named thomas yapp went to live with her and probably she was deterred from marrv iug him in consequence of the absurd restrictions of the wil by this man according to her own confession she had no less than six children all of whom sbe murdered at or im mediately after their birth and as she stated buried them with yapps assistance underneath the paving of her back kitchen none of her neighbours appear to have had any suspicion that during all this time she bad once been a mother till a few weeks ago she was taken ill and fancy ing it was for death she made the above confession and re quested that the remains of her children might be dug up and reburied in consecrated ground she described with accuracy the spots where the bodies lay and in those precise spots they were all foundat least flve of them were so dis covered and we have heard it stated that when she was told that the sixth could not be found she exclaimed  oh i re member the pigs ate him  but of this we cannot speak with any certainty vre believe it was not deposed to before the coroner thomas yapp still remains in custody in the gaol how the death of his partner will affect his situation we can not form an opinion but probably ig wil be found that the case will be too weak against him to warrant his conviction of this however it is premature to speak at any lengthinquest on the bodyglocester saturdaythis day an inquest was held on the body before mr john cooke the coronerwho conducted the investigation at ruardean disease had reduced the body to a perfect skeleton but the appearance of the features was more pleasing than otherwise mr cooke who saw the deceased alive about three weeks ago remarked that her face had undergone ettle changethe first witness examined was eliza gausmore one of the nurses attached to the gaol who stated that she was di rected to wait upon deceased shortly after her arrival de ceased often thanked ffod that abe had been removed and said she was much happier in gaol than at homethe coroner here stated that a rumour was abroad that the deceased was in the family way and he asked the wit ness if sbe could speak to the point the witness stated that she asked the question of deceased and she stated that she was not deceased sad that she was only  years of agemria nuttal another nurse was next examined she said that she was present when the deceased died on friday morning and was with her for some days previous she asked witness to read and pray to her sometimes when she was reading the deceased would say  stop wait till im better and when ebe recovered she would ask her to go on as her aeath approached she seemed to feel contetied she was sensible to the last she said that she had been ill forabout  monthswr hlckes the surgeonstated that the complaint of which the deceased died was pulmonary consumption auid in his opinion the removal from ruardean had neither mjured nor benefitted her she seemed to be aware that she could sur vive only for a few days she tnentioned to him and to others that she had been sent to gaol charged with the mur der of her childrenthe pury returned a verdict of  died from natural causesyapp on being told of the death of bennett wept bit terly the body was buried by the relatives of the deceasedas to worldly means the murderers were comfortable in deed it is alleged that the only index to their brutal conduct is to be found in the cireumstance that bennetts husband settledbhis property upon her but with the restriction men tioned above that should she marry again the property was to go to his children it was the desire to retain the pro perty which probably prevented her marriage with yappand everybody knows how one crime leads to another
