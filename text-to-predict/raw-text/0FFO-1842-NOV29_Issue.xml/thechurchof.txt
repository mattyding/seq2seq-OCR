 te cubvrch of scotlandedinburgh savrbnayi uam ble to communicate the resolutions which were geed to at the lahe meetings of the  convocation these eeeolutions are important u giving the best and surest ildiation of the feelings by which the ministers who attended azeactuated how far these may be sustained by the gene ral body of the clergy is another questionit is quite clear that the number who supported theaecond series of resolutions is not of that oveyhelming amount which vill induce the government to suppoee that they fairly represent the opinions enterained by the great body of the establsael church i have already mentioned the relativesumbers and as it seems that the important resolations of the sitting were only supported by  ministers it is quite apparent that the nonintrusion party is clearly in a minority in the assembly the resolutions however will speak for themselvesfirst series of resolutions passed by te convocation of ministers on saturday the th of november o and concuared zn by  mxinsters that according to the recent and as it appears to this convocation unconstitutional decisions of the supreme civil ceurts and the interpretation which those decisions if al lowedorsanctioned bythe supreme power in the statewould put upon the civil lawthe obligation to receive and admit a qualified presentee imposed by the law of patronage on the presbyteries of the churcb is a civil obligation such as may be nfored by the ordinary compulsations of civil law and in particular that the rejection of a presentee in respect of the dissent ef the congregation according to the fundamental principle and lavf of the church is not merely an act to which the civil courts may refuse to gite civil effect but is in itself a civil wrong or offence which may be dealt with accordingly by the civil courts tht other decnsiens of the civil courts and in particn hr the decision of the lord ordinary in the ca of the depo sition of the strathbogie ministers imply an assumption of a juidiction in the moet sacred functions of the wvorship and government of the church especiallg in the matter of thie deposition of ministers to the effect of reducing the sen temces of spiritaal courts in the exercise of discipline over ministers and members of the church that these claims to jurisdiction in spiritual matters on the part of the dvil courts are based chiefly if not altoge ther upon the act of queen anne restoring patronagean act from the first unjustifiable and recently interpreted in a sense to which the church cannot conscientiously submit and to which she cannot consent to accommodate her eeclesiastical procedure that as the principle involved in these decisions and particularly in the recent auchterarder judgment is that of the suyremacy of the cvil courts over those of the established churo in the exercise of their spiritual fauctions so the members of the convocation declare that no measure can in conscience be submitted to by them which does not effectu ally protect the church against the exercise of such ju risdiction by the civil conrts in time to come and in parti clar full prevent all future encroachments of the nature specified in the preceding resolutiens that in all their past contendings the members of this couvocation have been actuated and they trust that in all their future proceedings they will continue to be actuated by a deep conviction of the value and excellence of the civil and ecclesiastical constitution under which they live and that one of the chief causes of their present anxisty arises out of their impression that the tendency and inevitable re sult of the recent decisions of the dvil courts especialy if these shallbe finally sanctioned as the law of the land must he as entirey subversive of the constitution as they are re pugnant to the principlee of this church and the consciences of her officebearerssecond series of resolutions passed by the convocation op xinisters on tuesday tee  of novex bess  and concurred ix t  mizinsrers that while the church most solemnly protests against the invasion of her jurisdiction by the civil courts as con trary to the word of god the confession of faith and the constitution of this kingdom and while in particular she ia entitled in the judgment of the brethren now assembled to declare as the general assembly in the claim of rights has declared that the amumption by the civil courts of au thority in matters spiritual and especially in the ordination admission or deposition of ministers and the other proceed ings there set forth is in violation of the law establishing the churcb which was made unalterable by the act of security axd the treaty of union  and that whatever is done in the exercise of that assumed authority ought therefore to be held m in right or dejure it is null and void and of no effect still whbaever the nation in these circumstances might do it is not the duty of the church as a kingdom not of this world which has not and cannot have any power of the sword or aav secular dominion whatever to plead her title thus ac qmrsd and secured to the temporal benefits of her establish ment in opposition or resistance to the supreme power of the state except in the wvsy of remonstrance protest and serious warnng tbat a on the other hand it is the bomnden duty of the church and of her faithful ministers to represent to the supreme power of the state the nature of the invasions of the civil cours upon the spiritual province so on the other band the refusal on the part of the state of such a remedy as has been declared indispensable to meet the emergency cannot be otherwise construed than as being a recognition and sanction by the state of the principle which the deci sions of the civil courts involve that the brethren now assembled fully recognize the intrinsic authority and final jarisdiction of the civil magis trate or the supreme power of the state in the exercise of au dvil functions and in the discharge of all the duty which heowes towards the church of christ and in particular they acknowledge the right of the civil magistrate to fix the terms on which he will establish the church as a right which he is to use on his own responsibility and in the use of which the church is not entitled to resist him and hence accordingly as the church being essentially inde vendent of the civil magistrate in her spiritual province ls not bound and is not at liberty to conform her procedure in the government of christs house to the orders of the state or of any courts of the stateagains her convictions of daty founded on the word of god so neither is she wmrrauted in prescribing to the civil magistrate or requiring him to act according to her views whether in the administration of civil affairs generally or in what he does towards religion or about things sacred as in his giving to the church or vith holding from her the civit countenance and support nor m the churho resist his deternination in these matters incein both departments of his duaty the civil magistrate is always bound to act according to his own censcience under the rule of the word of god and on his responsibility to that it is the duty of the faithful ministers of this church not to continsue to receive the endowments or emolu mtents secured to them by the civil law or to involve them selves in the manifold inconveniences and serious evils of a protracted struggle with the civil powver after it shall appear that the supreme power of the state by refusing to relieve them from interference of the civil court in things spiritual does thereby substantially and effectually sanction the condi tion which the civil comts would attach to their holding of these endowments or emoluments and to which they never can submit or yield obedience viz the condition of subjec tion to civil control in matters spiritual and of being bound against their consciences to intrude ministers upon reclaim i g congregations that it is the duty of the ministers now assembled and of allwho adhere to their views to make a solemn represen tation to hler majestys government aud to both houses of parhament setting forth the imminent and extreme peril of the establishment the inestimable value of the benefits wich it confers on the country and the pain and reluctance with which they are forced to contemplate the possibility of the churchs separation for conscience sake from the state respectfully cauing upon the rnlers of this nation to miain tain the constitution of the kingdom inviolate and to uphold a pure establishment of religion in the land and finally ntimating that as the endowments of the church are un doubtedly at the disposal of the supreme power of the state with whom it rests either to continue to the church her pos session of them free from any lirmitation of her spiritual u risdiction and freedom or to withdraw themn altogether so itimust be the duty of the church andconsequently in de pendence on the grace of god it is the determination of the brethren now assembled if no measure such as they have de clared to be indispensable be granted to tender the resigna tion of those civil advantages which they can no longer hold in consistency with the free and full exercise of their spi ritual functions and to cast themselves on such provision as god in his providence may afford maintaining still uncom promised the principle of a right scriptural connexion be tween the church and the state and solemnly entering their protest against the judgments of which they complain as in their decided opinion altogether contrary to what has ever hitherto been understood to be the law and constitution of this country  out of the above  adherent added the
