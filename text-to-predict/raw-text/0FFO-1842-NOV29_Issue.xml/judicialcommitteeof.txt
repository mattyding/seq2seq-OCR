or by the citation or decree or in or by the letters of re quest on whose application or at whose mere zmotion the party was chargedt withi the pretended offence nor at whose request or mere metion the letters of request were granted  aur did it appear that the several provisions enactments and directions of the act had been duly observed and complied with the learned ndge overruled these objections ant as signed the appellant to appear absolutelythe queexs advocatm and mr cocswurn appeared in support of the appeal from this sentence by the d section of ttie church discipline act it is enacted  that in every case of any clerk in holy orders c who may be charged with any offence against the laws ecclesiastica or concern ing whom there may be scandal or evil report as having of fended agaist the said laws it shau be lawful for the bishop of the diocese within which the offence is alleged or reported to have been committed on the application of any party complaining thereof or if he shall think fit of his own mere motion to issue a commission under his hand and seal to five persons c for the purpose of making inquiry as to the grounds of such charge or report this was a power given to the bishop for the firat time by this act by the th section it is enacted  that it shau be lawful for the bishop of any diocese c in ary case if he shall think fit either in the first instance or after the commissioners shall have reported that there is sufficient prim faccie for instituting proceedings and before the filing of the articles bat not afterwards to send the case by let ters of request to the court of appeal of the province to be there heard and determined according to the law and prac tice of such court the bishop had therefore the option of iuwamg a commission under the power given him by this act or of proceeding in the old form by sending the cme to the conrt of the archbishop  but he could not do both he must make his election and according to the th section he is to make his election in the first instance after sending a notice to the party of his intention to iusue a commission the bishoo is not atliberty to send the case to the archbishops court until after the commissioners have reported that there is sufficient prnm facic ground for instituting proceedings in the present casethe tbishoo must be taken by his notice to have elected to proceed by issuing a commission and if so he could not send the cause to the arches court until after the commissioners had made their report and consequently his letters of request could give that court no jurisdiction having been sent improperlyin point of time if this were not so the party might be subjected to a twofold proceedingthe commission might still issue and he might he called upon to answer the charge before the commnssioners and also in the arches court before the commissioners had reported that there wvas sufflcient prima feds ground for instituting proceedingsvicechancellor k brnceyou assume that the notice is subisting and that the bishop may still issue a commission but is that conceded by the other side the qusais advocare sid it was plain from the act of parliament that the bishop might still act upon the notice if he thought fit he had done nothing to deprive himself of the power of issinmg a commission another ground was that by the act of parliament the bishop might proceed upon the application of a party complaining or of his own mere motion but he could not do bothdr lusuigtoothat is the real difficulty it is quite plain by the act that the bishop may promote the suit him self as formerly or there may be a separate promoter and it is also plain that the bishop may if he please devolve the suit pon the arches court but the difficulty ix that the letters of request being in the name of the bishop proceeding in the first instance as if the bishop had been the promoter instad of sanders at the end there is the name of san ders as the promoterthe queenss advocamsyes you have one puty at the commencement as the promoter and then it is devolved upon anotherlord canpbellyou say the notice is in the nature of a processmr cocbbuvmyes though there are cases in which a notice is not a process still it appears by this act of parlia ment that this notice is intended to operate a a citation and in point of fact it does so it is in the nature of a notice of trulvicechancellor k biumcyou sayrby giving this notice the bishop has made a conclusive electionmr cocsuasnno far conclusive that we cannot send the cause to the arches court until after the commissioners have reported again the act of parliament gives the bishop the power of proceeding in two cases only where he prwoeeds upon the apphcation of a party complaining or of his own mere motionthe bishop of loswonam i to understand that if the bishop had been originaly a voluntary promoter of the suit he could not then have referred it to the arches court by letters of request rmr cockbuarhe may do so in the first instance there may be circumstances which induce the bishop to think that the matter may be more fairly inquired into out of his own diocese and he may divest himself of the cause for that reason but it is im portant that it should appear upon the face of the pro ceedings whether the bishop sends up the cause of his own mere motion or at the insktnce of a party complaining  because however desirable it may be that some superintend ing control should be exercised over the opinions of the in ferior clergy there is also a very wholesome control exer cised by public opinion in respect of prosecutions such as this for religious opinions he mr cockburn was quite sure speaking in the presence of one of the right rev pre lates of the church that it was not consistent with the dig nity of those high ecclesiastical functionaries that they should be the promoters of suits of this kind he would put it hypothetically that the gentleman whose name was now used as the promoter of the suit was the bishop of exeters secretarydr admassyou may take it as the fact there is no doubt about itmr cocxzunuathen iask whether the bishop is pro moting the suit with the moral responsibiity which ought to belong to a prosecution of this sature tthe bishop of lendonyou are aware that under the old law the bishop could proceed in no other way than in the name of his secretary mr cockburnua yes but it was then understood that the bishop proceeded of his own mere motion but in this case there is the singalar anomaly that the bishop commences the letters of recuest as if he were the party setting the proceed ing in notion and then he suddenly transfers it to mr sanderso vicechaelor k brucesnppose the true construction of the letters of request to be that sanders originally gave theinformation and setthe bishop ia motion and then the bishop thought it of his own mere motion to send letters of request to the dean of the archesin order that the cause might be disposed of in the arches court sanders being still minded to be the promoter of the suit ad continuing to be so woold that be regular or not mkr cockburnb apprehend it wouldvicechancelor kbucethen the question is wkether these letters of request according to their true and fair in struction do not imply that dr addaks addressed their lordships shortly on the part of the respondent the d and th  sections of the church discipline act would not bear the construction putupon them on the other side  in the first instance meant at any tame before issuing a commission nd in this case no commission
