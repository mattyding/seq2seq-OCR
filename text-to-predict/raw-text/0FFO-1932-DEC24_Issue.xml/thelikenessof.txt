the likeness ofchristearly portraitstwo unpublishedcopiesby the rev c c dobsonthomas heaphy was a portrait painter of no niean repute and the son of a distinguished artist he was born in  and died in  his life work consisted in searching for and copying the earliest likenesses of our lord and the early saints and he succeeded in seeing and copying some of the most treasured relics of the roman church usually inaccessible to the public among such were the famous veronica cloth at st peters at rome the cloth preserved at st bartholomews genoa and that at st silvester at rome all of which bear traditional likenesses upon them of our lordheaphys paintings of some of these and smaller frescoes and glass patera pictures found in the catacombs including early likenesses of st peter and st paul were published in a large folio volume edited by a friend wyke bayliss seven years after his death under the title  the likeness of christ by thomas heaphy he had himself written in  a series of articles in the art jouirnzal with small line block copies of his smaller pictures and this posthumous folio was a reprint of these articles edited but including for the first time several fine full plate coloured copies of his larger paintings such as the veronica and genoa cloth likenesses and it is these that are generally used when press illustrations are neededit seems to have escaped students that the portfolio containing the originals together with his manuscript notes was deposited in the british museum an examination of this album not only supplies interesting information regarding his work but discloses two watercolour likenesses of our lord which for reasons he himself gives in his notes he never reproduced nor do they appear in his posthumous work one of these is illustrated on page  it is believed for the first time from the considerations which follow and which heaphy himself can hardly have appreciated they may prove of an interest transcending all other early likenesses of our lordheaphys ambitionin his a rt jouirnial articles heaphy tells us how when a boy there came into his hands a copy of a mysterious picture of our lord which sub sequently proved to be that on the veronica cloth and which the inscription stated was at st peters at rome filled with an ambition to see it he set out still a boy to travel on foot across europe in quest of it he describes the enthu siasm and excitement he experienced on reaching the city and his disappointment at finding st peters closed for the day and having to wait until the morning before he could gain admission the next morning he searched cverv nook and cranny of the great building in vain frescoes pictures mosaics and carvings were there in abundance but there was no sign of his picture the attendants knew nothing of it and his disappointment was so apparent that it attracted the attention of a person in purple who was passing evidently a cardinal he then learnt that he was not mistaken but it now seemed farther beyond his grasp than ever it was on the famous veronica cloth which no eye was ever permitted to see but that of the holy father and two high dignitaries once a year and then only after ablutions and con fessionsthat he did ultimately succeed in seeing this and the other two similar cloths copies of all of which he made may be taken as assured his bonia fides in this respect was challenged by a critic in the quiarterly review on the ground that no member of the public especiallv a protestant was ever permitted to viewv any of them and suggesting that he had painted the genoa cloth portrait from one of the common print copies on sale in the streets of the city heaphy in a letter to the athenzaeum of novem ber   indignantly repudiated the sug gestion and declared that the exclusion of the public from access to the relics was due to the nmiraculous claimis associated with themii and their origin and that for obvious reasons he could not make known the means by which he had succeeded hc was able to cite two witnesses with their names and addresses given who had viewed one such relic with him it is however not difficult to conjecture how this was accomplished the early contact of an enthu siastic boy who had tramped across europe for the purpose with a cardinal in st peters laid the foundation his many years subsequent labour in the catacombs his cvident artistic talent and his copying of the gold and enamel pictures at the bottom of glass paterae in the vatican museum must have gathered round hinm a body of friends among the highest of the roman church which proved the open sesame to some of her most guarded relics attached to his original painting of the genoa portrait in bold writing underlined are the wvords  not for publication which implies the condition on which access was permitted nor did he repro duce anv of them in his lifetime and thev were only added in his posthumous work sevenr years laterpictures on glasssome of his paintings are of frescoes in the catacombs which were being opened after many centuries remains of those buried and presumed to be those of martyrs were being removed valuable relics with pictures upon them were being found and deposited in the vatican it is possible that some of the frescoes he copied have since faded through exposure to the airduring the first and early second centuries little glass paterae were used by the earlv christians for holy communion on the bottom underside of these were worked in gold and enamel bible pictures symbolizing our lords work and also portraits of the earlv saints they were real works of art the secret of which seems to have been largelv confined to the christians the purpose of these was that on lifting the glass to partake of the wine our lord might be seen tertullian tells us that by his time circa  the use of glass for thispurpose had given place to metal as a safeguard against spilling the sacred element bv accidental breakage it was the custom to bury these with the dead large numbers are in the vatican and our british museum has a nice collection of them apart from the artistic value of these little pictures thev are of par ticular interest in that anv portraits that appear upon them are of assured first or early second century date heaphy has a portrait of st paul from one of them wvhich may thus have been drawn in his lifetime he tells us it was worked in gold and blue enamel and he published it in his art jouirntal articles it is reproduced on the next pageheaphvs notes contain a piece of information which has a direct bearing upon the two por traits herewith illustrated it was the custom of the firstcentury christians to cover the face of the dead with a handkerchief on which had been depicted the face of our lord the intention being that our lord shouldthus cover the dead this may wvell give us a clue to the origin of the veronica and similar other cloths with faces upon themthe picture of our lord repro duced on this page was copied as we learn from heaphys notes from a frcsco in the ceilin of a vault in the catacomb of ss achille and nereo it was much faded and dilapidated and in parts indis tinct he dates it second century else wvhere he tells us of the great care he exerciscd in copying even to the lines of mosaic work the date he assigns to this fresco is corroborated in several wvavs particularly by the date of the catacomb itsclf it was originally klnown as that of st domitilla and contained a nunmber of firstcenturv burials the antiquity is characterized by the absence of a halo or the labanim or any later symbol it has none of the hardness of the many pictures executed when christianity was legalized by constantine in the early fourth century its position in the ceiling is in keeping with the firstcentury custom of covering the dead with the face of our lord his face would here be covering all interred in the vault we may wvell ask if this is indeed of this early date is it the original of all the traditional portraits of our lord which became so common in constantines time  the whole expression of the face is appealing kind loving yet anxious and yearning it is verv beautiful and ftull of strong characteranother picture faded and faint is attributed to st peter who is said to have drawn it from mnemory with ink and a stylus at the request of the daughters of pudens and claudia named prassedes and pudentiana it is still a most jealously guarded relic in the church of st pras sedes in rome and is never shown to the public it is possible that heaphys is the only copy that has ever been made on the empress helenas arrival in the city in ad  it was shown to her with this traidition attached to it as a most highly prized relic even in those days helena took careful measures for its preservation and had it encased in a framework of silver and enamel a section oft which heaphy has included in his copyapostolic traditionpudens was an extremely wealthv sena tor about whom we know a good deal his wife claudia was british according to mlartial together with linus who clement of rome savs was her brother they resided in a large palace the site of which is well established and which is said to have been the palace of caractacus during his seven years parole in the city some traditions say that claudia was his daughter to their home came st pauland here according to irenaeus he and st peter consecrated linus as bishop of rome in this  house also st peter appears to have been stay ing in about the year  the chair used by these apostles in this house is still a much prized relic in st peters in ad  the neronian persecution broke out and the two daughters of pudens and claudia prassedes and pudentiana act ing under roman law began to rescue the remains of the victims and inter them in the grounds of their fathers palace part of which they constituted a secret church this we learn from cardinal baronius and an ancient tablet preserved at the church the present ninthcentury church still bearing the name of st prassedes stands on the original site and under neath are still to be seen traces of the first church the relic is still preserved in this church and has never left itwhat is more probable than that these two women rescuing the remains of the martyrs and requiring according to pre valent custom a handkerchief with our lords face upon it with which to cover them should have asked st peter who xwas actuallv staying in their home to sketch it from memory  in favour of the genuineness of this relic it may be pointed out that unlike relics of a similar type it rests upon no traditional miracle and it has never to the present day left the place where it was executed the tradition about it is extremely old the church remained a secret one in a private senatorial palace until christianity was legalized when for the first time its exist ence became public property and when ifelena was shown the relic heaphys own evidence in the athlenaeum that he did indeed see it and copy it is as followsi made a copy not oniv of the head but also of the intricate enamel work of the frame or setting it is true that this is one of the rigidly excluded pictures nevertheless i did it and was accompanied by several persons on the difterent occasions of my visits amongst others by mwr statham of  wimpolc street and ihe late mfr gattley the sculptor both of whom ere permitted to take the picture into their handshcaphy tells us that the reason why he did not reproduce this picture in his art journial articles was because being faint a line block could not do itjustice or convey a correct impression the same no doubt applied to tne fresco portrait of our lord since his time photography has been invented and enables us now to do what he could not
