reached bv the conference on the subjects of the special powers and responsibilities of the governorgeneral znd the governors and defence thus the only outstanding question left for con sideration wvas that of financial safe gzuards the committee thereon met in the afternoon to consider its draft report and again in the evening at the night sessionfhe conference reassembled late in the evening for a general discussion sir samuel hoare took the chair and the first business was consideration of the report of the committee on financial safeguards this report accepts the principle that it is necessarv to reserve to the governor general in regard to budgetarv arrange ments and borrowing  such essential powers as wvould enable him to intervene if methods were being pursued which wvould in his opinion seriously prejudice the credit of india in the money markets of the world it was agreed with one dissentient who is known to have been sir purshotamdas thakurdas that the requisite power for the governorgeneral could suitably be obtained bv placing upon him by statute a  special responsi bility in financial matters again with one dissentient it was agreed that the ciovernorgeneral should be enabled to obtain the services of a financial adviser to assist him in the discharge of this special responsibility in financial matters a further recommendation is that a reserve bank bill should be introduced into the indian legislature as soon as possible in the hope that it may be started before federation takes effectpicture incompletein opening the general discussion sir tej bahadur sapru referred to the fact that all three parties in this country were pledged to the policy which had been shaped at the conference the picture was still incomplete when they saw the proposals of hm government in the white paper it would be for them coollv and dispassionately to ask themselves what was the sum total of their gain he urged that the time had come for the states finallv to make up their mind and definitely without any doubt or misgiving say that they were ready to join the federation provided that their special interests were safeguarded the position ought to be made clearer than it was at present a date should be fixed on which the states must formally and authori tatively notify their willingness to come into the federationsir tej ended his speech with a lament that the present state of things in india the state of rule by special powers could not be allowed to continue much longer without doing serious prejudice to the work of gaining supporters to the cause of constitutional reformlord peel on whom has devolved the heavy share of work of presiding over the federal finance committeedescribed the conference as more practical and less rhetorical than its two predecessors he made the telling point that while the session had been occupied largely with reservations they had forgotten to look at the very real and great transfer of authority which on the other side was being made over to indian ministers we did not want to limit indian selfgovern ment and had acted only under a sense of responsibilityconference gainsspirit of trust andconfidencelord reading paid sir samuel hoare a tribute of admiration for the way in which he had carried out his work the greatest gain of the conference was the greater spirit of trust and confidence that it had brought between british india and this country he held they were to be con gratulated upon the amount of agreement that had been reached they had travelled very far in this respect since they first met more than two years agoon financial safeguards lord reading claimed that the government had done its utmost to meet the desires of indian colleagues there must be some general provision in order to give the same feeling of security to the investor in the future that he had today as the federal government developed and the admini stration of finance was seen to be of a prudent and wise character that feeling of security would grow india would requirc to borrow money in this country again and againafter the rajah of sarila had spoken for the smaller states representing about  per cent of area and  per cent ofthe population of  indian india  sir akbar hydari claimed that as the indian states had come up against difficulties in the same proportion they had shown their desire to overcome them and to attain the goal his speech like that of nawab liaquat hayat went to show that the princes are reiterating their faith in federationsir akbar appealed to his friends from british india for a better understandingof the positioii of the states the princes and their ministers had shown by their acts their desire to join them in a truly national government of india sir pur shotamdas thakurdas declared that fewv indians would be satisfied until they obtained full dominion status but there was a  ray of hope  in the spirit in which the british delegation
