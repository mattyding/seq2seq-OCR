imperial and foreignfinances ofindiafederal schemereportthe roundtable conference yester day received and noted with slight draft ing amendments the report of the federal finance comniitteein the report lord peel the chairman of the conmittee explains that its aims wvere to provide that all provinces might start with a reasonable chance of balancing their budgets to afford them the prospect of revenue suffi ciently elastic for subsequent development to assure the solvency of the federation and to ensure that after an initial period the federal sources of revenue should be derived fom british india and the states alikethe report deals with allocation of taxes cn income on lines indicated in the tinmes on december  envisaging a twofold division of the proceeds of taxes on in come into shares which would be assigned as a permanent constitutional arrange moent to the federal government and the provinces respectivel in order to ensure the solvency of the rederal government until the existing ab nortnal conditions have passed and sutficient time has clapsed for the development ot new sources of revenue it is proposed that out of the provincial share ot taxes on income the federal government should retain a block amount for a period ot x years this amount would be deducted by the federal government from the total net yield attributable to the provinces before any dis tribution took place in this connexion how ever some ielegates wish to state that in their opinion the result as between the provinces would be inequitable since in effect each pro iace would makc a special contribution to the federation in proportion to its individual share of incometax they consider that the pro vincial share of taxes on income should first be distributed and that contributions should then be taken back on some basis vet to be deter mined delegates from bengal and bombay are particularly emphatic on this point as regards the amount to be allotted to the federai govern mient we are agreed that it should initially be sufficient to balance the federal budget at the outset arl it would therefore have to be deter mllined shortly before the inauguration of the new constitution in the determination of this amount the provincial governments and the government of india should of course be closely associated many members of the com mittee consider that in viexv of the high level of military cxpenditure the possibility of reducing such expenditure should be closely examined in determining the initial federal deficit indeed some mcmbers go farther maintaining that the problem of a federal deficit might be entirelv eliminated by very substantial reduction in ex penditure under this head and referring par ticularly to sir valter lavtons remarks on the subject on the question whether the initial amount should continue in full for the entire period bf x years we do not express a final opinion but on the whole we think it might be better to divide that period into two parts on this basis the amount would be fixed for a number of years and would then be gradually reduced to zero on a scale provided under the constitutiton during the remainder of the period of x years as regards the duration of this period we are unable to report agreementthe states representatives consider that the minimum period should be  years divided into two parts of at least five years each if the alter native proposal just mentioned were adopted the british india representatives would limit x to four or five years divided if necessary into parts of two or three and two years there is agreement that if during the initial period the federal budget showed a prospect of a con tinuing surplus relief to the provinces and states which make special contributions to federal re sources whether direct or indirect ought to have priority over remission of taxation provided a satisfactory yield from taxes on incomc is permanently assigned to the federa tion the states representatives agree to assum liability for corporation tax on the expiration of the period of x years subject to the understand ing that assessment of the tax on the companies in a state having been made the state may raise the amount due to the federal fisc by any method it may choose and not necessarily by the actual levy of that taxspecial taxing powers in addition to the normal powers of the federal government we also contemplate as an integral part of the scheme special powers de signed to meet such a situation as might arise if the federal budget initially balanced by the amount retained from the provinces failed to remain balanced despite increased taxation upon existing sources and the development of new sourccs of revenue permanently allocated to the federation it is implicit in the scheme that the federal government should do its utmost to develop its permanent resources from the out sct it is accordingly proposcd that so far as british india is concerned the fcderal government should have power to levy for its own purposcs additional tax on the heads of incometax permanently assigned to the pro inccs in practicc of course it would simtil taneously raise thc rates of tax on its own corresponding hcads whenever this was done the fcderal government would also levy pro portionate contributions on a determined basis for example that suggested for a somewhat similar purposc in paragraph  of the percy report from such states as prefer not to come into a federal incometax most of us are agreed that independently of the scheme described above each province individually should have a right of surtax upon the personal tax levied on its inhabitants under the heads permanently allocated to the pro vinces subject to a maximum of  per cent of the tax centrally imposed this surtax like all other taxes on income would be collected by fcderal agency some members on the other hand urge that a provincial right of this nature would not only offend against the general desira bility of uniformity in rates throughout india but would affect the reserve of taxable capacity availablc to the federal government in times of cmcrgency   while it is cssential to ensure the solvency of the federal government and an equitable dis tribution of burdens among the partners in federation we recognize also that provincial sol vency must be secured if the provinces arc to function successfully we consider that there should be an inquiry shortly before the new order is inaugurated in the provinces as a result of which the amount of any subvention where necessary and its dura tion if only required for a limited period would be finally determined it is important that the decision should be final as periodic revision could not fail to react on constitutional inde pendence and financial responsibility we con template that the amount would be only just sufficient to enable a province exactly to balance its budget on a basis of providing for bare necessities further the total sum involved for all the provinces concerned should be manage able in size and not stichi as to affect materially the resources whichi can be made available to the other provinccs we do not at the present stagegivc an opinion as to whether any particular subvention should be constant and permanent or constant and terminating after a stated period of years or constant for a tcrm of years and then diminishing over a period in thc case of bengal we recognize that the difficulties arising from the prcsent distribti tion of resources are cxceptional and we suggest that they might perhaps be met by according to the province some sharc in the revenue from juteit is suggested that perhaps the export dutv on manufactured jute might be re moved and a central excise on such jute imposed to be distributed to the provinces in which it is levied but it is also pointed out thatthe delegates from bengal however view this suggestion with strong disfavour and they con sider that the deficit positionof bengal should properly be remedied out of the export duty on jute which is practically a monopoly of the province in their view the whole proceeds of that duty should be allotted to the province though for the period of x years defined above half the proceeds might be given to the federal government a subvention will of course continue to be required for the northwest frontier pro vince in order to develop a sense of financialrespolnsibility we consider that the amount of the subventioni shouild be fixed both initially and on the occasion of each revision for as long a period as may be foutnd possiblein paragraph  the committee contemplates that the special taxing powers proposed for the federal government in paragraph  should ordinarily suflice to obviate the necessity of emergency con tributions such as were proposed in section  of lord peels report nevertheless we think it may still be desirable to provide in the constittitioli for such contri butions and we support the proposals of the pcrcy report paragraphs  and  as regards both the definition of the circumstances in w hich they should be levied and thc basis of their assessment except that we prefer in the case of a war emergency that it should rest with the rulers of the states as heretofore to place their resources freely at the disposal of the crown we have considered the adjustments which will be required to enable individual states to enter thc federation on the basis of the general financial schemc taking as its leading assumption that in an ideal system of federal finance all federal units would contribute on a uniform basis to the federal resources it is gencrally agreed that the terms of entry of the states into federatibn should as far as possible entail the gradual elimination of contributions of a special character cash contributions or ceded territories by certain states to the resources of the federal government and the disappearance of the immunities or privileges of certain states in respect of certain lhcads of federal revenue sea customs salt posts and telegraphsunequal incidenceafter suggesting how some of the neces sary adjustments should be made before the entry of the states into federation the committee in paragraph  expresses the opinion that the present cash contribu tions of unequal incidence paid by certain statescontravene the fundamentai principle that contributions to federal revenues should be on a uniform basis and endorses the view of the davidson committee that there is no permanent place for such exceptional and unequal contributions in a system of federal financewe accordingly recommcnd that generally speaking these contributions should be extin guished not later than the expiry of the period of x years provided for in paragraph  above and in case this period should be protracted longer than is expected that a moiety should cease to be paid at the latest in  years from the date of federation and the whole within  years some of us would favour the immediate extinction of the cash contributions but the general view is that during the period of x years the entire sacrifice of this source of federal revenue would not be practicable at the same time it is the view of all of us that any cash contributions wlhiclh are continued during the period of x years must be taken in reduction ot any contribution under paragraphs  and  of this report which the states may be called upon to make during that period we have taken note of the view of the davidson committee in paragraph  of their report that the tributes and cessions of terri tory for defence have for the most part a common origin we therefore accept their view that states which in the past have ceded territory in return for protection are entitled equally with the states now paying cash contri butions to some form of relief alost of us agree with the conclusion of the davidson com nittee that the net value of the territories at the time of cession constitutes the fairest basis for calculating the relief to be granted when such relief is desired by a states we fully endorse the view of the davidson committee that interstate tributes are anti federal and we view with approval the sugges tion that these tributes should disappear turning to the question of the immunities and privileges great and small which are enjoyed by numerous states and of which the nature and value is indicated in the davidson report and its appendices we would reiterate the view that the entry of each state into the federation should as far as possible result in its assuming liability for an equitable portion of federal expenditure nevertheless we agree with tihe conclusion of the davidson commitee that where a state enjoys privileges or immuni ties the value of which is not offset by any special contributiofi that statc must retain the balance in its favour in whole or in part on its entry into the federations in the case of sea customs we note that the present annual value of the immunities enjoyed bv  mlaritime states amounts to bver i lakhc and we recommend that the question of extinguishing thesc immunities by compensa tion should be left over for consideration after the federation comes into being  the existing treaties and agreements must be fully observed and no change made in them without the consent of the states concerned but we recommend that maritime states should retain at the most not more than the value of the duties on goods imported through their ports for consumption by their own subjectsreport on commercialdiscriminationthe conference also endorsed the report of the committee on cormmercial discrimination this committee accepted the basic proposal of the federal struc ture committee at the last conference that the avoidance of discrimination would best be achieved by specific pro visions in the constitutionsome members were disposed to the view that it was undesirable to attempt to provide against discrimination when it resulted from administra tive action on the ground intcr alia that as the powers to prevent administrative discrimination must necessarily be vested in the governor general and the governors the possession of such powers would be tantamount to conferring a right of appeal to those high officers against any action of the ministry which had given rise to dissatisfaction on the part of any individual or minoritythe general view of the committee was how ever that no such consequence need be antici pated from the inclusion of  the prevention of commercial discrimination  in the list of the governorgenerals and governors  special re sponsibilities and that the adoption of this expedient was the only available means of making such provision as can be made against administrative action of this natureas regards the persons and bodies to whom the specitic provisions should apply it was sug gested that in the case of companies protection on the lines indicated above should be confined to companies registered in india it was how ever pointed out that a provision on these lines involved possible attempts at double registra tion by companies originally registered in the united kingdom which would itievitably give rise to great legal confusion and conflicts of jurisdiction the majority of the committee how ever considered that no subject of his majesty domiciled in the united kingdom and no company registered in the united kingdom should be subjected to any dis abilities or discrimination    to which subjects of his majesty domiciled in india or companies registered in india are not subjected in the united kingdomindian registered companies on the other hand would be secured against legislative or atlministrative action imposing upon thcm con ditions as to the conduct of their business which discriminate against particular classes throughi the operation of the general principles indicated in paragraph  of thc report of the federal structure committee cited in paragraph i abovepending agreement between a medical council in india and the general medical council some snecial provision mav be required regarding the right to practisc in india of practitioners rcgis tered in the united kilgdomthe committee agreed that bounties or sub sidies should be available without distinction to all tirms or individuals engaged in a particular trade or industry at the time the cnactment authorizing them is passed but that in regard to companies entering the field after that date the government should be at liberty to impose the conditions of eligibility reconimended by the external capital committee
