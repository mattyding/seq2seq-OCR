progress inpalestinetwo nervous racesfronm our special correspondentpalestine has passed a quiet and satis factory year controversy has died down in the absence of incidents to nourish it and the economic condition of the country has on the wvhole been excep tionally good the drought in the early part of theyear caused hardship to the fellahin of the hill country but the oranges and grapefruit of the coastal plain have continued to be one of the few articles in the world for which there is a steadily increasingdemand this has brought money into the countrythe revenue returns for the first six months of the financial year show a surplus of Â£p this is proof both of prosperity and good husbandry in consequence the government considered itself justified inraising the immigration schedule for the halfyear to  which is almost double wlhat it has been for the past five years this decision has naturally given great satisfaction to the zionists to these good points may be added the distinct personal success xvhich has been achieved by the new high commissioner lieutenantgeneral sir a g wauchope with both jews and arabs he has im pressed them both by the great pains which he has taken to acquaint himself with their affairs and by the sympathy which he has shown for their hopes and difficulties none of his predecessors can have done so much travelling about the country as he does or have acquired so rapidly a full and personal knowvledge of its problemsthe racial antithesisit would have been pleasant to recall that as a consequence of these hopeful factors the racial antithesis betwecn jew and arab which is the core of the palestinian problem was on the way to being overcome that cannot be said the two are still highly nervous and mutually distrustful of one another this has been clearly shown by the lack of enthusiasm to sav the least of it with which both arabs and jews received the reference in the high commissioners speech at geneva to his hope of establish ing a legislative council in the near future the arabs still claim by right of numbers the dominating influence in such an assemblv and distrust the presence of official members the jewvs on the other hand are more fearful than before of being overruled by an arab majority dr arlosoroff the head of the jewish agency in jerusalem in a recent state ment seemed to threaten that a decision by the british government to establish the council would antagonize jews all over the wvorld both parties apparently shrink from the risk of suffering defeat in such an important and public arena it looks therefore as if the council mnight once again have to be shelvedif this proves to be the case it will not necessarily be a disaster or mean that no progress has been made towards bringing arab and jew to work together in the course of the last  years numerous per sonal contacts and friendships have in evitably been established between mem bers of the two races both in business and in society and in government service the racial distinction is little felt there are conspicuous instances to prove that in matters of common interest arab and jew are not averse from collaborating arab capital has joined with jewish in the two largest commercial enterprises in the country the palestine electric corpora tion and the exploitation of the dead sea salts arab and jewish labour likewise frequently unite to gain their common ends latterly representative arabs and jews have been induced by the govern ment to sit together on advisory boards dealing with various matters of public in terest such as agriculture education and roads and in some cases have worked together harmoniously and effectively unfortunately as soon as this participa tion began to be represented as coopera tion with the government there were numerous resignations among the arabslocal governmentnone the less this shows that common ground can be found and it is surely from foundations such as these that co operation between the races can best be developed to proceed straight to the legislative council may be too big a jump but that there is an unexpressed demand by the population of palestine for association with the government secems certain from the amount of criticism wlhich exists of the administration and of the laws drafted by the government a case in point is the local government ordinance the text of which has just been published it has been unanimously con demned by all the municipalities of palestine the jewish municipality of tel aviv being at one in this with the arab corporations their objection to it is that it places them completely in leading strings and makes them dependent for any except the most trivial decisions on the consent of the high commissioner how they ask are local councils to develop any sort of responsibility and serve as a train ing ground for legislators if they are hedged in at all points by vetos and restrictions the criticism is a fair one the purpose of the law is presumably to ensure that local affairs are efficiently and honestly conducted but it ought to be possible to ensure thiswithout compelling a mu p  i council to ask the high commiss ners consent if it wants to buy a fireengine moreover there is something in the com plaint that the form and language of britishmade laws are not suited to the population of palestinethe question of palestinian officials raises another grievance which is shared alike by arabs and jewsthe cost of the administration the government staff is certainly large both in jerusalem and the districts but the particular conditions of palestine possibly justify this what is less justifiable is that so few palestinians should have becn recruited for the higher posts the case of transjordan which is administered entirely by local officials with the help of a few british advisors is in crying contrast the advantage of having palestinians in the legal depart ment of the government has already been mentioned there is certainly no good reason why only one out of the seven or eight leading posts in the central admini stration should be filled by a palestinian the same applies to the assistant district officersthe saving which would be thus effected is only one consideration the principal advantage would be that in this way the population would be more directly implicated in the government of the country and the arabs associated with the jews the argument that it would not do to have arabs administered by jews or jews by arabs is defeated by the exist ence of palestinian judges in the courts and palestinian mayors in the towns
