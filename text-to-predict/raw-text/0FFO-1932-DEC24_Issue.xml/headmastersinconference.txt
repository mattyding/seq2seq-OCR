of subjects at the london school of econlomics could be found all the essentials of a liberal education urged that the timic had come for greater recognition of the possibilities and functions of the modern universities as against oxford and cambridge the position occupied by tie two ancient universities in thc cducational system of england was remarkable the general public spoke liabitually of  the universities  in terms of a boat race to them they were two places from where  young men would corme next april for the annual proces sion of boats between putney and mortlake kle was not suggesting that nobody should go to oxford or cambridge but only that not every body who could should go there automatically without considering seriously the modern alter natives educationally all our best eggs were put into two particular baskets might not that be a little dangerous discussing the relative merits and demerits of the old and thc new seats of learning sir wvilliam beveridge described as a little frivolous the idea that so long as a man had spent three years in a university what hc had studied was a matter of indifferencethat he would be cqually well prepared for life whether what he had learned had any bearing on life or not in plain language some of the subjects now allowed to eat up the best years of our best youth were dead there was nothing more of importance to be found in them they were a refug from reality not a pathway to it some of the subjects that pass for humanities and not in the classics only are as dead today as exhausted coalmines he saidit is time to leave them to specialists to the collectors of fossils dead or dying humanities ought to be replaced not by natural science which abstracted and left out half the world but by living humanitics found in the circle of the social scienceslondon universitythe headmaster of mierchant taylors school mr spcncer leeson and thc high master of st paulsschool mr john bell were appointed a deputatioti to convey to the university of london the views bf thc conference on the terms of admission to that universityhlr leeson addressing the meeting said he wvould refer to only three of the difficulties they wished to sce removed one was the practice of the university in requiring a boy who either had not passed the matriculation examination or had taken tho school certificate and had not attained all the necessary credits in that certiticate at the same time to take the whole examination over again the second point was the requirement that a boy must either pass in latin or in science the third was that the university authorities should bc asked whether they could not give some kind of recognition to the higher certificate examination of other bodies for the purpose of exemption from their own inter mediate examinationmr t kingdomi headmaster of nvyggeston grammar school leicester movedthat this conference while accepting the principle of income limits in the award of scholarships and special places regrets that the board of education in circular  has sug gested so low a limit as to rule out a large number of children who are deserving of secondary educationthe

adopted as tile substantive motionmr h h hardy headmaster of shrews bury school moved a resolution deploring  the growing tendency of the university authorities to demand of boys in their last year at school particularly those who are intended for medicine and the law that they should undertake outside the school curriculum work properly belonging to the first year at the university he instanced one cambridge college vhich demanded that a boy who was to study medicine must have passed three parts of his first mb before leaving school the consequence was that the boymust be more or less segregated in his studies and had to drop out of the cultural sides of his school work two boys who were intending to take up law were carly this autumn instructed by the colleges with which they had registered to get on forthwith with their legal studies at school it meant assimilating  pages of six very weighty tomes totally unsuitable for a boy to be reading at school even if he had the timestimulus to studiesthe motion was seconded by the rev dr a t p willunsis headmaster of winchester college and opposed by mr e r thomas headmaster of royal gratnmar school new castleontyne and dr terry thomas head master of leeds grammar school mr thonias said that a good deal of the work demanded was proper to the school curriculum and that work which had some bearing on a boys future career gave an additional zest and stimulus to his studies in his last school year dr terry thomias said that there were other universities besides oxford and cambridge and the resolu tion kould be harmful to sehools which dalt with these othcrs the schools had sometimes to persuade the newer universities not to include in their first year work that should b done in the sixth fornm at school the first xib work could be doite in any good schoolby agreement the tendency complained of in the resolution was attributed only to the oxford and cambridge college authorities and the specific mention of medicine and the law was omitted in this amended shape the motion was carried
