the wise mena child and the starfroni a correspondentit was just after christmas that they came the wvise men whom after ages created into kings bringing their gifts of gold and frankincense and myrrh and yet one associates them with the shep herds and their flock the angel and the multitude of the heavenly host and rightly and naturally with the star of bethlehem thc great painters and the great poets are partly responsible for this the earliest recollection of childhood which likes to think that the child received presents too on his birthday even though he was so poor as to be born in a stable see how fronm far upon the eastern rodethe starled wizards haste with odours sweet o run prevent them with thy humble ode and lay it lowly at his blessed fcetso milton ushers in his hymn on the morning of christs nativity and perugino adorns a serene fresco of the adoration of the kings with a background of sheep and shepherds green pastures and a courtly stable a star shining down in broad daylight while a long procession headed by the bearers of the gold frankin cense and myrrh approach mary then they kneel down before the king of kings and lord of lords the only ruler of princesafter all onlv  days separate epiphany from christmas and those days mingle together into one great day of manifestation which was to transform the lhistory of the world indeed the eastern church originally combined together in its ancient epiphany events so separate as the nativity the baptism and the first miracle at cana time stood still and every year of the nearly  since then time stops and stays at christmas just as the star  stood over where the young child was how well one remembers that night when one was first lifted out of bed and shown the star of bethlehem look said the nurse there is the star  i looked and there it was brilliant in the sky immense so it seemed dwarfing all other stars with its steadfast radianceit is said that for four years in succes sion before the birth of christ the dog star sirius rose and shone at sunrise upon the first of the month mesori which being interpreted means the birth of the prince with what a vonder must the three wise men of whom we should think as of three eminent members of the royal society engaged today on some profound research in physical or astronomical science with what awe must they have observed this extraordinarv phenomenon in the heavens wne see them on a hoarv moun tain in assyria or egypt or persia scan ning the sky during those years of prelude pondering on the meaning of sirius and his motions finally struck vith the splen dour of scientific inspiration thev reach their provisional conclusion yes they will put this poignant and agitating idea to the test they mount their camels for the lmile journey over the desert over the ancient hills and through the waters of the south slowly thev wind alongkaspar slightly bowed with age his white beard and hair telling his years melchior in middle life and prime of scientific attainment and balthazar beautiful with the grace of youth and ardour for the revelation of the mysterv what if sirius had deceived them after all three years in succession they have seen him the fourth is the decisive period in that year they have set out and after months of journeying they approach jerusalemthey ask of herod the king  where is he that is born king of the jevs  his star we have seen where the sun rises and we have come to cast ourselves in obeisance before him herod small worldly king is jealous and alarmed he calls his cabinet and asks them where christ is to be born thev search the archives and reply in memorable wordsin bethlehem of judca for thus it is written by the prophetand thou bethlehem in the land of juda art not the least among the princes of juda for out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule my pcople israelkaspar melchior and balthazar looked at one another and nodded the weariness of their limbs left them the problem was almost unravelled they must set on instantlv to bethlehemnight had already come down but they would not wait tomorrow was the first of the month mlesori and sirius would arise at dawn in splendour the camels quickened their pace and darkness was no longer darkness to the wise men as they hurried over the last six miles of their pilgrimagedawn was beginninig to streak the heavens when thev reached the outskirts of bethlehem they searched the eastern sky with anxious eyes and balthazar could hardly contain his emotion even kaspar and melchior trembled as they crouched upon their camels then balthazar cried out and pointed at the first mild beam of rising sirius spell bound they watched it seemed that as the beams expanded they shone down with a peculiar brightness and glory on to a shattered stable on the very edge of the city the wise men climbed down from their camels with shaking limbs they untied the box wvhich kaspar had carried containing those regal gifts which were at once the symbols of their faith and the vindication of their sciencethey approached the stable which the star had now noosed in a circle of serene light there  they saw the young child with mary his mother they fell downand worshipped him and as they wor shipped calm came to them they knew at last wvhat truth was and their minds were soothed with a sense of enormous tranquillity quietly they opened their treasures and presented to the child gold and frankincense and myrrh
