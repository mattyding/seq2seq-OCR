 in the gardena year of extremesfrom a correspondentfew tears will be shed over the passing of  for horticulturally it has been a year of unpleasant extremes when that delightful but indefinable time we call spring is curtailed as in  gardeners may well feel aggrieved because for some of them more of beauty and interest is packed illto those few nmonths perhaps than into the rest of the year but when spring is coldshouldered off the calendar altogether as it was this year it is as if injury were added to insultfor the second year running faith in the old saying that a late spring and a good season for farm orchard and garden go hand in hand has been rudely shaken it may be that the author of that classic aphorism which has more than a grain of truth in it had frost and the retarding effect of gloomy low tem peratures in mind more than the actual destruction of which the east wind is capable there can be little that practised gardeners do not know about the evil powers of the east wind on vegetation but in march april and may of this year there were days when though the mercury was nearer deg than deg the young growth on some trees shrubs and plants could be seen to curl up and wither as if a flame had passed over it no doubt the persistent easterly wind was responsible for the tardy progress of all outdoor growth in southern england this year once january had passed for in the soft weather that opened the year there was no hanging back of anything once again the vernal drought and the drying winds demonstrated the main risk of the spring planting of trees and shrubs and the losses must have been seriousthe year  has been one of extremes in the early drought abnormal lowv tem peratures and general gloominess of the grst half in the tropical heat of august and torrential rains of october and but for the blaze of august the annual allow ance of sunshine would have been almost skimpy enough for a record yet in spite of so little encouragement the standard at the rhododendron show in may and again at the chelsea show was as high as usual while that at stockport was voted higher than ever these two great flower shows however derive their support mainly from nurserymen wvho seem able to cir cumvent all the moods of the weather but in the home counties and with the inevitable exceptions amateur gardeners fared none too well in  early flowering shrubs which are rightly re ceiving more and more attention in gar dens had little chance this vcar and much of the joys of april and may were lost because of the shrivelling of the blossonm by the pitiless wind even those tough inatives the thorns were only half hearted in their display and very late the ash was not in leaf until midjune and then only because it was spurred on by a few hot days early in the month border roses againwith the inevitable exceptionshad little encouragement this year they responded well at first to the august sun but except on heavy soil were tired out by the excessive heat long before it passed bv the same agencv lilies that usually come into bloom late in august were forced into flower earlier than usual and though the displav was fine the autumn rains spoiled the seed harveston the other hand autumnflowering plants like michaelmas daisies border phloxes and the autumn yellows flourished amazinglv in the rains which most of them like the heat of august too set the stage for a panorama of colour such as we are not allowed every year and if the ultimate picture fell short of its promise that was due to the unfor tunate onslaught of wind and rain at a critical time just what the ripening heat of august will do for next vears floral display will depend on the weather of the second quarter of the year but its influ ence must be for goodas if in tune wvith a sombre year death has laid hands on two famous pioneers of horticulturemiss gertrude jekyll and george forrest both had a pro found influence on gardens and garden ing she by her wise teaching he by the variety and interest of his introductions of new asiatic plants and especially of rhododendrons amateurs have also to mourn the loss of mr vicary gibbs as keen and sound a connoisseur of trees and shrubs as ever was it is the ironv of fate that the collection he formed over so many years at aldenham should have had to be disperseda process that nothing apparently can stay but the rare succession of a gardening father by a gardening son dr claridge druce pro bablv knew more of our native plants in their habitats than anv one of his time and sir william somerville versed in both theorv and practice lent invaluable aid to the cause of british forestry
