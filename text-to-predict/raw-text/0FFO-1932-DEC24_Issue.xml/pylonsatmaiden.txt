pylons at maidencastletoys beside antiquityfrom a correspondenton the ramparts of maiden castle at sunset it is easy to fee sure that the earth does not really go round the sun sun and moon eternally pursue one another in an arc above that undying majesty of human handiwork in a neverchanging place the ringsfor so those who live near the  camp  call it familiarly just as the roman amphitheatre a mile away is maumbury ringsseem like a model of the solar system in an antique atlas being themselves the central orb and the heavenly bodies mere planetsthe hugeness of the fortification man made though it is makes mans own more solemn more highlywrbught creations appear dwarfish the great trilithons of stonehenge would be but childrens bricks in the vast arena at the summit if they stood in the topmost trench they would be invisible from the thirdlowest vallunm of the four main walls the entire length of fleet street and the strand to come to meaner things would not make a circlet large enough for the crown of the pro montory but there is no splendour of a great road leading to mai dun the high fort no culmination of sweeping downs to make it a bleak precipice of resistance higher hills are not far off the ancient ridge way from east to west starred with tumuli is as lofty all round are other earthworks and the burialplaces of nillenniums of the dead yet the castle remains a lonely and unique immensity there is nothing in the world comparable to itthere have been hutman beings in this region ever since people lived in families in england at maumbury rings mainly a roman work in its definitive form there has been found a palaeolithic shaft and in dorchester are traces of every age fifty years or more ago it needed popular outcry to save maumbury from being cloven by a railway even as thomas hardys  round pummery close by actually is cut and now pylons are being set up all along the southern contour of mai dun though they run just outside the earthen circles possiblv because the whole place is in the care of the kings office of works it was the fortress of other kings maybe  odd years agothe pylons suggest vulgarity if not sacrilege but maiden castle if anything has gained glory by the very nearness of the cobweb columns on a fine evening a day or twvo ago the three men working high up on the slender filaments in the late light were nothing more than black insects clinging to a sticky plantspike another score murmuring hoarsely to a cry halfcheer halfchantv tugged at a wire cable to tauten the structure in its chalk rubble base and were only ants seething about overturned eggs so little so impotent thousands labouring for manv years with sharp stones must have sweated to build those five miles of ft trenches that will still be unharmed when the grids are a handful of rustfor so pettv an end too do these gaunt things come striding from the east from the turbulent dirt of cities into the green and gold and crimson of the occident sun a crowd of ploverflying by a strange derisive accident in a formation that took the shape of an aeroplanethrew all human skill into absurdity upon no alarm perceptible by our senses after their wont thev had risen with one accord from the thin steel streaks of the winter bournes had wheeled perfectly across the line of pylons settled again a quarter of a mile away vithout a straggler departing from their unity their quick wings catching a few last ravs twinkled like closepacked bait chased by mackerel in a dark sea what do our devices of com munication matter to them  what need has their commonwealth to create ugliness for greater convenienceof life as the sun vanished utterly a light cloud on a distant hill that a moment before had been a delicate transparent havstack of flame became black the crescent moon colourless till then suddenly received her consorts light and tried to throw it back upon the wriggling men one small star grew plain not yet fully kindled still shivering as if afraid to come out the air and the whole sphere were all at once cold but a mile away far down the line of whitewashed pylons in the gloomy east a single tiny window in a cottage threw a beam so friendly that the ghostly skeletons were mere bogeys no blaze brought from distant power could be more triumphant even the greater wonder to the north the huge masts of the wireless station were mocked at they tower like lords in this empire of machines they should be tall kings in the purple ploughland thin and splendid and merciless but a heifer as of immemorial right stood in silhouette upon the highest ridge and lowed at them with brutish contempt a solitary hare climbed the steep trench painfully for so limber a beast and paid no heed to the working bipeds fieldfares made their sudden low assemblies and vanished upon their old occasions we do but share the universe with them not possess itpylons are ugly here  no only brittle toys of no account they are the newest conquest of the difficult globe by man but not the last for on maiden castle he himself is only a child even todav
