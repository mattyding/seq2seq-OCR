irn the comtuittee pon ybgs termis hso was to have the delay whichxvas yesterday so comideraelyg raa to bim by the con nlitteemr jovthe committee wras vars that tbiswas aques tion of costs and in dealing with it ho would eg to refer them to the portsrlington case to be found in perry and iknapp p  which wavery analagous to that at present under their consideration in that case witnesses who were to have proved the safe ctustody of the roll had not arrived in town upon the belief that tho inquryv was to go over the easterholydays t andin thatcase delay was only grantedopon the payment of costs the application for delay coming from the petitionerswhen he talked ia this case ofcnsa tta he did not meantoimputeit tohislearnedfriendsbueshatgros neglect was evident in the gettjng up of thecase must hae been abtuidantly enident to the moat casual observer under such circumstmnces it would be unfair that the aitting mem ber wvhose interests the committee were bound to protect should have to pay the expenses arising out of the sins of omission and commission committed by his opponents his brief as he had yesterday truly statuwsw onlya copy of the petition with the addezdesz of anotice at its conclu sion that his learned friends wvould not go into a scrutinly in the sweeping and general case opened by bis learned friend much costs must have been incurred to enable him to snsver it but beyond this was it to be endured that the sitting memwber should be comapelled to labour under a charge of the gravest nature for at least another wveek w hile his adversaries obtained time to supply the deficiencies in his accusation how was it that his learned friends had not ascertained that the sheriff had net verified the pollboolks while his learned friend had been made acquainted with it by a blunder the pollbooks were not authenticated by an additional bluader the affidavits were not here the committee hiad not the record in court and why should air barron suffer from the gross reglect of lis opponents even upon the payment of costs the case had scarcely teen entered into or was merely upon the threshhold of inquirythccilaieran beg your pardon this case has been en tered into anid indeed adduced and arguments heard which haave induced the committee to grant as much delay as will enable them to deal imnartial justice between the partiesmr joy begged paraon of the commttee the case was not enterod inlto asc item melon the first vitness was stepped at thc first question and wvhy he would beg leave to ask should his client suffer even though those who opposed him mighlt be innocent if the committee agreed to this delay wvithout the payment of costs more than the ustul de lay and negligence in irish election cases would take place and petitioners supported by a strong fund subscribed in a manner vhich he would not characterize or by their own long purse would make a run at sitting members which they couidwitls difficulty encounter it was no small grievance to remain a wveek under imputations of so grave a nature that perhaps might carr their own cure and as a matter of course both oci principle and authority he was entitled to the costs attendant upon further delay it might be said that the oojections niade to the nonproduction of the affi davits and the non verification of the pollbookswere mere matters of form but matters of form he would take the liberty of stating were indispensable to the ends of justice however trivial they might appdar to bemr thmswmtei denied that the petitioners had been guilty of any niegligence while it was admitted at the other side that the returninig officer the sheriff had been guilty of a culpable dereliction of his daty in not verifying the poll books but li ilearned friends could cure the evils of delay and prevent the annovances of wlhich they complained by at once admitting the pobooks it was admitted on saturday by his learned frield mr austin that he had no brief and no witness and lie even complained of losing two posts in ecusequence of the personal accommodation which he mr thsesiger had received from the committee new allow they had no vvitnesses as to the scrutinybut what muat be said of the charges of bribery of which they pretended they knewv nothing the learned counsel contended that the sitting member was now in a better situatious to meet the charges made againist him than lie was before his opening speech inasmuch as specific cases of briberv haiiimn aid lio iglt f he thought proper bring forward wit nesses to rebut tlienimr joy roe
