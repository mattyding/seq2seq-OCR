they did not hold as essential parts of the roman catholic creed the doctrine of teinfallibilityof the popesdeposing powerhisrightto absolve subjects from their allegiance and other matters and an oath was framed upon that with the coneurrence he believed wvith ke cooperation of the british committee ofroman catholics the protestation had been subscribed by three of the vicarsstolical who immediately declared off when it assumed the form of an oatb to one of whom a formal letter of thanks was addressed by the pope through the president for his op poition to the oath the right rev prelate theni read extracts rom various documents but in so lowv a tone of voice as to renderit a matter of tho utmost difficulty to eollect even their purport in the gallery we applied to the right rev prelate hffs papers but not having received them we can onlzroelnd from the htasty ana inaudible manner in which tney were read to give a meagre outline of their contents in the event of the emancipation bill being earried the pope gave permission to his dear catholic ehildren of great britain to adopt one of three forms or oath he wvould not read them but in no one of the three forms was there a single word aflvrding se curity to the protestant establishmenit or even to the pro testant succession to the throne further than that it should remain in the present family after this they went no mire to rome the right rev prelato then read an extract from a letter w ritten by dr mllilner wvhomt in spiritual matters the noble earl wvas bouni to obey having authority in the dis trtet where he resided and wsho was as honest as any of the roman catholic bishops or clergy dr lilner x ut the ques tiee in the form of asvlhorism thuslt does not lnn tntue province of any man or body of

perjury that an unlawvful oath a oath agaiost the rights orreal utility of the church could not bind any one and that in e atters relating to the juris diction of the pope his holiness of course considered himself the selejudge of the unlawfulness of oaths the next quotation wvas from the evidence of dr hale as to the powoer of the church to dispense wvith oaths and ina which it was laid dowvn that the church had the power of dis nasln wiati baths as the interpreter of the divine will ei tonght that he had now succeeded in showving that the poep wvas fully recoanized as hatvinsg the power of de dliring what oath was lavul and wlhat might be dispensedithby the power of thechurch as contrary to the utility of the ehurch looking back then upon tsh whole statement which he had made hie did not scrulple to reaffirm the ac ouracy of his quotation and as to time stateinuest connected with it the noble lord would find that in the prelininary portion of the work referred to this productioii of tiie honest franciscan as lie was called would lie conceived leave no doubt upon any impartial mnid as to the honesty ofa franciscan he could furnish from bishlop burets fi ory of his oun timnes a single anecdote illustrative of the usture of that honesty and the extent to which it might be  confided in that learned prelate expected that the peace of utrecht would become a subject of discussion in their ierdshipa house he therefore prepared himself to take a part in that discussion but it did nlot take placo and he not wishing that the preparation he had made should ho loot to the world included it in his history  the late king he says meaning william iii who as thme bouso knew iargely confided in bishop burnet  told him that the ge arotestant princes wvere generally convinced that the confessors of the roman catholic princes used towards them the dispensing power delegated by the pope vith regard to oaths t ayrecognizedasan establishedmaxina that their words and faith bound them as men andasmembers of society but that their oaths vere acts of religion and that their con esors could exercise in their favour a dispensing power as regarded obligations for this reason protestant princes pre ferred rather to depend on their honour than the oath of a roman catholic prince to prove this he mentioned the hiot that the protestants of france thought that they had
