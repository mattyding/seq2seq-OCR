machinery for religious instruc tion and it required nothing but able wvorkcmen to render it efficacious let them choose fortheir enterprise a district in theworst part of the netropolis their object

that district by the inquiry whicir proved that only fivcersous attended the meetinghouse from the inimediate neig bourhood in consequence of the system of persuasion wlhereas  had been made to attend a church by what be w ould call the aggressive system that is the system of daily isitation the congregation of that meetinghouse wvas merely a cbngregation msiving fromi ono place to another the principle of aggression was to create a newvniarket ind non congregations there was iunfortunately a prqvalent idlea that ts affect the religiouis feelings of the masses of tho uneducated and
