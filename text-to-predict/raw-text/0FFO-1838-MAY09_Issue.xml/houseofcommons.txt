seizure of some british ships on the coast of africa it ap peared that in july  two british yessels were seized on the african corst by some french ships of war and that subsequently in february  a blockade had been raised on that coast when some other british vessels were also seized and the commercial interests of this country materi ally interfered with ho would therefore ask the noble lord whether thc english government had rentonstrated with the french and had preferred the claims of the sufferers by that unjust proceeding on the ansvwer of the noble lord de pended the line of conduct

some length of time to explain his views his reason for moving for a committee of the whole housctas that in  wlhen the noble lord the member for nortl lancashire lord stanley had brouht forward tho irist temporalities bill some deobt existed as td the course to bh pursued in consequence of which the billwas referred to i select committee of which lord althorp was the chairman and their decision was that no measure rolating to a tax could be introducec except in a committee of the whole house as the subject of first fruits and tenths was nol generally understeod by hon members he would ex plain their nature as clearly as he could the bon member then went through an historical account of thc first fruits and tenths from their introduction to the pre sent time with respect to the act of queen anne he must say that he considered it was a miserablo filure as far as it regarded the poor clergy and his wvish was that it should be made subservient to the objects which her majesty had in niew at tho time it was passed of the livings in this coun try where we boasted of the best endowed church in the world there were not less than  with an income under  per annum  between  and  and i o betwecn  and i besidesthese there were upwards of  curacies vwith stipends under l per annum now in what way did this happen and why had the act so greatly falited in its purpose i he did not mean to give anv offence to those connected with the subject but in his opinion the governors of the queens bounty had not done their duty anid had not attended to the solemin trust which had been reposed in them for thcbenefit of the poor clergy by the munificent spirit of queen anne in addition to this there were many very equivocal expressions in the act which rendered its meaning ditficult to bh properly understood ho thought howtever that this ouglht to be corrected for where any law operated oppressively on any portion of the people it yws the duty of parlianient to equalize it so as to be just to wards all he certainly must say that ho considered the governors as trustees of tho bounty and as having received from the queen a royal injunction had been guilty of agreat dereliction of duty in not construing the act to the advantage of the poor clergy the value of the livingain this country had been calculated at  but then there was x deficseiiv of  ia the real value as compared with the neminnr the question wvas what then xlas this sourec of income ca pable of yielding  and he bad found by calculation that it was capable of producing  vhereas it only yielded at the present time   what was the renmedy for this state ot tsinnas l ho propesed in the first place that first fruits should tctaltogether abolished because he contsidered tbat the payment of first fruits acted oppressively ox the cleroy dtring the first year they held tiseir livings he wouid not however stop there and he further proposed thlat all livings under  should be exempted from the paymnent of tenths and that all livings abovo  of yearly value sbould be charged with onetenth of their net value he would further state that it was not his intention to apply these regulations to the livings of clergymen now in posses sion he proposed that they should remain as they were at present and that tho regulation he suggestod should only tako effect on clergymen to be hereafter appointed what it vould be asked wvould be the effect of thits schenie on the fund devoted to the support of the poorer clergy i by a cal culation lie had made he found tlhat a tenths of the annual value of the whole livings of the clergy would amount to ow and that that sum would be at their disposal in stead of only  the amount at present derived from first fruits and tenths that amount however could ot ho obtained by thegradua operatior of the plan he proposed and not all at once because no clergyman at present in pos session of a livmng ivould he affected by his proposal and it was only on feturo presentations to hienefices that sis plan wuld take effect on those benefices the next question was as to tho application of the fund to bo thus raised  and in his opinion tho first object which they ouriit to have in view was the augmentation of the livings of the poor clergy he vihed as the chief object of lis measure to increase those livings and to give to the working clergsy a clear annual income of not less thasi  and he wished also that no curate should have less than e ayear but this part of his plan did not rest on his authority alone ldlt year a select consimittee was appointed by thel houso to coissider the mnode of payment and the application of first fruits and tenths and the report of that committee recommended the adoption of measures similar to those which hc had proposed lhe hon member then read a passage from the report reccmmendhing the abolition of first fruits and that the tenths should be deyoted to the augmentation of poor livings to the providing of retirng pnsions for aged and infirni in cumbents and for  endowment of additional churches sueh swere the terms of the report now his plan was not exactly similar to that recommnended by the com mittee but be had so framed his bill that the house would be at liberty to adopt wliuchever plan they might most approve he was aware of the difficulties he had to encounter and that objections would be raised to the measure he proposed and he would therefore shortly advert to some of the objections which would prohablybe broughtforward the most prominentobleetion likely to bourgedagainst hins was that there were no petitions from the poor clergy on the table and that therefore there was no discontentment with the present state of things but could any gentleman suppose vith the report of the commsittee before hint that there was not good ground for discontent and could it be imagined that inen with only l  or  ayear could live on such stmrs without feeling too strongly the pressure of poverty why theso sums were not equal to what was yeaily earned by a working mechanic and yet the persons who held them were rnen of education and expected to liye as gentlemen but the reason vhy no petitions had been presented to the house nas possibly because the poor clefelttliemselves dependent on the higher orders in the church he said so in no offensive sense but the poorer clergy were naturally anxious not to offend those with whom the w ished as it wias their interest to live in terms of amity and peace blut athoughs no petitions had been presented ho himselfas as other members of the house had received masses of letters from the poor clergy complaining of the present state of things and ho w ould take leave to read extracts from a few of those letters to the house rhe first extract he should read ws from a letter ddressed to himself the hon member then read a pas sage from the letter alluded to complaining that the tirst rruits and tenths were paid upon the valuation of livins made in the reign of henry vii and of the mode efappli cation of the fund raised from those sources and that in con equence of the present state of things a largo number of the lergy were left in a degraded state of poverty the next letter to which he would advert was addressed to a friend of ats a member of that houseand was written by a clergyman af westinoreland the writer stated that h eld a liing of inly  annual value that he had a large family that hia wife was suffering severely from ill health and that lie was in a stat ef the greatest poverty such said the hon mem ber was the condition of some of tihe clergynen of the church aaed he wondered when he reflected onx the condi tien o� the writer that he did net apply fos relief to thecareshunien worushouse the next letter he would advert to containedvery important informationad was addressed to himself the hon member then read an extract from the letter complaining of the condition of the poorer clergy and giving a comparative statement of the first fruits and enths chargeable ca a number of livings in various parts of the cauntry according to the valuation of henry viil and ac cording to tshe recent valuation and showing the annual amount ofdifference he then wsent on to say that if the tenths payable on those livings had been charged on the recent valuatio insteadl of that of henry viil they would have amounted to   whereas they nly amounted actuallv to  othetpart ofwhat theycught to be exclusive ofthe firstiruits it had been argued thatas therehadbeen no altera tionrfrom the time of hery viito queen anne there ought to hs no alteration now but the bishops from whom he had quoted were so far from tlinking that no alteration was re quired that they applied for an alteration four years after queen annes act was passed it was stated that in the time of queen anne they paid nearly to the full value of the amount of the tenth and firstfroits that was paid in the time of henry viil but how were they paying them at the present time as compare with the time of queen anne some did not pay onefourth some not onesixth some not oneeighth others not onetenth one only a six teenth and another only onethirtieth wvhereas in the time of queen anne they paid nearly to the whole aiuount the hen member then proceeded to read n long extract from the return of the elcclesiastical commissioners consisting of a statement of the value of the income of each prelate of the church the amount paid for first fruits and tenths andthe deficiency in the latter as compared with the time of queen anne the whole system then was inaccurate unequal and unjust bishop burnet had left it on recore tiati me the pareat for first fruits and tenths amounted to  or  ayear whereas at the present time notwithstanding the alteration in the value of meney it amounted to only sool so great was the deficiency to the disadvantage of the poor clergy it was said that it would be oppressive to demand tho paymant of the real tenths upon all hnings above the value of  ayear hut that ho denied because no man ever entered on any such living wvithout knoving beforehand that he wcas liable to have onetenth taken from his income an objection hadbeen urged on a late occasion by the hon member for the university of oxford who said that many persons had con into the possession of advowsons under the impression that they w ere atall times to pay according to the rate fixed in the time of henry viil he could notdenythat there wassome force in that observation but he begged to ask the noble lord the member fornorth lancashirev hether it was also applicable to the irish chutch temporalitiebill end in a much higher degreo for the irish clerp paid only onetwentieth inatead of oneteuth  another objection which had been urged for nearly three centuries was that there was no valuation upon which first fruits and tenths could be paid but that of the time of hienry viil that meight have been a good objection downm to the year  hut now because an authorized valuation signed by the right hen gentleman opposite had been made by the clergy themselves who were not likely to overvalue their livnrgs and therefore the objection was obviatednwsth respiic to wyale a gontleusn of charaucter andlegal education named joues had mado a scrutinizing examination into the livings in that country in connexion with the distribution of queen annes boanty which he stated vas a source of great wvealth to the rich clergy but for the poor it had done scarcely anything his correspondent did not consure persons but the system  which was ho m nustsaya vicious one and he thouglit hon gentlemen opposite weould agree with him that a remedy wvas necessary the trcsureir of queenannos bounty had been asked whether incaseef two clergymen one having a living of l ayear and the other ono of only  ayear applying for an augmontatlon of their livings the latter w ould havo any better chance tban the former h the answer was that bo would have just the same chaxce beause the governors acted according to the livings and not according to the circumstances of the clergymen he contended then that the goyernors of queen annes bounty did not act according to the spirit of the act wlhich w as intended to produce the augmentation of smoall livings hoe hoped he had succeeded in establishing three propositions firsttbat the intention of queen annes bounty wa to provide competent livirgsfor all thepfoor ergy secondlythat it had ontiret failed te produce that effect and thirdiy that t vtw high tim me

ing that the conduct of tho government would be such as to lead queen victoria to gie  talitythose principles which had bqon laid down by q leen anne nod to perpetuate her memory as a benefactress of thechurch he saw a sceptical expression on the countenance of afi hon gentleman oppo site and he knew it was not the opinion of tme hoa mem bers of that house that tho present mlinisters were frienidly to the church but why because while they had done so much for tho church they had through their influence done much also for roman catholics and dissenters and because they had not confined their favours to one particular deno mination ithadbeenimputedtothemsometimes that they vvere the enemies of the church but he contended that the irish church temporalities bill which had removed

praisewas a bill wvhich established this principlethat propertyrather thau personsought to be made the iiieans for tpavment of the clergy that principle had beencarriedintothe en glish tithe

cordial co openation he concluded by mloving for a  committee of the whole house to take into condijertion tbe proprietv of abolishing the first fruits of the clergy in england andwales and the more effectual rating and th better collec tilon ofthe tenths applicable to the maintenance of the poormr t duncomue seconded the motiontho solicitorgeneral said that although he could not fulfil the expectation of the hon gentleman he must do him tbie justice to give him credit for the sincerity of his motives and for moderation of temper and tone in the dis cussion of the subject the grounds on which ho oppoed the motion were shortly these if the question had boen ge nerally as to the right and expediency of parliament to make a much mere equal distribution of church property fer the benefit of the community at largo ho might have bhen induced to direct his attention to it but quite unfettered by anyuting arising out of firt fruits and tenths or the bounty or statute of queen anne the hon gentleman seemed to have confounded thhughout the abstract question with the rights established under tlio statutes of henry viii and queen anne it was absolutely clear to demonstration that the clergy had nowunder those sltutes all that they bad ever beei tntitled to hear the question was how the valuation svas obtained by the statute the lord bhanceller was to be directed bv the crown to issue his comisuission for that purpose ho vould not enter into a question which might ba raised upon the langttage of the act as to whether the valuation was to be made from time to time or at once but he would assume that it was to bo made from time to time certainly the mode of distribution of queen ansnes bounty for the augmentation of small livings was to be ac cording to the old and not according to any newv rate of valuation so that if his hon fiend should succeed and ally surplus should be gained it would belong to the crown ansd not to the poor cergy he believed that there never had been a doubt on that point amaongst legal men and if therc ever had been any doubt suebse quent acts of parliament were sufficient to remove ithemn it appoared to ber to be perfectly clear upon the law of thecase that the firstfruits and tenths now receivable by the governors of queen annes bounty were exactly thossane that iradaw dvay been received and that ss iso had stated on a former occasion to the hon gentleman the governors had no more powver than he had to alterone farthing of the sutm so received that being the case though the question might bo discussed whether or no some alterations might not bo made distinct from queen lunos bounty such as in the case of tbe irish church temporalities bili but wllielh ought net in the slightest deoree tobe fettered or incumnbered by any of the provisions of the statutes affecting first fruits and tenths this was not a question which ought to be entertained he therefore felt bound to give his oppoaition to thie notionmir g knight said if the augmentation of small livings could be obtained by tie motion of the hon member he should feel inclined to give it his support when lie con sidered the large number of inadequately paid clergymen he felt tbat some remedy ought to be applied the worst feature of the present system was that it wvas so un equal out of  benefices only  paid tenths at all and those that did pay paid according to a valuation made in the time of henry viii a living valued at that time at  wbas nonv worth  he did not deny that it wvas legal that they should payas they did but it was contrary to common sense most of the livings valued under i ayear were worth san hon mrxitert on tho opposition side of the house moved that the house be countedthe gallery was accordingly cleared but was reopened there being a sufficient number of members to make a house amidst cheers from the ministeral benchesmr knight resumed he referred to a statement of theadditionial church room which had been afforded nvithin the i last  years sittings had beeni pronided for  per i sons and compared vith the number whicli slould have beei provided there was a deficiency of about  sittings aotwithstuiding that parliament had granted amihion ayear ror eleven yearsmr hume said his hon friend need not trouble the i bouse to divide did the hon mensber think alter the pro ceedings of the last few nights that the government wvould i listen to the commonsense view of the question  look at i lhb changes they were making could any man say thatwhen tle clergy vere gaining foer mitlionsaxud a half by the i rommutation of tithes if there wvas any disposition on thepart of those who caled themselves the friends of the church i to increase the small livings throuhout the country they hadot the means of doing so  the overnment and the friends if the church were to blame they had it in their power to remedy the efi and they refused to use itmor j stewart said that the act of anne gave every i thing that was given by the statute of henry vill so far i from that statute being repealed it was confirmed by the d i scetion of the act of anue every riht therefore that vo i had under the statute of henry vii we have under the i statute of anneanamely to make a fresh value of livings imr goulburn concurred in the view which the sol i citorganeral took of the question he did not know any authority for increasing the first fruits or tenths if there was any such power he would ask those wvho proposed to alter thepresent system whether they wqre satisfied with the justice i of the original imposition and were aware of the effect of the rendy they proposed h he did not ttdnk that any one acquainted with the early history of the first fruits or ctenths in i thwis countr and the wray in vwhichl they xwere imposed couldapprove of it the pope had never exactecs more than one half of the tenth in the reign of queen anne the queen  thinking it right to restore its property to the church di vested herself of her revenue for the benefit of the poor clerzy the question whether or not a property tax ought or ought not to be generally imposed was one which must depend upon a vern different footing from the subject of first fruits and tenths frem the hon member for leeds ewn showing it would appear that to adopt his principlewould be to raise the taxation on this description of property from  per annum to about  ho concurred with the hon and learnedsoucitorgeneralin thinking that the discussion of the question of first fruits and tenths affordod no argument in fa vour of the proposition of the hen member for leeds it had been said that benefices were taxed according to the value in the kings books vwhich value had been ascertined i the reign of henry yiii and that they ought to bear an impost equal tothoeirlmproved valuein the reignof queen victoria butho was at a loss to know on what principle this was to be justified as well might it be contended that hon members whoheld property onan equally ancient tenure should contri bute to the revenues of the country in a degree corresponding with the improved value of their property hear hear he mr goulburm was not deeirous to go into the question of whether or not it waa eopedient to impose a special income tsx upon one class of individusls for that was a question which must be argued upon its own intrinsic
