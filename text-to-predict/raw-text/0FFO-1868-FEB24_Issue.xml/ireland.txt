relating to public demon strations and the opinions elicmted from this court there is no desire entertained by the loyal portion of the community whose feelings were olitraged by the procession of the th of december to see pcnish rnent inflicted on the persons who took part in it whatever may be their legal responsibilhty there can be no doubt that their moral culpability is greatly mitigated by the fact that the highest minis ter of the crown declared his opinion that the procession in cork was not contrary to law and that no notice or warning against such an assembly was given to the people dnring tho trialyesterday the court was densely crowded the novel circuimstance that three of the traversers pleaded their own cause added to the interest which the case excited mr bracken one of the accusedwhose turn it was toad dress the jiury offered only a few observations to the effect that he didnot think the processionwas illegal as no notice to the contrary had beeu issued and lord derby whose speech he read for the jury declared it was not illegal mr martin delivered a long and clever speech in his defence he com plained that hchad not been put upon his country to be tried as the spirit of the constitution required andas a loyal citizen he desired tobe by twelve men indiferently chosen se regarded the juryastwelve fellovcitizens selected because they were political opponents eor the purpose of obtaining a convic tion in form of law re did not impeach their honesty or that of his prosecutors because that was a political trial and political trials in this country had always been conducted in that way he thought the system of excludingiepealers from the box when repealers like himself were to be tried was calcplated to bring thd administration of jsstice ito isesbe disjoeion and hatred as a loyal aubject he protested anst s he saidthat the re son fo i a nv    o  no avalssig iumself oieassistance or counsel was not that he doubted the lonour or ability of the bar but that in this coun try no advocate obtained office from a whig or tory ministry who did not discountenance acts nvritings and opinions contrary to theirs and as counsel on his behalf would have tospeakas arepealer sharing the convictions of the traverser he wrunot so xelfish as to place atny member of the bar in the position of hring to forfeit his chance of pronnotion he had rherefore resolved to conduct his own defence he tools seriatim the seven conditions which the learned judge said were necessary to support charges of that kind and he maintained that his case they did not apply first the meeting was not for an un lawful purpose their object was a peaceful ex pression of opinion upon a publie act of the public servants of the crown in the second place the numbers in which the people met did not endanger the public peace none of them carried armsthou sands were women and children in the third place the ssemblycaused uo alarm to any of hermajestys eubjects in the fourth place it did not create and was not intended to create disaffection on the contrary it was a peaceable expression of opinion calculated to remove disaffection in the fifth place it did not incite the irish subjects of the queen against her english subiects on the con trary it was a constitutional way of coming to a right understanding upon a transaction which if mot fairly and fully explained and set right must produce hatred between the twro peoples those who protested against it were not to be characterized as seditious but rather those who were responsible for it in he next it was not intended to asperse the right and constitutional administration of jus tice its tendency was simply to point outfaults in the conduct of servants of the crown and it could not be contended that judges or juries were infal lible and never came to wrong decisions it was constitutional for all gooa citizens to try and keep the administration of justice above the suspicion of unfairness wrong had been com mitted and it could notbe redressed by sending him and his companions to prison for saying so even supposing the judges acid crown counsel were ofoiiion that he was mistaken they had no right under the constitution to convict him of a misde meanour for that reason by indicting him they virtually indicted millions of her majestys subjects and indeed it was only the size of the courthouse which prevented a million from being tried in one batch he would not have held the procession if he had not supposed that it was permitted dr ball qc replied on the part of the crown he ob served that the bringling of large masses of people together even without a word or weapon might come within the principles of the law relatina to unlawful assemblies he referred to the placards and advertisements convening the meeting to show its character it was in honour of men as pa triots who were concerned in the rescue of pri soners in the grasp of the law who belonged to an organized consiracy against the crown and government the abstract riuht of discusshig legal questions was subject to certain conditions it was one thing on a titting occasion and to a fitting audience to discuss a supposed error on the part of persons no matter how exalted it was another thing to collect large crowds not for that legitimatepurposehntto work thlem up into a blind unreasoning euthsiasm and discontent with the authority that sanctioned the executions he called attention to the speech delivered by mr miartin and maintained that it was calculated to excite hostility and resistance to the government of eng land they should remember the circumstances under which the demonstration was held at a timewhenithadbeenfound necessary to suspend the habeas corpus act he argued that the pro cession was a violation of the party processions act and in reply to the statement of mr martin and his friends as to misgovernment and sufferinghe asserted that the period since the union was not to be sur passed in the annals of any country for progress in liberty science and prosperity in concluding his address he made some pertinent observations i he askedwhat avail was it to revive the feuds and animosities ef other times each age should be judged by the stan dard of light and of opinion in its own day they conld mot transfer into the post the enligitenment of the present they could no more judge the staetemen of elizabeth and james for want of political celigtenment than they coula the astronomer of that period because he was ignorant of the discoveries of newton what was ic their power was the present in the legislative department of the state in the administration of the affairs of the state let them overn that present in an enlarged and enlightened policy ut f other duties also arose and if law sad government and order came legitimaty before them as a tribaual to decide upon and protect let them impartially do their duty in that respect with fairness and independencemir justice fitzgerald in charging the jury thought it his duty to put out of their way in the frst instance some irrelevant topics which had been introduced with respect to the observations of the prime minister and cbief secretarywhich bhad been referred to they were to remember that the law was to be taken not from any statesman or law officer lut from the court ai regards the charge that the jury had not been properly selected he said that on criminal trialsabove all political trialsit was essential for the ends of justice that the tribunal should be properly selected and be above reproach in the present case only fourjurors had been set aside by the crownone at his own request being over age tto others asbeinawitnesses and the tourth he did not know for what reason but he would only say that his sympathies were not with the traverser his lordship then went through the counts of the indictment and ob served it was the privilege of the assembly of the tb of de cenmher to canvass the administrattion of tbelaw  but indoing o they were not to bring the administration of tho law into hatred or contempt if this assembly was held under thepretence of sympathywith the executed nenwhile really it was for the purpoge of bringing the british admi iqistration of justice isito hatredl and contempt then it was an illegal assmbly the distiiaetion taken by mr sullivan was that such were not the objects  that they did neot ap yrove the crimne but that they mnet to express commiser tion with the fate of the cendemned mnen  and that the go vernrs cot as lmatter ofpolicy bad been mistaken if that assembly was for the purpoe of pointing out that a political imistake had been committed by carrying out that sentence then the indictment brought by the crown would entirely fail in judgging of its character they shouldl take into con sideration the proilamation and a�dverzisemen le diduotnaderstand howthe act of men who had talcen part in i an unlawful rescue could be called patrioticreferrring to the uncovering of tho procession iu passing the place where emmet was execated his lordship said    the rebellion in which emmet engaged was now passed entirely into historv nd it was not treason to allude to it or to express pity and comumiseration for that gifted young enthusiast especially when tbey recollectedthat the objects he soughtin his uansuccessful rebellion ad been nearly all since obtained and were now the law of the land if emmet were now alive he would probaoly be found con tentel with the present state of things setttll his face agast the tide of

express pity bnt for the purpose of inciting the men of the present daytofollowhis example by joininginarmed insurrection was a matter to be taken iuto account with reference to tho character of tbe assemblymr iartins speech he said should also be taken into account but they should bearin simd the difference between written and spoken words the former were deliberate tho latter were often ut

wanot tho doluf ngwasto bo consideredbnt the circumstances under which it was displayed they were to consider whether under the common liw and the statute the procession was an illegal assembly and their decision was of great importance with reference to futureoi proceedings the jury retired at  oclock and at ten minutes past  the foreman returned and in quired whether if they considered the speech of mr martin a seditious one that made tho whole procession illegal the jury having been recalled the learned judge said he must give an ansuwer tin the negative rhecaued their attentiontothe fact that one of the police superintendents who had been exa mined swore that he saw manyperzons present whom he believed to be loyal men the speech however was legitimate evidence for them to

the court that there was not the slightestchance pf tkeir being able to agree counsel having been consulted as to the course to be pursued left the matter in the hands of the court and his lordship

indictment to  prevent for ever the chance of reconciliation between the people of ireland and the english nation i acquit you however of having entertined in your mind any such intention fr sullivan made a motiou of assent but you must see and you must understand you must now yourself feel that no government could exist or if it existed could hope to possess the affed tions or esteem of the people if they allowed a public jour nalist to proclaim with impunity to the governed people in the language of another of these articlesthat  the gaol and the hangman are twin pillar on which the defence of british rule in ireland is supported wow it is fair to observe in your case and  call public attention to the fact that iu the articles which are alleged to be seditioua and for which you were indicted with one important exception relate entirely to what is nowknown aa the manchestereze cutions are confined to that subject and it may be that as that topic gave rise to great excitement

unhappy men executed at manchester were no mur derers but proudspirited patriots who sealed their devo tion to their country with their blood you were un consciously and i am certain uninteitionally giving virtually an argument to the minds of the young anti the enthusiastic to fouow a similar example in the remarkable speech you uttered in this court two days ago and which i mnow consider as our
