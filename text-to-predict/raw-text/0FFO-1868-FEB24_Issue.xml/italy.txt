italyeprom our owl correpondymflorence fm it is known that the marquis de moustier replied in a very friendly tone to the communication from this government irn which at the request of that of france bases were laid down for a dossible rnmodus rivendi between italy and the papal states as now existent the moderate nature of the italian proposals was admitted by the imperial mi nister who undertook to advocate them at rome and endeavour to obtain their adoption this is very satisfactory so far as it goes but past experi i ence must have taught tho emperor that it is useless to expect concessions in that quarter he has never yet been able to make that stiffnecked priest government budge one inch in the right direction and if he could not do it in days of darkness and depression he is not likely to suc ceed now when the clerical soul is inflated with its recent triumphi and buoyed up with san guine hopes of the early downfall of antichrist in other words of the spirit of revolutionary evil as embodied in united italy the incessant and eamnest efforts made for years by the emperor na poleon and his representatives to obtain an amend ment of the roman government ar still fresh in our memories and we all know in what complete failure they resulted m de ioustier may ivrite instructions and mdesartiges tnayzealouslyexecute them but it will be so much paper aud breath expended in vain the only practical ad vantage obtained from the recent interchange of communications between paris ï¿½ad florence is that they seemto have established the re lations betwveen the two cabinets oni a perfectly amiicable footingmuch more aricable indeed than is to the taste of those who with an eye to possible war like complications in europe would gladly have seen the recent mutual iliwill perpetuated at berlin such friendly rappochement must be viewed witli displeasure althongh hardly with disappdiintmenb in the event of a war between france and prussia the beat the latter power could hope for would be that italy should maintait au armed neutrality  ard although that would be extremely liable to conversion before the struggle should long have lasted into a more or less compulsory adhesion to the fortunes of france its maintenance for a certain period might be important as being to soe extent likely to influence the policy of austria ieutrality is the course obviously enjoined on italy by her own interests but very few dare hope she would long be allbwed to preserve it and at the present time many are disposed to believe in the existence of a secret agreement with france vhich although it may not amount to an ofensive and defensive aliance binds italv in fact to the conclusion of such a treaty in the event of certain contingencies the present italian government keeps its own counsel better than some of its pre decessors and nothing has transpired of a natura to confirm the belief in such a compact but the cir cumstances of the time the character and tendencies of the cabinet the wellknown desire of the king to keep on good terms witth france as a necessary condition of his thrones safety and as the bestgua rantee for the integrity of his kinadom all point to its probability if it be true that ltaly has given pledges of the kind with reference to possible future events it is to be hoped she has not forgotten to stipulate an equivalent and that we may soon see the last freuch troops quit the papal states that will be the best meanof tranquilliijig the country and of putting an end to the bourbonist plots of which rome is now the focus and of wbnch the object is by no means limited to compassing the overthrovr of the italian kingdom it appears that certain french journals lately anmounced with un concealed satisfaction that coins were circulating in italy bearing the effigy of the deposed sovereigns and tho words  italian confederation consi dering how high the premium upon the precious metals now is m this conntry and how great the scarcity evenlof dirty copperconsidering that an issue of halffranc notes is talked of and that such small paper is already created and circulated by cafs and shops on account of the impossibility of otherwise procuring changeconsidering these and other inconveniences under which wo labour in con sequence of the forced paper currency we should really gladly welcome any kind of coin no matter though stamped with the likenessof pope pre tender or even of a worse personage than either the federal coinage referred to by the french papers has not yet come under ny observa tion but a letter from rome says that one issuing from a different mint has made its appearance there in the form of fivefranc pieces bearing the date of  and the image of the count de chambord with the inscription  henri v roi de france and round the rim the bourbon motto  svuam fcsc rgcrn dornine it isthought thiat specimens of this new coinage would ex ite some interest inaris it is but a short step from the mint to the palace the bourlbonists in rome are reported to have said when the federal coins were filrst seen therethe report that the pope had made difficlties about grauting a dispensatiou for the marriage of prince humbert and princess margaret was in stantly contradicted tro objection wras ever raised but the necessary brief wvas at once expeditedin all countries where a press exists it is probably inevitable that some of its less scrupulous members wil at times make their public duty subordinate to private aims and interests it is only by supposing a case of this kind that explanation can be given of the systematio attempt lately made to impairitalian credit and lower italian stock in the european market by announcing an intention on the part of this government to impose a tax on the coupons of the rente i have the best grounds for be lieving this to be a mere mischievous inven tion and that should it hereafter be judged expe dient to extend the incometax to the interest on the public funds it will only be doneso long at least as the present finance minister is in office when means shall have been devised to secure the exemption of foreign holders of italian stock from an impost which so far as they are concerned would be a breach of faith with the national credi tor the enemies of italy are indefatigable in their efforts to injure her by every possible means her difficulties are sufficiently great to need no exagge rationf a question which was justly denounced as in opportune and as dangerous to italian credit was raised in yesterdays chamber by deputy

ferraris the wrellknown lawyer and leading member of the piedmontese perasntc sought to establish and to vindicate by legal subtleties seu with his blunt good sense went straight at the question he
