nava a nd military intmlligrbnweafter a rough trial off the maplin sands sud a couple of runs over the admraalty xtandard measured in stokes bay off portsmouth on thursday the screw corvette un armoured wooden blanche six gans  tons horse power captain t e montoomerie was put through her crucial trial of speed at her deepest load draught over the stokes bay course on friday under the superintendence of captainw c chamberlaincommanding ter majestys ship asia and the steam reserves at portsmouth the officers on captain chamberlains staff who conducted the trial were chief engineers w g wratten and  deal of the re serves and assistantinspector of rachiaery w h steil mr james steil inspecting officer of machinery to the en gineer in chief of the navy and mr j b crossland anis tant constractor were present from whitehall the rough trial of the ship on the haplin sans mile fgave her a mean speed of  knots but mr ravenhill of the frm of ravenbill ana hodgion the manufacttrers of the engines being convinced that tie engines had more power in then than had been even then developed and as increased power of the machinery simply meant increased speed to the ship the latter was ordered to nake her final tria over the standard mue in stokes bay on her way down channel mr ravenhiuls anticipations have beenl fully confirmed by the results of fridays trial fore shadiowed as the latter was by the two rans made over the mile on the previous day which then gave the hip an increae of a quarter of a knot per hour over the rate attained on the maplin sand mile on friday morning ott weighing her snchor from spit head to enter upon her trial the blanche drew ft in of water forward and ft sin aft au the yards were aloft on the thre muasts of the ship to royals and au sails were

admiralty regulations the machinery of the ship was during the time of the trial incharge of messrs ravenhill anil hodgson who were both present under the conditions imposed by the admiralty cir cular the ships engines are of the present accepted type for her majestys navy fitted with surface condensers and super heating apparatus of horse power nominal and pre cisely similar in their gleneral

other vessel of precisely similar tonnage anld nominal engine power that has passed the test of the measured mile under both full and halfboiler power and as both the danac and the blanche have been built from the same set of drawings this excess in speed by the blanche over the danae is undoubtedly a great credit to the messr ravenhiu and hodgson whose engines ran throughout yesterdays trials without a check or trouble of the rlightest kind in testing the turn ing power of the ship by putting her through circles under ful and halfboiler power the mzain results were with fullboiler power
