j daysci preatqe comipound bousieiolde t disraeli appears to persistin his original iisconception of this tron hiesome question even at his scotch ovation he talked of u pesonal paymnt of rates as a fundamnental principle of his xeform act although  as thc attorneygen era has since been compelled to admit the l eforos act contains no such provision and the law at present is as it was before the new actit is still permitted to the landlord to agree witli the tenant to pay the rates and such payment by the landlord will be deemed to be payment by the tenant this is the answer that shoud be given to most of the questioners in the house of commons but there is another difficolty which mir disrseli does not appear to understawi and which cannot be dismissed so easily as the iw was before the new reform act there were two processes bv which rates were made payabib by the andlordinstead of the tenant by one parishes adopting it were empowered to rate the owner of small tenements instead of the occupier and by the other parishes were empowered to compound with the owner of such tenements to pay the rates upon terms which alloweld to the landlord a large deductiou for the trouble of coec tion and risk of loss this was profitable to the laudlord because he added to the rent the amount of the rato andl something more and thus was enabled to recover in the form of rent rates which could not have been collected under their own name now both of these convenient ar rangements have been disturbed by the new act the parish can no longer rate the owners of small tenements iustead of the tenants and it cannot compounnd with owners to pay the rates for their tenants the consequence is that multitudes of tenants cannot or will not pav ana landlords who were previously rated and tlierefore compelled to pay the rates of small tenemenits being no longer liable refuse to pay the rates for their tenants as hitherto they have done true it is that in everv case the difficulty might be solved by the owners continuing to ay the rates and adding them to the rent and that bv so doing they would be iu no worse position than before save in this that they must pay the ftill rate instead of the com pounded rate  but ia the majority of cases they decline to do this and hence the present diticulty wmhich is a real and substantial one which should be mes bv souie speedy remedy the repeal of the rating clauss of the refornm actisdemanded asbeing the only efficientcure but tirem are many objections to this rating is an ohligatiom of citizenship the principle of the scot and lot franchise is that the voter zhall pay his scotthat is iia share of the local burdens and bear his lotthat jr his part in the local offices rating is the piroof of occu pancy it is the best evidence that the claimant is s householder but rdting does not imply lpersonal payment being rated the householder is liable to pay but it is not obliatory upon him to pay with his own baud or out of his own pocket provided only that tho rato is paid the law and the reason of the law are alike satisfied it is not there fore practicable to deviso a plan by wvhich while securin the test of bein a rated householder the present parochial difficulties in the colection of the rates maybe avoided waving given to the subject much tbouht wve venture tob suggest what appears to be a feasiblel plan for effectiag this desirable object at is very simple let it be enactesl that in all parishes in wvhich the small tenements acts are not tn forcesid this would include ll the boroughsthe name of the oweer of all rated proerty as welu as that of the tenant shall be inserted in the ratbhook and tbat with respect to all tenenients rated at a less annual vhlue than  the parish shall be entitled to recover the rate from the owner if it fails to do so from the tenant in other word make the rate a charge upon the propertyand not upon the person this would practically restsre the lav to what it was before the reform act it would not be unjust to the owners of small tenements fortheycouldprotect themselves by paying the tate and letting their houses at rents that would include the amount of the rates they pay andu ill fact it would merely give theni an inducement to do tiat which they have done hitherto with equal advantage to themuelves and to the parishes thus without disturbing any existing provisions of the ltefornt act aud iwithout in justice or wrong to any the present difeculty might b effectually removedlcw timestnie sutnieritland railwaywe tiuerstasiithat it is now confidently
