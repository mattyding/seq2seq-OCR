it is called the yeigeur and represents the battle between the french fleet under admiral villaret joyeuse and tlhe english channel fleet commanded by lord howe on the st of june  the favourite french tradition is that when the vengeur  in action with the brunswiclk captain harvey was sinking the crew went down shouting  fne la rpubliqu p a cry of the kind in these days would of course be treasonable ande its repetition on the stage not to be thought of one of the censors who may have been a redhot republican in  suggested yve lempercur  but so gross a disre gard of historic truth

there is one difficulty still remaining the or chestra must play something while the ship is going down but the mearseillaise in out of the ques tion one of the censors suggested partant pour la syrie but the lady queen hortense who composed what is now the national anthem of france was then but  years old and the gallant offlicer for whom it was composed not much older at any rate both the imarseillaise and the par tant pour la syrie have a political meaning and that would not do for the stage as certain couplets of the chant du depart have been altered in the piece somebody has proposed that the vengeur should go to the bottom to the tune of leto chapeau de marguerite which has the advan tage of compromising no one the point is ibe lieve yet unsettled but historically speaking the cry attributed to the crew of the vengecur is as unfounded as the heroic words of cambronne are now universally admitted to be the gallantry of the french in  was doubtless quite equal to the effort but the faot is that the only cries heard were cries for relief when the vengeur was sinking and which the british boats afforded to the best of their power the vive la retpublfie version
