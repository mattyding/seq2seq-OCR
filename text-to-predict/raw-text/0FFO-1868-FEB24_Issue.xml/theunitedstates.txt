thee united statesfboil ma a irnroan ooexspozdetphiladelpeia feb the secretary of the treasury has published his sisual montbby statemeat of the publio debt of the united states showing its amount on february lit to have been the fouowingon january st  the debt amounlted to  c so that the increase during the month has been  c the rerenues of the goverament duringjanuary were wholly inade quate to meet the expenditure which enhanced by the interest on the s falling due on new years day and the fact that about six millions of the debt was paid on that day amounted to nearly  the customs and inland dauties also did not yield as well as was anticipated and the consequence was that the receipts fell below the expenditures  the deficit being made up by increasing the debt  and reducing the balance in the treasury  on february st there were  c in tiie treasury  in coinas compared with  c on january   in coin the secre tiry has stopped contracting the greenback cur rency but continues his policy of converting the debt into goldbearing bonds that clss of the debt having increased  during the month the issue of  bonds now amounts to  this debt statement is not re garded as a very flattering one and it ha awakened a general anxiety about the financial condition of the country the evidence is plain that the revenues are inadequate to meet the present extravagant rate of expenditure but as all the appropriation bills for the current year were passed by the congress of  it will be inpossidle to cut down the expenditures until july next for the fiscal year beginning then congress is now considering the appropriation bills and in obedience to the general demand the committees are making great retrenchmeunts the pressure is so strong from diminished revenues and grumbling constituents that for once congress is superior to the lobby intluences and is believed to be sin cerely endeavouring to cut down the appropriations it is thought that the aggregate appropriations of this session for the fiscal year   will be less thau  which is  less than the amount for the current year of this  mil lions are for debt interest  millions for bounties and  milions for pensions while the army navy and civil list are to absorb the remaining  mil lions siothing has yet been done towards paying for russian america or st thomas and it seems dangerous to mention such a thing to congress so economical has it grownthe new consolidated lon bill reported in the senate last week senator sherman now states lie will call up for consideration on the th of february while this bill is free from some of the objectionable features of the first one reported it still meets with very little favour it drops two of the bid provisions of the old bill the appropria tion of one per cent for expenses and the forein loan clause with its covert authority for ex orbitant charges for differencoe of exchange the present bill proposes a gold  loan at  per cent gold interest free from all taxation excepting the utnited states income tax into which the present  per cent bonds are to be consolidated the pressure that appears to be contemplated to compel holders of  per cent bonds to change them for these  per cent bonds is the subjection of the formertostateand local taxation the present holders of the s thought they had securi tspayable in coin and exempt from taxation and if they are mistaken in these particulars under a  per cent bondwhat guarantee can they have that they are safe under a new promise bearing but  per cent the repudiation ghost seems to lurk around au the transactions of tho senate finance committee and here it appears again in the efforts that are to be made to compel the bondholder to accept a reduced interest the complaints of the press are almost as general against the present fundinz bill as they were against the former one and senator sherman can have very little hope of carrying it through congress in anything like its present shapethe proposed acceptance by the united states of the french system of a decimal international coin age of which the f piece shall be the basis is meeting with opposition the new york chamber of commerce has adpointed a committee to consider the propriety of memorializing congress against the passage of the bill now pending which reduces the value of the american dollar to that of the f piece in accordance with the recommendation of the french monetary convention this reduction if made will take away about j per cent of the value of the dollar and the holders of the united states bonds and all other creditors public and prirate will suffer injury to that extent unless this diffli cultyean be avoided it is not probable thattheunited states will adopt the french monetary systemthe boston commercial convention called to consider the depressed condition of national trade asembled in that city on february  and did nor conclude its proceedings until the evening of the th it was composed

similar character within the past two years which have re solved most vigorously aaainst the bad condition of affairs yet the state of trade has been growin worseaund worse the effect of the good counsel given by these assemblages is lost as soon as they dissolve the boston convention assembled on wednesday the th and frederickfraley of phila delphia was made temporary chairman after which a permanent organization was effected by making e w fox of st louis president with a long list of vicepresidents and secretaries rules were then adopted and committees appointed to prepare busi nesl

after spending the day inthis manner a banquet was given by the city of boston to the convention in the evening and the festivities were prolonged far into the night on friday the th the various committees made their reports which were considered and in the erening there was another banquet in which the delegates were the guests of the boston board of trade on saturaay the th the consideration of the committee reports was concluded and the convention closed its proceedings various private entertainments being given to the members in the evening by the leading citizens of

theplaceto which they are ultimately destined so as to do aray withbondingwarehousingc upon the question of taxation the convention i adopted resolutions asking congress to change the tonnage duties on domestio vessels so as to operate in favour of the shipping interests declaring that the government should economize its expenditures in every possible way and that taxation should be taken off domestic products abd manufactures aud the inland revenue should be raised from to bacco spirits and other luxuries the condition of the south was considered and while the conven tion declined to pass a resolution asking congress to loan  millions of dollars to the southern planters it adopted one declaring its sympathy with south ern suffering and destitution and expressing the hope that  congress will in its wisdom devise such measures of relief as will without loss to the government stimulate industry and speedily and permanently reatore prosperity to that section of the country a resolution was idopted in favour of the construction of a ship canal capable of passing vessels of  tons from the great lakes to the mississippi river and in favour of a free ship canal around niagara falls it

and the convention finally adopted on these subjects a series  of resolutions in favour of a return to specie payments and proposing a gradual approximation of thegreenbackcurrency to the gold

volation of the law of contract and a breach of go vernment faith to impose taxes upon them now that there should be a free banking system in the uinited states and per cent should be the rate of interest excepting in cases where other rates are agreed upon and that the proposed charge in value in american coin to conform it to the system of the french monetary convention is injudicious the

finance resolutions and the giving of three rousing cheers for  national honourin the western states a movement is on foot to call a general convention of the producing interests of the country to

on february  the argament being concluded upon the motion made by the counsel for the military autho rities that it be dismissed for want of jurisdiction as is well known this case derives its importance from the fact that it involves the constitutionality of the congressional reconstruction laws exgo vernor sharkey of mississipi on behalf of iardle opposed the motion while senator trumbull sup ported it a great crowd was in attendance the court some time ago decided that it would hear this ease on its merits on the first monday of march but the friends of congress represented by senator
