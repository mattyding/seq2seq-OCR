to the country by a dissolution it has eoneessed that it never had any right to exist neither ths internal condition of greece nor the aspect of the eastern question with reference to greek interests makes the time suitable for playing at politics ml bulgaresthe real headof the oppo sition was immediately summoned to form a mi nistry which it appears he had all ready for the members of his cabinet tooktheir oath of office the same eveniug the royal ordinance was signed next daylproolainhiog the dissolution of the cham ber ordering the election of new deputies on the d of april and convoking the chamber on the th of maythe only member of the moraitini ministry who has added to his political reputation during its short official existence is m klessnezes the minister of the interior hedisplayed both activity and cha racter in attacking the system of corruption which has filled every department of the public service with crowds of useless paid supernumeraries greece is in sad want of army navy civil service and foreigaofficelistsof her paid officials x ivies senezes dismissed even the prefects whose conduct had been governed by party interests and not by public duty and his enetgy appears to have sur prised his friends aswell as his enemies so rare is it for a publio man here to make an effort to do his duty the placehunters phanariots andnon phauariots viewed him as an enemy of their caste who ought never again to return to office ehis re putationl depended on the independenea of his cha racter co to ruin him in public opinion the political intriguers spread a report that he acted under the direction of a former minister the thing wras pos sibe but it was not explained why messnezes ex hibitedso much more honesty and firmness than that minister when he held office himselfthe new cabinet is composedentirely of men who have alreacly been ministers and most of whom possess great official experience wl petros deli yannes retains the ministry of foreign affairs which he held in the moraitini ministry he has more knowledge of his department and is gene rally regarded as more suitable for his place than any man in greece general spero mlios also retains his post as minister of war though if common report can be trusted it seems im t possible that he and balgares can ever enter tain the samue principles or act cordially for the same end spero miios is considered a man of abilitybuthe has been the most unlucky wvarminis ter that ever held ofhfice in the greek kingdom e was in the cabinet of admiral kriezes which at tacked turkey to support the plans of russia in  embroiled greece with france and england caused the occupation of the piraus by the allied troopsand led to that internal disorganization ofthe government which has filled the country with bands of brigands he was also minister of war in the cabinet of  when the revolution dethroned king otho beforethe king left athens on the illstarred tour which terminated his reign the minis ter of wvar assured him that the army was devoted to the court yetthe troops joined the people every where and in athens they were more hostile to the king than even the mob of the capital spero moelios was also one of count sponnecks councillors of state in  and this council of state was an unlucky creature lived an unlucky life and came to an unlucky but timely end the remaiinngminis ters are xw simos ministerof finance who was re garded as the ablest member of the small cluster of politicians who were called the english party in  but he quitted it to succeed koumoundouros as minister of finance whose inflated budget for the year  had frightened king otho simos was a member of the cabinet that suppressed the military revolt of the garrison of nauplia in  and was stigmatized by the national assembly as the ministry of blood he is well acquainted with the business of the finance department and is a man of industry and talent miltiades kanares the minister of the mlarine is the son of konstan tine kanares the hero of the greek revolution he held the office he now holds when the bloody civil war took place in the streets of athens during the first days of july  when the outs and the ins fought to settle which party should be found in officeat king georges arrival m barboglou the minister of justice was minister of ecclesiastical affairs as long ago as  the remaining member of the cabinet is w antonios mavromichales who holds the portfolio of ecclesiastical afairs and pub lic instructionand who was minister of the marine in the cabinetof deligeorges in  he is a scion of the powerful mainate family which bore a leading part in the military history of the greek revolution and has continued to possess great influence in the country and the chamber the present ministry is undoubtedly stronger in talent and experience than any ministry that has held office during the reign of kzing george this time w koumoun douros cannot upbraid bulgares with surrounding himself wgith mere satellites nobody seems to know what will be the policy of the cabinet so that it is impossible to conjecture whether they will be able to make their policy popular in thecountry it must not be overlooked by those who would judge events rightly that the rude condition of the rural populamonthe existence of universal suffirage the influence of a placehunting society the grat power which administrative centralization throwvs into the hands of government and the absenco of political principles as bonds of parties in the state all com bine to make the king the practical head of the go vernmentand impose on the crown thearduous task of exercising a direct control and superintendence of the executive administration public opinion demands that it should be soand it is a consequence of this state of things thatwithout a strongpersonal support from the king every miinistryin greece is paralyzed at the same time this personalauthorityof the crown imposes onthekingthenecessityofstudy ing how to act in conformity with the public opinion he is called upon to guide the instinct of the people teaches them that the king has a common interest with them in controlling the ministers and watch ing thecbamber thegovernment of a free country at the period when its national institutions are in the process of formation requires that the crown should possess administrative talents to defend the peoplethe statistics of placehunting are of importance where placehunting forms the principal occupation of the educated classes as is the case in greece since king george arrived at athens on the th of october  the government has been con ducted by  different cabinets including that which held office when his majesty arrived about  changes of portfolios have taken place in these cabinets though never consisting of more than seven members and frequently of only five daring this short period  new men have attainedthe rank of minister with such changes it is evident that parties bound together by a political principle can not exist nor can cabinets have any fixed policy statesmen can do nothing but struggle to attain office when they are out of place and fight to keep their places when they are in officewhatever may be the policy of the present minis trywhether it persist in hostility to turkey and continue the military and naval preparations that have been commenced or adopt a policy of pacifica tion and seek only to secure good government in stead of annexation for the island of cretethe ulti mate position of the greek monarchy both at home and abroad wiu be deternined by its financial con dition the subject occupies the attention of the greek press and it is of more importance to know what greeks think on a matter of such general inte rest than to learn bow tho names of greek politi cians have been shuffed in the last cabinet i shalltherefore translate a few passages from recent numbers of the emhnophypzx said to have been written by one of the most experienced statesmen in greece a man who has been prime minister and a member of several cabinets during the five and thirtyyears of monarchical government be bas of course sounded all the depths and shoals of honour and he nppears like wolsey to have learnt at last that corruption wins net more than bonestythe finances are shown by this writer to be in a condition that ought to make the greeks pause be fore deciding to persist in their aggressive policy and lavise expenditurethe revenue of greece for the year  actually collectedamounted to  drachmas the ar rears of collectedinagtoodrachmas making the whole receipts of the treasury from re venue  drachtnas in no previous year did the government collect more than  drachmas in addition to this revenue of tbirty millions the cash realized from the loan of twentyeight millions which the ministry of m kon moindouros was authorized to contract forwarlike preparationi has amounted tow drachmas wlhich brings the total of the money that has en tered the greek treasury in the year g to  drachmas the taxation of the country has been increased a great additional burdenwhas been imposed on many municipalities for the main tenance of the  cretan emigrants now in greece and an augmentation has been made to the annual charge on the debts due to greeks on wlhich greece really pays the interest it appears there fore that the ministry of koumoundouro has ex pended seventeen millions more than the ordi nary receipts of an average year during its year of office after giving the facts the writer exclaims is it not true that  milions have been squanderea during the year  to serve the in terests of aparty andnot to advance the great idea this expenditore has on the contrary nullified or nt least adjourned th the govem ohe hopes of rellenism inesning of course projects of annex ation the partisans of the cabinet of corrhption inist thatenthusiasm forashe great idea prevailed among the people last winter hnd that the tinistry of bdlaresi  on if fell because he hesitated to enter on the road which the government has since followed those whiofinsist on this schepe write and speak what is false thiat mrinistry knew thle state of thepublic meindand had the courage to pro pose decided or if you like strong ineasures it swa that the fever of the great idea had only affected the brain of a feer and it proposed the dissolution of the chamber and a direct appeal to the good sense of the country those who en couraged the febrile tendencies of the people and prevented the dissolution have inflicted a deep wound on the hellenic kingdom they have caused the country to squander  millions on futile pre parations anld crude projects they have created a system of governmenat by factions in the provinces corrupted political society and rendered bank tuptcy imminentthe vriter goes on to say that the only safetv for greece lies in ati economical administration of the finances and replies to the eulogists of mir ke hayas who cau the advocates of economy antedi luvian politicians by declaring that mr kehayas manner of squaudering the public reyenue must end in one of two thingseither the government must leave the ships it has purchased to rot in the port of poros and the army it has increased to rest im movable in its quarters or else it must omit to pay the creditors from whom mr kehayas obtained his loans the conclusion of one of the ablest articles says that m christides the minister of finance in bulgares cabinet of  is not an antediluvian politicianle is a modern statesman those who call him antediluvian are themselves inmorant of the art of government for they neither lnow nor re cognize the powerful effect of economy everything has been modified in political science except the power of economy which remains a great pohtical force and an immutable principle of sound finnuce and it will remain the one trae principle of states manship in all coming time both in the old and in tbe inew world then addressina himself to the greeks he exclaims do yoa wish to possess a fleet let your government be economical do you desire to see your army efficient let your governmoent be economical do yoe desire to realize the great idea  let your government be economi cal be economical and you will be powerful let not placehunten persuade you that you can become rich and powerful by laying on new taxes and contracting fresh loans on the contrary you would grow daily weakeryour navy would soon be useless your army paralyzed and the great idea would become practically a very small idea indeed you would sink into a state of moral and political bankruptcythere is truth in this strong lanauage which is inspired by a sincere conviction that the  present crisis makes it treason to the cause of his country for the writer to remain silentall the greek newspapers furnish evidence from time to time that the febrile excitement of the great ideahas enabled the government to lavish money without any regard to constitutional responsibility or international law the steamer crete was pur chased by the ministry of koumoundouros with government money and immediately handed over to a company which receives a large sum of money from government to carrv on a regular system of blockade ranning a sum of  drachmas appears to have been expendedto support the insur rection in crete and a like sum on warlike prepa rations but the present minister of war found only about  muskets in store and of these  were old and useless the supporters of an aggressive policy assert that  stand of arms with a corresponding amount of military stores have been shipped to crete and it is said that  more diappeared and wrent somewhere under the pretext that they rwere used in the abortive attempt to invade thessaly and epirns these revelations are not calculated to facilitate the annexation of crete to the greek kingdom bv a voluntary concession on the part of the sultan since they prove that the porte can neither reckon on the faith of treaties nor on the truth of promises in any dealings with greece the discussions in the greek press which are tearing aside the veil of diplomaticsecrecy though confined to party recrimination foreshadow an uneasy feeling that the great idea has collapsed that there is pros tration of the national strength that crete has been ruined by a premature enterprise for its an nexation and that a lavish and unwise employment of the revenues of the kingdom render an alliance with russia for a serious attack on the ottoman empire next summer extremely improbablethe news from crete is that blockaderunning is carried on with nninterrupted success and that skirmishes take place in the usual purposeless man ner in greece brigandage is giving signs of re viving activity it has lately excited very little attention for only the peasants have suffered and politicians were beginning to boast that it was quite extinct in the peloponnesus but the band of lingos which has been destroyed by the press at least a dozen times lately arrested a respectable greek on the road between argos and tripolitza and extracted from him a ransom of  drachmas  the existence of brigandage to a fright ful extent in acarnania etolia and phthiotis is admitted by all parties but it is attributed to the encouragement it receives from the inhabitants of the ottoman territory not to what the writer in the ethnophylax caus the government of greece by provincial factions it is not improbable that it is increased by the disrosition of tlhose who dwell north of the frontier to revenge their losses when their districts were invaded by banxds of aeuenic patriots last year
