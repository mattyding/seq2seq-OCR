afhaxistanthe present crisis in cabul will have the effect of awakening the dormant strife waged wvith such bitterness last winter on tho subject of the socalled scientific frontier the necessity now forced upon lis of entering the capital of afghanistan will afford a reasonable excuse to the pupils of the advanced school to develope their theories as to the urgency of permanently incorporating that kingdom with the empire of hindostan and of holding in strength the chain of fortresses on the western slopes of the suliman mountains the opposite school on the other hand will point to the sad disaster of the d of septemberas a sign that their views were right that no ameor could guarantee the safety of british officers in his kingdom and that it would be wiser to withdraw to our old border and treat the afghans with friendly indifference in point of fact tho situation re mains practically unchanged the unfortunate and evertobedeplored death of sir louis cavagnari and his gallant followers has no appreciable effect on the question the reasons that held good last june for tlle establishment of a british mission in the capital of the ameer hold good now  the necessity for the permanent occupation of the khyber ipass is as strong as ever  the military advantage tobegained by garrisoning the kuram valley is now strikingly apparent and the division encamped at candahar have been able with more celerity than if they had been withdrawn to peshin to make good our grasp on southern afghanistan the one portion of the treaty of gandamak that has fallen through is that relating to the maintenance of an envoy at the court of the ameer there were those who prophesied that yakoob khan would be ponverless to protect the british officers in the event of a sudden rising not a man of thatescort but lnew the danger he was ronningand the members of the mission felt full well they carried their lives in their hands the massacre is an undoubted proof that the viceroyequally with sirl cavagnari did not form a correct estimate of the actual position held by yakoob kban but it cannot be said to have been unexpected it is but a repetition of the scenes of november and december  it is butan exag geration of those numerous isolated cases of fanati cal murdersonce so prevalent in the transindus provinces it was an outrage the motive for which was religious hatred and it will prove to the afghans the knell to the sacredness of their king dom as sir l cavagnari boldly said to the ameer when warned that he would be murdered if he rode about so fearlessly  there are hundreds of other officers ready to tako my place  so the afghans will find that the murder of one liavoy will not rid them of the presence of the hated foreigner in whatever part of the kingdom the court of the amneer may in future be fixed there a british envoy will be found only carb must be taken in future that his safety is duly assured by a powerful escort prompt reparation must be exacted for the insult but our action need go no further than that nor is there any necessity tor making further demands on the ameor for fresh territory or for war indemnities if we are to main tain political ascendency over the ruler of af ghanistan if we are to convert that country into a neutra barrier between ourindian possessions and those of russia in central asia th establishment of a british resident at the court of the ameer is an undoubtod necessity tho risk run by our envoy is undoubtedly great but thereare hundreds of indian officers who woulci volunteer for the post tomorroiv feeling as the gatllant sir louis cavag nari didthe greater the risk the greater the honourit is difdicult to see how our military position can be bettered by any enlargement on the terms of the treaty of gandamak the strategic aspect of the case was well considered by local experts and not a yard of territory was occupied that was not deemed absolutely necessary it is true that this decision did not coincide wvith the views of experts nearer hoxe but the reasons given by the strategists in india were valid and sound enough ilere in england it may be reinembered that the one party urgently called for the annexation or occupation of the whole kingdom of afghanistan and demanded the construc tion of fortified posts on the northern slopes of the hindoo koosh herat is the key of india and merv the key of herat was the text preached by this party the punjab school held very oppo site views they were content with the frontier they had guarded so well for more than  years and deprecated any changse beyond a scientific strengthening of the whole line by the erection of bridges and the construevion of military roads a third party the followers of general flamley advocated a middle course this vas arrived at purely by a study of the question from elabo rato maps and was conceded by manyuto be the strict strategical view of the case the northern frontier was to be left intact though it was to be scientifically strengthened  but in the south our border line was to be thrown forvard to girishk on the lielmund in order to flank the western slopes of the suliman mlountains to guard the ap proach to cabul from herat and to keep open the iiih road of commerce from central asia to hindostan as we have said local experts dis agreed entirely not only with the conclusions ar rived at by the three parties in england but also with their premises thepermanent occupation of the kingdom would entail an expenditure of at least five millions per annum with a like sum at the outset for the construction of barracks c the revenue of the country is estimated at about half a million and though by iudicious management this might be increaed yet by no means could the state be made selfsupport ing the advance to the hindoo koosh would be but weaening an already too weak chain of com munications wvith our frontier and would plunge us into a netwvork of mountains where nilitary operations could only be conducted with difficulty and whence in the event of reverses extrication would be next to impossible the mere fact of placing large garrisons in the chief towns would be to call down upon us tho slumbering hatred of the fana tical population and to expose us to a long series of minor operationswhich would further in volve us in hostilitier with the peopleand wvould be productive of no benefit either to our honour or our interests by occupying mlerv we should be in dangerous proximity to both russia and persia and should be holding an advanced post upwards of  miles from our basethe indus the object of such an undertaking is hard to discover and the mere task of protecting the line of communica tion would be costly and dangerous there would bo but one line of retreat from the majority of the advanced posts north of the hindoo eoosh a line closed for a great portion of the year in fact financially politicallyand strategically the scheme was indefensiblethe pleas put forward by the advocates of inactivity were equally untenable the presence of a russian mission in a city not  miles from our frontier one to which the admit tance of british officers had been repeatedly re fused was in itself an act of discourtesv hard to pass over and one likely to lead to serious conse quences possibly to imperil the safety of our indian em pire for years the trade between central asia and india had been gradually passing out of our hands owing to the incompetency of the ameerof afghanistan to maintain jquietude in the passes leading from his dominion to ours and latterly it was more than suspected that the disaffec tion existing among certain sections of the semiindependent border tribes was due to instigation from cabul under these cir cumstances it was necessaryfirst to insist on british supremacy in afghanistan to tho ex clusion of all foreign interference  secondly to adopt measures to encourage a healtlycdevelopment of the lost trade between central asia and hindo stan and thirdly to take up such a position that the constant disturbances among the pathan tribes on our northern puinjab border might be summarily checked the treaty of gandamak fulfilled these conditions a british iission was established in cabul and the foreign relations of the ameer were virtually intrnsted to the english resident the occupation of the khyber and the kuram passes placed the warlike tribes of the sufedkoh completely in our power and was a material gua rantee for the pence of the peshawur and cohat districts the mere fact of a british cantonment being thrown up within  miles of the capital of afghanistan and on the further side of the dangerous eobstacles to a rapid advance on that city plainly showed the ameer that we were determines to have the treaty carried out in its integrity and were at hand to en forceo its fulfilment by holding the peshin valley the safety of the bolan pass was seocured and tradopermitted to flow healthily through its old channel while an alternative route being opened upto dera ghazi khan by thallchotiali added much to the security of our new possessionsgeneral hamleys scheme would certainly have had the effect of guarding the bolan and thus reviving the doecaying trade but the turbulent pathan tribes in the north would have been permitted to pursue their careers unthreatened and unchecked one dominant idea seemed to pervade the scheme of the rawlinson and hamley school and that was that an in vasion of india by russia was imminent and that the main point to be considered in dealing wvith afghanistan was to secure the best line to guard against that certainty the view adopted by the authors of the treaty of gandamak was that our relations with our neighbour the ameer of afghanistan and with the chiefs of the independent border tribes were in an eminently unsatisfactory condition and that they needed to be promptly and permanently re medied at the smallesb possible cost either to the dignity of the ameer or to the revenues of the indian government this was accomplished by the treaty of june last and this must be maintained at all hazards now nio fresh complications bave arisen to demand further strategic annexations our hold on the hill tribes is assured by the occupation of the kehyber cabul is even now threatened by brigadiergeneral massys force as it lies encamped on the crest of the shutargardan should circumstances require it redan massy is the very man either to conduct dashing cavalry raids on the country below the pass or to check any attempts at coalition between his unruly neighbours tho mangals and jajis and the mutinous heratee regiments said to be on tho march to the shutargardan the bolan and thallchotiali passes are quiet and before many months have elapsed caravans will be wending their way between british outposts unhindered by demands for black mail and without fear of moles tation the wisdom of the treaty is apparent at the present moment the hill tribes are quiet though revolution is rife in cabul they are checkmated by the presence of troops on eitlier flank rein forcements are hurrying up the kuram valley and when the campaign opens as it will in a short time it will be found that our base of operations instead of being upwards of  miles is not a weeks march from the capital of afghanistan the advantages of our present mii tary position are undoubted it would be difficult to better it the soldiers responsible for the strate gical clauses of the treaty have shown themselves masters of their art  the one blot in it was the blind faith reposed in a faithless people and in a puppet king the death of the generous and gallant officer who has just fallen shows the neces sity that existed for a thorough revision of our relations with afghanistan and may ultimately prove the harbinger of civilization to a strangely proud and wayward race but it does not call for a cancelment of the treaty of gandamak or for fresh annexations of territory
