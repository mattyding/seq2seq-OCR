met with in the progress of the work and the erection of the bridge is regarded as a triumph of engineering skill twelve of the cylinders were sunk in sand averaging about ft in depth driving the piles for the staging was found to be impracticable and mr brunleess plan wvas adoptedviz forcing a jet of water through a pipe to the feet of the p ies thus scouring away the sand as the piles descended in deep w ater the cylinders were kept dry by the use of com pressed air the cylinders in the channel of the river were the most difflcult to erect the water varied in denth from ft to ft  at bpring tides the water rose ft in a little over two hours and the current ran at the rate of ten knots an hour the sandbanks in the river and the strength of the current induced the engineers not to attempt to build the girders on shore and loat them to the site and hoist them into position and thence a number of stages had to be erected to form platforms on wvhich to work the engineers for
