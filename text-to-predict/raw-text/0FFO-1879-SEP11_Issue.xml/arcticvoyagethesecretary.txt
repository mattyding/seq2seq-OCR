communiemcation from st lawrence bay had been received at st michael at the date of sailing of the rush july  and consequently there was nok nowledge of tne safety or movements of professor

to proceed directly to st michael in alaska leaving bere august  from all tbe intelligence received from the north ward it appears that the lasr winter has been an excep tionally mild one and that no obstruction to navigation n the shape of ice has been encountered i can but deplore that the necessity of loading this ship so deeply at st francisco has made our progress thus far so slow oning also to head winds and swell as to make it doubtful whether we shall be able or not to profit by the open w ater in the arctic sea in our efforts to gain a high latitude this season if upon our arrival at st michaels nothiog has been heard oe the party nder the command of professor nordenskjold i shall proceed to st lawrence bay in siberia to obtain tidings of them and shall proceed sub sequently in
