tb whitia short sketch of the careqr of te whiti the prune mover in the late disturbances in iew zcaland may not be uninteresting erueti now known as to whiti is the grandson through his daughter of paora paul eukutai who was chief of the pautuhiai trihoe when this dis trict was first occupied by european settlrs the ohief of the tribe now is ruaorl grandson of the old chief through his son aperihama abraham though his influence is but nominal being overshadowed by that of the great prophet leader to whitierueti was in his youth a pupil of the rev mr riemensobneider head of the now defunot wesleyan blission station at warea and it was here that he obtained his intimate know ledge of the bible which it is no exaggera tion to say he knows by heart and his thorough acquaintance with whioh he displays with so muoh effect in his publio manifestoes and orations be was looked upon by mr riemenschneider as an earnest christian and when his pupilage ended the rev gentlemen presented him with a large biblo whioh he still possesses about the year  and thence to  he was engaged under european surveyors cutting lines and chain bearing near new plymouth he frst came prominently into notice as a leading man among his people in  on the occasion of the wreck of the steamship lord worsley in te namu bav opunake the steamer was wrecked on the st of august of that year and on the following day a council of chiefs consisting of wiremu kingi matakatea aperihama ngatawa and erueti sat to deliberate on what should bo done with the passengeps and cargo chiefiy through the exertions of erueti the passengers were allowed to proceed to new plymouth where it was greatly feared that they would never be allowed to depart with their lives from opunake there were also  ounces of gold on board the ship and it was principally at the instance of erueti that this was given up to mr robert graham the person in charge of it soon after this erueti changed his name to to whiti  after an old pah of the tribe situate in the vicinity of neow plymouth near the sugarloaf peak in  shortly after titokowar as outbreak it was important that the intentions of te whiti who had by this time attained to great influence among the taranakis and ngatiruannis should be ascertained and mr parris then civil commissioner proceeded to parihaka accompanied by about  friendly nativesand had an interview with him the party was well received parihaka was then a small clearing in the midst of dense bush with about s resident natives it was gathered from what fell from to whiti that his people would not cooperate with the rebels and that he was in favour of peace mr parris stated that the parihaka natives were with out exception kingites and to whiti was looked up to by them as being little if at all inferior to the ding that al he uttered was spoken in a very calm manner though the man was evidently deeply convinced that he was under supernatural influence no doubt the result of the secluded life he had then been leading for some years shortly after this meetings were convened at stated periods by the prophet these are held monthly but there are two principal ones vizon the th of marsh and the th of september in ecah year the most important of these moetings up to the present time was the one held in sep tember  when mr parris attended with a fol lowing of  queensnatives the prophet on this occasion ordered titokowaru to remain at peace the following are extracts from the civil uommissioners report of the meeting   te wbiti is one of the few mlaories who have never embraced hauhauism but is said to havo steadily pro fessed the ohristian religion and carefully studied the scriptures consequently he scarcely utters a sentence without quoting from scripture his perfeot knov ledge of which has filled his mind with very primitive notions and rendered kim very impracticable i contro versy and having for the last ten years lived a very secluded life in rhe warea distriot he is not able to ap preplate the advantages of the improvements necessary m a new country for the development of its resources but seems to think that food and raiment are alone necessary for mankind  although representatives of the tribes from north and south had been at parihaka more than a fortnight no one had the sightest idea what te whiti was going to propose or to put it more correctly vhat he was going to decree for it must be known that this chief outdoes il the other inspired prophets and rulers of the maori race actually venturing to identify himself with jehovah ann giving forth his edcts as the direct com mands oo god this strange assumption and delusion renders it the rnore difflcult and painful to enter into any discussion with him more especially as he has succeeded in inspiring his followers with a feeling of stperstitious awe and with the belief that if not actually divine he is divinely inspired as a natural consequence of this what ever he says exercise over their minds a peculiar influence and powverhlis personal appearance is thus described by a gentleman who not long ago visited parihaka he is a man of medium size about  years of age of iane organization compact dense fibre iine hands i neat compact ears placed close to the head laving no nendent portionall indicating birmness and activity rather than great personal strength or prowess he wears his beard full  it has been very dark or black it is now welmixed with grey llis eyes are clear bright and intelligent his lips thin and olosing firmly his nose rises well from the face the nostrils opening well the cheeks are thin and eyebrows promi nent the features in repose have rather a spanish typeare most decidedly european so much so that i think there is something more than mere maori in his composition he has a bright ami able pleasing look such as i have never seen on any other maori face the features are very mobile  his forehead will wrinkle with little provocation and his eyes scintillate and ilashsuch is the man who at the time the grey go vernment was trying to purchase the adherence of tawbhao and rewi agai lifted his voice and called on all maories to rallyroundhimand said that their lands should be returned to them still protesting against fighting but announcing that the eettlers would be removed by some supernatural meanswhen the survey of the waimate plains was commenced it was thought that to whiti would make some demonstration but he stiu confined himself to prophecy though when maclean the cook to one of the survey parties in the waitoturu district was murdered by hiroki and the mur derer took refuge at parihaka to wihiti shelteredhim and refused to allow him to be given up and i on the chief of the tribe to which hiroki belonged proceeding with some of his men to parihaka to demand that he should be surrendered to them and given over to take his trial to whiti ordered that all the party with the exception of a european who accompanied them should be killed if they did not at once retire in march last the ron mir sheeban native minister went to the parihaka meeting and demanded the surrender of the mur derer te whitis reply was that hliroki was not so guilty as the government he bad only killed a man while they had illed the land he therefore refused to allow hiroki to be given up anddlr sheehan left parihaka the very next day te whiti issued orders to his natives to re move all the surveyors and their gangs from the waimate plains but without any shedding of blood which was accordingly done men and in struments being carted across the waingogoro river parihaka is now an alsatia where anymurderer or other criminal of the maori race is secure from the arm of the law to whiti having proclaimed it a city of refuge the place is only five miles from the main south road and barely six miles from the european settlers at okatoperlhaps a better idea will be given of te whiti by the following speech which he delivered at parihaka in june last than by the previous de scription of him though this was not one of the great meetings yet it was looked forward to with some anxiety as immediately following the ploughing exploits of his followers done too by hisorders there were only about  natives present te whiti said i am the man who stopped the rains oub of heaven from flooding the land the figbting i am the man whospoiled the laud in the places i chose to do it if any man molests me i will tak to him with the tongue that is my weapon with which i fight whoever

by my messengers are gchosts do man canl stop them my wvorkmen are fire the ploughman no men can stop them the prophet of edaal this is the last generation of the wforldto whiti proceeded in this strain for a consider able time and appears to be unlder the impression ohat the whole wvorld belongs to lliin he called himself jesus christ and said that the government would send large forees to parihaka and take hirn tewhii ndcrucify him that after three days adnhlhe will rise agai he says he will raot offier any resistance to the soldiers when they come but thatb he will gladlyr be crucified hee also states that the glovernment are deterniined to put dsur veyors on the plains but he will hot fight themten whiti further stated tat he received a tele gram tr om sir george grey oai the th of june proposing to send a commission to investigate the clauns of the nlatives to the confiscted lands la viting him ta whiti to employ a lawyer to look afterhis interests the government
