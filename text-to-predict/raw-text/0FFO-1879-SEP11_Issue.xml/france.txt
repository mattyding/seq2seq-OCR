france  fro our coiaesrondentsby telegiraphparis wednesday smr    rmthe sensation created by the cabul outrage is subsiding  but the temps this evoning discusses the matter more fully than any other french paper has yet done it holds that events have condemned the new english policy tho fruit of a wellcon ducted but costly and laborious campaign has dis appeared for less value was set on the scientific frontier than on the virtual control of afghan policy the late lord lawrence always objected to a pormanent mission as hazardous and the ameer excused himself from going to simla on the ground of internal anarchy  but this warning was thrown away and the indian government did not hesitate to treat with a prince so uncertain of his own authority eyoub khan the governor of llerat was known to be opposed to the peace and the experience of  had shown that an english tool on the afghan throne must succumb to the unpopularity of such an alliance the rising must therefore be imputed to iuevitable causes for such a mission was either unmeaning or signified direct interference in internal affairs shere alis aim having beon a standing army and centralized governmentan aim which

explained to return the visit of count andrassy it is probable however that some stronger motive than courtesy has induced prince bismarck if tho journey be indeed resolved upon to adopt so marked a course immediately after the imperial meeting at alexandrovo at vienna ho will be in a position to confer with persons of the highest influence and of the most extended information upon any subjeot which can justify the expenditure of time so valuable as his while it might be almost impossible to obtain such conferences in any other sway than by repairing to the austrian capital indeed if the prince had any great political scheme in view it would be entirely in keeping with his wellknown character to secure at firsthand any knowledge required for its complete attainment he must be well aware that at the present juncture when a happy resolu tion on the part of the russian and gorman emperors with which he has however thought fit to disavow any connexion has made it difficult for the most perverse writer tocontinue the late dangerous journalistic differences such a demonstration upon his part must inevitably bring about an instant renewal of the fray the meeting of the two sovereigns could be well accounted for on the score of the remarkable affection whicb fortunately perhaps for the many millions of their subjects exists between them that meeting to speak plainly was not one of the highest importance although it was certainly very convenient to peace loving folk to say so it is generally believed here that while the present emperor is the ruler of germany no war will be permitted against the subjects of the czarand it is tolerably certain that even with a rich and powerful ally russia cannot expect for years to be able to cope successfully with this country but these things were known to all wellinformed persons before the meeting at alexandrovo on the other hand a visit by prince bismarck to vienna at the very time when the russian press is exasperated by the quiet entrance of austrian troops into rich provinces freed by the expenditure of russian life and money could be construed only in one wayas an intimation that germany and austria were about to enter upon a common course of policy openly opposed to russian aspirations in eastern europe the berliner ageblatt of this morning in an article founded upon a letter from its vienna correspondent who mentions a report that count andrassy is retiring in order to make way for the peace party which believes that all may yet be arranged between austria and russia points out that the real com plaint made by the latter country against germany is that germany prefers austridn to russian interests there is full foundation for this remark and it will serve to indicate how the proposed visit will be interpreted in st petersburg the article concludes with the expression of a hope that prince gortchakoff may resign in favour of count schouvaloff an office which in no sense can he be said to fill this is all very well but in a country where there is no constitutional variation of a re presentative executive government and where dis missal means disgrace such a solution of the diffi culty can hardly be expectedon the subject of prince bismarcks move ments the semiofficial norddeutsche ailge meine zeitung states this evening that the reports in certain english and french news papers of the existence of relations between the papal nuncio at munich roncetti and the chancellor of the empire are without foundation and that to wellinformed german circles not a sign has been given that the nuncio has any com mission of authorization from the curia this may perhaps be tead as a hint that such a com mission is recommended  and as the princes hearty and continued support to his unaccustomed allies can hardly be reokoned upon the hint will probably be takenthe newspapers generally contain more or less speculation upon the prospects of the next session and it seems to be here and there suspected that the national liberals will not keep to the mode rate programme just published but discard it after it has disarmed suspicion and served its purposevery little is said today about the murders at cabul but the national zeitunzg thinks the autho rities having a full knowledge of the history of british relations with afghanistan are greatly to blame for allowing the fmbassy to enter the city with so small an escort the natirnal zeitung is of opinion that the decisive struggle betwoeen russia and england for surremacy in the east has by the catastrophe been brought critically nearmuch interest is of course maintained in the emperors progress telegraphic accounts of it are published daily by some of the papers and all agree in their description of the wonderful

ironclad fleet at anchor in these waters this consists of the friedrich carl the preussen the ironprinz and the friedrich der grosse it is well known that the emperor takes a very deep interest in the development of the naval power of germanyan interest which has boen shared by all his subjects ever since the late war with franc and the port of wilhelmshafen named after his majesty which from being an obscure fishing village has within the last few years risen to rival kiel is of itself aproof of the rapid strides the empire is making towards the possession of a marine power less dis proportionate to that of other states the iron clad fleet stationed here for some time back bas been taking advantage of the cool autumnal weather to train itself in all the essential requisites of naval warfare on monday last the squadron executed an important landing manoeuvre under the eye of admiral von stosch chief of the admiralty the idea was that a rather formid able fleet intended to effect a landing at one part of the coast and that in order to mask this and allure away tho troops intended for thecdefencoe thereof a kind of feint descent should be earried out at another point oonformably with this idea four ironclads supposed to be detached from a larger fleet began to steam in towards the shore in parallel lines en echelon at a short dis tance from the beach they cast anchor and in a few minutes a steam launch towipg seven boats laden with marines was seen steaming away to landward from the side of eaoh vessel meanwhile the guns on board ship opened fire for the purpose of silencing a fanoied battery on shore and covering the disembarcation of the attacking force scarcely had the boats touched the strand when the marines jumped ashore part im mediately spread out into a line of skir mishers others bwiftly landed one of the two guns carried by each steam launch and yoked themselves to it while the rest formed up into attacking columns previously determined on the skirmishers moved forward on the fancied enemys shore battery in the way practised in field tactics and after various evolutions in which the disembarked guns and those on board the launches bore effective part it was as sumed that a line of road and rail had been occupied whereupon the fancied battery was stormed and taken a peculiar feature in the manceuvre consisted in the fact that the sanitary corps of the ironclads accompaniedtho landing party and treated predetermined cases of wounding in the requisite way conveying the patients to the vessels the aviso today with the emperor on board was followed out to the roads by more than a score of private steamers richly dooked with bunting and on his leaving the harbour each ironclad fired a salute his majesty on passing each

away to the north after witnessing various other evolutions his majesty steamed back into the harbourand as tho imperial standard dropped from the masthead of the griue each of the ironclads again saluted him with  guns the emperor has expressed to admiral von stosch his deep satis faction at the accurate way in which all the evolutions were carried out in the afternoon ac companied by the

first leader and with the same distinc tion a letter without signature described as being from a person of much authority in vienna in which the writer undertakes to state the reasons which prompted the austrian government to give publicity to the report of their military attache in rome the writer says in effect that considering colonel haymerles official position his close re lationship to the preconized successor of count andrassy and the strictness of austrian military discipline it cannot be supposed that he would have published a pamphlet on so delicate a subject as the international relations of his country with out the consent of his government and probably also of the emperor bimself in fact the pamnphlet had given satisfaction in high quarters before it was known to the european publio and it has made much noise for it was intended to do so the writer continuesl but here is the problem why was this tempest in a wineglass raised when the re lations between the two countries were on the most cordial footing  austriahungary is preparing the letter is dated the st of september to occupy the sandjak of novi bazar as she has bosnia and herzegovina she was afraid of a determined resistance greater than that made in bosnia and some weeks ago the difficulties were not smoothed as they appear to be today now in case of becoming entangled in a serious war in that sandjak austria did not want to be troubled by the agitations of the italian irredentists who profiting by her momentary embarrassment would have renewed their cries for war the austrian government confides in the loyalty of the cairoli ministry but it remembers  now the publication of the pamphlet was decided upon before the occupation of novi bazar for several reasons it was desired to ascertain the secret mind of the italians and to provoke declarations from the government which vould be energetic against some of the colonels cbnjectures but would aim at proving the loyalty of italian states men in desiring to maintain cordial relations with austriahungary and have additionally pledged them  and lastly they know that in raising the question in that form some berlin papers which contain the warnings of the potent chancellor would shadow forth his authority in favour of austriahungary i do not know if this mode of procedure has attained its object or if it is better tor

catastrophe has produced a most painful impression in vienna almost all the papers of this city contain articles on the subject dvelling on the courage and patriotism of the victims who fighting to the last man fell like heroes though yakoob khan seems in no way compromised in the matter the freie presse is disposed to trace some analogy between the cabul revolt and that at cairo which iamail pasha made use of to rid himself of foreign control rulssia it is not doubted had her hand in the game  and very probably in quitting cabul the russian mission left behind a number of agents to make a

country it will be difficult says the talblatt to affirm and still more difficult to prove thit the troubles at bui arise from russian intrigue though it is certain that russia resents the dominant influence of england in afghanistan and tho rivalry between the two nations in asia is likely to lead to sanguinary complications the viceroy of india will perhaps take advantage of the occasion to subjugate the whole of afghanistan but it is doubtful how the new conquest would contribute to the real consolidation of the anglo indian empire the deutsche zeitieng does not doubt that russian gold bad something to do with the ocbul catastrophe the only way to the domi nation of afghanistan the deutsche eitung argues is the way indicated by lord beaconsfield in his romance of tancredthe way namely by persia and the arabiansthat is through syria and mesopotamia the zeitung is therefore of opinion that the opening of a road from lahore to cabul would offer a better guaranteo for the domi nation of afghanistan than a garrison of ten anglo indian regiments at cabul lord beaconsfield is not the man to recede in face of difficulties and the viennese paper hopes that the novelists plan of

the journals opposed to article a of the berlin treaty have been publishing a series of articles of a violent character which though offensive to the soberminded portion of the people are calculated
