mizfonmaies iwi z amo our couresrondunshangha ny missionary circles both at home and in china have of late been much interested in what is known as the wushihshan case t foochow where pagan priests and anglican clergymen have submitted their differences to the obief justice of the suprome court in china for a peaceful settlement it wil be remembered that tho ohinese gentry aud merchants of the city of foochow have long ob jected to the presence of missionaries of the church of england and their mission premises on the prominent site of the wushihshan hill by the intemperate zeal and enterprise unaccompanied by discretion of the rev mr wolfe the head of the church mission at foochow the objections of the chinese were every now and again in a long series of years inflamed into aotive hostility  and this hostility culminated last year in the disgraceful riot of which i sent you at the time full particu ars the missionhouse was destroyed the mem bers of the mission and their families narrowly escaped with their lives and in consequence active negotiations were commenced by our consular and diplomatic authorities to procure compensation for the injury done and to have the ringleaders of the riot punished satisfactory promises were made on both these heads by the chinese overnment and things were rapidly going back to the tatus qto arnte when the chinese owners of the land on which the missionary premises are situated suddenly brought an action in the consular court at foochow claiming power under the lease they had granted to the missionaries to eject themthe land rented by the missionaries on the wushihshan hill is a part of the grounds of a taoist ternple the property of the city of foochow this temple with its buildings and lands has always been under the management of certain directors who in  wiere men of euch tolerant views in religious matters that they let part of it to the rev mr wolfe for a certain sum per anumn the deed of lease among other things recited that part of the rent received by the directors from the missionaries was to be handed by them to the taoist priests of the temple to be used in the temple services that it was to be paid quarterly and no limit of time for the termination of the lease was mentioned under this lease the missiouaries might have held for ever if they had not set about irritating their landlords in the most perverse manner taoist priests are nothing if not geomancers  no house of any pretensions is built without their advice being asked regarding the harmony of situation and building  and the mis sionaries in spite of that proceeded to build houses on the temple land under the very noses of their landlords which in shape and position outraged not only the superstitions of the taoist priests hut of the whole population of fooihov it was too good a chance to be lost of reading the heathen a lesson on the follies of fang shui and mr wolfe took full advantage of it in many other ways too the missionaries succeeded in exasperating and worrying their pagan landlords and the upshotwas that the latter finally went to a british court to obtain power to withdraw from the lease which they had granted to the missionaries in  they claimed of course much more than that under the astute advice of foreign lawyers who toos care to inform their clients that petitions in england are usually framed with the view of getting the benefit of anything that may turn up during the hearing and that plaintiffs in engalish clourts pray for much wvhich they do not expect to get the resort to a british law court for redress wvas a proceeding so novel anid so inexpected that quite an unusual attention was given tv whaton its intrinsic merits was a common place dispute between landlord and tenant our foreign press indulged in heated periods where hard names and bad language took the place of fact and argument and the case was prejudged with even more than the usual rancour andfoolismness which in chinahave of lateinvariably accompanied the local treatment in the press of local subjects as the learnedjudge who decided the case calmly plt it the interests involved in the case are really not of mach moment but other ciroumstances have drawn to it a factitious degree of attention which neither the value of interests at stake nor the importance of the points raised justify the chief justice having ruled that the contract of lease between the priests or the temple directors and the missionaries was to be interpreted by the l loci rei sits so soon as that lsw was ascertained there was no dificulty in disposing of the case official witnesses were called by the plaintiffs to prove that by the general real property law of ohina and by the local custom of the province in which fooohow is situated the mission sries must give u the land and buildings rented by them to their landlords wvhenever they were re qlilred to do so the conclusion to which the chief justice came on the somewhat elastic and insatis factory evidence produced was tlhat to establish the right to the resrunption of chinese property leased on the terms of the agreement of  the landlords had only to declare that they bond ftide required the property for their own uses he accordingly declared that the taoist priests would be entitled to resume possession of the mission premises on the wushihshsn hill on their requir mg the same for the purposes of their temple the efeot of the judgment will be of course that the missionarles will be at once turned out and that e ohurch missionary society will lose possession df an important property which has been their most active centre in china an even worse con sequence of the publicity which has attended the case is the alienation fromthe missionaries b bheir own aots of that sympathy and support wbich their followcountrymen both here and at home freely give them when their conduct ib in barmony with their principles the following quotation from the sï¿½hanghai oouries expresses fairly the feelings of english laymen in china regarding the wulshih shan case and the acts of the missionaries wvhich gave rise to it the spectacle of the authorities of a pagan temple appealing to a british court of justice against tho alleged aggressioni and wrongdoing of a christian missionary society wss most painful to all who respect missions and missionariea the bet friends of missionaries would have wished to avoid it when it is said aa it is so often that the cause of missions in cbins has made litble progress if it has not been an utter failure thoughtful people cannot help asking who is responsible for such a marked want of success how often has missionary indiscretion and disregard for the feelings and rights of the chinese provoked hostility and hatred when the real purpose was to promotq charity and love i it will no doubt be said that the case just decided was an altogether exceptional one and that the course pursued towards the natives did not receive the sympathy or support of others engaged in missionary work we are afraid this is a too hopeful view of the matter and we bave grounds for saying so on opening a wellknown missionary pamphlet just to hand we bnd a missionary lamenting the difficulty attending his efforts in ohina there is one word says thim enthusiastic gentleman  whioh represents very com prehensively the mission work in china better then any other expression in the english language it is the word aggression but aggression must be backed up and followed out every place that we obtain in ohina ought to be held tightly and firmly and never be surrenderedif that is to bathe spirit in which missionary enterprise is to be conducted in chins the wushlhhan case will not be tho last of its kind the very word  missionary  will become a term of reproach and socalled missionary enterprise will prove a formidable obitacle to the inter course of natives and foreigners and so arrest the progress and improvement of this vast exmpireto the ruling of the chief justice that all contracts relating to land held by foreign lessees of chinese landlords shall be interpreted by the le rei sitca there an be no objection as a principle of law the difficulties of finding what the lawv is in any gi ven aue are however almost insuperable the es es civilization bears many mnarks of its in ferlr oharaoter such as the severitv and vin diotiveness of the criminal code the haphazard in oidence of taxation the position of women the liability of the family or sept for the delicts of the individual  but none is more strilkin than the un certainty and indeed in many grea departments of law the absence of any definite civil law real property law intestate succession ills and con tracts are a jumble of local customs which may be eetadde atpleasure bythe magistrates of even courts of firat lnstance in shanghai one or two strongminded british asaessors at the mixed court have

desert of chma tho local oustoms whioh do exist aro enforeed by judges who are trained to believe that the essence of law is compromise and that it is their duty to eive suoh deoions as shall bo

fundamental legal prinoiples in a civiltzed country in addition to the difficulty of finding the law there is the diffloulty even whore the law may be supposed to exist of getting chinese official witnesses to state it a our knowledge and experience of chinese officials goes to show that any one who might be called to state the ohinese law in any case would be exceedinigly apt to square the law with his own view of the merits of the case or with his estimation of the cubical capacity of the plaintiffs purse under these circumstances it will be for all foreign lessees of land or bouses from chinese proprietors to make their agreement of rent with the ful undertanding that whether they become ultimatel plaintiffs or defendants in a suitatlaw regarding the provisions or interpretation of these agreement and whether the fortm of the case be an english or a chinese court they will have to abide by what ohinese landlords and their witnesses may choose to say chinese law is in the wushihhan case sub stantial justice has been done but in nine cases out of ten where the lsx rei itt may be applied in an anglochinese case the english landrenter will certainly go to the wall
