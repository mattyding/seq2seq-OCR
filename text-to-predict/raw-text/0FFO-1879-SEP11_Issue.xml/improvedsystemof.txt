improved systes of street ligirringthe gas engineer to the bristol corporation mr b kitt oe successfully tried on tuesday night in one of the latgest thoroughfares of the city a new system he has designed for the improvement of street lighting owing to a sugges tion from the corporation wvhen the scheme of electric lighting was under discussion he turned his attention to the means of improving the present system without involv ing any extra consumption of gas dealing with the present burner wbich consumes five cubic feet of gas per hour and is in general use throughout the country he divides she light into two jets each consuming ift of gas per hour and thus leaves the actual consuniption un changed between these two jets placed in each street lamp he suspends a double convex lens forming a powerful reflectorand by competentcalculation the result is foundto be an increase of ligbting power to the extent of  per cent ordinary batswing burners are used and the only care required to insure a perfect light is a nice adjustment of the suspended lens so as to get tbe right focus and the full reflection of the lighl when this is secured the jets even at a distance are very brilliant and have the ap pearance of globes of light they illumine the footpath between each lamp with mauch of the effect of the electric light while the divided jets give ample light also to the roadway a special feature of the system is the iondistance to which the light is thrown from each lamp and at  yards the light backed by the reflector is very powerful compared with the ordinary streetlamp while a slighr increase in the size and capacity of the burners has a surprising effect in two or thrte instances argand burners were tried the light was more steady but showed little improvement on the ordinasy batswing burners which are found sufficient for all practical purposes the gas engineers of corporations in other provincial cities have been some vveeks waiting the result of the bristol scheme and several letters had been received from them desiring earlyinformation of its practical adoption theplanwascon sidered undoubtedly a success and will probably be adopted throughout the city it consumes no moie gas than that ordinarily burnt and the reflectors being of simple con struction the cost of adopting the new system is nominalrobbery at the frencch x natby of finaqce on saturday afternoon a most impndent robbery was committed at tbeo ministry of finance paris two young clerks who were actihg for the chief cashier m chazal during his absence had laid on a table behind them a packet containing  francs which had to be sent to the banque after having answered the inquiries of some persons at the counter they saw on turning round a gen tleman who had just entered the office by the inner door and who on their asking his business replied that he wished to speak to i chazal on being told that he was not in the stranger who politely begged pardon for his intrusion withdrew and a few moments afterwards the two clerks became aware that the packet with  francs bad disappeared from its place search was made but it could uosvhere be found and the police were accord ingly sent for the guilty parties have not yet been traced but it is believed that the strangers who made in quiries at the offiee just before the clerks discovered the intruder were accomplices of the latterthe st gothard razlwayon the section of the st gothard line which is to run between brunnen and fluelen and which will beyond dispute be one of the most picturesque strips of railway in switzerland  navvies and other wor men have according to the bund just made a commencement with the work of preparing the necessary foundations the section in question starts about  paces from the pension gyr on the outskirts of the eastern side of brunnen the line will here pass about  metres below the axenroad enter a tunnel and leave it below the hotel axenfels  metres away from the road tbe line skirts one side of the lake hut owing to theprecipttons nature of the land here it frequentlyasses through tunnels the longest of these  metres in length terminates at sisikon near the steamship station at sisikon the line runs along the shore of the lake towards tells platte the road is being widened by blast ing the rock and the railway is here on the same level as the axenroad beneath the tells chapel hotel and be tween the hotel and the chapel a tunnel is being excavated on coming out of wbich the line is  matres below the road the railway then passes through another short and one long tunnel which is excavated through the middle of the axenberg with its remarkable geological formtions the last mentioned tunnel on this picturesque route termi nates in the vicinity of fluelenthe pussian harvesthe preliminary official estimate of the barvest in prussia the results of wbich as regards the chief kinds of grain and potatoes have already been noticed in these columns includes a review of the less inportant crops such as buckwheat peas horsebeans vetches lupines sugarbeet mangold wurzel rape seed flax linseed hops hay from clover and meadow or grass hay the number

and particularly in the department of gironde of the  hectares planted with vines throughout the country it is estimated that nearly  are utterly destroyed and  others seriously affected and that the total loss to the state will not be less than three milliards in the gironde alone the produce for the year is believed to be diminished by  tuns of wine mi leonce guiraud the president of the niames chamber of commerce bears testimony to the value of american vinestocks which bave been planted in that neighbourhood to the amount of  or  bectares and which though of course not equalling the yield or quality of the old vines have yet shown great resistance to the disease  and he recommends that their cultivation sbould be pursued in all poor land the treatment by sulphuret of carbon has been follonved with greab success and especially where the vine yields more than  hectolitres to the hectare or where the quality of the vine secures it a high price the cost of applying it is at the rate of about f to f per hectare for two dressings where feasible as alongside the banks of rivers it is advised to turn the water over the vinevard and submerge it it being found that the mud which ia deposited has a good effect in killing the phylloxeraproressor vibchowprofessor rudolf vir chow of berlin is expected to visit this country shortly it will be remembered that he was dr schliemanns
