saying he was glad the time had come when ho could lay before the magistrates and the public hisanswer to the grievouscharges mr mureb was distressed and disappointed at the result of his longefforts toprormotetheprosperityof the bank and through the loss of his fortune and that of his family  he was overwhelmed with misery at the widespread ruin which the failure of this unfortunate bank brought uton so many but bo still bad his honour unscathe ande now pledged himself to give a full and direct answer to the charges to suggest that a man of the education and associations of mr mureb enjoying the respect of all with whom ho was brought into contact wvould settle down with the other gentlemen who now stood arraigned to concoct a scheme of fraud and for a long series of years to persevere in a course of almost unparallelled falsebood was tomake a charge of a most infamous character for nearly fifty years mr burcb had been resident in bath and enjoyed there the esteem confidence and respect of all who knew bim he having been four times mayor of the city unfortunately no other court of inquiry for great fimancial disasters existed and the government had recourse to what seemed to be a harsh and cruel proceeding which was justified upon the ground that they hadbeen obliged to resort to the old common law remedy of indicting the defondants for the criminal offence very fact which had been used against his client was a tact which had been disclosed by himself iu a case like this where a great disaster had occurred whero their own friends might have been heavy losers a jury would anxiously look around and see if they could not sacrifice some lichtm so tbat the directors would becorue the victinms of popular feeling and prejudice he felt sure that ng man would rejoice more than the at torneygeaeral that men respecting whom he had insti tuted this inquiry ece after a full searching and com plate investigation declared not to be flt subjects for iurther criminal prosecution re was not there to justify them as lankers they were not artaifned upon a charge of being i effect bankers directors of joint stock bank iebank c as a ruile had to rely greatly upon the ads ana officials and the management of t kdeended upon their juagment certainly as much suponthe judgment of the directors themselves as to the a of fraud was there any imputation upon the personal honour or honesty of either of the defendants or the slightest pretence for saying thatthey had conspired to gether dir jollins bad notput before themone singleentry suggestive of personal corruption or personal dishonesty ntob a suggestion had been made from beginning to end that thee mcu now charged as criminals had ever acted except with a view to promote the welfare of the bank and those connected with it thpre wasb overdrawing of accounts no improper dealing in shares ther was no ellng shares at high prices or buying them at low prices the conduct of the directors all through was the conduct of men of honour and intearity bir murch wheu he became a director in  beld  shaes agrd radually increased the number by continually buying the same might be said of the other directors and if they were rogues or conspirators they had banded together to deceive and defraud the public and yet had done this so cleverly that they had become the victims of their own machinations lt had never beea beard of before that the persons who prs ed the frauds should be the very ersons wbo were t m of them the directors bought a new minutebook and invested in a new carpet for the boardroom laughter they might have been sanguine and over sanguine ut that the directors believed in the stability of the bank and that it would succeed was apparent from their conduet from the first day of their connexion with it to the last it was recorded that mr murch nover sold a single share ro did not mean to say thoy might not be rogues but if so they were rogues one ought to preserve because they were curiosities laughter no man knew the affairs of the bank better than dlr clarke the liquida tor he was a tboroughly independent witness eta was under no influence of prosecution or defence mlr olarke said he had since december last been engaged in the liquidation of the bank and had the fullest and most thorough opportunity of searching into its whole history and he was master of every detail of the transaction liecould not find from beginning to end the slightest grounds i for suspecting fraud mr dester was in a different gosition  be was an official of the bank and if there had been any fraud mr dester was at the root and bottom of it therefore mir dester might be said to have been a sus picious witness the prosecution called him and he stated that throughout the whole ofhisconnexion with the bankhe had found the directors anuimated with a sincere desire to promote the interest of the bank and all connected with it and that he had never seen the slightest ground for sus pecting fraud in any of their dealings mr smart an ac countant from london had been brought down by the treasury because they particularly confided in him and he had been examining the affairs of the bank for the last three months and had not even finished his labours if mirsmart had disovered any fraunl the prosecution would have calied him the bank became interested in the booker works by taking over a banking concern at cardiff whch had beea carried on by ltessrs toogood among other accounts the bank took over the booker account in the course of years booker got more and more into the banks debt and ultimately the account became un manageable and a great source of inconvenience to the bank ir collins referred to the warnings of dir bates bates had been manager of the bank for a great number of years up till  but did not begin his croaking and uarmnig until he had gone out of the bank they made him a director bates had overdrawn his account at the bank as general manager he was the last person who should have done this because it set a bad example when dlr bates was pressed by murch to make some satisfactory arrangement with respect to his overdraft he felt it his duxty to issue these croaking warnings che directors thoeght a company could be formed to take over the xorlcs aun that the anks security would then assume a more manageable form because if the booker company could be successfully brought out the public induced to take shares and the thing prospered the directors would be able to got rid in course of time of bookers debt their debenttures and sbares and relieve themselves from anxiety in  or l the seheme for the formation of a limited company was originated the public like fish had their feedling time and it was no use to bring out anything when the public had not an appetite for it laugbter he supposed that this company wvs floated at an incon venient tiuc as the public did not take shares through all these minutes they woulw find the negutiations were con ducted on the pait of the bank tlrough the instrumentality of mr prichard and on tho part of booker by mir powles the first aidd greatest obstruction to briinging out the com pany was booker himself they could not get booker to do anything but overdraw laughter they were put in this difficulty if thoy did not a lowbooker to overdraw the works would stop and if the norks stopped the security was practically gone ln all transactions hlr priohard acted as legal advisew to the bank if this was a fraudu ivut company the directors seemed to have gone the wrong way to carry it out mlr bird who valued the concern mid dir foster brown who was another valuer employed were both men against whomn nothing could be suggested a meeting was held in london which was attended by ir iaurnl cud dur bird they discussed the proposed ar rangemnents with dlr booker in dlr bird s presence  ail yet they were told that it was fraudulently concealed i rom dr blrd that the bank had a very large in terest in the works when the company was brought out mlr ucorge became one of the first victims of the fraud if it wvas a fraud as he took shares without any guarantee the solicitor too took shares he couldi iniagine a person unexpectedly coming into a legacy niaking a rash invest ment but imainn a rolicitor investing his costs in a comn pany of which ae did not think well  laughter as to the  per cent it was guaranteed to the trustees of dir dlurcns sons marriage settlement and it scarcely seemed cousistent with the belief or knowledge that he had been a party to a fraud that he palmed upon his sons trustees an utterly worthless security it that was fraud why had not the prosecution indicted mr powvles and mr prichard under whose iidvice the directors had acted  if there was fraud dlr prichard was cognizant of it and mir powles was as bad as the representatives of the bankc he knew everything was a party to everytbing and responsible for everything connected with the transaction quite as much as any of the defendants if that were not so why lhad not alr prichard dir powles and also mir jefferies been called  with reference to the charge of putting fraudulent statements in the balance sheets there wvas just as much aiid just as little founda tion for this chairge as there was for the one of which he trustedd he had satisfactorily disposed in  when thecompy evs lancld an he h account waszon into snu thoroughly discussed booker s debt to tbe bank was �no doubt a sum of almost disastrous mag nitude but at that tim the booker property was in qulestionably a inost valuable one and was valued irrespective of goodwill lands and stock at �thri w as als substautial szcurity at this time and against bookers works there had always been a special bad debt reserve after s the arraugement was made that the bank should take certain secutrities in satisfaction of their debt iut these transactions were not definitely carried out until  notnithstanding the efforts of dir priebard in conjunction with mir povles to get in the jvarious outlyiug securities considerable disappointmentwas cxpressd that the shares nvere not talcen up as had been hopei and nio doubt had these shares beoon taken up the booker debt would have beean satisfied the bank would have been relieved from the incubusnod it miglht now have been a flourishing concern the works were carried on for a time at a profit but then followed a period of unprecedented depression there wvas a loss on the wvorks lhey had it in the evidence that mr gilbertson and other gentlemen of experience in the locality wvho knew the works were content to buy their shares at par and this being the case how could they say the directors were not justified in entering their debenturesor shares at a like value i tho substantial question in the case was whether the board were justified in dealingwith their securities from  up to  in the way in which they didnamely at the vnalue at wvhich they placed theni in their balancesheets the ban had uot to deal with this property as one it bad to sell it had to deal with it as a security to be realized in due course the diretorsheld it as security for money and vhlema thoy vrere told by dir foster brown that it was worth � why sbould they not have entered it as worth that amount  the directors honed up to the last that trade would revivepaoh taob ca rried on t a profitas to r ertson to ter t t a was concetneho was worse than ooker he did not mean this in ant improper sense btit gilbertson went on the booket companys board to rcpresent booker and he did his utmost to make the bank keep up their coanexion with booker and to get concession after concession from the bank it never occurred to him that the bookers should give up anything and he did all he could against this hank to support the directors as to the questions of rebate and abatements he really felt ashamed of wasting their valuable time in following theso various willothewisps til one showed what they were as to the deferred suares referred to in the minute of april he would point out that the proposal that the dividends upon the fully paidup shares of booker and co should be deferred till a certain dividend had been secured on obe other debentures was contrived and carried out by gilbert son the virtual chairman and manager and prichard and jefferies and brought to the board for the bank to assent to and that was the share the board had in the matter if this were the gross fraud described then gllbertson was a party to the fraud as well as pricbard and jefferies but he repeated there was no fraud and no man who had taken the trouble to consider the matter before casting such a suggestion upon his fellow men would have ventured to bring such a charge in the correspoadence on the deferred shares they had the old story of one man who would not consent and that was the inevitable banker he was generally an accom modating man always ready to do anything he would not stand in the way of the banks sharts being deferred at anypriccbut he would notdeferhis own he saidhow ever i will tell you what i wilu do the bank has some in vestment shares i will take these in exehange for fiully paidup shares they will give suoh a sum of money as will enable me to pay up the remaining call as to the ques tion of the banker policies it was really one of those he had a difficulty in approaching seriously there was something thoroughly ludicrous about it but as to fraud he ventured to say that inalluthe charges made against these gentlemen there was not one in which there was less ground to suspect fraud of any sort or kind of course t looked serious in the first instance it was said there was a mere policy set down as an asset and strange as it might seemst was always treated as an asset and he would show them that everybody believed it these sort of nmistakes were sometines just those which the longest escaped detection it was like hiding a thing in a place where everybody was likely to see iti and where no one looked for it laughter he wonldi show them that it was one of those errors which everybody made he would trace its history from its origin downwards until he fouowed it into the bank parlour and tiu it was presented to the governors and the directors of the bank of england as a select asset laughter at first it astounded one to hear that � of life policy was treated as an asset of � but it was so and the error was so treated by business men and was one of those orrors that were always repeated but when his friend mr collins asked was not there � served up every week in the bank parlour and did not the directors remember all seeing it he would replyof course they saw it they saw it every week they would have missed it if it had not been there they would have been wonderfully surprised if it had not appeared it was used as one of the stockt dishes of the balancesheet it was one of those standing figures which never alterlife policy and bonus the very samo words in which mr pritchard first intro duced it to the bank and the same language was applied to it throughout it was regarded by the bank as a stock asset and as such was taken to london and submitted to a conmmittee of bankers as an asset on which they sought to raise money tracing its origin to a minuto in which mir chard the solicitor suggested that the debt of � might be reduced �  by the creation of those plicies on the life of mr boocer he must argue that thiat was how it first came to be regarded as an asset and through out the correspondence on the subject there was not a single misrepresentation of any fact or the slightest attempt at any sort of concealment this asset found its way iato the ledger and subsequently into the balance sheet and ir dester at the time the policies were entered as of the value of � mnst have either known their wvorth or not if he did not know it he must have made a great blunder if he did know it he was the worst party in this conspiracymr day was in the middle of his speech when the court adjourned until this morning
