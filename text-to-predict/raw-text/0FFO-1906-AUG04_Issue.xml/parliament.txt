could receive religion from a person who did not believe in the religion he professed to teach hie contended tihat theto had been ample fulflment of the purpoens for which the vohlntary schools were

out how the bill was regarded in the country there had been a great accruing of pinpose and power in the resolve to amrend the bill as the debate bad gone on he believed that would be reinforced by a

ultimata authoi was able to unveil its inmost secret not neces sarily to the elaboratelv instructed but to the single hearted soul these considerations made it to him infinitely unwelcome to tae a line of protest and of disappointment at what they had been earnestly assured had been an honest atterpt by able d patriotic men to arrive at a settlement of this great disnute bathe was compelled to say that his disapointment was bitter at the facts as thev stood he was dismiayed at the rutess energy vwith which the extremely well meant attempt at a compromise in  had been pursed until it had issued in the proposals of the present bill hie believed that feeling was shardby many evenminded godly and informed nonconformists from the proceedings ihat had talca place at public meetings and from experierce in his diocese he ws con vinced that there was a feeling in the countr vwhich might be interpreted as a maneate to the house of lords to do nothiing inconsiderate but to approach thisbill with tho consciousness that thero was a mass of feeling behind which looked upon the mouse rather as a sub stitate for a referendum than us protectors of sectarian interests the causa for which thev stood should inspire courage it wms not a sectarian cause not a proselytizing cause it was a cause in which thewahole christianitv of the rising generation among tlh wcrking classes of the country was concerned there ows no security that what was called the copertemple teaching of religion would rerainiindead it was largely ceasing to be what it had been and he held that the church of england which was not a sect which was not a denomination merelyit vas older than the nationhad the position and capabilities for doing forthe rising generation what no other christian body as corstituted today could do to preserve the teach ig of revealed eternal truths with a inowvledge of a great hacking in the country and maighty reasons he exhorted their lordships to consider the bill

with cheers saidi should lilheatthe outset of my ferrearks to notice very briefly a suggestion which during the last few days bha been repeatedly made tome made to me by noble lords for whose cpinions i elltertain very deep respect and whose judgment is entitled to every consideration i have beena sled by several members of your lordabips house whether it wvold not have been betterifthedebateon tho second reading of this bill had stood over ntil the month of october my frierds were able to adduca several reasons int favorof that course he bill had been in our hands but a very few hours when this debate began it has been greatfy altered during its pasnsge through the house of commons and it contains many important provisions which vwere not there discmsed in these circumstances it was not walnul to ask that moro time should be given to the house of lords before we give the bil a secmod teading bm on the other hand after consulting with many of our supporters it seemed to me that the attituade of nble lords who sit on this side of the house towards the billwas perfictlyclear and that it was desimble that this attitedo shouldlbe made p lain to the coumtry with out iurther loss of time hear htar i ndertand that most of us are readyto admit that some modifition ofthe actof  isinevitable batweholdverystronely that in submitting these papticular proposls for the nlteration of that act of parliament his majestys government have very seriously mnisudarstood the feel ing of the country towards this importnt subject hear hear we believe that this bill would workj if it were to pass in its present shape sery grave injustice oat of all proportion to the alleged grievances it seehs to remove and wo at ny bt cannot contemplate the passing of the bill into law in the shape in which it now stands cheers on the other band we recognize that the bill contains ad missions of some very important and farreaching principles admissions that we welcome as indicat ing a desire at any rate on the part of the framers of the bill to deal ina equitablo suirit with thisquestion in holding these views it saims to ng that it is our duty to try to amend this bill and we feel that it would beamoreor spertful to the other house of prliaentand i think we aul feel that there should be reciprocal respect sholwnby each houseto the other hear hearthat it would ber more respectful to the house of commons to resd tho bdl a second time and thea address ourselves serioasly to the consideration of the grave injustice we believe it odntains hear hear if i have not incorrectly describedtheattitudo of the louse it is sorely better that that attitudo should be explained now rather than we should by delay give rise to the least suspicion for two orthree months doting vhich all sorts of sinistermotiveswouldbe nttmnto your lordships house but we do desire to be clearly understood that in iving a second reading to the bil we do not abat one jot or tittle of our right to deal with the bill as wo think proper at a future stage one other reason why i m gla the debate has not been postponed is that i think that some of the speeches which bavebeen delivered during the coursoeof it aroespeeches that camot fail to have a very wide efiot in the country  and if we only had to consider from that point of view the speech from the most rev prolate who prasides over the see of centerbury i should say we have reason to be deeply gteful that the debate has taken place now cheers shat is our main complaint of this bill  i think it may e sexpressed in a very fewwords by snying that it does very littlefor education end crates a vast amount of heartburnig a nd disturbance the billhas been descrubed today as above al things en educational bill and i would like toput the accuracy of this descrition to a simple test the lord president of the council introduced the measur in a lon speechnot too iong bemuse the sabject is one calling for lengthened explanationbut i noticed that out of the hourand a half i think that was about the time occupiedabout an hour and a quarter were devoted to what he himself decribed as theo  aid region of the religions diifculty and only in the last quarter of en hour of the time occupied by his speech did he find himself in what he gmacefully describea as being in the green fields with the children and then he began to tell us of things the bill did for the children such things astffheestablishment of play centres vacation schools and i suppose i mrt include that early intro duction to the dentist which is no doubt necessary and upon wbich the noble earl became eloquent ittis oven so with all this controversv theabsorbing interest of thisreligious question has stped all the educational side of tho problem it has dispelled so it seemns to me tho sense of proportion of lislja jesty govcrnment ithasled them to exagerate tho extent of the nonconformists grievance it s led them to underrate those other grievanoes which the bill wvold infallibly create to underrate the agitation which it would lead t an agitation which i am convinced will be far more formidable than any which ehas been provoked by th existi

there again the indictment was not always the same the bishop of londom attackedthe bill becauso it ws an attempt to set up undenominational religion at tho expense of denominational religion but the dauke of devonshire denounecd it as an attack upon ll religion broadly speakin  the answer of the govern mdent was this the poople of this country were a relioglos people this bill entrust largo rights and duties to the educational authorities of the country and it was not to be supposed that an educational anthority elected by roligions peeplo would be likely at once to comlmence an antirelrgious campaign the contention that teaching under the cowpertemple clausewould lead to a secular systen vws an attack not on the bill but on the existing law thle cowpertemple clause now

been able to anreo with the methods inmodzrn times the efforts of the church had been great and it mast not be taken as any reflection on the right rev prelstes or their predecessors if they ventured
