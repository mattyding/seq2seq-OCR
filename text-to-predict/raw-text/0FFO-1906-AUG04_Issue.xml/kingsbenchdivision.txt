plaintiff might reover this sum of � hadheseed for money lent merely but not on the cheque this position seems incapable of support as a fair one by reasonmg from principle unless one were to adopt m an inverse sense the view of the statute of annu given by mr justice willmot in robinson v bland at page s of the report  the statutes meant to prevent excessive gaming and to vacate all securities whatsoever for money won at play and the genuine trae and sound construction of  anne is to understand it as intended to prevent any securities being taken fox money won at play or lent to play with when the borrower had lost all his ready cash but not to mao tha contract itself void where thse money is fairly and hone lent thoagh at the time and p lace of plav indeed mr randolh relies entirely on the words of the statute  and  will iv cap  which repealiun tha statute of anne enacts that  every noto  which would have been void under that act as this cheque ndonbtedly would if drawn in respect of gaming in england  shall be deemed and tiken to have been made for an illeal consideration the case of  quardiec v colston  put an end as fer as english gaming is con cerned to the distinction before then drawn bv ths conzis in construing the statute of anne between the recovery as a debt of money lost in gaming and the recovery of it upon a security for its paymeri mr randolphs argument is that provided the gaming be infranee the distinction is preserved by the act of wivand no doubt the mere words of thestatute shall be deemed and takren to have baon made for nn inegal considention do support that contentiorn i thbik however that the statutes were intended to etriie at gmiig in this countrr alone and in suchothorsmight make ilegal gamin within their borders and that

care that no difficulties were placed in the vaydr robert jones medical superintendent of the london county council asylum at claybury who gave his ovidenco in chief yesterday wastoday crossexamuned by mr lush he said that beforo the frst visit of dr lister and himself to brookstreet they had received certain information as to facts concerning the marquis which would help them to come to a conclusion in the miatter he did not think the information weent beyond tha stuament that there w gentleman at brookstreet into whose mental condition they were to inquire he thought that in maling smh an examination it ws certainly necessary to get reliable information as to the case at the house they asked for information from people who wero present ie did not think the attitude of the marchioness vas hostile to them ile saw no indication of it he interpreted mfr suthersts attitude as beinm hostile hie thought there was a tendencv on mfr sntcersts part to try to prejudice their minds inxone particular direction one point was in relation to the ascendency of mr robins being an imsane infuenoe and the other as to his capacity formanagig his affairs the marchioness volunteered information to him on the subject of the ascenday of obins he fonned an opinion of the m s state of mind after his emipa ton of him bnt not before he had got the informatiofi from the m ioness they had a confirmation of her information he did not think that tho alleged ascendency of robins was the one nuportantcpestion vwith reference to tho stato of lord td endseminbut it ws an important question lndy townshend told him that mr robins had taken her husbands affection from her themarchioness conveyed to him the impression that lord townshend was dominated by mr robmnsmr lusabearing in mind that the test of such en influence is that the influence of friend for friend indicates a healthy mind and that the relationship of dominntmind and sabservient idmeanswmt of health did tho marchioness convey to you that the influence of mr robins over tho marquis was of the latter kind yesthat meass an tmsomnd mid does it not that is what she couveyed to mecontinuing the witness sid in answerto his loun shp that he rejected part of what had been told him becanse it did not tally with his personal observation of the marus in considering the question of the nature of the influenco of mr robins he took the marquiss view of that infuence in the fist instance and tho view of the marchioness in the second instance and he then formed his own ophimon as to it after his exanina tion of the marquis and havingpt these views together he came to his conclusionin answer to further questions by mr luass the witness said ha thought the statment made in his report to the lunacy commissionerswas a perfectlyfair one ho had read the letters from the marquis to mr itobins which had been intercepted there was a puro boyish recklessness about themmr lushin cno of the lottes the marquis says d dumne is in tho job what doesthat mean dr jonesi was here when dumme was cross examined and i should think from that that duane might be in svthingmr lushrs na wi be very grteful to yon i dare say but that isnot the point didyourask him what he ecant by that no i didnot mention it because i wvs satisfied that it was written under very great and intense mental excitementcontimning the witness said the impression indicated by the letters was one of dominance theyweraextmavagant in expression but in regard to tho languageused might he say that is carroll wroto tho line come to my anns my bcamish boy but no one suggested that he was insane mr lushdo you realy think that this is an analogous case because if soi shouldliike to apply that testtobr standard of judgment  ujsii rread some further etracts from the letters with the view of showing the state of the marquiss mindthe witness saidyou can prove anymortal thing by taking passages out of letters without the context you could prove any one insane in that waymr lusa should be very soray if anybody could prove mo insane by taking passages from my letterscontinuing mr lvssr read another lotter in which the passage occurred  that odious mother of mine is moving heaven and earth to se me i understand and will stop at nothing to rain you and asked is not that the farrago of a gentleman whose mind is unfortunately affected i suggest no because a man named davidson who had matried the marquis and marchioness came into the house and informed the marquis that his mother wanted to poison him i remonstrated with mr sutherst nnd told him that it was a hard thing to come in and put these views into tho marquiss mindmr lush read another letter to mr robins in which tho marquis wrote  you are all i care for and i would give up wife and all foryou   my love for my vife is as if i never had noneo you know what that means in another letter the marquis referred to hisunscrupulous old mothermr lushdo you know that you had been sent to see the marquis by the dowager marchioness and that she was allowing him  a year yes and i also know that at that timo the marquis had been told that his mother wanted to poison himwhen you talk of tho marquis being in a state of adolescence what do you meanchildishnab no not childishnessboyishness yeswhat sort of boyish age do you represent the marquis was at the time of his arrest in some cases hais much younger than others for instance in the case of memory he is as old as ywo or icompare him to a healthy boy what sort of age would you say he was it is very difficult to fix perhaps nbont do you think an ordinary young man of  would write letters such as thoso i have read it depends on the conditions under which they were writtea and on the relationship existing between the partiesdo you know that after writing these affectionate letters the marquis now talks of the malignity of robins and of blackmailing and other things without apparently having seen him in tho interval when i saxv him last saturday he told me that he should pass him in the street as an ordinary strangermur justurca jucnxrlet me ask you this supposo yon found that the marquis changed his opinion of kr robins without any apparent reason would that affect your opinion as to tho state of his mind i think his mind is very susceptiblemln jutirc bmrcimmzdo you think he might go back to robins next week i should be more or jess afraid of ittho witness was then crossexamined by mr lush with regard to tho occasion at brighton when the marqnis was walking about all night and contemplating suicide and it was suggested that the letter written by him was not tho emanation of a sound ralndthe witness did not accept this viewbin justca bucmcanilsupposing tho marqais had tommitted suicido on this occasion what would you bave said then  would you have been astonished at a verdict of suicido while temporarily insane no i hould notbeexamined by mr dueit was expressly stated in the petition that there was no suicidal tendency on tho pert of the marquis he should not have thought that the paszqins if he aed committed suicide had dono so whenxa hi opinion the vedigta of corouers jurieswero not satisfactory tests of the state of mind of the person concerned with regard to the attituide of the marqnis to dunne ho did not after his conduct regard it as evidence of insanity on the marquiss part to speak of him in terms of strong condemnation with regard to the ascendency of robins it was impossible to fix a dividing line between dorination deponding upon reason and involuntary domination it beemed to him that in the case of the marquis it was quite reasonablo having regard to the information given to him the memory of tho marquis was superescellent llas understanding was a little less excellent in conversing on ordinary topics he wgas extremely intelligent and in certain transactions ho w as quite ap to the average as regarded the marquiss lettcrs ho had not been able to iind in them anyv passages whichhadnot a rational explanation it would notbhe fair to him to take the letters and disregard the circum stances inwhich theywere written in his examination of the marquis he took what he regarded aa the urest methodofascertaining the state of lord townshends mind it was a method based on long experiencedr g f blandford examined by mr duwe said ho had devoted himself to the study of insanity for  vears eb had previously been lecturer at st georges hospital on monday last he had an interviow with lord townshend they discussed the question of his affairs and ho the marquis said they wero iu a great muddle he said that he had a house called ryngamhall but that it was lot they discussed mr robins and mr dunne and as to the former the marquis said he had been a great friend of his for many years but was not so now he saw nothing whatever to indicate unsoundness of mind in the marquis and he certuinly thought he was capable of looking after his own affairs the marchioness was not present during tho interviewcrossexamined by mr lusnile had heard the letters read in court that morning he thought thoy wore very exaggerated letters written under the influence of great excitement he should like to have read tho letters before seeing the marquis the information he had before seeing the marqtis was chiefly derived from the newspaper report of mr lashs opening of the case he asked no questions of the marchioness beforo seeing her husband the reason was that he thought it much better to examine him rather than the marchioness hle asked no questions of the marchioness about the marcuiss attachment to robins becanse the marquis told him about it himself the marquis said the reason for the cessation of his friendship with robins was that robins had robbed him the mrarquis said he had been to tho bank and found only  there when he the marquis said there ought to have been many hundreds ho asked the solicitors about it and they did not tell him definitely that robins had robbed him  they said that tiere ought to have been money in the bank which was not theremr lusnha good many people think thatcontinuing the iitness said the marquis told him that he went to tho bank at brighton with the marchioness whilst he was at brookstreet he did not ask the marchioness whother that was tho fact he asked the marquisabont the commission note to dunne lord townshend admitted it was a foolish thing but ho did not givo any explanation of how ho came to give it hel said he had signed a number of documnents at that timo and he gave the impression that he had been induced to sign them by those around him he the marquis said he had a confused idea of the different deeds he dr blandford had never seen the marquis beforedid he strike you as being like an ordinaryperson well he is smaller than an ordinary personthis inquiry is not to ascertain his height would you describe hum as an ordinary person i should say he was rather umdeveloped and weak but not insanscontinuing the witness said that with the asistsnceeof those ho had confidence in lord towashend was cappsle of managing himself and his affairs if he was in the hands of dishonest people he might be got atis not that aothor way of saying that umder those con ditions he wonld not be capable of managing his affairs  i think he

discussed ordinary topms with him and among others the present inquiry the miis said he was anxious to manago his own affairs he was perfectly sane at the time originated subjects for dission and was competeat to arguc on them hedid not find his judgment in fault nor did he see any evidence of his taking that to be which was notcrossexamined by mr lusirhe went both as a doctor andes a friend he had never seen lord townshend before there was a male nurse there he could not iirnagine what for the nurse was therm when he loft mr sutheret came to boulogne when he was thero and so did mr bennett the marquiss solicitor and another gentleman mir davidson was not there ile told no one ho thought it was foolish to havo a male nur the marquis slept in his own room he did not know whether the nurse slept in thle same room the marquis did not go for expeditions or walks by himself he had seen the numse during tho day he thought ho was sitting in the verandah reading a navel he had heard the letters read in court he would not have preferred to have read themn first becanse he was not concerned with ancient histort but only with the facts as they were at present he suggested that the marquis was like other people mentally and physcallypreexandned by mr durcshre did not know how long his on had been a friend of the marquis but ho had heard of the trouble the latter had bad h paid his own expenses at boulogne the household at boulogne con sisted of the marquis and the marchioness mrs sutherst and miss sutherst the marquis and marchioness were on terms of affection ile never saw the male mnre perform any duties for the maronuis who controlled his own movementsthis having concluded the medical evidence mr duxs desired to intorposecmr sutherst resamed his statement which was intqr rnpted yesterday as follows during tho coume of the ne otiations and before the marriage i sssaed mr robinsn the marquis whet was the mode of life of the marqis wastoldthathe was anxmiorus to take an muctis part inpolitical ltihfeand wthat he was a student and was desirous of attending to his duties as a landlordto conrm this i asked the amarqnis if it was his intentiontoattend the sittings of the house of lordq e said he wns most anxious to do so but that he had a very small lnowledge of poliucs or political life i asked him if he had bern interested in anv financial or company matters he said only one i asked him if he would resign his positiointa company and undertake to accept no directorship and have nothing to do with any investments or public companies or make any loan or sign any bill or borrow any money my reason was thathad discovered he had bean givingbills and embarking ont one or twodobfletris and i was anxious that ho should begin his married life fre from business complications i did this in the interest of the marquis and my daughter the marquis and mr robins saw the reason of this and agreesd after the marriage mr robins and myself proceeded to paris on onr vay to lisbon i invited mr robins to go to lisbon because he had with ma had a great deal of work dnring the fortnight and i felt he would enjoy the trip and i was glad to have his society we saw the marquis and marchioness tney seemned very happy and the documents excluding the marrinae settleraent were executed before our departure for lison the dowager marchioness was believed to be in paris and i suggested to the marquis to let her inow be was there he wrote but the dowager was not in paris but in gloucesbtershire the maru and marchioness saw us oft from tho station to lisbon as we were leavmig the station mr robins said that he had dis covered that colonel townshend was in paris at the champs elysees and they must avoid him as far as possible on our return we found the miarquis and mlarchionas had gone to nviesbaden an it waraged that we should pay them a visit weowenttbereand found there were some little disagreements between them probably the resut of temper o onoe side or the other and we attempted to composo them at wiesbaden the marquis was asked to sign a power of attormey to mr robins and mlsolf for the purpose of looking after his ateairs during his absence as it was contemplated that they might be awa some time as mr robins had been appomted agent i thought it would bo wiser and more bunesslike that i shod have a voice m thomatter before all business matters had been conclnded i declined to take the power of attorney alone the power vas executed and we returned to england as domestic matters have been referred to i ought to say that a little difference arose between the mfarquis and the marchioness when i was there mr robins and the marquis and i went out and stayed out till  oelock and the marchioness was annoyed because she had ashed her husband not to go or to takeher thatwas the only difference between them at that visit we discssed taking a house in london and eventnally i suggested to them  brookstreet the negotiations resulted in lord townshend taking  brookstreet at an annual rental of �s as a furnished house with the right to con tinue the tenancy for four or five years the rent was payablo in advance i paid half and lord towashendnail ln returning from uiesbaden to london the party including my wihe and second daughter stayed at brussels for two or three dacs i had gone to lisbon again wvhile there i received telegrams nsking me to return immediately they were remarkable telegrams and i wired to mr robms asking him to go to brssels to ascertain what was happening i returned immediately and met my family m paris at the hotel continental they informed me that they had had mysterious visits from strangers at their hotel inquiring for lord townsbend the visitors were not known to lord townshend or any member of my family thoy had also had anonymous telegrams asking lord towvshend to return alone immediately and particularly i understood without his wife they became very suspicious  and in tho end i discovered that mr robins wished to have lord owashond in london for the purpose of signing the notices to the tenants before term day in order to have a revision of his rents the mysterious part was asking hin to go without his wife lord and lady towmshend afterwards returned to london and went to i brookstreet a few days afterwards i saw mr robins wvith lord towanshend mr robins sruggested he should like lord townshend to pay him a visit at brighton i said it wvas a reasonable thing that he should go and see his old friends hie wgent to brighton and returned on the tuesday or wiednesda y afternoon imme diately after his return there wias a maarked difference in his conduct and temper and i ascertained fromn him that mr robins and mfrs robins and miss rtideda le hsd discussed the wh
