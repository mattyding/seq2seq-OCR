representing all the shipping associations of the kingdom they wre not animated in their criticisms by any hostile feeling either to the department to the chief of the depart ment or to the billlorda hverclydn messrs g and j burns glasgow said they merely wished to cooperate with the board of trado in putting the bill into what they considered to be a more workable form they would like to have one bill and have done withit andnothavanothermerchat shipping bill for many years he hoped that the clause under which the board of trado were going to see that foreign skips were dealt equally with british ships in regard to eguipment and load line would be resolately carried out the clause maing it necessary that seamen should understand english vas not workable as it at present stood when it was borne in mind what the term seaman  coveredmr lloydgfoitgli have guarded agaimst tlht in the bill i say that nothing in this section shall apply to british sabjects or inhabitants of any british pro tectorate or to any lascar so that the best coast of africa will be in the same categorymr w l raes  glasgow chairman of the clyde district of the shipping federation said that although they did not look upon the bill as a whole with any adverse feeling theg had grave misgivings with regard to some of the clauses he hoped the president would not take offence when he said that it seemed to him that the fuil intention of the bill wsw to make the em ploymentofforeignerass diimcultaspossible when vessels were competing in all parts of the world there waa bound to be a very lrge number of foreigners employed in the ships that number was increased a good deal by the desertion of english seamen desertion being one of the greatest evils that shipowaers had to deal with he thought clause  should be so amended as to give more protection to the shipowner for what with food scales repatriation and so on in one bill and compensation in another bill he did not know bowit was going to be possible for thlem to conduct their buesinssmr cutirsn laws london general manager of the shipping federation said tbo effect of part  of the bill was to hand over mav important matters to the tender mercies of the burecrascy which was nioiously designated in the bill as  the proper officer  and  the proper authority he contendad that the bueaucracy set up in the bill vws not competent to discharge its duties for though he did not wish to reflect on the con sulat srch duties were generally performed vy the vice consuls or their clerklsmr lloydgeougyou do not wish to alter the authority

the bill it seemed a ery simplo request to make if he might go a little further he should sav that it would have been a very good thing if in tbe flsrt session of parliament shipowners bad been leftalone  e could not help thinking the government would have been a little moro wise if they bad considered the shipowners before they brought in the billir lronggonosparden mewre bad mrcuthbert

secretary of the liverpool shipowners association  in dealing with clause  ns to desertion asked that th amounts due to seamen who had deserted should be pooled and that if there was a loss in respect of one rnan in consequence of the large expense which the desertion involved and there ws a saving in the caso of another man the balance only of the saving should be paid to the board of trademtr lmothgkonombat supposing afterwards a seaman is able to prove to the satisfaction of the proper authority that it was not a dehierate case of desertion how do yon meet that case mlfr wegnuarasby preserving his right against the shipownermkr lloyrgeorge in reply said ha had been very much impressed with some of the points that had been raised but there was one general observation he would like to make lie frankly admittod that in some respscts the bill increased the burdens of the shipowners but it was a great delight to him that there s no effort nade on the part of thoso present as large employers of labour to restrict at least seriously tse conditions in respect of food and accommodation which the bill afforded he conratulated them on the spirit with which they had received that he mrust ask them to bear in mind that that was not altogether a onesided biul there were points which were distinctly favourable to tho shiporvmers he would ask them to bear in mind that this year they had also benefited the shipowner in anotber respect bv improving the loadline regulations hear bear they were not altogetber harasing the shipowners and they were bearing in mind the difculties they had in facing foreign compotitiondicfilties which were increasing from year to year but the shp owning community was holding its own against the rest of the world germans it was true vere corepeting in solne branches  but it ws a verv remarable feet thst wvith all their competition in spite of all the assistance they got from their government their shipping did not repro seat onefifth of the shipping of our country nhe germans were not free from governmeht inter vention wphether they would be able to resist it much longer he could not tell  but he was perfectly certain that there was an inreeasing pressure on thre germans rather to follow the exaplo of this country in the improvement of the accommodation the food and also the conditions wbich tended to safety of life at sea to some of the points that had been raised he should have to give careful consideration and that applied topart  for which tho solicitorgeneral  very largely responsible and therefore it vould be a matter for consultation bie thought that on one or two of the points raised by mr weightmean and mr beeburn on tbat part of the bill something wolld have to be done ve was of opinion that theywould have to consider that before the report stage aqs srived at and he should like the assistance of mr rbum sand one ortwo other gentleman before fially considering the i amendrments on part  hear hear the same tbing anplied to mr cnthbert lawss incisive remarks on the competent authoritv although mr laws could not sug gest a better authority than they had at their disposal at the present moment he mr lloydgeorge agreed that the consulate might be improved and without pass ing any reflection on any individual consulate ho thoughta good deal could be done to improve their represets tion in that rspoct in all parts of the world he thon t he might tell them that steps were being taken vith thgt object in view they were inconsultationwith the foreign office and he hoped that good might result ron the new arrangements he thong t the case made aby ir wv j chambers as to the vrovisions on board ship as aboso lutely irresistible aird he thought he might promise that they would accept tho suggestion made by mr charbers in tiat respect hezr hear lord nmbmxnholres suggestion ws that the navy scale should be adopted that was considered very carefully by them and also by lord st bliers committee upon which the shipovnerwere fully represented they recommeded x cerisin food scale which the government bad adopted in the main the only differencee they mado wgas in favoutr of the ship owners therefore he thought any criticiss on it ougt rather to have emnated fron the seamen they had been criticized very seveely for departing from tle scale which was recommended by that committee but on the whole they felt perhaps they ought to proceed gradually he did iot think it would be possble to apply the navy rules to the mercantile marine snd he was told thzt on the wbole having retard to the qunlity that vms supplied in the nay if they compelled the mercantile m not saeml to adopt the scale but the quality s well they wld be losers he did not think they had treated them badly as far as the scale was concened and he was glad to find a disposition on the part of the shipownern to adopt that be thought the objections as to certificated cooks were due to a not very carefnl srutinyof the provisions of th bill he saepted the sugges tion as to the language test that were a man bad passed the test a certif cate should be given him so that beaheuldwoald be unwis to begin to mnae distinntio as td dieret nations the term iflcaxs  used as s sort of genericten meaning oxientals nat was the desnitiontthatwasunderstood thereow a good deal in the suggestion that ï¿½ should ba inserted ilk claso  because he thought there should als some otbsr instrument in the shipowners hlnds otherwise there would be a prnamin on deserion hear hear there was one point to which he attached mucohimportance under the bill they were going to set up an advisory committee andali criticism would be submitted to the advisory conmittee bfora adoption oneortwo speanrons had rather comnplained that they hd not tawn the shipowners it oorltation he did not think tbat complaint wa utiel beforei the bhillw evrfrmomed he took the rather irusnsa coausfor a cabitet minister of tsking into

which would ultimately become useful t the mercantile marine of the country
