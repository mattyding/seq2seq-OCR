high court of justicechancery divisionbefore m jusnce knexwiceward iocn and co limited v johin longthis was n action for ain injunction to restrain the publication and sale in volume form of a story called  the lost viol both the plaintiffs and the defendant are wellknown publishers and the question in dispute was whether the plaintiffs or the defendant were or was entitled to the copyright it appeared that ir al p shiel the author of the novel in question submitted through his agentmr watt a synopsis of the story to the plaintiffs and an agreement by letters in december  was come to by which tle plaintiffs agreod to purchase the copyright in volume fonn of tha storv which was to consist of  words for the sum of � of which � was subsequently paid to mr shiel dut when the words of the story came to be counted it was found to consist of not mom than about  that being so the plaintiffs refused to pay the remaining t the balance of the purchase money whereupon mr shiel treated the contract as void and sold the volume rights of the story for the sum of  to the defendant who at t dte knew nothing of the agreement between the phlinties and mir shiol on may   the defendant paid to mr shiel the sam of i as a purchaser in good faith of the volume rights and mair shicl gave to the defendant a receipt and guaranteed in the usual way that tae story was in no ay a violation of ana existing copyright tho book was published on august  s and on the following day the plaintiffs were duly registered as prorietors of copyright under the copyright act  the plaintiffs elaimad to bh the owners of the complete copyright in ihe beol the main line of defence wasthat theplaintillsas publishers employed lr shiel to compose the story by wsy of commission and that the purchaso pries of � bad not been paid to tr shiel and thaerefore under section  of the copyright act  the copyright had not passed to the plaintiffsmr stewart smrith sc and r ilostron appeared for the plaintiffs  and mr ingpen kc and mr warwicl h draper represented the defendantmn jusvrc ktnnwica in dlivcring judgment said that when called upon to decide questions of copyright he frequently felt inclined to echo thea words of imrdlet  cursed spite that ever i was bom to set it right  the question in this case was one of great iimportance to a large class of persons every author and every publisher ws interested in the question now before the court the arguments had disclosed sevenil difficult points upon which thero was little or no authority and which bad not been sufaiciently consadered and whiich deserved further attention tinde those circiunstances his lordshin tro posed to taie the iniusual course of not deciding anatfiing definitely at present but to give his impressions some o whisch were strong ones and then to adjonren tha case for further arglument it adneared that mr shiel was the anther of az book called   that mwen do taking the wellknown words of mark ntony as his title tint vwork was purchased by the plaintifs for � ir shial then proposed to bring outanothernovel of which ho sub mitted a synopsis to the plaintiffs and the plain tfs areed otaike it on the terms of the last transaction if hr shiel had accepted that offer manv of the present difficulties would have been avoided hle did not how ever accept it and on the same day decomber   the plaintiffs made another ofer by fetter which wms that the plaintilfs wouldpayv  fortho complete copyright of the story containing not less than  words that letter said nothing about series or volume but only complete copyright that second offer nwas accepted by mer watt the aeut of mr shiel in a letter of decem ber   therewas aecndition tlht some of the money should be paid in advance but that was complied with and in the result thee as a clean acceptance of the oller the contract was that the plaintifs should have the complete copyright and the cmuscridtwas dulvdelivered was that an assigunent strictly speaking it was impossible in law to assign anything which did not exist as for instance a legacy which some one had promised to bequeath by will on tbo other hand yon might have an agreement to assign and that was good however impro bable it might be that the thingassigred would ever come into existenco a familiar example of that was the ordinary covenant to settle afteracquired property ina settlement still that was not an assignment though it mnight be enforced in equity whenever the thin assigned came into existence the question was ought the courttoconstruean assignmentof copyright on those lines  ls lordship thought not an agreement to assign copyright if in writing might bo an assignment of copyright the difficulty was to say whether it was in itself necessarily an assignment the act of l con templated a different view between author and publisher that wasshown by section  that section was difficult to construe and the main difficulty arose from the refer ence to employment by a publisher the section con templated tho employment of some author wvhat was the meaning of  employment   there was no anthority on the point some meaning muist bo given to it and it must be distinguished from assignment it seemed quite possible to regard the contract in the present case as an employment it might be employment of the assignee by the assignor could an agrcement to assign something not in existence be an employment that was the great difficul ty of the section as regarded this case other points arose on the section it awas smid that the words  or any book wvhatsoever vhich were to be found in thelst part of thesection had been dropped ot of the latter part bat there could be no doubt that on the proper construction of the section there ws pro cisely the same language as bcefore end the words  any booki whatsoever  were included then the section ssidi that the yuhlisber shonld have the copyright of every volume  so composed and paid for wnhat was the result  it had been decided by the house of lords that yen did not want an agreement in writing the agree ment to look for was an agreemnent on teams that the copyright should belon g to the publisher if yon found that then the copyright would belong to the uiblisher wvhen the wori was composed and p aid for s one of the terms was to pay for the co vrigoht the copyright did not pass until it wavs paid for that wavs the meaningt of the section if the contract waus for employment had it been paid for  some dispute had arisen as to the length of the book and it ws �said that it waus too short by someo  words if however the plaintiffs wvere now to pay the balance of � tho condition wvould be fulfilled and the result would be that the defendant would take nothing if the contract ws anassignmentthen it ws an easlgumuat of the comupiste copyright and the plaintiffs would be enltitled to succeed if employment then the wror had not been paid for but that could becared bytueubs geatmn tha qustion eireatrstt
