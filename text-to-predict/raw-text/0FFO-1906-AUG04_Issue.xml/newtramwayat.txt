secretary of the congress of arce ological societies whose address is castlehill guildford has forwarded the following letter to the prime mdinister by direction of the congress of arcelological societies in union with the society of antiquaries of london i have the honour to send you the following resolution unanimously passed at their meeting held on july   under the presidency of lord avebury  that this congress regrets that tho govern ment has not cartied out tbhprovisionsoftheancient monuments protection act for the appointment of an inspeotor various monuments have beenplacedtmder the act on the faith that the provisions of the bill would be obseved the congress therefore urges that an in speoctor of ancient monuments should be appointed in accordance with the act i have been mqaested to say funther that the congress quite recognizes the desire of the government in the arangemenets that have been made to protectthe ancient monurments that have already been banded over to the ease of the nation and it has no intention of questioning either the zeal orabllity of the official entrusted wvith the duties i am instructed how ever to point out that it vws intendod by the bil that the inspector shonld be a man of independent position able to devote muzch attention to the duties of the office and that these were intended to include not merelythe care of such mnonmnents as wnre nad in the oact but en offizisl atatus which would enable him to intervene for the praser vation from destruction of other similar mon meats the experience of the committee of the congrs formed for recording eartworks shows that suh cninspector might be of the grytest service in preservig froma destruction those importnt relics of the pc st it is obvious that duties of this description cannot be adequately discharged by an offiial in governmenteiploy who has otherhimportcnt dties to fi midnwho doesfet possess the ahrttl contemplated in themactn aisrland iorovided ty nthe
