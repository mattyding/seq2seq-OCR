british assoctioliyore aie much work of good quality has been done in the sectionstoday in the mathematical and physical section a discussion was opened by professor soddy on the possible transmutation of the elements the crowded room bore testimony to the importance and interest of the debate and the time proved inadequate for the discussion although all the papers were postponed the statement that the prodnction of helium from radium has established the fact of the gradual evolution of one element into others vas not seriously questioned but the impossibility was recognized of effecting a change from one element or ore metal to another owing to the amount of energy required in the geographical section mr clement reids paper on coast erosiotl evoked an interesting discussion

delivered a lecture on volcanoessection cgeolooythis years president of the section mr g w lamplugh chose for the subject of his address yesterday the question of the british glacial drifts with special reference to the interglacial problem in discussing the diversity of opinion existing on the sub ject of  interglacial  periods he emphasizedi the unsatisfactory character of most of the evi dence brought forwaid in this country in support of the  interglacial  hypothesis and avoiding a positive conclusion suggested that the solution of the problem would be facilitated if the elabo rate schemes of classification that have been pro pounded were set aside and thewhole subject reconsidered on its meritsin the ourse of his addres mr lamplgh said that one of the most important points on which there had been and still was wide difference of opinion among glacial geologists both in this country and abroad was with regard to the valne of the evidence for interglacial periods and it wonld be his aim in bringing forward some general conclusions regarding the drifts to concen trate attention principally urpon this evidence to keep the discussion within practcable limits he assumed tho former extension of icefields over the glaciated areas it was now he thought agreed by all who accepted this proposition that the icesheets of the glacial period though of vast estent had their northerm as well as their southem limits the original idea that they represented the outer portion of a polar icecap having been dis proved by more extended rescarches in the more northerly part of our hemisphere moreover it bad been found that these icesheets bad their origin in tho coalescence of masses which spread outward from separato areas of accunmnlation acting more or less independently so that the individual sheets did not all attain their farthest bounds at the same time but this recognition of inde pendent centres of glaciation had given sharper promi nence to the question whether the glacial deposits were to be regarded as the product of a single epoch of glacia tion or whether they represented successive epochs of this innd separated by intervals during which the great icesheets temporarily vanishedtire ldrsngocmn hxrarsomas opinion stood at present probqbly most geologists leaned to the idea that the glaciation was interrapted by at least one interglacial epoch during wlich tho cliniate of any particular latitude became not iess warm and per haps wanner then it nw was this was the interglacial hypothesis in its simplest farm but it had been fre ventlypcinted out that the criteria depended upon ine rerognition of warm interglacial conditions could not be all assigned to the samne horizon since they recurred at different positions in the drift series hrence it had been claimed that two three four or even five inter glacial epochs with a corresponding number of separate cpochs of glaciation might be recognized in the glacial sequenco in opposition to these views of every deroe a zmaller number of glacialists urged that there was no proof of even a single absoluto interraption of the glacial conditions fromsthe beginning to the end of the period this radical diference of interpretation respecting tile constitution of the glacial period assumed the greater consequence in that it bore directly upon many questions other than those which were strictly geological thus the antecedents mad distribution of our present fauna ana flora and the time and conditions of thit momentous event the appeaanrce of man in northern europe were deeply involved in the issotm baixrs icelomrsir adopting tho hypothesis thatthe basement boulder clay of yorkshire represented the groundmoraino of an icesheet we might consider briefly the probable condi tions umder which this east british icelobe  was accumulated whether the elevation subsequent to the stage represented by the infraglacial beaches was suffi cient to drain off the shallow seas around our islands was uncertain but it must at any iate have restricted their area and rendered them still shallower and it was un likely that there was then anv southward connexion of the north sea with the english channel the climate by this time hadbecomo such thatpemnanent snovweaps could accumulate in the northern parts of our country at eleva tions not much above present sealovel indeed the climato might have been actually colder at this time than during any of the later phases of the glaciel period and the stage of mavxseui glaciation might have lagged con siderably behind the stage of maisuim temperature under theso conditions with the anowfall on the uplands always slowly drawing away in icestreams to the basins and there accumulating it was inevitable that the enclosed basins wonld eventually become icecovered any open water within them being in time obliterated either directly bv the oncicaching glaciers or indirectly by the packing of bergs and floes until the basins them selves possessed a surface upon which the snowfall could accumulate thus the basius became great reservoirs of ice in which the supplies from the siurrounding uplauds received important augmentation by direct accretion of snowfallreservoirs moreover containing a substance sufficiently rigid not to require retaining walls  so that in time the surface of the ice within the basins rose higher than many parts of the rim the general move ment of the mass within its reservoir then became dependent mainly apon its own confguration nd only secondarily upon the shape of the solid ground these conditions in the north sea basin had their parallel in the basia of the irish sea in which the  west british icelobe  was developed  and on the low interior plain of ireland where the similar though sriiller  ivernian  sheet hela possession the cruz of the interglacial problem so far as the british islands were concerned lay in the on whether these huge reservoirs after their first filling swore completely emptied during the sposed inegaca poch of warmath named by professor ceikie the rgelvetian and vwere afterwards refilled for the later  polandian  glaciation in which on the evidence of the upper boulderclays it was generally agreed that icesheets from the basins again closed in upon the land it was this one interglacial or  middle glcial epoch only that most of the ritishsupporters of the hypothesis had demanded and bad attempted to establish in the east yorkshire sections for his own partalthough he had sought long and carefully for evidence of this great inter glaeial episode inthe y orkshire drifts and at first with the belief that such evidence must surely be somewhere forthcoming he bad not only failed to bring to light any adequate proof of its reality but had noticed many facts vhich he could not explain otherwise tha by recognizn that the icelobe continued to occupythe basino th north sea during the deposition of thea edsclaimed as interglacial though its margin had for a time shrunk considerably within its earlier limits so far as the eastern side of england vas concerned he thought that the epoch of mataauin glaciation vas reached not when tbe east british lobe pressed farthest westvard but when the pennine and north british ice advanced southward along its receding flank  and this stage wns he presnmed equivalent to the p olandian glacial epoch  of professor geikies classification of the glacial and interglacial epochs of professor geilies schemen later than the  polandian  it was admitted that no indication had beean found in yorkshire there seemed on the contmry to be evidence of steady maplioration in tbe climate on the whole he thouglt tbft his review of the t timonr from theojreas which helihad closely investigated would servo to show hoew exta ordinarily elusive was the evidence for even the principal interglacial epoch of the proposed scheml he ventured to claim that in each of these areas all the availablo data eonecrin the superficial deposits woro systematically examined in the feld and conscientiously sifted without prejndice towards one opinion or another yet the ohly sapport which was found for the interglacial hypothesis was from a single section in north lincolithire and althongh in this case the facts gave some encotragement to the idea they could be as readily explained without recourse to it it was especially remarkable that in the range of magnificent coast sections not of these aeas alone but of tho vhole of our islands there was not so far as he was aware a single known occurrence of fossiliferous land deposits peaty or otherwise inter bedded with boulderclama and we had therefore to depend entirely upon much less satisfactory exposures n the interior of the country for evidenco of this kadthis morning in this sectionmir jous panserson read the first paper wich was illustrated by lantern slides on the  postcretaceous stratignaphy of southem nigeria west contral

of the contal province the asaba district on the niger the ijeba district of the western province lagos province and the calabar districtmr parkinson said that he concluded that stratigraphicy the

succeeding elevation many of the most prominent features of the physiography must date they consisted of ferruginous sands sutliciently compact to stand in a vertical cliff occasionally pebbly and falseheaded but characterized principally by the angularity of their quartz grins and the occcurrence of patches of kaolin and fragments of decomposed felapar the beds contained muscovite garnet and

its enormons size it was nearly lour times larger than the largest previously known stone and even so was probably only a portion of a much larger stonegas was evidenced by the fact that several of its bounding surfaces appenred to be planes of cleavagea short discussion took place on these diamonds in which mr iior d sir wmrrzz cnooses piro ysssobl bonmy mr isna mr gregory and mr graintilli

tho north of england his chief results were to show the existence of a defiite break betwoen the lower and upper carboniferons stratawhereas until recently it had been considered certain that the carboniferius strata were unvariablo and deposited within a relatively short time the zones he had found proved faults and unconformities in the physiography of the carboniferous layers and also showed denudation of the lower carboniferous strata in places leaving pockets of lower strata there appeared to have been almost sudden submergence followed by a fresh deposit that covered up both the denuded places and the pockets of the lower carboniferous layers professor garvood added that he had found the freshvater gasteropod paledina at the baso of the carboniferous strata whereas it had never previously been found recorded lower than the oolitesmir t h f oaw gave an oxhibition and description of a remarkable form of sodalite from rajputana which bad the property apparently unique amongst minerals of rapidly changing colour ia bright daylight from carmine to pale grey or colourless and of slowly recovering its carmine coloar when kept in the dark the mineral wvith these peculiar properties was discovered by mr e vredenbarg as a constituent of tho pematitic veins innepheline syenite intruded into the aravalli schist series of kishengarh in rajputana along the same belt the sodalite intargrown vith nepheline in the pegmatite veins was of the common blue variety and nothing un usnal was shown by chemical analvsis of either variety tho carmine colour disappeared as ripidly on exlposure to light in a moist atmosphere as in drv air in the cold weather as rapidly as at higher tempantures and under bright electric light as in daylight the mineral had apparently no effect on a photographic plate and was not noticeably radioactive the reappearance ol the carmino tint took place in a few weeks in some specimens but required some months concealment in the dark in others no explanation had been offered so far to account for this remarkable phenomenonmr a wnaore presented a contribution to our knowledge of the limestone knolls of tho craven lowlands district between the great faults on the northeast and the grit hills of the pendle range on the soulth lie suggested that as the words  knoll  and  reefknoll  seemed to be differently understood by different workers it was desirable to drop the term reefknoll after classifying the types of knolls he observed that examples of all the types occurred on ono welldefined horizon that the knolls were most conspicuous on the margin of the district and that the more massive knolls of white limestone appeared to be due to irregular aggregations of submarine debris and folding and weathering had intensided

anatomy at oxford de livered his address on the  lifehistory of the foraminiferahis subject he said vwas the lifehistory of a group of lowly organisms tho foraminifers which belonged to a division of the animal kingdom standing apart from all othors in the simplicity of the organization of itsmembers the protozoa for the last  or so years the l attention of zoologists had been increasingly given to tho protozoa not only from the interest arising from the particular study of its members but because as a group apart from other animals and from most plants they agforded a point of view from which to judge of the results on fundamental questions of biology obtained in those more highly developed organisms their study bad received a great impulse of late years from the dis covery that like the bactcria and their allies whose action in this respect had been longer recognized many of them wore when they gained a footing in the body the causo of disease in man and other animals an essential step in counteraoting their influence was a knowledge of their lifehistory and mode of attack for the proper estimation and inter pretation of the facts in the lifehistorv of one organism it was of course necessary to be acquainted with its course in allied forms and in other divisions of the class to which it belonged whether the matter was approached from the philosophical or utilitarian side an essential step was to obtain as completely as possible the lifehistories of species belonging to the main groups of protozoa worked out in detail the zoologist who for the last  years had been proeminent in the investi gation of the protozoa was fritz schaudinn whose early death occud last june three years ago pub lished an account which completed the main outlino of their

sand and examining it with a lens it woould be foundthat the whiteness was due in part to fragments of shells of molluscs of one kind or another but in part to the presenco of complete shells of minute size and the most exquisite sbapes microscopically examined tho shells would be found in nearly all cases to bo made up of a cumber of separate compartments or cham bers commnnicating with ono another by ono or nore narrow passages and disposed in some regularly sym metrical plan in some the arrngement was a flat spiral like that of a wvatch spring in others belicoid like a snails shell there was great variety in the plans on which the shells might be built they differed too in texture some were transparent andtheir walls per forated by multitudes of minute pores setting the interior of the chambers in direct communicationwith tho outer world while in others the walls were somiopaque white and glazed liko porcelain and such perforations were absent the shells were composed for the most part of carbonate of lime contained in an orgaic chitinous  mnatrix but in many cases grains of sand were included in the walls the ilanispiral chambered shells presented such a close resemblance to the shell of  nautilus that for a long time notwithstanding their diminutive size many of them were actualuy included in that genusamong tho cephalopo mollusca as knowledge advanced the cephalopoda

were represented in geological deposits right back to the paleozoic period so that in dealing with them we had that third dimension the history of the group in the past wide open to us in which to
