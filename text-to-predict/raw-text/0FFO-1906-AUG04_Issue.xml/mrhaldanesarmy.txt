mhm heaidanks army schemfthe following memorandum by the secrsetmy of state for war on army reorganization dated july   has been issued as a parliamentary paper cd   since i made a statement ou behalf of the govern mnent on the th july there his been much discussion both in and out of parliament upon the subject of army reorganization it will probably be convenient that i should briefly restate the broad principles which underlie the propositions of the govermnment without repeating particulars of reductions already given in some detail the substance of thesa propositions is that incressed economy and increased efficiency are no more in practice mutually exclusive conceptions than they are in logical theory in order to ses whether a reorganization is possible which shall combine the two principles a careful survey has been made of the army as a whole both of the regular and of the auxiliary forces the result has been to show that in the case of the latter in particular they havo grown up haphazard upon no principle and with no definite purposs or function in a whole assigned to their constituent parts as regards the regular army the survey has shown that it contains a larga number of services which are more or less of a civilian nature and which soldiers agree could be efficiently performed in war by civilians who give only a part of their time to military training in peae and yet are willing to take a definite engagement to serve oversen if necessary on mobilization the manning of the ammunition colmns certain transport railway supply clerical medical aad veterinary srvices and much work done by artifdcers eg shoeingsmiths wheel wrights c ara instances to which this principle can be applied the question therefore which aross on the survey was whether it was not possible while reducing the size of the standing regular armyforming as it doss today an organization almost entirely disconnected from the civilian populationto effect at once substantial economy and at tho some time with a part of the money saved to incrense the total number of the persons capable of rendering effective military service to the nation by substituting in many instances vwhat might be called an engagemcnt on a militia basis for an engagerent to devote exclusive time to service with the regular army by giving effect to this principle it is possible not only that the number of regulars available for fghting purposos should be angmented and the organization of an expeditionary force be rendered more efficient but that substantial money savings should also become practicable in some respects the political conditions of the time lend themselves peculiarly to reconstruction on the linesindicated no doubt if the only military problem s how to send reiforcements to the troops in india the policy of having a very small force at home organized for expedtionary purposes and a large anorganized mass of troops out of which reinforcements could be evolved somewhat after the fashion pursued in the war in south africa wonld at least be deserving of consideration even although open to grave objection from the want of cohesion of principle in the organization but the change in theo political circumstances of the day has made it possible for the present to divertexclusiveattention from the northwest frontier of india and to consider other possible contingencies what seems to be a rational principleond it is the principle of the government planis to ascertain by way of commencement what number of regular troops it is necessary to retain at home in peace for the purpose ofnding drafts for the forces of the crowvn overseas and then to organize oat of themwell within a marginas completo an expeditionary force as possible adeflnite number of regalar troops being for the reason above indicated necessarly maintnined at home to organize them in the form of an expeditionary force is to obviate waste both of money and of men for thissingle force will thus serve two purposes for reasons upon which i will not enter at present this object vill in the opinion of the government and of its military advisers be most surely attained by aadering to the socalled cardwelu system drafts for the troops overseas may be found either through the medium of depts or of training battalions whichever mode is adopted the same amount of drafts is necessary the cardwell system makes the training battalion serve two purposesit provides drafts in peace and the same battalion can od mobilization by means of reservists be transformed into a firstclass fighting unit where world wide duties have to be performed battalions mobilized in this fashion appear to the great majority of the expert military advisers of the government to be greatly pre ferable to the battalions of an independent shortservice armycomposed largely of inexperienced and partialltrained reservists who must necessaily be quite inferior to seasoned men who have already gono througha sub stantial period of service abroad t is on this very principle that the expeditionary force itself is moulded as a whole in these proposals to fulfil the double function of draft finding in time of peace and of readiness for war on mobilization on mobilization the necessity tor finding drafts for foreign garrisons of course ceases auto matically as men are not then sent homo to go to the reserve combining the two principlesfirst that the size of the expeditionary force is the ontcome of wvhat it is necessary to kieep at home in time of peace to supply drafts to the overseas forces and secondly that for those who are not destined immediately to occupy thefrtcombatantsmainlybatof lane and for ethers whose services are mi nly of a civilian character training on a militi basis is suficienta definte conception of the organization of the army can be fra the general staff have taken the forces which we are compelled to maintain at home in peace in order to provide drafts for our forces abroad and applying the principles above laid down have worked out the proper organization of this mas of troops for war as a result we should if the governments proposals receive effect be in a position to readily mobilze for service oversea a force consisting of four cavalry brigades and six divisions each of three brigades with the necessary troops for lines of communication or ronghly  officers and men of these about  will be regulars servin with the colours about d will be reservistsd about g men employed and trained on a militia basis thefigures in the appendixgiveinanapproxi mate fashion the details of such a forcean army so organized would be in point of numbers available for taking the field overseas nearly  per cent stronger than any expeditionary force which we have hitherto attempted to organize it is possible to organize such a force with a smaller peace establishment of regular troops and with reduced expenditure but only upon the footing that the existing militia aud anv other troops we raise on a militia basis can be diverted from functions now superseded to the aid and support of the expeditionary force and with a view to this can be got to take engagement for service oversesintimeofwar this is how it is possible to make reductions in the regular or standing army and yet to icrease the strength and efficiency of the national army as a whole the new arrangements proposed by the gover ment are of coumrse so far only in fiai but negotiations ae now proceeding with representatives of the various elements in the auxilisry forces which are reuied to complete the organization in the case of the artillery there is at present such a deficit of both officers and men that to mobilize  field batteries with theirammunition coluns we should be obliged practically to destroy the remaining  batteries in the united kingdom lif the existing system of  years colour service with  years in the reserve wrem retained for the artiuery as has been suggested a large reserve it is trne would have been pro duced by the year  but there are inhrent in this system two danges against which no provision has been made the one is that the a years men will not reengage in sufacient numbers to provide tho drafts required for india and the colonies the second is that a part at al events of a reserve consisting of men who remain for  years without any pro vision being made for thei training and who have never had any actual experience with the latest type of gun may not prove as efficient as conld be desired for the purposes of vwar moreover such a system makes no pro vision whatever for officer of whom the artillery is as short today as it is of men it is proposed therefore to form the militia garrison artillery oficers and men as field gulnser into a reserve section of the royal regi ment of artillery which will then be sufficiently large to mobilin in onlorsmitv with modxn standarda ilot onlyall the field artillery eadmres of the expeditionary force including  field batteries but certain reserve vatteies as wsellil it is not the desire of s maj tys government to break up or destroy more than is avoidable the existing organzation of the auzilinry forces for instance the now mwita field artillerama will lthoueh forming au ntegalpartofth royal begiment retain their tori toral connexion and be tmined in their units and with their officers senior and junior as at presentsimilarly the iilitia infatry battaions althougb drawn closer to the regular battalions of the territotal regiments of which they form part wil still be trained as units what is hoped for is that it will be possible to send them abroad in their units to render such service as may be required of them the leading military authorities are agreed however that it would be vrrong to give a pledge that they shall never be asked to gc abroad otherwise than in battalions national necessities may arise paramount to every special interest and it is therefore right that there should be reserved at least for possible exercise a power to make tha same call upon these battalions as is often made on regular battalionsa that is to say to send out companies with coman officers to join another battalion of their territoria regiment i need hardly however add the observation that the last thing the government desircs is to revert to the old svstem under which zdilitiabattalions were ruined by being bled white of their best officers and men beforibeing called on as units to take the field to obviate the necessity for this and to make provision for the main tenance of the regular battalions a depot battalion will on mobilization be formed foreach territorial regiment from which drafts to replace the wasto of war may be furnished there is good reason to believe that the rmperial yeomanry are prepared to adopt a niew and more ins portent part in the national military organization and tc accept even thongh the rwesult may be that their nambers may somewhat diminish liability for service overseas in time of war they viu train if this proposition is carried out in their own units and with their own officers withaviewto assoming fanctions inthe expeditionary force which in the opinion of the general staff may weu be entrusted to corlls which will become a second line of cavalryis the question of providing officers and an efficient reserve of offlcers is ofgreat importance and urgency there is at present an alarming defciency in the number of officers required on mobilization and no serious attempt lsas hitherto been made to deal with this it seems clear that no single avenue is sufficient along which to proceed in search of additional office for some time past the whole matter has been under close consideration and it is hoped that it vill be practicable shortly to make propositions which may lead not only to the establish meat of a reserve of ofcers for the army generallv bat to the filling up of the numerou vacancies in the officers tanks of many branches of the service notably of the militia so far the organization of an expeditionary force for service overscas is all that has been under considera tion to mobilize such a force and to znako provision to meet the wastage of wrar during the earlier stages of a senous campaig practically the whole of thelregular troops in the united eingdom and a large portion of the lilitia and yeomanry as well would be required the amount of support and expansion we could hope to get from these sources would therefore be strictlv limited in quantity but suppose we were engaged ina warof great severity and of prolonged existence what provisios is made for further support and for expansion if neces sary the answer under present circumstanes is that provision is deficient so that it would be necessary should events like those of the sooth african war recur to ins provise both support and expansion a process alwaysighly unsatisfactory what the government now aims at doing is to hring the army nearer to the people in the localities and get over this difficulty first by giving full effect to the scheme of territorialization initiated bv mfr gladstone and mr cardwell and secondlv bv encouraging the people to adapt the volanteer porces which they have raised somewhat haphazard for the definite functions o support and expansion support should take the form of an organization which will enable the expeditionary force to leave theseshores certain that the naval fortresses and the points on the coast line which require garrisons would be adequately manned from volunteer sources and further that sufficient forces drawn from the volunteers would bs available to repel raids but to enable them to fulfil such functions the volunteers must be more com pletely and more scientifically organized for war than they are at present and the general staff keeping the objects of support and expansion in view are now pre paring a scheme for giving the volunteer force a real war organization the effect of an organization of this nature when fully developed should go far towards meeting present requirements becuase it is certain that if the mind of the nation is concentrated on the defence of its own interests it will if it is made possible for it by adequate preparation to do so pour out in case of necessity very substantial numbers to the expansion as well as the support of the expeditionary armv this appears to bea truer method of expansion nof onyin these islands but throughout the empire as a whole than either an enormous standing army or an attempt at im posing legal obligation on men to go abroad ft must never he forgotten that the real puspose for which we might require men mainly defence of our frontiers across the seas is wholly different from the home defence necessities of continental nations experience has shown that centralized forms of administration are not suitable for the purposes of citizen forces raised on a voluntary basis conditions which suit one district and one corps have a most detrimental effect elsewhere moreover centralization tends to stifle local effort for a citizen organization local assistance is necessary not tn supersede those duties of command and training wheichas in the regular army must always remain in the hands of brigade and divisional com mandersand ultimately of the genernl omicers com mandinglachief but for the pmrpose of obtaining not onlv the men but the facilities for rifle practice and manceuvrrng wvhich can only be got readily if in each county those wrho control possible rifle ranges and manceuvring grounds are interested in an organization in which they take pride as being in a large measure theis own accordingly the govermment is considering the practicability of handing over certain business relating to territorial forces to coanty associations so formed as to be reauy representative of local feeling and of making them responsible for the civil administration of the volunteer forces locally raised and maintained besides managing the affairs of the local voluntees forces such associations might serve a most useful pur pose in fostering rifle clubs cadet corps and other semi military bodies which would be afflliated to the local forces it is to be hoped too that they will be in a posi tion to assist recruiting for the regular army that they will help those who have served their country abroad to obtain employment when they leave the colours and that they will generally look after arry interests in their own districtsbriefly the associations should do much to develop local interest in tho military forces of the crown as a whole and through them adequate machinery should id time be produced for dealing systematically with the patriotic efforts of the nation to help the army in time of war the want of any such machinery was keenly felt in the earlier stages of the south african campaign to sum up the governments proposal is that effort shall in future be mainly concentrsted on the production of an expeditionary force immediatelv available for nse overseas in war with a territorial organization behind capable of supporting and expandin it the expeditionary force and its immediate supports will be administered directly by the militarv anthorities the territorial part of the national army by countv associa tions the command and training of all forces will be is the hands of the general officers commandinginchief the schemes which wil l form the basis of their organiza tion in peace and of their auotment in uar wi be prepared by the
