claimant appealedmr hohler and mr josephsappeared for tho appellant mr j b matthews was for the plaintiffsyesterday the majority of the courtlord justiee vaughan williams and lord justice llomerallowed the appeal lord justice cozenshardy dissentingonrd justice vaughan wnzaas smid that the case was an unusual one and far from easy to decide the question was whether a bill of sale given to secure a loan was a good bill of sale or not if the security included a chattel interest in land it was not arguablo but that the bill of sale was void but if on the other hand it included only personal chattels it was a good bill of sale the decision of the divisional court seemed to his lordsein in substance to be based on  coehrane v entwistle qbd  in that case however there could be no doubt but that the bill of sale dealt wvithn interest in land of the nature of a chattelreal and it vwas not an aathority in the present case at all because in the present case the vhole question was whether on the true con jstructioa of the bill of sale an interest in land es distinguished from an interost in chattels was given as part of the secnri in coestruing this bill of sale it as necessary to look at the bill of sale as a whole to ascertain what was the intention of the grantor and the grantee ss expressed in the document it xas argued that the inclusion of these title deeda in tho schedule showed that the intention of the paties really was to give the grantee a charge on the land to vwhic the deeds related iw the f kebad gone to a court of egttd snaiked toimve tbis docunent dealt wtith by ion or otherw  as creating an equitable cbsrge on the land thei wod have been a complete answer to the claim that loohing at the words ot the document it was manifest that the intention of both gam�or and grntee was not to create a charge npon the land but simply to create a security upon tbe subjectmatter of the chazge itselone consequncce of this bill of sale bein treated in equity ns a charge upon the and would have been that the grantee could have got an order for sale but it was quite smnecesssry for the vantee to getany orderfor sale becanse the doclmnnnt mn question contained anepress power forthegantee to sell that which was intended o be tbe sjecttter of the sectrity after theexpization of five days from theateofseizure or taking possession an argument had been basd on the fact that the grantae had taen possession of the deed and it was said that the takingpossession s eont porneo wt h tha bill of sale blnt there w no evidence of the ciustances in which thiss don and it could not affect the construction of the document of course if it had been said thnt the document did not represent the real transection between the paties this fact vould have been most material but no snch case had been made tnen it vas said that the document ought not to be read in this way becanse a lease was so far realty that the assignment of this lease and other neniments ought to be rend as intended to give an interest in land that might have been a strong argument if it had been a true proposition of law that documents of title could not be severed from the land which waithe subjectmatter of those documents but the decison in bartonv gainer  shandns was in his lordships opinionan authority to the coatrary taking all thesa matters into consideration his lordship was of opinion that the decision of the divisionad court could not be supported and that the appeal mnst be allowedload juscec roma delivered judgment agreeing with lord justice vaughan williamslod juaicr cozzzshamtay mid that he agreed with the other members of the court in thaankg cornsel for their argmnent but that he was afraid that his agreement ceased there he thought that the decision of tho divisional court was ight and that the bill of sale vas void becauso it included something which was not a personal chattel his lordship proposed to deal with the qutestion upon the constraction of the document iself if itwas a fct that the deeds were handed over contemporaneously with the execution of the bill of sale it was strong evidence that the transaction was not that which wvas disclosed by the bill of sale but he put that on one side in the first place this tmnsaction uas a loan it vws an assignment of the things described in the schedule byway of security for money lent and there was a power to seize and take the property comprised in the schedule among the items in the schedule vas this assignment of a lease and the mmrimentes therein referrod to the schedule did not deal vwith pieces of parch ment of no value except e curiosities but by the billof sale the ovner of thela gave a licence to the lender to get possession of thesr deeds as security for ahis loen if s borrower ave an authority to a lender to go to his  kakers and taye his title deegs as semity for a loan his lordship thought that it was clear that that would be regarded in equity as a good charge upon the land to which the deeds related he thought it vwas stmining credulity in the present eso to suppose that these title deeds were to be regarded as mere parciuet and vwx and it seemed to him an irresistible conclusion that they wete dealt wvith for the purapose of giving a security on the land after default made in his lordships opinien the lender could have obtained a legal mortgage on the land in the court below refianco had been placed on the easo of coebhme v entwistle supra but his lordship nreed with lord justice vaughan williams i that that decision was of no assistance in the present case he would have thought that that ease was too obvious for argument and it was verv different from i the present one in his orneion the decision of the divisional court in tho dresent case was right
