the r ready to fly toindiadelarture tonigrtit is expected that r  will begin her flight to india by wvay of the mediter ranean and egypt this evening close examination of the oilcooler wlhielh broke down on lher tiial during wednesday nighlt has shown that the fault was not due to any fundamental defect the cooler has been replaced and the engines theimiselves are in excellent condition after the trial the airship will sail with a complement of  including her five officers and crew of  she may be expected to reach egypt early on tuesdaythie actual course betweeni cardington and ismlailia will be determinied in the light of this evenings weather forecast the navigator woould prefer given suit able conditions to take the shortest route to tho mediterrttnean across the centre of france to lyons and down the rhone vlalley to marseilles on this course the distance to isinailia is  miles but the rhone valley is difficult flying country at the best and the tlhreat of thunderstomis would make it an indesirable statt for it long voyage a wide detour in order to ntiss the line of the rhone is possible and woould add  miles to the distance this mllight be taken if local disturbances were reported after the maini cotirse had been settw o other routes have been plotted and they are both longer one would take the airship southiwards to toulouse and then across france to theo mediter ranean passing over narbonne by this route tlle distance to ismyiailia is  miles the remainiag route is  miles long the airship in this case would fly by way of brest into the bay of biscay ancd would not tturn inland until she was south of the pyrenees she wvould then pass over tafalla in northern spain nd out into the western end of the mediter ranean wvith allowances for devition on aecount of local storms wlichl may be met at this time of the year r  will make for the neighbourhood of malta whence her course may be direct to egypt or along the african coast according to the nature of the weather reported avleadweather reportsthrouglhout the fliglht the airship should never be out of touch with one of the five main wvireless stations she is equipped for longwave transmission and for recep tion on both long and short wavelengths until she reaches marseilles or its equiva lent longitude in the mediterranean she wvill receive reports from cardington and will send her sixhourly reports to that station for the next section to longitude deg e the neighboturhood of crete she will be served by the malta station and for the rest of the first half she will be in touch with isniailia wrtheni she resumes the flight after refuelling she will continue to communieate witlh ismailia and at the lhead of the persian gulf responsibility for coimiunieations will be taken over by the karachi stationthis chain of royal air force stations vith the help of the indian government station at karachi will keep the sllip supplied at regular intervals with weather reports so that mr m a giblett superintendent of the airship division of the meteorological office will be able to prepare on board for the guidance of thle navigator weather charts siniilar to those issued by the air ministry warnings of sudden changes or local disturbances in or near the path of the airship will also be given and the chanee of the ships run ning into bad conditions should be very much less than on an atlantic flightthe flight ill be the fist full test of air ship navigation aided by a comprehensive svstem of wveather reporting it is essentially an experinmental flight wvith a new airship over new territory assisted by a meteorological organization which vill be serving a long flight for the first time before her lengthening r  had flown for about  hours since the xvhole series of changes in equipment and in twvo of her engines she has done  hours away from the mast and that trial was handi capped by the failure of an oilcoolerfuel and loadshe will leave the mast tonight with none but official passengers and very few of them she wvill be carrying the equiva lent of a very small pay load a large supply of fuel probably more than shc will need will be carried in order that there may be a fair margin in case of enier gencies it is likely that for this  tmile voyage she will take some  tons of fuel ls compared with  tons taken by r  for the atlantic vovage of about  mniles this indicates one of the economies effected by the heavy oil engines by vhich she is driven oil fuel is estimated to give a range of  per cent more than an equal weight of petrol and while this is reflected in the weight of fuel carried as compared with r  theie is another saving wlhich is not so obvious the cost of oil fuel is about £  ton against £ a ton for petrolfood for the first part of the flight will consist of four days rations weighing b and  gallons of water officers and passengers vwill be allowed b of luggage each and members of the crew lolb apart from the crew she will be carrying a total load of not more than seven tons a very small load for a ship of her size and power restricted deliberately in order that she may be given every chance of a fair test fcor her structure and engines and for the unknown quantities along the route she will be commanded by plightlieutenant h c irxvin witlh squadronleader e l johnston as navigator there will also be on board wing commander r b b colmore director of airship development lieu tenantcolonel v c richmond assistant director of airship development tech nical and maior g h scott assistant director of airship development flying lord thomson secretary of state for air and sir sefton brancker director of civii aviation wvill be among the passengers
