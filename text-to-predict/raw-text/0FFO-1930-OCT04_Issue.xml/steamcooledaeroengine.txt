steamicooled aeroenginesuccessful tests on a faireyfoxthe first aircraft to be equipped in this country with a complete system of steam cool ing of its engine has just successfully completed some rigorous tests the newn method which is the product of two years work has becn evolved by the fairey aviation company anc the aeroplane used for the trial was a fairey fox day bomber this machine is normally fitted with a retractable radiator for engine cooling and the application of steam cooling has reduced the frontal area by allowing this radiator to be removed and is reoorted to have added but little drag to the machinethe condenser is placed on the centre section of the upper plane and is almost covered by the camber of the wing the cooling lins alone protrude beyond it the aeroplane has been given full trials with this arrangement includ ing the usual high speed climbing and aero batic tests the development if it should prove successful in general use will be of some imnortance it will mean a reduction in weight both as to the radiator and its water content in military machines it will mean less risk of damage by bullets which might put an engine out of action by piercing its radiator whereas a bullet hole in a steam condenser would cause only a small escape of steamthis device will probably have an imrortant influence on cooling systems for racing engines in rccent designs onc of the troubles has been to find a arge enoulgh area on a racing aero plane to allowv of ceficient cooling of the watermrs ethel nove of nwewstead elmavenue eastcote was fined Â£ with five guincas costs at the llarylebone policeconrt yester day for travelling on the metropolitan railway from easteote to bakerstreet with intent to avoid payment of the fare
