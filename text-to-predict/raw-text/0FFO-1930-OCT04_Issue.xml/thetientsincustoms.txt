llig governmlent finallicialt circles by tlle reeeipt of a telogarn froinr lenox simpson putnaim l eale custoimis coiii miissioner at tientsir tinder the northern governmuent aivill notice that if  pavable iionitlilv by thel ministrv of finance for the miaintenancee of the governmiuent uniiversities at pekingis not paid forthwvithi lie will deduct the l amount fromi the portion of the customs revenue lvllich is remitted periodically to shanghaiit should be stated that customiis erellue is treated in slhanghai as of two categories the original  per cenit treaty duties wlhicl are held in the namle of the inspectorgeneral and are au re cquired for the service of the foreign and the prenanking domestic debts  and  the additional duties arising from the new tariff vihich practically doubles the old cluties all of which are at the disposal of the govermiienit and are used partly for the services of the nankiing loans and partly for administrative purposeslvlien the inorth threatened to take over the tientsin customs the main point atissue wvas the preservation of the integrity  of the foreignrmanaged administration all parties interested especially the chlinese banks have always regarded thecustoms service as something to be held  inwviolate so wlhen yen hsishan an  nounced that he was determined to stop the flow of revenue from the great port ntider his control to the excihequer of liisopponents it was obviously for the general i benefit to retain the staff at tientsin and to make an arrangement about the revenue yen was acreeable to keep the staff and to remit the  per cent portion for the foreign loans and to place the whole of the balance in safe custody so that neither side could touch it umtil the war wvas over unfortunately the nan king governmient confident of the ability of thieir armies to vanquish yen and his allies in quick time refused all compromise and ordered tile coommllissionier at tientsin with all the staff to withdraw if as wvas little expected yen used force wvhen yen did act the staff duly retired whereupon mr simpson took clharge and recruited a newv staff out of the hedgerowscapital for militariststhe consequences are significant col  lection of duty continues as before andthough not quite up to the previous year  averages over a million taels mnonthlv of  whieh about half is remitted to shanghaifor the foreign loans yen being concerned not to alienate foreigners but the balance vlliclh might have been placed in chan cerv is taken by the northern leaders and usecito fight nanking shanghai has been affected adversely for an order to collect in shanghai the duties on goods destined for tientsin has resulted in the loss of the transshipmiient business as it wvas impos sible for traders to pay at shanglhai and again at tientsin to mr simpson foreign goods are now shipped direct to tientsin and w here transshiprnent cannot be avoided it is usually done at japanese portsthie most unfortunate feature of the situation is the fact that it has been shown to the militarists of this distracted caontov that the customs is no longer taboo and that any general who consti tutes himself master at anv point wherethe government of the day cannot easily  get at him mav put his oown man into i the local custom house and take the money without anything happening formerly any such action would have been followed by the advent of angry foreign gunboats but nowvadays the ponwers leave tile protection of the customs to the chinese themselves if the process of disintegration goes only a little fartlher yen hsishan will find the end of the customs service in sightat the beginning of his cornmissioner ship mr sillpson gave notice that if shanghai collected any duties on goods being transshipped to tientsin he would deduct the amount collected fiorn his re mittances to shanghai now lie says he will do the same thing about the lmoniey for the universities and all that nankina can do is furiously to accuse mir simpson of a monstrous piece of illegality although the whole of the proceedings in the north have exactly that character when tne north wvent to war the leaders denounced nlsanking itself as an illegal organization so the nrgument cannot be settled excepi by force nevertheless mr simpson mlay claimn reason in this rnatter of the univer sity money as may be gatheredl frorn a glimpse at the history relating to tile subjectrussian artfulnessin the russochinese treaty of  russia renounced all clairn to her portion of the boxer indemnity stipulating only for the allocation of the money to the pro motion of education among the cihineser people at that time the russian portion was mortgaged for the repayment of loansraised by the peking government and the treaty very nearly wvent through without reference to the lien on the instalments which amounted to about Â£loooo annually at the last moment was in serted  after the satisfaction of all prior obligations secured thereon wllich meant that nothing would be available while the loans were outstandingthe chinese educationists however were entranced wvith the prospect of immediate affluence and soviet stock soared to the skies the arrangement incluaed tie appointment of a committee of twvo chlinese and one russian to adnminister the ftunds ancl the artful provision that decisions of tlhe commnittee had tobe unaninilous meant that notlling couldc be done wvithout the approval of the russian member thus the russians were able to secure the appointment of two chinese who were redhot com munists the design being to usc tho money for the propagation of communismamong the teaching staffs of the univer sities and the thousands of studentswhen the committee understood that there was nothing immediately obtain able they conceived the idea of floatiig a loan of  secured on the inidemnity instalments after thie existing obligations had been liquidated with the proceeds of such a transaction enor motus damage could have been done but fortunately by this time the object of the committee was seen through and nothing ever came of the loan proposals a little later the committee was able to divert to the iniversities a few small balancesvhich just sufficed to keep them alive dturing the series of wiars then in progress but with tlie ruptiue of relations between russia and chinia thle memlibers of tho coimimittee disappeared and the treaty itself althoughl not denlounced is virtually abrogated bv the nction of russia in makinlg wvar on mlanchutriathe funds required for the service of thle loans secured on the russinli portion of the indemnity have since decreased owing to the process of amortization and the l overnmnent for some time has been paying  n imontlh fromli this source to the peking unliversities the only neans of support thiev lhave this is tho molney whiiell nankitig has now cult off thollglh in faet it is in hand and the tientsin customiis is contributing to it vwhen it remits the  per cont duties to shanlghyai alr simpson therefore is logical in saying to nanking thatt if lie s remiiitting to meet foreign obligations of which the boxer indemnity is one nan king is called uponi to contintle payillg the educational quiota to peking to whllich tientsin is actuallv contributingif nanking withholds the money and the universities starve it has been assumed that all the bltiue wvilt fall on yen ihsisliaii and his coobjectors in the north for their presumlption in challeng ing tle nationalist governient and bringinlg disaster upon its helpless do pendents in peking btut wvhen mr sinip son puts his hanid in his pocket and pro duees the funds to relieve the necessities of the educiationial beehive in peking it is the nortlhernl leaders who wvill get all the credit while the opprobrium iwill be on nanking
