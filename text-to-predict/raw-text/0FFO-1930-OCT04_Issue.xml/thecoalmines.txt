wvith regard to other inatters connected with the iiunes he will endeavoour to persuade the asso ciation to reconsider its decision not to cooperatel in the setting up of the board lie vas not yet willing ho said to aecept the decision of the central coiiuiittee of thie mining association as final and un alterable mr shinwells statemuent avas as followsi have receivea a letter from the mininig association of great britain intimating that that body is niot prepared to cooperate with me in the appoinitmiient of coalowvners on the national industrial board the coal milnes act among other thiiigs provides for the esta blishment of this board for the purpose of considering and reporting uipoii any disputes coucerning district agreements about wages and similar matters in the various coaltieldls the dutv of appointing the members is upon the secretary for ines after consulting with the mining association and the miners federa tion wlhichl are entitled to six imemiibers each the federation of british industries and the association of chambers of commerce the general council of the trades unioni congress the cooperative utnion and the national con federation of employers organizations whicll are entitled to one member each most of these bodies have ahleadv sinified their will ingness to act but the letter of the mining association is a refusal to do soi have difficulty in believing that the mining association will adhere to this attitude which in effect is a refusal to assist in carry ing out the expressed will of both houses of parliament whatever views thev may have expressed on this part of the bill while it was under discussion now that it has been passed by parliament and is the law of the land i cannot believe that the coalowners will refuse to help to give effect to it i say this par ticularly in view of the effortsof which the coalowvners are well awarethati am making to render the act useful to the industry but if the mfining association should persist in its present attitude it does not follow that this part of tlie act becomes inoperativehaving consulted the coalowners y de partment is empowered indeed obliged to proceed to the appointments without the help of the mining association and will if neces sary do so in order that the national wvages board to which the government attaches very great importance shall be in a position to carry out its functions if district disputtes arise i am satisfied that public opinion favours the establishment of machinery which can assist in the speedy settlenuent of disputes in the industry we have had more thani enough of disputes they do no good to the owvners the men or anybody else i am not yet willing to accept the viewv expressed by the central committee of the mining asso ciation as the final and unalterable decision of the coalowners of great britain i am about to invite the mining association to con fer wiith me shortlv on a number of matters includine the continuance of the welfare fund and safety measures and i shall take the opportunity when we meet of discussing wvith them their present refusal i hope thevy vill see fit to reconsider their decisionit must be fully understood that even if this part of the act were rendered less effective through the refual of the owners to serve which is by no means likelv it does noti any war interfere with the operation of other sections of the act for example the fixnia of mininmum prices the allocation of output the apnointmnent and operations of the amalgamation commissioners and the reduction of the halfhour in the working day which automatically come into operation on december mr shinwell added that if the central coni mnittee continued to refuse its cooperation the department would have to rely on individual owners and that method of constituting the board might not be quite so effective he preferred to have nominations from a repre sentative body but he wars not precluded from selecting individual owners hle did not think the central comnmittee of the mining associa tion meant to be deliberately obstructivethe exact nature of the mining associations decision is brought out in the letters that have passed between the mines departmient and the association the association was asked to euggest the names of colliery onners to serve on the board it has declined to do so and the reasons referred to but not stated in its letter are those which were indicated in the times yesterday the association is of opinion that the establishment of the board will prove a hindrance to district wage agreements that national agreements ae notin the best interests of the industry that the presence on a national board of representatives of the ining associa tion and of the iners federation woud pro duce a camouflaged form of national negotia tions  and moreover that an arrangement giving persons unconnected with the mipnin industry a voice in the settlement of its dis putes is not desirable the correspondence is given belowv the mines department wvrote as follows on august i am directed by thie secretary for mines to refer to the provisions of section  of the coal mines act  regarding the constitu tion of a coal mines national industrial board to be appointed by the board of trade after consultation wvith various representative bodies mir shinwell vould be glad to receive any suggestions as to the personnel of the board which your association may wish to put fornwardthe secretary of the mining association mr w a lee replied yesterday as follows i have to inform you that your letter of august  stating that mr shinwell would be glad to receive any suggestions as to the personnel of the coal miines national industrial board which the mining association of great britain might wish to put forward came before the central committee of the mining association yesterday after having been referred to the district coalowners asso ciations for their consideration and st was instructed to inform you that for the reasons which were strongly urged by the representa tives of the colliery owners upon the govern rnent whlen they intimated their intention of adding this proposal for a national board to the provisions of the coal ines bill thenunder discussion the association is not in a position to put forward any suggestionsas to the probable outcome of mlr shin wells endcarour to persuade the mining association to change its view nothing can yet be said it is however made clear in mr lees letter that the decision of the central committee of the association
