thackeray and t titmes reviewer criticcorrespondentisome new gleaningsin comnpiling materials for a book on tthackerays literary apprenticeship which will be published next year dr h s gulliver who is professor of english in the georgia state college for women usa has discovered in the files of the times a good many articles which on evidence to be duly set out in his book he attributes to thackeray it is well known that thackeray was introduced to this journal through his wvifes friendship with the family of captain sterling the original thunderer and editors and biographers of thackeray have identified some of his contribu tions should dr gullivers argunents be approved the number ofidentified contributions will be greatly increased we give below with dr gullivers permission a few passages from the articles newly attributed by him to thackeray some of which will be printed in full in his forth coming bookan entry in the diary of macready the actor for april   nmakes it evident that tlhackeray wvrote some dramatic criticism for the times  and of these articles the following vhich appeared in the tines november   wvas probably onethe tragedy of mlacbeth was performed here at covent garden theatre last night with an extraordinarily strong cast mr macready en acted the principal character mliss huddart wvhose person and talent suit very well for the part wvas the lady macbeth mr phelps per sonated miacduff and mir warde banquo the latter part is perhaps hardly so important as those which are generally performed by mir warde but the excellent inanner in wahich he played it and the finish wvhich wvas given to the general effect of thle drarna by intrusting the character to him show howv good is the system by wlhich all the chief actors of a company are made to participate in the performance and to insure the success of the play in the foreign theatres it is a plan which has been long and generally adopted and it is no small credit to the present inanager of coventgarden that he has been enabled to overcome the vanitv of the chief english actors upon this point and to in duce them all to contribute to the general effect of the piecemacreadys macbethof mr macreadys macbeth we have spoken before and often in this paper and with his faults and his excellencies the public are alike familiar let us sav howvever that there are parts of his performance which displayed talent of no ordinary kind his preparation to murder the king his dreadful burst of agony when the deed is done and wvhen goaded by his wvife he declares he dare not reenter the chamber altlhough he lhas ventured to comunit the crime show at once liow well he merits the high place which he holds in his art his reflections after wvards upon duncan that after lifes fitful fever lie sleeps xvell and that noble and pathetic speech in which when arming for hiis last battle he speaks of his own solitary and dishonoured old age were delivered wvith very great effect let us speak in the same terms of praise of the wvhole of his performance of the fifth act there is nothing better on thie stage than the passionate detiamce witlh wvhiieh he receives the account that birnainr wood marches to dunsinane or with wlhichl he commients upon his vifes death the scene of the battle and his death are equally well rendered it is the finest perhaps of all his performances his comnbat vith imlacduff is a real eearnest fight and his death a grand heroic picture the house re ceived the play and the actor wnith a tumult of applause and indeed both merited it wellcertain references in that notice suggest to dr gulliver that thackeray may also have been the author of a reviewv of earl harold a tragedy published anonymously in the tinies of sep tember   which included this re miniscencewe recollect once wvitnessing the per formance of richard iii when r macready personating the fierce plantagenet did battle with mlr wnallack who enacted richmond mr wllallack in a splendid plume of ostrich feathers waving over a kind of tin beret wvhich he wore placed himself in an elecgant fencing attitude expectingthat according to the stage direction the combat avould be over in two niinutes and that his antagonist run through the body would gasp his death speech on the ground not so however did king richard understand his part lie rampaged and raged over the field like a lion as lie was shouting and stamping wvith his foot slash and thrust quarte and tierce lie so belaboured and fiightened mr wallack that he fairly drove hiim from the field of battle into the wvingys only there did the great actors memory retturn to him so he camne back to tho stage flyinig and fighting crabvise anud per miitted poor frightened rhichmond to bestow upon him a single slight poke whereupon he fled this ve say was something like actinga letter fromi paristhat thiackeray used to send letters fromi paris to the times in s and  is clearlv established althouglh it is verv difficult to deter imine wrhich of the letters vere his one of themi however dr gulliver believes to be attributable to thackeray on internal evidence it is a letter from paris dated march  describing a political banquet and it wvas printed in the times march  si shall wave sic a miniute description of the salle wlhich wvas not well adapted for the purpose being divided by cohunns and other wise

similarity between the two festivals althouglh convinced that with the latter occasion would terniinate the parallelthe greater part of thackerays work for the titnes consisted of reviews of books the first known for certain to be his was a review of carlyles  the french revolution in the issue of august   in the following autumn there appeared in this journal reviews of certain books which thackeray is known to have reviewed in january  in frasers alaga zine and after comparing the two sets of reviews dr gulliver has come to the conclu sion that both sets were by tliackeray the first quotation given here is an extract from a review of bulwer lyttons novel  ernest mialtravers published in the timies sep tember  the poor thing does not know that there is a god her father had none
