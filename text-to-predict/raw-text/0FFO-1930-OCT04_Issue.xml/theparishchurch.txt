the parish churchinfluence in nationallifefroi a correspondentfrom early times a churchs dedication was annually commemorated on the date on whiclh it was set apart for divine wor ship but in  the authorities in church and state ordered that throughout eng land the dedication festival of all parish churches should be kept on the first sun day in october this canon has never fallen into abeyance and tomorrow its injtnction will be observed in many piarts of the countryit was not unitil the days of persecution were over that clristians were able to build public places of worship in the fhrst tlree centuries certain buildings in which they gathered together for prayers were known to the initiated but it was impos sible to disclose this fact to the authorities irnmediately after the edict of tolera tion christiaii churches appeared evcrv wlhere sometimes temples formerly used by the old pagan religions were turned into clristian sanctuaries but this was not done so commonily as might be sup posed for the association of such build ings remiained abhorrent to christians constantine built a number of chlurchls the most magnificent of which was st sophia in his new city of

been sorely de faced and misused wsill testify that their witness to the grace and kno ledge wlhich christianity offers to mankind has deeply influenced our national lifethe puritans erred when they wished the parish churches to be destroyed or put to secular tuse they could think of them only as the places in which super stition had been encouraged and feared that their continued existence might

wellinformed description of english national life and his significant estimate of our countrys con tribution to modern civilization points out that tlhe church of england has always cherished its catholic character its piety he declares is not indi vidualistprotestant but collectivist catholic  but he adds that anglicanism with all its leanings towards rome  will lardly become catholic it may vbe asserted that the special character of anglicanism has been created and preserved less by its formal theology its theories of the rministry or its controversies wvitlh other churches than by the
