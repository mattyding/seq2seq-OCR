fast torpedo craftspeed trials of newmotorboatfroni our naval correspondentrenewed interest is being shown by various powers in the construction of what were known in the war as coastal motor boats but are now generally referred to as motor torpedoboats an order for six of these craft was placed by the british admiralty last autumnthe first since and a further six are to be built under the recent supplementary navy esti mate special attention is therefore being directed to the performance of the latest boat of this class which j  thornycroft and co limited have just completed for a foreign countrythis firm supplied the lightning officially torpedoboat no  to the royal navy t years ago and have been closely connected with the development of such craft ever since the old steamdriven torpedoboats as is well known became larger and larger and developed into the modem destroyer with a range of  miles without refuellinga miniature cruiser with steam machinery the armamentcarrying capacity of the small torpedoboats and their radius of action were very limited but by the employment of modern internal combustion engines not only are these factors very much increased but a much greater speed can be obtainedthe boat which has just completed her tials is able to carry two torpedoes depth charges and machineguns with a full load of uel the following results were obtained in official trials over the admiralty measured milebest run     knotsbest pair of runs    knots true and mean speed of sixruns  knotstest in bad weatherin the small steam torpedoboat apart from the seakeeping qualities of the hull the speed was limited by the possibility of stoking the boilers and looking after the machinery when the boat was being tossed about with the motor torpedoboat these difficulties arc obviated and this was amply demonstrated in a run made from westminster to portsmouth on may  the weather was exceptionally badthc report in tlte times described the english channel con ditions as  fresh strong northeasterly winds mainly cloudy showers and sea rough under these conditions iocluding the run down the thames where speed is necessarily limited the boat arrived at portsmouth in a running timc of hr min which works out at an average speed of a little over  knots the return journey was made at an average speed of  knotsit is believed that this boat is the fastest torpedocarrying war vessel in the world in which case messrs thornycroft have added another to the numerous speed records created by vessels built by them since
