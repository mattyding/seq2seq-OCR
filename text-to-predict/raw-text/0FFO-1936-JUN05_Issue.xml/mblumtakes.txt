statement at  am tomorrowm salengro the minister of the interior who is now responsible for keeping order throughout the country entered on his duties this evening he stated that the government would take any necessary steps to ensure the supply of provisions to the large towns during the strikes and that their first act would be to pass legislation which would satisfy the legitimate claims of the working peoplem herriot was elected president of the chamber this afternoon by  votes against  votes for a lastmoment can didate of the right m xavier vallat and eight for other candidatesmenace of the strikesin circies in close touch with the front lopulaire serious alarm is now felt owing to the impression that the strikes have got out of hand and are not under the control of the labour leaders the strikes began as a spontaneous but welldisciplined movement which had its origin in the victory of the left at the elections and the determination of the industrial workmen who have suffered severe reductions in their standard of living since  to seize the first opportunity of improving their conditions with a prospect of success so far the movement had the sympathy of the socialist and communist parties and those who represent them in the new govern ment but the spread of the movement during the last few days has embraced large classes of wageearners who are not organized trade unionists and who are moved by a vague feeling that good times are comingthe organized labour movement now finds itself overwhelmed by this good humoured but dangerous outbreak of oirect action which as the statement of the employers in the metallurgical industry shows today is rapidly approaching the point where general paralysis of the social system with au its dangers may set inin these circumstances m blum and his friends are being urged by their advisers official and unofficial to lose no time in taking action which will restore order before it is too late m blum is being pressed this evening to make an appeal to au the working people to trust the front populaire government to support their claims and in the meantime to put an end to a movement which threatens to make the task of that govern ment impossible in any case m blum is expected to hold the first meeting of his cabinet tomorrow and to face the chamber on saturday afternoon and it is probable that a biu or bills designed to satisfy the fundamental claims of the workmen will be tabled by the govern ment immediately
