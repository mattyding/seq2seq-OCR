imperial and foreigndr schachtstourgerman tradeexpansionfrom our onvn correspondentberlin june it is officially announced that dr schacht minister of economics and presi dent of the reichsbank will leave berlin on saturday to begin a european tourhe will first visit basle where the regular board meeting of the bank for international settlements takes place on sunday thence travelling by air and spending two days in each capital he will go to budapest belgrade sofia and athens a visit to bucharest was in the original programme but has been cut out in deference it is believed to hungarian sensibilities it is thought likely however that the minister may go at a later date to bucharest and possibly also angorathe order in which dr schacht will visit the various capitals does not seem to have been decided yet it may be presumed however that he will find it more useful to reach belgrade when the little entente conference is over than in the middle of it this assumes of course that the tour has some political and economic signifi cance which is not admitted here accord ing to the official announcement his object is merely to return visits made to berlin by the heads of the banks of issue of the countries concerned but if dr schacht does not intend to discuss commercial problems his prospective hosts do at any rate the german press publishes a statement on the visit by the governor of the bank of greece who speaks of the extraordinary importance attached by greece to the development of trade relations with germany the diffi culties that have arisen over payment for greek exports to germany referred to in this correspondence on may  are men tioned by the governor but he expresses confidence that all outstanding questions will be solved when dr schacht arrives in athensgerman trade progressthe governor goes on to say that the development of trade relations must be on the lines hitherto followed which means roughly an expanding exchange of greek agricultural products for german manu factures through the machinery of clear ing and compensation agreements it is the strength of germanys economic posi tion in the danubian and balkan coun tries that she needs their surplus foodstuffs and raw materials just as urgently as they need outlets for them germany is or is becoming the best customer of all the countries dr schacht proposes to visit and the process has naturally been accelerated by the effect of sanctions against italy on the other side german manufacturers promise to obtain some thing like a monopoly in central and southeastern europethe main difficulty in the way of mutual trade expansion is the problem of pay mentsgermany owes large sums to greek bulgarian and yugoslav exporters and it would not be surprising if dr schacht in his conversations with the bankers in the various capitals took up the question of mutual trade expansion from the side of monetary conditions in some quarters it is thought that he may sound his banking hosts as to the advisa bility of a general monetary agreement to end the present confusion in that part of central and southeastern europe which interests germany economically he is known to be a little more hopeful than he was of england france and the united states soon taking up the question of currency stabilization and if they do they will find him ready to cooperate that he has in mind a little anticipatory work among the countries he proposes visiting is not out of the questionthere is also the possibility that he may discuss bilateral agreements providing for the adjustment of exchange rates with a view to simplifying the problem of pay ments or agreements to settle immediate payments difficulties and provide for increased interchange of goods on the lines of that recently concluded with yugoslavia at zagrebeconomic penetrationofficial circles however minimize the importance of dr schachts tour on which unofficial circles comment that if there are any striking results the tour will become a mission if not it will remain the private undertaking it is now represented to be it is certain at any rate that germany regards present conditions as favourable for developing the economic penetration which must smooth the way for german political control of central and southeastern europedr schacht has also a strong personal interest in expanding the territorial basis of the german economic system he is fighting the battle of capitalism in ger many and his victory or defeat will to a large extent depend on his success in restoring her foreign trade as things are at present germany can only with diffi culty import sufficient raw materials and foodstuffs he must find markets also fsr german industry in anticipation of the day when it can no longer be kept busy by government contracts financed by bor rowing it is difficult to believe that he will not have these considerations strongly in mind when he makes the round of southeastern capitals
