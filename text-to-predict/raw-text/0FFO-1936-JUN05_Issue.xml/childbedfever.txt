childbed fevergood results of a newdrugi from our medical correspondentthere are published today in the lancet two papers dealing with the treat ment of puerperal and other infections by means of a drug commonly called prontosil an aniline compound which was introduced last year in germanythe papers are by dr leonard cole brook of the medical research council dr mave kenny of queen charlottes hospital and the members of the honorary staff of the hospital and also by dr buttle dr gray and dr stephenson of the wellcome research laboratories the papers are of a highly technical character but the results which they describe are so good as to deserve widespread attention the following is included among the con clusions of the first of the two papers thirtyeight puerperal fever cases infected by hemolytic streptococci have been treated by oral plus intravenous or intramuscular doses of pron tosil subject to confirmation by further experi ence the impression has been gained that in many of the more severe cases the drug has exerted a definitely beneficial effect manifested by unex pectedly prompt fall of temperature and remission of symptoms and this impression is supported by a substantial reduction in the casemortality of the whole series three patients in whom there was judged to be a generalizing peritonitis on admnission one with a positive blood culture have recovered without laparotomy under very large doses of the drug the clinical results together with the mouseprotection experiments support the view that further clinical trial is amply justified and that there is more hope of con trolling these streptococcal infections by the early administration of this or some related chemo therapeutic agent than by any other means at present availablethe lancet commentsnot only does this drug work so to speak at a distance but it works when administeted some days before or at least some hours after infection takes place indeed it appears to have determined recovery in an animal already the subject of bacternemia this at any rate is something quite new it is the first time that any drug has been shown to have a specific and regular effect on an acute bacterial infection when administered by the mouth all observers are agreed that the effect is limited to infections due to streplococcuts progenes although there are slight indications in dr buttles work that the meningococcus may also prove susceptible the conclusions drawn by drs colebrook and kenny on the basis of their clinical experience are commendably cautious it is very much to be hoped that the therapeutic trial which they have initiated in this country will be extended and made to embrace types of acute streptococcal infection other than puerperal fever
