cities asmightthey besatellite townsthe larger view ofplanningfrom a correspondenttwo important directions in which develop ment of policy is to be looked for in municipal activities in this country are largescale replan ning of central areas and as a necessary corollary the creation of subsidiary centres in the form of satellite towns the responsibilities placed on municipal authorities under the town and country planning act  and the hous ing acts   and  are so extensive that they can be discharged successfullv only in accordance with longterm policies this in volves a drastic change in the attitude of public authorities towards the larger aspects of housing and town planninghitherto both housing and town planning have been regarded in relation to immediate needs because those needs have been pressing this limitation of view threatens to lead to difficulties that may be greater even than those which have arisen from mistakes in the past the carrying out of large housing schemes may make town extension lopsided as it is doing all over the country and townplanning schemes may actually provoke undeiirable building specula tion the new slumclearance schemes with their subsidized rents mean that large new areas are being populated by people few of whom are above the poverty line and whose segrega tion in districts where life will be monotonous when the novelty of new surroundings wears off will certainly create social problems not at present guessed atbackward englandthe great work of rehousing which is taking the alternative forms of building large blocks of flats near the centre and the development of large housing estates on the outskirts is pro ceeding on lines which may be already out of date the conflicting tendencies to over concentrate population in the centre of cities and to scatter population over the countryside are both productive of results which are not free from undesirable elements and suggest the need for a reorientation of policy the general opinion of the delegates from abroad visiting england for the international housing and town plan ning congress last july was that this country was not now showing the lead in its housing methods which it showed  years ago but was falling behind other countriesthe inadequacy of present policies is shown by the difficulties that the most alert and active local authorities are encountering in carrying out their rehousing schemes they are not find ing it possible to rehouse people from cleared slum areas as quickly as those areas can be cleared and they cannot at all meet the needs of other people who want houses to rent this is what is happening at birmingham for example as the report recently submitted to the city council shows there irrespective of slum clearances the corporation has applications for  houses on its registerat present many local authorities are re developing their central areas with highdensity residential buildings at great cost more or less on continental models when the land could more advantageously and profitably be used for professional or trading purposes industries are at the same time removing from the centre the result is that cities are coming to consist of central highdensity industrial trading and residential areas a first fringe of mixed resi dential development most of it in good condi tion a second fringe of lowdensity housing estates a third fringe of lowdensity industrial areas with a fourth fringe of lowdensity houses in some of the fringes flats are being erected by municipal and private enterprise taken altogether this is an uneconomic and unsatis factory system of town development and is bound ultimately to depress values to lead togreat inconvenience and to increase transport costs what is required as an alternative is a policy of restricting central areas to business trading and industrial purposes only of main taining the residential character of the first fringe preventing any industrial encroachments which is the most important principle of all and carefully controlling the other fringes on definite zoning methodsthe central areathe tendency for manufacturers to move to the outskirts of towns is at present unorganized it is a valuable economic tendency which should be used for constructive civic purposes and in particular the relation of satellite town develop ment to the replanning of central areas is a matter to which attention should be given the difficul ties of such replanning are known to be con siderable undoubtedly the best way is for properties to be pooled and for a redevelopment scheme to be prepared the benefits being shared by individual owners if this were done on a sufficiently large scale the economic advantages to all concerned would be considerable and the effect upon the standing of any city undertaking it through the increased convenience of con ducting business would be great organized and planned redevelopment in the centre and organized and planned building on the outskirts would have the effect of increasing values both in the centre and in the outskirts whereas the present unintelligent methods cannot fail to lead to ultimate depreciation the only persons who are advantaged by existing haphazard methods are speculatorssatellite town development would enable alternative accommodation to be offered to those conducting industry in the centre and to the housing authority for rehousing the people it is an illusion that people who live in the centre of a city must necessarily live there by reason of their employment some are unemployed and many members of families resident in a central disthct have to travel elsewhere to their work either outside the city or to a distaut part of it all of them have to travel outside for openair recreation and today facilities for leisure are as important as facilities for workexamples of satellite towns are provided by letchworth and welwyn garden city and to some extent by vythenshawe manchester the satellite town differs from a housing estate in its conception as an organic unit both physicallv and socially it is a compact settlement of houses for all classes of the community with its own social shopping and recreation facilities and with means of employment carried out with attention to the preservation of amenities the entire scheme being intended to create a definite civic life the main features of satellite town development may be sumnmarized as follows the area should be large enough for a population of from  to  it should be planned as a complete community centre so that while it is subsidiary to the city it has by reason of its structurc and the facilities provided a efc of its own it should be so planned in conjunction with transpoit facilitics that the coiuimunity shouidbave casy and chcap access to the city for those cultural economic and other advantages which the city alone can supply it should be physically separated from the city and from other development by a perma nent agricultural or park belt so that its form could be kept distinct the plan should provide for houscs of all classes so that it should have the charactcr of a mixed residential area the plan should provide for shops schools churches halls cinemas playing fields parks  c there should be an industrial area within the satellite town or thed satellite should be planned in relation to an existing or separately developed industrial area the financial basis of the scheme is the inmprovement of land values which if carefully handled should bc considerable over a period of yearsto carry out satellite town development an area of agriculturar land should be secured in a ring fence the area should be from  to  acres depending upon the size of the town proposed to be built an area of  acres might be allocated somewhat as follows acres residential  shopping and commercial  industrial schools playing fields open spaces allotments agricultural belt  this would provide for a population of from  to  persons if the land were purchased at agricultural rate its cost should average £ an acre or £ an advantageous purchase would mean even less if the estate took  years to develop the total cost of nthe land including loss of interest and repay ment of loan until the land was used mnight amount to £ an average total cost forland of £lan acre  sufficient profit could be made on the land disposed of for shops factories and for residential purposes  other than working class to cover the cost of the land retained for agri ctiltural purposes fand for open spaces this is no more than a rough calculation but it could be shown that a bulk purchase of land accompanied by a scheme of de velopment supported by the municipal authority would be a sufficiently sound financial transaction to provide a proper basis for the schemenew civic enterpriset hat the city area would need to be ex tended to include the estate if the best re sults were to be secured goes without say ing but this is not essential for as letchworth and welwyn have shown it is possible to carry out development on a virgin site without any municipal powers at all the town being dependent upon the county council for public services like education and police and upon the rural district for drainage c water gas elec tricity and transport could be provided under trading agreementsthe corporation of manchester is carry ing out the development of wythenshawe through a special committee an alterna tive to direct municipal action would be to form a housing association incorporated under the companies acts in accordance with the provisions of the housing act  the undertaking being financed by the municipality in respect of the cost of the land and development including housing loans could be advanced under the housing act  or the municipality could guarantee the issue of shares or stock made by the association the municipality could have rcpresentation upon the board of directors but subject to the approval of general policy and annual accounts the undertak ing should be conducted as a business con cern serving the public interest as a public utilitya scheme on these lines would bring much credit to the municipality under taking it or finding facilities for its being done an important point is that satellite town development accompanied by the re planning of central areas forms an entirely new form of civic enterprise
