need of a strongerbritain  mbishops on dangers toworld peacereference to the italoabyssinian dis pute and the position of the league of nations was nmade yesterday by two bishops in addresses to their diocesan conferencesthe bishop of hereford dr lisle carr said he regarded the present pacifist movement as mis guided ard a real danger to the peace of the world the failure of the scheme of collective security had proved complete the league of nations had performed great service to mankind on the social and industrial side and in settling minor quarrels but where great issues were con cerned and tle pride of firstclass nations was at stake a league without the united states ger many and japan ceased to be a power for peace they must not lose sight of the ideal of all the nations settling their differences by common con ference but the league of nations in its present form was a danger rather than a help to peace and it must be reorganized from top to bottom if it was to fulfil the high ambitions to which its origin gave birth it seemed to him also that the pacts which statesmen seemed to make so eagerly were a further danger for they remained fixed while the world movedbritain could only continue to add justice to peace and be the friend of all but friendship was of little value unless they had the necessary strength to give it emphasis he trusted that the armed forces of this country would never again be involved in a great conflict but their exist ence was necessary if the will to peace was to permeate the politics of europethe bishop of soutrhwell dr mosley addressing the diocesan conference at notting ham said he felt a sense of almost crushing disappointment at the failure of the league of nations to prevent the wrong done by italy to abyssinia but he thanked god that this country had shown a genuine desire to act up to the prin ciples of the league and had taken the lead in trying to carry them into effect he was as convinced as ever that the principles of the league offered the only hope for peace but the league as at present constituted was not strong enough to prevent such outrageous acts of aggression herein lay the justification for increased armaments he could not understand the mentality of those who while keen to see the league enforce peace were unwilling to give it the power to do so the christian church must face the fact that while there was an increasing body of opinion in this country that would refuse to go to war for a purely national interest it would be prepared to take military action to prevent a breach of international peace and brotherhood
