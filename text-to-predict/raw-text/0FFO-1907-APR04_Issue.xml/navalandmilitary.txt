at the signal school at portsmouth marks a now departure in the signalling instruction of these officers the subjects which have been already taught whilst officers of the royal njaval reserve areunder going their periodical training in ships of the home fleet are to be supplemented by courses to be held at the chief signal school in may and october of each year which will be open to ten officers abovo the rank of midshipman who have been specially recommended by the command ing offlcers of ships in which the officers have undergone their  months or periodical training each course willasta fortnight and the instruction given wiul be of amore advanced kind and include subjects which have not been taught during the periodical training the full pay of this ranc is to be allowed each officer during the pernod of the course and othor allowances and travelling expenses are also to be included no officer will be allowed to undergo the course oftener than once in four years the value in war time of rapid signalling com munication between ships of war andmerchant vessels especiay at night cannot be overestimted and these projected courses are evidently the outcome of the well known desire of the admitalty to facllitate such com munication to the utmost an excellent step forward has been talken which should be much appreciated by those offlcers of the royal naval reserve
