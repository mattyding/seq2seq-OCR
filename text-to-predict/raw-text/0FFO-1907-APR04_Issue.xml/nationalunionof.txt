in tho countrythe p sirmirm said he would rather stay and carry out the business but he was keen about raising the social and educational status of the teachers it was becanse this great university

lavishhand and they could well spare a few brief moments to con gratulate the recipientsmr einmst gray in proposing a resolution of con gratulation said  years ago when he occupied the chair the university forged one link in the chain con necting the university with the village school that day three other links had been forged in the same chaina ehain so strong that the connexion batween the primary schools and university education would never again be severed the honour had fallen on worthy men butit wvas something more than personal it was an honour conferred on the vwhole teaching

tho report of the consultative committee on higher elementary schools aud demanding its withdrwal he said that although there were in the report good proposals sound educational principles and many ideas which the union had adopted and sug gested yet the whole thing was so snobbish and caddish as to make it altogether of no value and they called for its withdrawal they did not oppose higher elementary schools which were no doubt a proper provision but they could not he regarded as a proper provision of higher education for the working mans child he main tained that they must dignify magnify and glorify the upper standards of the ordinary olementary schools and those who wished to go higher should go to the proper secondary sohools cheershmr  t wvo portsmouth seconded tho

placed in the e bill avith the general approval of the house of commons and also of the house of lords and the executive urges the necessity for similar clauses to b oadded to the present bill le e sa id they had only  minutes left cries of shame  andheowanted to appeal to them to pass the resolution and also a resoln tion dezling with ahe halftime question therefore et them try to leave tho controversial side of the question out altogether he mtintasned emphatically that this cas a stupid bill end it would have been better if the govermnt had never touched it ln many cases itwould affect severely teachers iu nonprovided schools and theorefore he asked them to apply their attention to that question and that question onhy lf the bill did not pass a voice it will he a good thing no harm whould he done but if it passed a great deal of hrtm might resubl to many members of the teaching pro fession they were not the ero as memb ers of on patiular church or chapel he wias not there as a pohltieian he stood there as a member of the national union of teachers end they wiere ther in their capmacty as members of the union to protect their fellowteachers they wanted a strong expression of opinion from the contereneo that the bill could not and should not pass unless they got the compensation clauses inserted in the bill a voice let us kill the bill howould remind them that they were not the british parliament and the bill might pass he hoped the resolution would be carried by a unanimous votemr g j llmion birmingham in seconding the resolution said that to his mind this was as

jachman that it was possible the bill might be forced through the house of commons cries of  never he did not think it would but if these clauses were introduced they would safeguard the interests and position of his feilow teachers in church end other nonprovided schools as a churchman be admitted that many mistakes had been mado so far as the church was con cerned he believed thero was a broad and substantial christian platform which could be made available for every school provided and nonprovided cheersthere were several amendments on the agenda paper and the presidmnr reminded the conference that only seven minutes remained for opposed businessmr w j fltnetg oldbam who had given notie to move that the conference could in no way support the bill introduced by mr mekenna inasmuch

occupying the chair there was a large attendance and the company included dr macnamani mr yoxall the vicechncellor the president of magdalen thetnavor of oxford connoilor ne j brooks the rector of incoln the principa of brasenose the rector of exeter mr arthur sldgwick and mr h t gerransdr macnamara in responding to the toast of the houses of parliament said it was a charncteristic of the house of commons to bo alwavs ready vith eager willinguess to respond to any appeal to it on behalf of the children of the country cheers but directly the guestion of religions teaching arose the story was very  fferent somehowor other they au thereuponbegan to play the part of tho dog in the manger it was a pity not only because progress vas hindered but because theso interminable religious disputes were living tens of thousands of religiouslymilded people to throw up their bands in despair and to join the ranks of those who held that the proper function of the state was to be conflned to the provision of secular instruction only he vws opposed to that solution because it would dwarf and sterilize the functions of the school teachor and would commit thousands of the children of the slums of their great cities to a youth unsweetened by the influences of cuhristian truths but he must warn religious disputants and he did so very serionsly that they had better settlo their differences quickly or public opinion would demand to settle them in a way that advocates of religious teach ing most of all would have reason to deplore cheersmr yoxa l mp gave tho toast of the umaversitythe vxcscmancsrn in responding said oxford vms the senior and premier university of the english speaking race this was an advantage but it had also as he was sure they would see its disadvantages it vas not easy to adapt institutions of mcdieval days tradi tions of tudor and jacobean and hanoverian temper and taste to the requirements of the th and th centuiries it was no easier than their statesmen found it to adapt the traditions and usages of the anciont estates of the realm or of their historio monarchy to the exigencies of public life today and yet thev felt and no one he thought felt more than a gatherifg like that that there were great traditions and a gloriouis heritage and that they would rather strive to overcome the difficulty to make the old house livable and serviceable than to destrpy and prune it avwy cheers never was there a time when oxford was more catholic and cosmopolitan than today cheers he thought tbat the most educating influence of the university after all vms its atmosphere its variety of interests amid the contact and clash of which stimulating shocks and eulightening slarks were struck out cheers wvhat were the two most educating influences which they had  he would say their professors aud teachers and their college life of their professors he would only say that te thought they never had a stronger or more devoted band than thev had at this moment cheers their collego life in tho widest sense might speak for itself take that great college those storied walls the home of peel and gladstone derby and salis bury of wvesley and pusey and liddon cheers read their lives see how they went through their under grduate time let them read the life in particular of gladstone or of buskia in oxford as they might read that of tennyson or danvin at cambridge  they leamed not so much from the set studies of each place as from each other cheers the dilficulty of oxford was her complexity the varietv of interests she had to conciliate and keep going at once they were asked to admit the children of the democracy the poor students more freely they had always been willing and never he thought more vwilling thaui today to do so but he believei that if they were to admit the poorer in such a way as to drive away the richer they would do no ood to either cheers it had been said and he thougat it was a very wise saying at any rate it was a comforting one that it took all sorts to make aworld and so it took all sorts lo make a univesity cheers oxford today was dominated he thought by two instincts the love of knowledge and the instirct of research the love of fellowmen and the instinct of democracy cheers these ought not to conflict or at any rate to be irreconcilable but they would believe him that it wns no easy matter to do justice to both in all their various ramifications cheers
