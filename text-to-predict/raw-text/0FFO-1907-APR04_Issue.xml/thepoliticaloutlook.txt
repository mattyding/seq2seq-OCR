the political outlook in americampederal interference wilh staterightsfrom our own coioximwashgton dc mknc the president and his followers have a defender and a very vigorous one in the person of senator beveridge of indiana afore nentioned who first appeared iu the senate in  when he could boast of being the youngest member of that solemn assembly mr beveridge iuke mr bryan is an accomplished orator an extensive traveller and a voluminous writer and talker like his distinguished antago nist he feels himself confident to talk upor all subjectsfrom the athanasian creed to tariff schedules he has lived down his early mis forttme of being the youngest man in the senate has been reelected and his term will not expire until  he is one of the best speakers in the republican party and last year opened the campaign in no less than nine states he is therefore in touch with the people and knows far better than some of his older colleagues the real trend of public sentiment throughout the country when mr bryan first stumped the country for the pre sidency in  he was called the  boy orator  and beveridge has been ehristened the  grand young man a title that promises to cling to him perhaps i should make both these gentle men angry were i to suggest that here are points of similarity between them for given the same conditions in a large political conven tion mr beveridge would be quite capable of playing the part mir bryan took in the convention of  and playing it successfully he has capacity eloquence enthusiasm force and integrity and if he were less egoistic his future as a leader of his party would be very promising mr beveridge is devoted to the president and his policies and were mr roose velt a candidate for a third term would strongly support him coming from indiana he is support ing vicepresident fairbanks the conservative republican candidate but how far mr beve ridges views on public questions may be regarded as representing those of mr fairbanks it is difiicult to sayin his answer to mr bryan senator beveridge plunges into his subject with the question what is the national government   and answers  all the american people w hat are the states governments   he next asks  they are the same people split up into  smaller sovereignties surely he contends there can be no danger for the national govern ment except the danger that comes from the actions of the american people themselves acting as a body mr beveridge like mr bryan alludes to thehistoric contest between what he ealls  the spirit of national progress and the spirit of reaction and he tells us that this con test reached a crisis in the country on four different occasions on each of which the amnerican people striving after national consciousness triumphed over the forces resisting it passing on to the issues of the day he deelares that the heart of the present battle is the effort of the corpora tions to defeat national regulation of their vast concerns by championing states rightsevery railroad that has felt the regalating hand of the nations government says he is earnestly for states rights every trust attorney is declaiming about  the dangers of centralization do you know who is not  indeed this present conflict iargelv grew out of the assertion of nationality in the rate bill and other acts which extended the control of the peoples government over the railroads and in the activity of the nation in investigating certain mammoth businesses i do not say that au advocates of states rights are trust attorneys but that all trust attornevs are advocates of the states rights does any one donbt he further asks that the real reason of these mighty financial interests for engineering this twentieth century crusade for states rights is that they believe that bycurbing the power of the american people expressed through the american conqresa they can better protect their plans for financial gain that selfish money interests should be at the back of the present states rights campaign is nothing new senator beveridge cites the creation of tariff in one state against others allowable under the article of confederation the attempt to secure the waters of new york state for exclusive navigation and jacksons fierce assertion of nationality originating from the sordid financial interests of the slaveholders of calhouns day who feared the nationalspiritof libertywouldtakefromtheintheir slave labour unless the  sovereignty of the states were asserted for broader illustrations of the baneful outcome of the  states rights  principle senator beveridge casts his eye on europe he instances france as she was hundreds of years ago divided into little duchies princi palities c each asserting its  sovereignty always warring andonly uniting when all were threatened out of which segregation of peoples had now emerged a united country consoli dated into that splendid unit the french republic he also points to the rise of the german empire as springing from the same unifi cation and regards italys growth as proceed ing directly from the obliteration of the sovereignty of the little states which once composed that country as independent units the united ingdom as it was when england scotland ireland and wales were separate and torn internally by strife is perhaps a somewhat ancient historical parallel to draw but may pass to give weight to his declaration that alike in france germany italy and the british islands liberty has made swifter progress and better human conditions have developed more rapidly through nationality than in all the ages of local  sovereignty  that went before undoubtedly as senator beveridge contends the same thing holds true in america her people were better off under the constitution than under the artieles of con federation and happiness and prosperity made greater advance after the war for nationality in lincolns day than during all the nations history before senator beveridge rises to some glowing periods as he warms on this inspiring cry for nationalitywhat the bearings of the conflict between states rights and nationality were in the past may be gathered from some edifying examples three issues have arisen which brought up the champions of the states in united front against the national government congress sought to stop the circulation of obscene literature and to prevent lotteries both measures were strenu ously opposed on the ground that such federal legislation was a  dangerous extension of national power some states had passed a lawto stop the traffic in obscene literature but the law was only operative within the state others did not  yet if all the states passed laws except one the circulation of obscene literature could still go on through that channel and no state could prevent it congress intervened in the  interests of the nation  without any express power to check this gross type of com merce on the contrary the constitutien ex pressly stipulates  freedom of speech pro tected by that immunity the supporters of state rights would let the exploiters of objectionable literature go on and prosper just as far as they were not prevented by the states themselves in whom they asserted was ex clusively vested the right to protect the morals of the people the national government only secured the passage of the law by appealing to the supreme court which found in the provisions giving congress power to establish post offices a loophole for national control over the character of missives transmitted through the postin the case of the famous louisana lottery supporters of state rights again beheld the  dangerous tendency towards centralzation the states were powerless to prevent the evil from the same causes already shown  but they strenuously fought the act which congress passed contending that if this power of nationality were coneeded the united states would soon be an empire again the supreme courts came to the resute and held the act constitutionala more recent example was the action of con gress only last session in putting the quarantine in the hands of the nation in order to stop yellow fever nowv yellow fever and other pestilences he rcevious articles appeared on mach  nad adril re not respecters of state boundaries yet it was actually submitted that the act was a direct infringement of the  rights  of the states its passage however was only feebly resisted for the reason that as senator beveridge causticauly comments no great business interests were thriving on yellow fever  nobody was financially benefited by asserting states rights in excluding it again we see that the preservation of the rights of th states be comes a sacred cause only uhen nationcaity threatens unrighteous pocket booksthe same stand was made against the pure food bill  manufacturers to use senator beveridges words  were putting poison into the food and medicine of the people andas has been the case for a hundred years in everything else the states did not actcould not act indeed the manufacturers resisted the bill and time and again it was killed with the sword of state rights the nation had uo  police power  over these  poisoners of the american people it was a direet and fiagrant invasion by the nation of the sacred rights  of the states declared these  getters of unholy wealth as mr beveridge terms them it really seemed that the protests of the  poisoners  of the american people under the disguise of states rights would prevail for great constitutional lawyers  had  serious doubts  about the  constitutionality  of the proposed law to proteet the health of the american people in the same way as the food and drugs act does in england other legal luminarieslikewise were profoundly convinced that the nation had no such power and that the bill showed a  dangerous tendeney towards centralization e it was the exposures of the iniquities of the beef trust the canning of diseased meats for one which saved the bill from being wrecked before the storm of wrath which swept over the republic the supporters of state rights dared not raise their heads and the bill was passed to the extent to which the pure food bill was an invasion of state rights the force of public opinion has overridden the aleged unconstitutionality of the legislation anyhow the beef trust has not dared to question its constitu tionality  and hence senator beveridge asks  if there is any sincerity in the present hue and cry about state rights why is not the meat bill attacked for it is the most daring invasion of the  sacred rights of the states  ever made in american history as the senator in charge of the bill he had a very strenuous time during its passage through the first session of the past congress and he is not without excuse for speak ing with some feelingin a recent conversation with mr beveridge he expressed the hope to me that a similar influence would arise that would enable him to pass his child labour bill which is contested by similar powerful financial interests on the same grounds so far however his revelations of the extent and conditions under which child labour is carried on harrowing as they are embrace too wide an area of the country to arouse general public indignation the bill did not reach a vote last session of congress but it may be revived in the next behind the mask of state rights he says the interests profiting by child labour are frantic against the proposed law which prohibits interstate comerce in the products of child labour even though state rights are not touched by the bill the degree of resistance to such legisla tion is to be measured by the extent of the financial interests involved senator beveridge regards the determined fight against this child labour bill as a thousandfold greater than the fight against either the obscene literature and lottery laws because the interests benefiting by unrestricted child labour are a thousandfold greater than those affected by the latternamed enactmentsthere is a conclusion to be drawn from this raising of the cry of violated state rights when such reforms are undertaken bv congress and that is that the cry is only heard when these interests are aroused senator beveridge names sundry acts of congress the constitutionality of which could with equal force be questioned but to which no demur was made if the laws governing obscene literature lotteries food and child made goods involve state rights then a large number of similar laws exist passed without objection which equally err and in stating that state rights slumber and are only aroused when some financial interests are hit the senator avers that he is naming a fact no man can dis puteon one ground then to go no further senator beveridge drives home his plea for a wider exer cise of federal functions scarcely an evil is con fined to one state and so when an evil is general states acting separately to combat it have never been able to do so uniformly as such evils affect them as a nationality not as a state the american people acting in common as one nation not as members of  segregated  sovereign groups must interfere to destroy them but where an evil or benefit is purely local and does not operate beyond the state which it concerns then the state has a clear function to remove theevil or bestow orsecure the benefit  the true relation of the states to the nation is the same as that of a municipality to the state senator beveridge quotes an eminent senatorial lawyer as saying to him  and that is to what we are coming he submits that the extent to which the american people are divided precisely measures the extentto which their powver to end abuses is diminished it is all summmed up in the republican motto iunited we stand divided we fall no jugglery of words as to what is or is not constitutional can impair the purpose of americau free institutions expressed through the national government to make a better people and upon that mighty truth senator beveridge concludes theepublic standsreading the impassioned appeal of the indiana senator suggests the thought that possibly he believes with mr gladstone that the struggles with the south for the first time and definitely decided that to the union through its federal organization and not to the state governments were reserved all the questions not decided or disposed of by the express provisions of the conl stitution itself this view at the time brought down upon mr gladstone a lively controversy some expressing surprise that the veteran states man should not have known the reverse of this proposition to be true had mr gladstones statement been made at this time instead of nearly thirty years ago he might have found defenders of his position from this side of the atlantic which it is certain he did not then
