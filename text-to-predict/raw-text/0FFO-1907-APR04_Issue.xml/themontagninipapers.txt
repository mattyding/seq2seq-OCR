colonial an foreignintelligencethe montagnini papersletter from l clemwenceauyeah our own coeespondentparis apl the pufication in yesterdays figaro of the text of a despatch from mgr montagnini to cardinal merry del val containing what pur ported to be a remark by m piou presi dent of the catholic organization the action liberale to mgr mortaguni as to the venality of  clemenceau has bronght forth a letter from m clexenceau couched in vehement terms mgr montagnini plainly stated that m piou had observed to him that m clemenceau might be bought but that his pricewould be too high m piou categorically denied having made that statement but hi clemencean evidently attached no value to his denial and takes up the cudgels for mgr montagaini he writes  you say that the dtei is very explicit i agree with you monsieur le redacteur only can you forget that this dmenti is addressed tothe representative of the holy see in france accused by the most militant member of the roman catholie party of having lied to the supreme pontiff by attributing to a very dear friend his own calumnies  i will not conceal from you that this dimenti which seems to you quite natural goes counter to all my ideas of pontifical diplomacy what  the residence of the nunciature is supposed to have become a hiunt of the lowest knavery the mouthpiece of the holy seee will have been guilty of deliberate calumny and falsehood and who is it that says so  the very n who is most in timately connected with it for the defence of the church the very same man with whom it ex changes its most secret thoughts the very same man who before ascending the tribune asks it what he must say yes it is the chief of the catholic electoral enterprise who deliberately without a word of regret without a gesture of pain or even astonishment throws to public contempt the priest the messenger of rome who but yesterday was his friend his confidant his inspirer since i am interested in the affair and the law gives me the right to reply will you permit me here to defend against m piou and against yourself a man whose inteli gence is certainly below mediocrity but con cerning whom there is nothing to show that his frame of mind is that of the low malefactor which he certainly would be if mi piou told the truth yon will not be able to find that m montagnini could have any interest in inventing the whole of this extravagant story on the other hand the interest of m pio to speak as he is reported to have spolken by mi montagnini is clearly evident he was engaged in a formidable enterprise he was leading to battle au the enemies of the republic under the flag of rome with the assistance of all the forces of the church for the first time since mï¿½ay  the coalition believed in sucess we know to day how events were to deceive that hope bat at that time among the clergy it was ecrrently believed that the separation law had revolted the country that the republicans were marching towards disaster and that the majority would certainly be reversed consequently no effort was sparedl it was war to the knife now the sinews of war are money as is well known much money was required and hi piou spared no pains to collect it counting above all on the cooperation of the church the principal beneficiary in case of success this is not the occasion to go into particulars of the various finnncial enterprises of i piou in view of the elections sufice it to recall that as far back as august   mi montagnini announced to cardinal merry del val the organization under the presidency of hi piou of the societe des eons journau with a capital of a million francs eo pro vided by the action libdraleand m fdron vrau in february  hi pioe sent father roavier to rome to seek for support for the futre elections and rome soon intimated to cardinal coulli that all distribution of money collected by the catholics of france for the elections should be made through hi pioum clemenceau then refers to his interview with hi piou at the house of an a merican iady he says the frame of mind of m pioil could not have been very different when three months later we met at the house of the third person of whom he has spoken he stll wanted money a great deal of money for the bottomless pit of his electoral game he tapped on all sides m thou became the master tapster of the vatican andwhen direct tapping did not suceeed he had recourse to the manmuvre which i have just pointed out in con nexion with the univers and was bound to drift finally towards methods for wvhich excess of scruple would be out of place let us see what he did m piou explains that he met me at luncheon at the house of a third person what he omits to state is that this meeting was solieitedby himself he had not seen me for  years he said all at once he missed me he then addressed himself to an american ladywhomiknowone of the glories of our modern school of painting who wrote to me to ask whether i would meet m piou at luncheon i had no reason to refase but i could not help asking myself what that per sonage could have to say to me nothing happened but when we were taking coffee mi pioa told me in a window corner that hewas opposed to the separation of church and state while i did not conceal from him that i was of a different opinion that was all i could not help expressing my surprise to some of my friends  fancy i said  m ptou wanted to talk to me and he said nothing what could have been his object   today since i have read the montag nini papers that object does not seem to me very difficult to divinem pion saw hi clemenceau  he shook some of his convictions he has not yet got hold of him but he might do so if he were provided with the means and the simpleminded montagnini swallows the new tapping by announcing that with a large sum of money one of v the partisans of separation miight be boughtthis plan is politically stupid as by buying a man yon do not buy his party but if you con sider the operation as a simple form of tapping it seems on the contrary quite rational being traditional among sharpers suppose that the pope had replied to the disguised solicitation of ai pion and had provided lavish funds who would have received the money i would like to know  necessarily hi ptou himself as none other was entitled to continue the game played at the luncheon at the house of the bonne dame ainericaine it was sufficient for m plou to see me publicly under any pretext to be able to say on going away to the friend who would wait for him outside my door the thing is done for the rest nothing could be simpler if i ased that the rights of catholics should be respected m pioa would say  you see that is the consequence of my bargain if i were to speak against the privileges of the church mi piou would exclaim without me he would have been far worse meanwhile the amount to buy me over would pass into the hands of the candi dates whose saccess was to raise h piou on apinnacle the proceeding is perhaps not one of refined delicacy but it is known that the society of jesus is not very particular the whole affair therefore amounts so far as i can judge to a mere tapping manouvre conceived and executed only partiallyfor want of dupes snfficiently credulousby a mnonsieur comme i faut who has not even the courage of his methods the rascals who rob andmurder deserve public esteem when comparewith a man who tries to dishonour people in tdark under the most absolute secrez y and thinws ho mij t out ef it when detected bv st mertedenials i have given the facts i have deserbed the personage let the publie conseience judgethe british ambassadorin a despatch to cardinal merry del val also published by the figaro and dated august   mgr montagnini reports a call he had received from the british ambassador sir francis bertie nobody acquainted with his excellency can suppose that he assumed with mgr montag nini whom he saw for the first time the eon fidential tone which that gentleman has thought proper to attribute to him his aceount of what the ambassador said to him is therefore to be taken with some reserve mgr montagnini alleges that the ambassador referring to his stay in rome spoke of having had occasion at that time in certain cirenmstances to communieate with the vatican and of having been present at the first mass with gregorian singing in company of a member of the noble guard and in a place of honour mgr montagnini continues thus he the ambassador spoke to me with a certain amount of satisfaction of the visit paid by edward vii to the vratican the ming of england refused the escort which the quirinal had up to the last moment wanted to give him as he thought it not the proper thing considering the august sovereign he was going to see sir francis bertie spoke highly of the english passionist fathers who have a chapel in romehe said that his government was to have appointed a catholic ambassador in berlin but that the emperor william on being sounded gave it to be understood that he would prefer a protestant ambassador yet most of the german ambassadors in london have been catholiesmgr montagnini gratnitously observes that these refleetions betray a certain illfeeling against the emperor wiliam sir franeis bertie he adds praised france as being a country full of resources the only one that could live by the produce of its own soil and industry the ambassador further remarked that all monarehieal and imperialist agitation in france was vain and that the republicau form of government was that which suited france best but the re public must be wise well organized the initiator of true liberty and opposed to the idea of the separation of church and state otherwise the fault would rest with the conservatives and particularly with the nobility who had stood aloof from politics leaving free scope to the radieals who recoiled before no effort and trouble and would in case of need lay down their lives for successthe miatin publishes a set of documents proving the systematic intervention of cardinal merry del vals agent mgr montagnini in the domestic afiairs of france and in particular the complicity of m piou and the vtican through out and after the period of electoral pro paganda in november  the combes scheme for the separation of church and state was proposed to the chamber in the letter in whieh he announces that fact to the cardinal mgr montagnini reveals that it was the catholic jurisconsult and deputy m groussau who posted him up and reports that cardinal richard was very pessimistic as to the outlook the cardinal archbishop of paris recommended the immediate study of the position of the catholics towards the state in england and america cardinal richard expressed his confidence in m pious organiza tion the action librale indeed in june of the folowing year it becomes evident that the action liberale and mgr montagnini are working hand in hand with regard to the future elections and the foreign and domestic affairs of france mgr montagnini however has no illusions as to m plious charaeter as is clear from a remark in a letter from him to the cardinal secretary of state he speaks a propos of m pions hesitation over the choice of a constituency of the latters  small courage when it is a question of putting himself forward the election of m ploa was looked upon by the vatican as so important that it exerted its influence in manifold ways in his behalf notably as appears from this correspondence in instruct ing the archbishop of rennes to request another catholic candidate to retire in m pious favour the archbishopwhether from prudence or loyalty to his duties as a concordatory prelate does not appear from these documentshad serious compunctions about intervening in electoral matters but m piou finally sueeeeded in inducing cardual merry del val to take those direet measures of episcopal authority which eventually resulted in m pious election to the chamberthe energy and tne devotion of mgr mon tagnini to the orders of the vatican are not more conspicuous in these documents than is the responsibility of cardinal merry del val this fact is emphasized in a suggestive set of papers from the montagnini dossier published by the clerical organ the autorit cardinal merry del val repeatedly congratulates his agent on the conscientious work he is doing and praises him for his cautious and prudent temperament he assures the zealous young secretary of his  special friendship s for him and in a letter the date of which is not given by the autortw cardinal merry del val writes to mgr mon tagnini i am much pleased with your intelli gent zeal and your spirit of sacrifice as also with your prudence try to listen well to report everything and to talk littlefinally the temps publishes a letter from cardinal merry del val to mgr montagnini dated august   while the separation bill which had been voted by the chamber was being examined by the committee of the senate the cardinal recommends his agent to take measures in order that  public demonstrations may be multiplied against the bill but to act never theless with extreme eaution so as not to get compromised
