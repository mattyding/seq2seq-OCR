broach cotton by the admixture of inferior kinds and raised the question whether action against this practice could be taken by government the matter was referred to the governorgeneral in council and at his instance it formed a branch of inquiry in the survey of gujarat cottons then being undertaken by mr fletcher the deputy director of agriculture in tho bombay presi denev the government of india have now forwarded to mr morley a copy of his report and have stated their conclusions and those of the bombay government thereon the despatch states that there is no evidence to show that the broach cotton plant has degenerated and points out that measums are being taken at the experimental farms at surat to keep up and if possible to improve the quality of the plant the survey has dis posed of the assumption that there has been deteriora tion owing to tho substitution of other varieties by culti vators the deterioration if any is due to adulteration with poorer cottons after the crop is
