trout fishingeoutern engliush streamsrom a co ondmthe past halfcentury has witnessed a thorough revolution in the method of flyfishingfor english trout the old plan was to attach two or three flies to the east throw them down stream and work them against the stream under its surface this answered well enough a hundred years ago colonel peter hawker experienced no difficulty in filling a basket from the test although his lures and tackle were so coarse as would assuredly send every modern trout shuddering to shelter but as fishers became more numerous and emulous and there are probably  anglers now for every one in hawkers day fish became wary and sophisticated it was borne in upon their under standing that no good whatever could come of seizing something like an insect from the mouth of which proceeded a glittering plainly visible flbre they also learnt to recognize an importanb difference between flies float ing placidly down the surface of a stream and simulacra of the same proceeding against the current by subaqueous leaps and bounds how such intelligence is transmitted from generation to generation of fishes is one of the problems of biology for trout possess no literature nor is it probable that oral instruction serves their turn seeing that the parental duties cease with the shedding of the spawn indeed it behoves troutlets to give papa and mamma a wide berth for infanticide is well established in the commnunity of fishes as a supplement to a lean larderanyhow it has come to pass that to ontwit the vigilance of chalkstreaxn trout men have had to mend their method almost as hopefully might one set forth to angle for oysters in the serpentine as to start fishing in the old  chuck andchanceit  manner in the pellucid waters of test or itehen a single fly exact counterfeit of the insect whereon the fish are feeding dressed on a diminutive eyed hook and attached to sx feet or thereby of the finest silkworm gat is cast aggainst the streama and allowed to foat down dry on the surfaee nor is the cast made at random as sufficed of yore the fisherman stalks watchfully through the meadow till he detects a delicate dimple in the water betokening the rise of a fish at the natural insect or he may perceive a trout not actually rising but lying in wait for what the current may bring within reach now is the supreme momentnow the time to tesb the nnglers nerve and skill the tiny lure no bulkier than a gnat must be lightly lodged on the watera couple of yards above the fish so that it may float down over his unsuspecting snout a very slight miscarriagemiscalculated range bagged line or dragging flywill set the trout down or put him to flight and the fisher must fare off in quest of another but if all goes right the fish rises to meet the sailing fly not with the splash and flurry of a north country trout but ever so gentlyfurtively as it were scarcely breaking the surfaee a turn of the wrist and the little barb goes home the rest remains with the man on the bankif the said man is a salmon fisher be must not resent a word of caution in setting out upon this more delicate craft the salmon fisher keeps a finger on the reel line to give the check necessary to fix a large hook in a rising fish woe betide him if he do the same when angling with dry fly among heavy trout  the reel line mnst be left perfectly free the reel itself must be light running else the fine gut will snap at the moment the trout turns downward with the fly in his mouth or in his first rush when he feels the steelthero be many who claim for this method of fishing the highest rank in the anglers craft preferring the subtlety of the chalkstream trout to the violence of the norwegian salmon champions of the respective branches may be left to settle their rivalry but there is some interest thongh it be merely of an antiquarian kind in tracing the new system of flyfishing to its origin the earliest directions for using the dry fly with which i am acquainted occur in pulmans  vademecum of flyfishing of whiel excellent little treatise the second edition as published by longmans in when the stato of the atmosphere says the author is favourable for the production of flies they come down in swarms snd the fish in order to seizo theam tho more casily station themselves close under the surface gently lifting their noses to catch them as they sail over now it is impossible to make a soaked artificial fly swim upon the water as the natural flies do so that when cast by the angler to a fish thus occupied it very commonly escapes his notice engaged as he is at the surface by sink ing m the water beneath him this is plain because if the wet and heavy fly be exchanged for a light and dry one and passed in artistlike style over the feeding fish it will partly from the circumstance of its owvn buoyancy be taken in nine cases out of ten as greedily as tho living insect itself we admit however that to ensure this imitation of the predominant species at least as regards colour and size is required  opining that if the dry fly be widely different in these respects the fish will bo surprised and startled at the novelty presented and saspend feeding until the appaannce of its known and familiar preyhere had the necessity for casting up stream been insisted on we should have had the whole art and craft of dryfly fishing in a nutshell all the profuse literature which has appeared on this matter during the last sixty years has been merely an elaboration of the same precept in truth the only important changes in practice consist in the use of eyed hooks and paraflin the latter being applied to tho fly to prevent its getting soaked thus saving the fisherman the exertion of waving his rod rapidly to and fro between each cast to dry the fly note in this respect the advantage of dipping the flies in parafiin days weeks or months before they are wanted for use they dry rapidly and for ever afterwards are completely waterproofthere are days in early april almost irresistible in their allurement to the trout fisher soft air gentle sunshine nbundant rise of fly trout busily on the feedwhy should one refrain from taking advantage of these ideal conditions  quid obstat  ah  have a little patience it is a wise provision which on most of the renowned southern english trout streams delays the opening of the season till the ist of may in the swift waters of the border counties where trout average much smaller than in the south they are often in prime condition before the end of april but larger fish require many weeks of high feeding to recover shape and complexion after the exhausting effort of spawning no group of fishes deteriorates so much in appearance with loss of condition as the salmon sea trout and river trout which three types in all their differing forms are now classed by scandinavian ichthyologists as varieties of a single species char belong to the salmon tribe also but are now classed as a separate genus salveli nuss easily distinguished from that of salino by the absence of teeth on the posterior part of the vomer or palatal bone char increase in beauty at the approach of the spawning season their sides flaming with orange and carmine hues but salmon and trout become very unsightly both in shape and in complexion the salmon repairs his appearance by a sojourn insalt water where he staffs himself with herrings and other nourishing food thatthere abounds but the river trout has not learnt the trick of seasonal migration and must content himself with the more meagre diet sufpplied by fresh water let the angler then yespcct the troults period of convalescence and refrain from pursuit till his quarry is completely restored to vigour and beautyenglish trout streams especially those of the southern counties fall into two classesnamely those whereon the mayfly abounds and those whereon it comes not at all opinion is pretty sharply divided as to the advantage of having this beautiful ephemerid for although the stimulating and abundant food which it provides increases the weight of the trout and although mayfly fishing is very exciting while it endures the visitation seldom lasts more than a fortnight and is followed by many weeks of ianzqor and redletioa oui thepart of the fish during whieh they can scarcely be tempted to look at any less import ant lure nevertheless the mayfly season which despite its title is never at its height before june is well under way is a carnival which no lover of nature should fail to enjoy the dancing swarms of brieflived flies attract many predatory creatures besides trout rooks and starlings chaffinches wagtails swifts swallows and many other birds pursue the tooth some insects  all the river banks present a scene of mingled beauty and massacre jand when the curtain falls towards the imiddle or end of the month reaction sets in swarms of little dans so highly appreciated by i the trout in the earlier season float almost unnoticed down the stream onlv here and there a fish lazily sipping and sucking one downthe effect of these mayfly orgies upon the appetites of fish is not surprising for the quantity of succulent diet consumed is enormous a few years ago in a single day mr hollandhibbert of munden took  trout weighing b with dry mayfly from the hertfordshire gade he had the diligence to count the mayflies contained in the stomach of one b trout and found no fewer than  either undigested or so incompletely digested as still to be recognizable were it possible to multiply that total by the number of trout in the river one would arrive at some approximate notion of the prodigality of nature which prepares the mayfly for its fleeting dis play two or three days at the most by causing it to exist for as many years as a sluggish crawling larva dwelling in and subsisting upon river mudfrom an angling point of vieew the extreme diligence shown in weedcutting and raking out mud from the river channels is very mischievous probably it is in consequence of these operations carried to excess that the mayly has dis appeared from many streams where it abounded in other years it is never seen now in the itehen above abbots worthy and however reasonably one might hesitate to introduce it where it was never indigenous efforts should be made to retain it where it survives and to restore it to streams which bave lost it for of all rural scenes none dwells more sweetly in memory than that of an english river gently flowing through sunshine and shade under a mist of silent glittering wingsa highland gillie was telling me a few days ago how his musster had taken him to london for a fortnights sightseeing  and how did you like it   i aslked  ah  but london is a dark place quoth he so it is and whereas hedonists recognize no more precious element in pleasure than the charm of contrastsurely no man can secure that more completely than the londoner who escaping from streets and squares trams and tubes is free to wander rod in band through the lush verdure of a hampshire river valley for unlike moorland burns and rainfed rivers dwindling to mere trickles in the summer heats these clear southern streams are distilled from the heart of the chalk downs which have been suck ing up the winter rains and snows and storing them against tho season when the land is most athirstonly of late years have men realized the re sourees of english trout streams in providing the most refned quality of feld sport a mile or two of good trout fshing within reasonable reach of london such as ffty years ago might havo ben had for the asking or even without the asking will now command a rent equal to that paid for good salmon filshing in the north exor bitant enough it may seem when set against the weight of trout brought to basket but who shall calculate in cash the value to a city man of long hours spent in the open air during the sweet o the year it is not alone from the inhabitants of the stream that he draws his enjoyment but from the life that enlivens the beauty that adorns its banks for it is beside the waters that all the loveliness of every countryside willbe found concentratedbut the iient saw holds goodcormptio optimi pesafma if there is nothing so fair as a clear ilowing river there is nothing so foul as a polluted one i stood last month beside the buckinghamshire wick i knew it a few years ago as a most troutfnl stream trouts renowned for their size and beauty today the water is opaque with flocculent waste from a paper mill the channel is lifeless not a fin stirs not a fly emerges from the stream even the waving waterweeds are no more we are still it seems in that inchoate stage of civilization which sanctions the destruction ot the wholesomeness amenity and value of miles of river to enable a manufacturing company to earn haiidsome dividends this is the doctrine of laisezfaire with a vengeance
