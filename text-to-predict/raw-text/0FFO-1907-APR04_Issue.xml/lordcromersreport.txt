lord cromers reportegyptian nationalismunder the heading egypt no  cd the foreign office has issued lord cromers annual reports on  the finances adriinistra tion and condition of egypt and the sudan in  these reports are as usual of the most exhaustive character but in view of the speeial interest which attaches at the present moment to the political situation in egypt we confine ourselves today to quoting in full the seetion dealing with the egyptia nationalist move mentit is difficult even for thoso who have an extensive knowvledge of egyptian affais to differentiate the various currents of thought which in ono form or another are moving in the direction of creating a local public opinion favourable to the eatirely novel idea of egyptian nationalism i say that the idea  entirely novel for it has to be remembered that for centuries past the egyptians have been a subject race persians greeks romans arabs from arabia and bagdad cireasslans and finally ottoman tnrks have successively ruled over egypt but we have to go back to the doubtful and obscure precedent of phaxonio times to flnd an epoch when possibly byt wa ruled by egyptians even now egyptian nation ism n a plant of exotic rather than of indigenous growth the idea in any form vhich can at al bo regarded as serious is the outcome of that contact with europe to which nubar pasha alluded throuagh the mouth of the reigning ehedive when ho said that eb pt no longer formed part of africa it has been evokedby the benefits which with a rapidity probably unparalleled in history have bean conferred on the country by the introduction of western civilization at the hands of an aliea race and it is surely the irony of political destiny that that race or tho instruments through whom it has principally acted should bo represonted as tho principal obstacles to the realization of schemes the coneeption of which is mainly due to their own actioni have spoken of the extreme difficulty of differ entiating the various opinions current in egyptian society in connexion wdth this subject i venture to utter a note of warning against rapid end sweeing generalizations in dealing vith egyptianaffairs ltmis too often forgotten that egyptian society is split up into quite as nmnerous sections representing difterent and often divergent interests and opinions as the society of any heuropean country the dificuldty of arriving at any soamd conclusions as regards local feelings and aspirati ms is not indeed so fonnidable as in india where the casto system interposes a great if not insuperablo bar to social intercourse between europcans and the greater part of tho population at the same time differences of race religion language and manmers and customs count for much i know of many cases of europeans who have resided for long in egypt and who appear to bo under the impression that they know something of egyptian opinion whereas generally all they know is the opinion of some one or morm sections of egyptian society usually those resident in the principal townswith whom they happen to have been thrown in contact i hasten to add that i do not protend to any very superior dogreo of knowledgo i have lived too long in the east to dogmatizo about the views of the inconsistont eastern for whoso inconsistency moreover i entertain much sympathy by reason of the fact that the circum stances in which he is placed render consistency very difficult of attainment all i ask is that the extreme difficlty of tho subject should be recog nized and that when it is recognized some caution should be exercised lest hasty conclusions should bo drawln from incomplete and often incorrect data i know nothing more true than the following words of professor sayce who is probably as qualified as any enropean can be to sp�ea on the subjectthose who have been in the east and bavo tried to ningle with the native population know well how utterly impossible it is for the european to look at theworld with the same eyes as the oriental for a while indeed the european may fancy that he and the oriental under stand one another but sooner or later a time comes when he is suddenly awakened from his drean and fnds himself in the presence of a mind which is as strange to him as would be the mind of an inhabitant of satuonthe difficulty of dealing with this subject is moreover enormously enhanced by the fact that but few egyptians have in political or administrative affairs a very clear idea of wbat they themselves want whilst the practice of advocating two separte programmes which are mutually destructive of each other is the rule rather than the exception the xnim qut reit la fin vcut us awwepis generally scouted i have frequently had expressed to me by egyptiansamongst whom i am glad to be able to cont many personal friends who speak to mo very franklya paradoxical desire to secure all the advantages of the british occupation which they fuuy recognize without the occupation itself i havo had a leading egyptian urge me to employ fewer europe ans in the government service and in the same breath ask me to arrange that a lawsuit in which he was interested should bo tried by a british judge i have kmnown a warm advocate of egyptian rights plead earnestly for the appointment of a lritish rather an egyptian engineer to superintend the distribution of water in his ovprovince over and over again have i had it pointed out to mo that the authority of the egyptian maoudirs is weakened by the presence in their respective provinces of british inspectorswhilst at the same time the withdravwal of the inspectors would lead to disastrous consoquences conclusions in both of which i entirely agree as to corruption i need only say that i have known scorcs of eses in whioh individualsoften inaveryhigh position have inveighed bitterly against the blackemail which they have to pay to the subordinates of the public works and other departments and at the same time have refused to make auy formal complaints or to mention names thus depriving thre superior authorities of the only effective arm wvhicn might enable such practices to be checked i could multiply instances of this sort but i have said enough for my present purposewvith these preliminary remarks i propoe to describe to the best of my ability the present phase of tho egyptian national movement and to sot forth my peracanl opinion as to the treatment vwhich it should receivewhilst it would be altogether incorrect to say that tho egyptiau national movement is wholly paislamic it is certain that it is deeply tined with panislamism tnis is a fact of which i havo forlong been aware and to which if i may judge from the utterances of the local press many europeans in egypt have albeit somewhat tardily now become alive it would be easy worn it necessary or desirable to do so to adduce abundant evidence in support of this statement here i will onlv say that tho events of last summer merely disclosed one newv foature in the egyptian situation admitting what is unquestionably the case that religion is tho main motive power in the east nud that the theocratic form of govcrnment possesses peculiar attraction for easterms it might still have been anticipated that the recollections of the past and the present highly prosperous condition of egypt as compared to the neighbouring provinces of turkey might have acted as a more effectual barrier to the growth of panislamism than apparently was the caso i use the word  apparently  with intention for in spite of all outward appearnnces i am by no means convinced that panislaamio sympathies extended very deep down in egyptian society and i an quite confident that had there been any real prospect of effect being given to panislmi theories a very strong and rapid revusion of publio opinion would havo taken place however this may be it is clear that panislamiram is a factor in the egyptian situation of which account has to a certain extent to be taken it is therefore necessary to under stand what the term impliespanislamism is generally held to mean a combination of all the mioslers throughout the world to defy and to resist the christian powersviewed in this aspect the movement certainly requires to be carefully watched by all european nations who havo political interests in the east it mav possibly lead to sporadic outbsts of fnaticisn in diierent parts of the worldwve were within a very measurable distance of such an outburst in egypt last spring i see it constantly stated that tho  unrest  to which allusion uas mnade in the houso of commons last snummer was imaginary iam wholly usablo to concur in this view the temperament of the lower classes of tho eqyptian population and notably of the urban population is eminently mercurial they were suddenly lashed into a furyby the inflammatory and mendacious writings in the ianlslamio press and they subsided into compartive trenoutility with almost equal suddenness when the british garrison wes increased and when the writers in the vernacular press under pressure ezerted on them by the more intelligent of their own countrymen moderated their tone but that for eomo littlo while a situation of real danger existed i have not the smallest doubt very numerous reports reached mae of threats uttered a ainst christians and europeans the vagae rumours wkich in the east are the usual precursors of disturbace bad been current to a remark able degree tho huropean inhabitants were alarmed and began to flock into the towvns eitherwas their alarm at all unreasonable in my report for  pp  idesenbed in detail the events which occured i alexandria towards the closo of  a chance quarrel between two greeks led to a somewbat serious riot which at once assumed an antichristian form i have no hesitation in saying that if as vas by no meansmprobnble some adventitious incident of tois sort had occurred during the height of theb excitement caused by the turcoegyptian frontier incident the consequences might and probably would have been serious l vish to add that the idea which i ocasionally see advauced that this  unrest was in any degreo duo to the polig pursued by the british and egyptian governmentsconnexion with the internal affairs of egypt is devoid of the smallest real foundation it vwas not partly but wholly due to the fact that under panislamic influence a large portion of the population had been led to believe that a wanton attack was being made on the head of the moslem religionto return from this digression if i am sceptical of panislamism producing any more serious results then sporadio outbursts of fanaticism it is in the fist place because i greatly doubt the possibility of moslem co operation and cohesion when once it becomes a ouestion of passing from words to deeds  and in the second place because xam quite conjfdent of e power of euroshould the necessity arise to deal efectively ith the material though not with the spiritual aspects of the movementpanislamism is moreover a convenient phrase for conveying a number of other ideas more or less con nected with its primary significtion for the purpose of my present argument these are of greater practical importance than the wider defnition to which i have alluded abovein the first place it means in egypt ore or less com i dieto subserviewu to the sutatn asomewhat nove loment is thus introduced into lgyptinn political life until recently the egyptian nationil movemient has been on distinctly antiturkish lines tho arabi revolt vas in its essence directed against turkoy and the turks i umderstand however that the leaders of tho national movement now declare that they have ro wish to draw closer tho bonds between tnrkey and egypt and that their only desire is to maintain the suzerainty of tho sultan this language contrasts so remarkaobly ith utterances of a very recent date that it is impossible not to entertain somo suqspicion that it is an afterthoughlt du to a correct appreciation of the fact that a more extended proturkish programme is calculated to alienato sympathies which it is desirable to maintain and to foster it would however be unfair topin downtho nationalist party asa body to the chance utterance of a fow irresponsible individnals accepting therefora this later version of tho programme as corrcet i have to observo that the suzerainty of the snltan over egypt has nover so far as i am aware been impugned noither does it appear probablo that it will ba endangered so long as all parties to the pirmanwhjch it has to be borno in mind is a bilatoral arrangemonttake no action cutsida the limits of their respective rights the sinai peninsula incident derived its main importance from the fact that there appeared at one timo to be some risk that the firman and the documents which form part of it would be violated to tho detriment of egyptin the second place panislamism almost necemarily connotes a recrudesceneo of racial and religious enimosity many of its adherents aro i do not doubt inspired by genuine religions fervour others again whether from indifference verging on agnosticism or from political and opportunist motives oras i trust ma sometimes be the casefrom having really assimilated modern ideas on the subject of religious toleration would be willing were such a course possible to sepirato the political from the religious and even possi ly from the racial ises if such are their wishes and intentions i entertain very little doubt that they will find them impossible of execution unless they can convince the moslem mases of their militant islamism they will fael to arrest their attention or to attract their sympathy appeals either overt or covert to racial and religious passions are thus a necessity of their existenceo in order to ensure the furtherance of their political pro grammein the third plac pantsamis almost necessarily connotes an attempt to regenerato islam on islnmic linesin other words to revivify and stereotypoe in the twentieth century the principles laid down more than a thousand years ago for the guiddace of a primitive society thoseprinciples involve a recogoition of slavery laws regulating the relations of the sexeswhich clash with modem ideas and which is perhaps more important than all that crystalliation of the civil crirdnal and canonieal law into one immutable whole which hs so largely contributed to arrest th progrmss of those countries whose populations have embraced tha moslem fathit is for these reasons independent of any political considerations that all who ar interested in the work of egptian reform are constrainedto condemnparnislamism more than this the utmost care has to be exercised lest any natural and very legitimate sympathy for genuine nationalism may not be unconsciously attracted towards a movement vwhich is in reality highly retrograde and deserving of but scant sympathy lt is at times not easy to recognize the panislamio figure wder the nationalist cloaki am however fully aware that side by side with the panisfaic movement there erdsts another which nay possibly be entitled to the designation of national the two movements aro in fact mergod into each other neither is it easy to state with any degree of precision whrem the one begins and tho other ends my conviction is that in roality panilslianis is the predominant partner hiowever this may bo i proceed to discuss the position of the nationl movement independently of any real or imaginary connexion it may have with pan lslamisnit is extremely natural that the idea of creating an egyptian nationalism should have germinated and brought forth some fruit the extent to which the so called national party represents the real wishes and aspirations of the mass of the peoele is indeed more than doebtful over and over again have representative egyptians protested to me strongly against the claim of the leaders of this party to th title which they have arrogated to themselves over and over again has it been urged on me that the party consists merely of a few noisy indiividuals whoso aotion is often duo to no very reput able motives and who in no vay represent the real wishes and aspirations of their countrymen i believe this view of the situation to ba substantially correcl in any cese it may be confidlently stated that the consequences which would inevitably ensue were the progrmme of the national party capable of rapid realization are very im perfectly understood these can be no doubt that the recollection of past abuses is rapidly fading away education moreover as was to be anticipated has awakened ambitions which were formerly dormant the most humble feliah now knowsv that in the eye of the lawv he is the equal of the pabsha a spirit of independ ence wihich was formnerly conspicuouss by its absence has been created under susch circumstances it can be no matter for surrise that the educated youth should begin to clamour for a ter share than heretofore in th government and admntation of their country nothing could be moro ungenerous thsn to withhold a certain amount of sympathy from these very legitimate aspim tions nothing on the other hand could be more unwise than to abstain at this early period of the national movement from pointing outtoallvwho areowiing to isetoraon the limits which for the time being must be assiguied to those aspirations i am too true a friend tothe egyptiasn people to endeavour either to fatter or to deceive themi ask myself therefore vwhat is it that tho young egyptians in so far as their views are represented by the national party wish to accomplish in the irst place they vish to rise to such of the higher administrative posts in the government corsice as are now occupied by europeans i have not a word to say against this aspiration lpropose in another portion of this report to deal fussy with this branch of the question hero i will only speak of the wider and moro strictly political portion of the national programme i understand that what is demanded is a wide and inmmediate extension of parliamentary institutions a good deal of misappre nenaionappears to exist especially in england as to the extent to which parlirmentary institutions already exist in egypt i deal with this qurestion in another portion of my report for the moment i propose to confine mvself to inquiring how far it would be possible or desirable to extend the powers of tho legislatve council and assemblyi am not aware that the egyptian naticnal psaty has ever formiulated its progrmme m any very precise terms but so far as i am able to judge they advocate the creation in egypt of an institution similar to the british liouso of commons i havo not noticed whether it is proposed to vest all power in a singleo chmber or vwhether it is suggested that a second chamber wlhich would take the placo of the french semate or the british house of lords is contemplated neither am i quite clear as to whether it is proposed that the egyptian parliament should legislate without distinction ior all tho inhabitanteof egypt or only for local sabjects the former of theso two methods would require the consent of all the powers which would certainly not be obtained leaving aside these doubtful hult very important points i conceive i shell be right in holding that what is pro posed is orst the creation of a ministry responsible to the chamber end daecndent for its existence on the maintenance of a majority a nd seconldly complete control over the financeos of the country such as that exercised by the elected chmnbers inathe uinited elngdom end in other european countriesthe adoption of the first of these proposals would unless i am much mistaken produce a state of things which mav without exaogeraticn bh termed chaotic intrigule of all sorte vvouldibe rife the system of bribery and corruption wvhich w as at one time so premalent in the country and which soeven now only dyina alingerngl death would receive a fresh impulse it ra more than probable that under the speciouls titlo of free institu tions the worst evils of personal government wouldrapeartho adoption of tho second proposalthat of handing over complete financial control to the chamberwould almost inevitably lead to national bankruptcyit requires irdeed some mental effort to discuss these proposals seriously can any sane man believe that a country which has for centuries past been exposed to the worst forms of misgovernmet at the hands of iss rulers from pharaohs to pashes and in which but ten years ago only  per cent of the men end  per cent of the women could read and write is capable of suddenly springlng into a position which will enable it to exercise full rlghts of autonomy with advan tage to itself and to others interested in its welfa  the idea is absurd tho programme of tho national party is qlte incapable of realization at present and it may wrell b doubted whoether in the form in which it is now conceived it can ever be realized in any eass i must wholly declino to take any part in furthering proposals the adoption of which wouldlnmy opinion constitute a flagrant injustice not only to tho very large foreign interests involved but also to those tea or twelve millions of egyptians to the advancement of whose moral and material welfare i have devoted the best years of mxy lifeis there then no hope for egyptian nationalism  in tho form in whch that idea is conceived by the egyptian national party there is i am convinced little or none but it is well for a nation and even for practical politicians to entertain an ideal even although its realizatica may he distant and beset with many difcua ties i venture therefore as a counterprogramme to that of the egyptian national party to put forward ia ideal which i have for long entertained it is that the only possible egyptin nationality wvdch can everbe created must consist of all the dwellem in egpt irre spective of race rigion or extracton so long as the counatry was wellnigh throttled by impending bansruptcy so long as the fate of the soudan was uncertabs and so long as anglgofench rivalry was in a more or less acute stage discussions or reflections on this subject could be nothing more than academical thes obstacles have now been removed another however remmais so long as the regime of the capitulations in its present form exists not only must the egyptins and the foreigners resident i eppt alwavys bo divided into two separate camps but also no thorough solidarity of interest can be established between the various communities of europeans iates st there can be no zeal cohesion and no concentiated actiou that cohesion can only bo secured by the creation of a local international legislative council i dealt with this subject in mylasti annual report and i revert to it n another portion of this report apart from other grounds on which it may be defended asa reform benetlical alike to europeans and egyptians i maintain that this measure will tend more t any eother to create a com munty of interest amongst the heterogeneous population which inhabits the valley of the nile and that it will be a first step towards the formation of an entiannational spirit in the only sense in which that winit mmbe evoked without detriment to the truo interests of the country i am very folly aware of the difficulties which havo to bh encormtered beform effect can be given to this proposal possibly some lonr while may yet elaps before the first european legislative council meets in egyptbut i havo no fear for the ultimate result the success of the cause which i advocate does not wholly depend on tho opinions of a few individuals whatever mav be their position or inluence neither does it wholly aepend on tbe local opinion whether european or egyptin of the dv the bestowal of legislative autonomv on the europeuns resident in egypt to take the nlace of the present cumbersome snd xnworkable system of legislation by diplomacy is a measure naturlly indicated by the ordinary canons which apply to political evolution the cause vwill certainly triumph although the triumph may be delayedbefore leaving the question of the egyptian national miovement  have yet one further remark to make bosides chore who have assumed the title of nationalist there exists a small but inc number of eggyptians of whom compratively little is eard but who deserve that title quite as munh as their competitors of adifferent school of thought and action i allude to tho partyhich for the sake of brevity i may call the followers of thb late mufti sheikh moimed abdoo i have in proe vions reports frequently alluded to the opinions held by this section of egyptian societyopinions which are very analogous to those advocated by the late seyyid ahmed who founded the aligarh college in india their fundamental idea is to reform various moslem institu tions without shking the mnin pillars on which the faith of islamn rests they are truly nationalist in the seuse of wishing to advance the interests of their countrymen and coreligionists but they arm not tainted with pan islamisrm their progamme if i understand it rightly involves not opposition to but coopertion with eurpeans in the introduction of western civiliation intothe country the ain hopoof egyptian nationalism in tho only true and practica le sense of the word lies in my opinion with those who belong to this party in tho past they have not for resous on which i need not dwell but for which the british advisers of the eiytian government are in no way responsible receivedtuo enoomagemueat they deserve recently however one of their most distinished members snd zagloul pasha was appointed minister of education the main reason for his appointment was not as van sometimes supposed any dissatisfaction vith tho manmer in which the work of tho department of public instruction had been conducted stiu less did it indicate an intention of asing any radical changes in the educational policy heretofore pursued it was mainly due to a desire to associate an able manaund enlightened egyptian of this pa rticular section of society wfith the work of egyptian reform tlhe exprment for such it is wvill be vatched inth interest should it suexced assi hope dan believe will he the case some encouragement wiill bve afforded to rove further in the sme direction shonld it fail the necassarv consequenca will be to throw the continutnce of the work of reform to a greater extent than foerly into european and notably into british hands in any case there can be no retrogressi the vwork of intro ducin western civilization into egypt is proceeding in every epartnient of the state on lines which havo been carefully conausidered and which admit of development bat not of reversal or of radica coagelordoromer adds the following comments on the press in egypti havo always been in favour of allowing freedom to the press in egyt at the same tine i niust admit that my opioii on this smbject is not shared by a very large and influential section of the community notably au the most respectable elements of nativo egvptian society consider that the unfettered licence now allowed to tho vernacalar press is an unmixed evil they complain not without reason that the papers to which i allude mis represent egyptian publio opinion and that they terrorize all those who would otherwise be traly repro sentative of that opinion i must also admit that in the course of he agitation which took place last spring tand summer some of the papors published in arabic did all in their power to shake the confidence of thoso wvo advocate freedom of the press in this country nothing could be more simple than the main facts connected with the smiai boundary dispnte nothing could be more clear than that the policy of the british govern ment was dictated by a trao regard for the interests of gypt and i may add for those of europe generally the fact was fully recognized by his high ness the khedive who ursa consulted at the very com mencement asell as at all subsequent stages of the proceeding s and who as was to be anticipated expressed his entire approval of a course of action which vas mani festly in harmony with egyptian interests nevertheless the policy pursued by the british goverament was represented as a wanton attack on the position held by the headof tho moslem religion and the suzerain of egypt every effort vas made to incite racial and religions animosity it is true that the agitation was superficil and to a great extent factitious the views set forth by the more violent of the writers in the araie press and by tho spealmrs at various meetingswhose utterances which were never reported were often more truly representative of the views of the panislamic partyv than any published newspaper articleswvre never shared by the most influenatil ad intelligent amongst the egyptians nevertheless the agitation clearlv proved two pointsthe first was that the ma of thelegyptian people are still in the highest degree credulous the second was that the agitators are wholly unscrupulous as to the methods which they are prepared to adopt for imposing on the credulity of the masses and for iraing their passionsit was no unfair conclusion to draw from these circum stances that the freedom of the press should be checked without however ente nn into any lengthy arguments on the subject i may say t the conclusion i drew was different it was that in order to afford an additional guarantee for the maintenance of public order and to inspire confidence amongst the lawabiding sections of the community the british garrison should be increased the result is that an additional charge of � asyer has been thrown on the egyptian taxpayersthis necessity is greatly to be regretted especiallv by reason of the fact to which i shall allude more fully in dealing with the financial situation that the egyptian tre ssy cannot nearly meet all the very nmierous cslls which are pouring in from every direction for additional exrpenditure on objects calculnted to prove of benefit to the country i hare howvever no doubt whatever tht the measure was necessry not only for the reasonato which i have alluded abovenaely in order to guarantee the maintenance of public tranquillity hut also becauso it was essential to showtvatbritishpolicyin egypt being based on tho facts of asitnationwhichis only capable of very gradual change is not liable to be inluenced nor the british occupation disturbed by any passing gave of local opinionfor the rest i may sav that i consider it as part of my duty to read many of the articles which appear in the vernacular papersnotably those which are opposed to british policy in egyps i do so mrny with a view to ascertaining whazther they containnaypractial sugestions which are worthy of consideration that the views of the wrfiters should on all subjects ha tinged by their political opinions is natural enough end cannot justly formnntter for com plaint i thought however at one timo that occasion ally something might he icarnt from them as regards dministrative and other local matters of a nonpolitical character in this respect i have been disappointed i find that facts are generally misstated and often wilfully perverted and that vague dcljnation wholly erroneous tmd even fantastio ideas as to the motives and intenrtions not only of england but of other foreign powers and seeping generalities bwhich are not accompanied by any semblance of proof form the principal stockintrade of these writeis i do not remember ever to have read in sny of the nwspapers of which i am now speaking a single accurate welargued or useful article on such matters as finaee education or the wording of the judicial system on the whole i think it maybesaid with truth that constaut perual of those vernacular papers which strongly advocate egyptian autonomy is well calculated to convince one who like mysel is most desirous
