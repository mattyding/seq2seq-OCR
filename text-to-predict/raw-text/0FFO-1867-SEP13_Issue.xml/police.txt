will take the horse home the officer then allowed bim to leave but sent a man after him to see whether he would fuifi his promise and take the horse home instead however of doing that the moment he reached the back of the bluecoat ehospital he reharnessed the animal to the omnibus and drove off the omnibus was one belonging to richard robinson plying between the city and bayswater and therefore
