the united statesfrops an imeric ortesrpondentphilmdelphia aug throughout america our politicians have begun votive preparations for the autumn elections and the candidates for office and the many people who make aliving politics are as busy as bees at present we  j in the midst of the excitements at tendant upon the selection of candidates and the tarious party conventions that make these selections are in full operation for the autumn elections as usual twoparties will be in the fieldtho republi cans and the democrats aud as weu as can be judged at this early day the republicans will be victorious in nearly all the northern states vhile their carrying the greater portion of the south through the agency of the negro vote seems a fore gone conclusion wlhile that party will sweep the country it will not be by any great majority how ever and there are hundreds of counties and cities that the democrats will carry whilo many places are so evenly balanced that both parties anti cipate a victory this makes the race for minor officesand in america nearly every office is an elective oneinteresting rand it is to make the selections of candidates to fill these positions that tho var ious party conventions aro now in session nothing can be of more inte rest to the reader abroad than a description of the mode in which this is done and i propose to devote a short space to it and as the process is the same in nearly every part of the country i will give a de scription of the mode pursued in philadelphia in this city the election is held early in october and there will be chosen a judge for the supreme court of the state a judge for the court of com xnon pleas of the city a sheriff registrar of wills city treasurer city commissioner who has charge of the assessment of taxes clerk of the orphans or probate court members of the state legis lature select and common councilmen alder men and school directors these offices are somo of them very valuablethe sheriff for instance receiving  in fees annually and jonsequently there are many anxious aspirants for them who spend money freely and bring every influence to bear that they can cau into play parties are very evenly balanced in this city which adds to the excitement and as each candidate has hundreds of retainerx who expect to reap a profit from his success through contracts and jobs or clork ships or  pickings and stealings the uproar is so much the greater the organization and mode of operations of each party in this city are essentiauythe same there are  wards each of which is divided into from  to   divisions or collections of  to  voters with a pollingplace where on election day they deposit their ballots each party has a committee in each ward to superintend its affairs nd these committees keep themselves posted as to the political opinions of every voter so that shrewd managers can generally calculate within a few hundred votes how the election is going the foundation of the whole fabric is in the election divisions and there it is generally found that two or three sharp men in each party can control the vote of the division and these controllers are the people whose friendship is courted and whose in fuence is solicited by the candidates for they are the men who make delegateseach party selects its candidates through the medium of conventions to which each division of a ward elects one or more delegates and of course the securing of these delegates is the end to which the exertions of all the candidates are directed the delegates and conventions are not re cognized bylawhowever andare merelythecreations of partytherepublican voters of a divisionwill meet on a stated evening and elect their delegates and thedemocrats will do the same on another evening the very next morning these delegates meet in con vention and nominate the candidates this is the theory but in practice it is found to work very badly for the worst men always get control being a throughly irresponsible arrangementthe man who can cheat thle most neatly always wins mir a and r b are rival candidates mr a for some three months is  hail fellow well met with mr c who is supposed to control a certain division and the people of that division belonging to his party really prefer a for a candidate the night to choose dele gates comes and c is full of promises of sup port to a and actually manages to poll the majority of votes for whim b however at the last moment offers c  for his services and c who receives the votes forgets all that he had promised to a and declares that the delegate returned is the one pledged to b this is the way one stage of the proceedings works and if the dele gate election does not end in a row in which all hands get considerably battered a can only  con test the election or buy up the delegate and he generauy prefers to do the latter the whole pro cess thereore resolves itself into buying and sell ing and the longest purse wins professional poli ticians know this so well that they make it a busi ness to fleece candidates and a man generally spends all he is worth before he secures a nomina tion the completest lottery that ever was invented is a race for office in america delegates are bought and sold over and over again both before and after conventions meet and fights frequently are resorted to in order to accomplish what fair means cannot succeed in doing the conven tions having assembled all the candidates pledge themselves to abide by the choice of the delegates present and then the seleotion begins a dozen men will be voted for at first and ballot after balot is taken the one having the smallest vote being dropped each time as the candidates become fewer the excitement increases and the price of votes rises delegates are openly bought up and paidtheir price and finally the candidate who receives the majority is declared the nominee of the party there wll be dozens of conventions in session at the same time to select different classes of officers but tho mode of procedure is essentially the same in each and the irregular practices of candidates fre quently cause splits in the party that nothing can heal intoxicating drink too generally furnishes the inspiration of the proceedingsand causes the bitterest quarrels excited crowds surround the buildings where the conven tions meet and by their threats and howls intimi date those insido i have known a mob in this city to deliberately break down the doors of a conven tvon and going in throw out of the doors audwnmows obnoxious delegates and nominate a favourite candidate on another occasion a conven tion having been bought up by a candidate the frionds of his opponent kept it imprisoned for a week until the men inside were almost starved sometimes a convention will get into a dead lock ky being equally divided and it will sit in terminably day and night each man afraid fb leavefor fear the opposing faction may gain some advan tage for politics in america men will sacrifice their business their family their health and its excitement is fully as engrossing as that of the gaming table it is a dirty business however and is irn the hands of the very lowest class for respect able men nearly always refuse to have anything to do with it and fraud and money rule in nearly every case philadelphia and the entire country are now goinm through this ordeal which when laid bare is certainly n revolting spectacle but under the present american system of choosing office holders though it is universally deplored there seeos to be no remedy oe the further proceedings of our parties in preparing for the elections after the candidates are selected i will give a short de scription in a future letterwhat is written abovo relates alike to both parties and occurs in the selection of candidates for minor offices no matter what questions of national policy may divide tho parties themselves theseconventions havo very little to do in moulding popular aentiment they are simply americanpolitical inventions for dividing the spoils of officevictory and defeat depend upon other influenestotally beyond tbhs control of conventions and at present party prosects go up and down as congress and the lresidentare wise or foolish in their movements just now republican prospects are bright because congress is not in session and can therefore do nothing wrong while the presi dent by constant exhibitions of iltemper and mulish obstinacy is driving away the few friends who still cling to him the democrats no longer consider themselves responsible for his conduct but the republicans keep charging the responsibility upon them and thus weaken their position the presidents coalition with grant might have strengthened him but this coalition is well nigh broken becauso the president arrogates all power to himself and will yield nothing to grant and as that officer desires to keep fair weather with both parties every effort he makes tosave thepresident endangers him to turn outsouthern commanders may be all vory well but tho president does not doit inthe calm and dinified manner one would expect from so high an official but he gets into a passion over it which to say the least is childish and sheridan and sickles the last one dismissed and pope who is to go in a few days come home as martyrs to be praised and petted for the very wrongdoing that caused their dismissal thus the president by his want of conciliatory power is endangering his con nexion with grant almost the last straw to which he can cling and by his iltemper angers his already too powerful opponents and seems to court impeachment the serious aspect of affairs has already caused a marked riso in the gold premium and if johnson dismisses his cabinet the premium mustgo higher as it wrill be impossible as all men and all parties now distrust him for him to get a cabinet that will last  fortnightthe order relieving sickles has been issued general canby being named as his successor general grant protested against this order as he has done against previous removals and the diffe rences between hfn and the president as to the exact limit of the authority of each caused a cold ness whichmust sooner or later end in a rupture the south meanwhile is in a most painfully uncertain condition as to tho future of the whites and the certainty of the negroes controlling it becomes more and more evident it is truly astonishing that as now reconstructed the poorest and most igdorant class there are to have power while the en of education wealth and landed property are utterly debarred from any voice in the government yet so it is for negro rule at least during several years to come is inevitable i have already reported such registration returns as havereached the north and other returns as they come in nearly all indi cate the negro ascendancy in mississippi the negroes have  majority in louisiana over  majority in alabama over  majority in the city of oharleston south carolina they have  majority while the total registry for south carolina gives them  majority virginia is the only state that shows a white ascendancy and this has a white majority of about  which is owingto the mild policy of general schofield having induced the southern whites of virginia to take part in reconstruction elsewhere however negro ascendancy is inevitable they are hereafter to form one half of all southern juries they are appointed to all kinds of offices and knowing their power they are organizing their party and in several places calling out nearo candidates for con gress the power developed by the blacks and the secret armed organizations discovered among them cause great dread among the whites and have had a strong effect in keeping theem aloof from recon struction general wado hampton on the th of august expressed the feeling of the south carolina whites upon this matter in a letter to a georgia newspaper in which he states distinctly that they prefer to te governed by military rule rather than be reconstructed in the way at present in vogue he counsels justice to the negroes and a with drawal of obstruction to impartial suffrage though he denies the right of congress to interfere with the suflrage in his state thaddeus stevens who is said to be somewhat better than he was a few days since has just written a letter to one of his constituents in which he denounces  conservatism and charges upon the faltering senate the responsibility of not having made the reconstruction laws
