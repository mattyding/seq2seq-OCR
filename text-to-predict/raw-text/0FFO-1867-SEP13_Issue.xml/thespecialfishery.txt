tiil special fiseiry cosis tovthe special commissioners for english fisheries having completed their sittings at maryfort cumberland for the riyer ellen on weduesday delivered judgment in the case of the ncther mill fishery milldam and salmon coop the lowest darn on the river and close to the tide way the chief commissioner mr paterson after reviewing the evidence documentary and oral said there was sufficient to lead the comnmissioners to the reasonable belief that the dain had existed before the th of edward iv  and that therefore it x as novr legal the dam however was illegal in so far as there was no grating at the head and foot of the mil race in order to prevent the fish going up or the fry coming down the race rheir order would therefore direct proper gratings to be made at those places but though the dam and coop were legal the salmon fishery act  contained certain edact ments sec  requiringthat during the annual close season the inscales becks tops and rails of all cruives boxes or cribs and all planks and temporary fixtures used for taking and killing salmon and all other obstructions to the free passage of fish through the cruives cribs or boxes should ho removed this section had been interpreted by the court of common pleas in  hodgson v little to mean that not only the coop and becks but the sluices through which the water passed into the coop must be entirely removed aud therefore it would be ifcumbent ou the owner of this dam and coop mr senhouse to remote the sluices from before the coop so as to perniit the fish to pass and that whether the coop be used for fishing or xot the coop had not been fished since  there must also be a clear opening ot not less than ft in idth from the bottom to the top through this coop whether used for fishing or not durinn weekly close time then see  of the act of  require thatno milldam should be usedforcatching salmon unless it had a passage for fish in it which should have con stantly running through it such a flow of water as would enable the fish to pass the dam during all the time that the coop was working the object of that enactment obviously was that while the coop was enticing the fish one way there should be an alternative left to tho fish of going over the dam in another way all these requirements therefore niust be fulfilled before the coop could be legaly worked and inasmuch as this decision would necessitate considerable alterations the order of the com missioners was directed not to take effect for one mouth from that date hlr senhouse said that the effect of the judgment would be to destroy the value of his mill and take away the supply of water to the town of workington which was taken from his premises to this it was answered that thio conduit had only to be taken higher up to give the usual supply to the town and that the principal mis chief was the building a mill too large for the river and which absorbed all the water of the stream in the summer time in reference to other claims judgment was postponed the cases being incomplete but the chairman took occasion to state publicly what were the principles on which the legality of these dams must be established as there appeared to is so little apprciation shown of the general principles and maxims of law applicable to this class of cases referring to the ancient statutes ke said begin nii with magna charta they prohibited dams and fixed engines in rivers which destroyed the brced of fish of theuens salmon and in particular a statute of the th of edward iv expressly prohibited all persons from mskidn or enhaucing weirs milldams stakes becks and so fortlu which destroyed the fis hence it followed that whoever had since  made any of these prohibited things having such effects had done so in violation of the maxim of public policy then proclaimed and since frequently repeated by the legislature what had been done in tho river ellen and other rivers was this dams had been built across the river diverting the water to a side channel and discharging it into the bed of the river lower down the object being to obtain a cheap motive power for a mill if the mill was large snd the nrver small the dam was built all the higher and tho consequence was that for a period of the year vary ing from one to five months the onginal bed of the river was almostdry no fishlcould comeupto tho dam and when through occasional freshes they got there the dam was too high to pump over and so the fish lay there much at the mercy of whoever chose to take them to stop the fish then was shortly to destroy the breed and all degrees of destruction were found going on according to tho relative size of the dam and of the aver and the caprice or inge nuity of tho miller or poacher if the dam had not a sufficiency of water runniung over it to allow the fish to go up or if it was immoderately high it was difficult to we how it could be lega and it could only be made legal by altering its proportions so as to comply with theso requirements all that the miler said in answer to those objectiods was that when his ancestors first built the miudam he never thoueht of the ash never intended to stop or catch them and was in different to what became of them for he was all the tine only thinking of corn or leathor or some other manufac ture but if a persou did an aot which was prohibited by rtatute or by publio policy he must be taken to havo iu tendedtheuatural consequences of that act no apathy ignorance or credulity of a few individuals or of any com bination of individuals could repeal an act of parliamniet or reverse the policy whioh a series of statutes had impressed on the general law of the laud partial or temporary acquiescence could not put it beyond tho reach of any dis satisfied person at any time to insist on reverting to the policy of the statutes unrepealed it vras the duty of the miller to mako the necessary alterations in the dams at his own coat no man ws entitled to
