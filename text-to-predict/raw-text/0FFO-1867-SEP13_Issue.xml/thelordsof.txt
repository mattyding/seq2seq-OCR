the lords of the admiralty inliverpoolyesterday mr corry chief lord of the admiralty and admiral milne paid a visit to liverpool their principal ob jeet being to take part in the annual distribution of prizes on board the school frigate conway a numerous and fashionable company assembled on board the conway the deck of which had been covered in and suitably decorated for tho occasion in the absence of the mayor who was in attendance at the marriago of his eldest son mr edward lawrence deputy mayor presided and amongst those present were mr hotsfall mp mr laird mp mr r brocklebank chairman of tho mersey docks and harbour board mr beazley chairman of the conway committee and other gentlemen letters of apology for nonattendance were read by the secretary r clarko aspinall from sir johu hay sir john kingcombe captain mends rn captain paynter rn mr s e graves mp and others the secretary also read tho re ports of the examiners mr lw jayneslate examiner and mathematical master at the royal naval college saidit have exarained the papers set for the last atidsummer exa mination in navigation and nautical astronomy and found on comparing the work dono by the students in theso sub jects with the corresponding papers of last year that satis factory as was the previous examination a marked and de cided improvement both in the theoretical and practical parts of nautical astronomy is shown in the present exami nation    they are certainly worth the being in spected by those who are interested in the progress of the conway the report of mr towson scientific examiner of masters and mates to the local marine board of liver po ol was equally satisfactorythe cmauimsn said it was a source of reat gratification to himself to be permitted to occupy once more that posi tion he assured them of the deep interest the mayor took in the welfare of the institution it must be a cause of great satisfaction that they were once more honoured with the presence of the lords of the admiralty it was no mere accidet that they were present but rather the continued indication of a settled policy on the part of her majestys government to take an interest in an institution the merits of whichtheybadso fully recognized he might accept their presence as a recognition of the factthat this institution was doing a specialhe might say a national work for the country hear hear circumstances had prevented this gathering being liad at the usual time in june but he was pleased to see that this delay had not affected the at tendance of the friends of the institution he then pro ceeded to address a few remnarkls to the bovs on the leatdin principles which should regulate their cnduct and then called upon mr corry to deliver the prizesmr conry who was received with much cheering said he learnt from the last report of the committee of mfanagement that the institution was designed mainly to train and to complete the education of boys in tended for officers in the merchant navy and it was impossible for any one in the office which he had the honour to fill not to take the deepest interest in sueh an institution having such an object in view in time of peace under the continuous service system and with the large annual entry of boys iuto it the navy might almost be said to be selfsustaining but on the occurrence of anyemer gency requiring any material increase its cxisting strength it was to the mercantile marine that it must look for the necessary supply of seamen and the quality of these men must in no small degreo depend on the officers who had commanded thom this institution therefore having for its object the training of the officers of the mercantile marine must command the sympathy of those who had the responsibility of the maintenance of our naval power but independent of thatthere was another connecting link we had now a royal naval reserve an the officers of that reserve held commissions similar to those hold by the officers of the royal navy and in the event of war woulid be called upon to share the duties and responsibilities of those officers no doubt one day many of those he was addressing would belong to that re serve and it was important that they should receive such a naval education as hewas happy to learn they did receive on board this ship qualifying them to discharge the re sponsible duties they might be called upon to undertake in her majestys navy but there was yet a more intimate bond of union between the conway and the navy he understood thatthis institution was mainly established by the mercantie marine service associltionconsisting of  merchant captains trading from the port of liverpool but that those gentlemen independent of their own service provided for the education on board the ship of cadets in tended for hler majestys navy that was an additional reasou why he and his coueagues should take an interest in the ship he could not refer to the preparation given iu this ship for appointnientsin the royal navy without say ing that he was sure the cadets appreciated as was deserved the generous manner in which her majesty had come for ward to encourage them cheers it had been usual for the first lord of the admiralty to place a naval cadet ship of tho first class at the disposal of the committee  but as this year the successful com petitor had reachea an age which disqualified him he mr corry had conferred upon him a cadetshipofthe second class and through the kindness of his friend and col league sir sidney dacres be had been able to place a second cadetship in the bands of the committee cheers alluding further to the intimate connexion which existed between the navy and the mercantile marine he said he was reminded that no vessel could be better appropriated for this double training than the conway  for an carly friend of his own named fair entered the mercantile service volunteered thence into the iloyal navy and after a dis tinguished career died when in command of the frigate conxway on the cape station cheers he would wish to impress upon their minds that however great might be the knowledge they acquired on board this ship it would be of no avail unless accompanied by those high moral qualities whioh wero most requisite in those who were destined to command hear hear it would be preslmptuous almost in him to endeavour toinstil this lesson into their mnidsfor nothing could be morc beautiful than the language in which her majesty had im pressed the same lesson upon them he mightbe permitted to say that it was one of the most necessarv qualities of a sailor that he should be strictly sober since a single act of intemperance whether when in command of a ship or of a watch might lead to the loss of a ship and of many valua ble lives hear bear he was happy to know that tho instruction given to them on board the conway was weu calculated to qualify them in all these moral and intel lectual respects cheers the distribution of prizes was then proceeded with her majestys gold medal for general proficiency and the possession of fearless and manly qualities was awarded to william cowley and the admi ralty nomination to a naval cadetship together with her majestys prize of a binocular glass aud  to john f marshall and the second admiralty cadetship to g f daloy mr horsfall mp mr laird mip and other gentlemen afterwards addressed the assembly and votes of thanks were accorded to the lords of the admiralty the donors of prizes the mayor and the chairmanthe lords of the a dmiralty accompanied by the chair man of the dock board and by ur john laird mip mr horsfall mp and the principal guests then proceeded on board the alert and made an inspection of ier majestys ship the donegal on returning to the alert they steamed pass the transports england queen kangaroo and peru vian which were takiug in stores for the abvssinian expe dition the england was ready for sea and it was expected would sil in the course of the afternoon accompanied by the peruvian if sho could be got ready in time the alert next steamed round by the liverpool and birkenhead docks giving their lordships an opportunity of glancing at the splendid dock resources of liverpool and the great facilities for accommodating the immense trade of the port the steel and iron works and the various shipbuilding yards were also visited and at the shipbuilding yard and iron works of messrs laird brothers woodside birkenhead they had tho means of witnessing the progress wbich has been made in the construction of the various vessels which are being constructed there for her majestys servicethe great object of interest is her majestys twin screw turret ship captain of  tons and horse power now in course of construction from the joint design of captain cowper coles in cb and mressrs laird brothers this ship combines the aclowledged power of the turret system for carrying guns of the largest size with the qualities of a seagoing cruiser of the first class she will bave splendid quarters below for her officers and men as well as a poop and forecastle and an upper deck for exercise or the manccuvring of sails her aimensions are length ft breadth ft in tonnage  tons draught of water abaft ft in forward ft gin the engines are to be two separate pairs of  collective horse power driving twin screws and are intended to drive the vessel at the speed of  knots an hour when all complete and ready for sea her armament is to consist of six guns four of which are carried in the turrets and two on the upper deck the guns in the turrets are to be pounder  ton guns which are the largest ever made up to this time and those on the upper deck at the fore and after end are to be chase guns of large size hc ship wiu be wholly protected by armour from ft below the water line to the main deck gunwale right fore and aft thus affording complete protection not only to the midship part of the ship where the machinery and turrets are placed but also to the quarters for iccrs and men the thickness of the armourplating opposite the turrets wiu be sinwhich is more than on the broadside of any ship afloat and on the remainder of the midship portion of the vessel to he in slightly reduced towards the ends these plates rest on a backing of east india teak in thick through which they are bolted to the skin of the ship formed of two thicknesses of threequarter plates the whole supported by massive framework loin deep the main deck at the level of the upper part of the armour will be covered with iron iin and lin thick supported by very strong beams and again covered with oak plank sin thick the turrets of which there are two each carrying  pounder  ton guns project through the nimin deck and the upper part where exposed to shot is covered with armour plates loin thick the lower part and all the gearing being protected by the sin armour on the sides the height of the centre of metal of the guns in the turrets will be about liaft above the water line which will enable them to be founht at sea in very heavy weather and thev wiul have an arc of training fom the foremost turret of  degrees and from the after turret of  degrees the ad vantages of a poop and forecastle for a seagoing ship as adding to thecomfortwhensteaming head to windand afford ing a certain amountof additional accommodation for officers and crew are obviousand theyhave thereforelbeen adopted in this shipas by using the guns of the after turret for extrenie training forward and the guns of the forward turret for ex treme training aft they do not materially interfere with the extreme training of the guns which is the only objection to them this poop and forecastle are conuected by a centre spar deck ft wide which runs over the turrets giving free communication from one end of the ship to the other in the beaviest weather and theareaof this deck will be sufficient to admit of the whole working and manceuvring of the ship without going on the main or turret deck the hatchways round the fun nel and amidships are carried up of iron forning at once a support to the spar deck and a system of vertilation perrna nently trunked up to the level of the spar deck at a height of about ft above the load waterline the captain will be rigged as a ship with masts on captain coles tripod sys tem and wiu have a spread of canvas equal to that of the best type of broadside ironclad frigate of her own tonnage the general construction of the huu of the ship is similar to that of other large armourclad ships building for her mua jestys navy and combines all the recent improvements of watertight innerbottom wingpassages and other bulk heads the fore end especially is made of enormous strength and terminates in a massive wroughtiron stem formed as a ram for running into an enemys ship the engines are to be two separate pairs each pair driving a screw propeller the outer ends of the propeller shafts being carried on bracket frames an the same system as adopted by messrs laird in several other armourclad vessels built by them the cylinders are  inches diameter and  ft  in stroke and the indicated power is to be not less that  horse power the contract for the captain which is for the completion of the ship turrets and machinery ready for sea with the exception of rigging and sails and such like stores was made in february lastand since that time great progress has been d ade with the ship and machinery as she is now nearly au in frame skinplating fixed and rivetted the beams of main and lower decks are also in place and the in ternal arrangements are in progress the first cylinder is bored the trunks fitted and many other parts well ad vanced the boilers are erected the shipwrights have al ready commenced placing the teak backing to receive the ar mourplatesthe first of these being now fixed on the side of the ship and the boring and planing the remainderfairlycom ncnced we maystatethat the first plate ofthekeelwas low ered into the dock in the last week in mtarch and that since that time nearly  tons of iron havebeen worked into the ship besides a large quantity being in various stazes of pre paration on the premises the captain is being built in the large rgraving dock in which her majestys ship agin court of  tons and the euphrates of  tons were construoted aud it is intended to take full advan tage of the shed with which this dock is covered and of the great depth of water on the cill to keep the vessel in until she s completely finished all thearmour plates fixedthe turretsand machinery all in place and ready for trial in addition to the operations in connexion with the captain we observe throughout the works considerable activity and show of work among tho other vessels in progress aro a composite ganboat for her majestysgovernment two ironclad monitors about  tons and horse power and an ironclad ram of about  tons and horse power these three last named vessels areto be fitted with turrets on captain coles system and will each carry two pounder iton gunsin aadition to these there are two paddlewheel river steamers of about  tonsland a small fleet of  iron screws of about oft length fitted with engines of horse power the launches have just been completed and occupy one of the graving docks the total amount of tonnage in courso of construction at present is about  tons and the engincs for all these vessels amounting to about  horse power are beingmade at the birkenhead iron worksthe party were entertained at lunch by messrs laird brothers before making the inspection of the works in pro gress in the yard and in the evening they were to attend a banquet given by the mayor of liverpool in honourof their visit at the townhall during their stay in liver pool their lordships are the guests of mr john laird mp
