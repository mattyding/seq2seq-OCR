the midlanid rail way collisionsmanchester thttrsdaythe origin of the fatal collisions which occurred on the lino between peak forest and new miius ou mon day eveuing was fully disclosed at the coroners inquiries which were opened yesterday afternoon and concluded after midnight it wiul be seen from the subjoined evideace that the signal man at the peak forest and of the tunnel was an inexpe ricnced personwho had been appointed owing to the serious illness of his predecessor at the same post but who was sup posed to have been wellinatructed and competentforhisduty this was a mistake in the first instance as the man himself showed in his examination by the coroner by the act of  unblocking the telegraph needle at his own end of the tunnel he unconsciously conveyed a signal to the other end which implied that the line was clear it would appear from his evidenco thathe had no intention of giving such a signal but had made a fatal blunder the result was that the signalman at the other endat chapelenlefrithal lowed the cattle train te fouow the bauast train into the tunnel along the up liuo to the peak forest the balast trair having stopped in the midst of the tunnel col lision was the consequence one result of this as readers of our first report will remember was to detaeh the cattle train from its engines andconductors causing the whole  vehicles to rou backwards unchecked down an incline of one in  for a distance of eight miles then it came in couision with an express from manchester at new mius and nothing but a combination of happy acci dents and of presence of mind on the part of the express driver and other officials there and at romiuy saved the express from fatal disaster as it in turn was impelled with out control down the incline three or four miles to the place last named where the gradient changed to an ascent the driver stokerandguard of theexpressiqwil be remembered had all dismounted while the express was standing at new mills as we mentioned in the firsb report four drovers lost their lives by the coluision atnewmillswhentheywereciug ing to the runaway trucks and by tho first colission in the tunnel at peak forest a little girl had been killed her presence there is to be explained rather differently from the account first reported she was a passenger who hal missed her train at bugsworth or chapelenlefrith and had been improperly allowedbut by whom does not appearto get into the van of the ballast rain to proceed to her home near peak forest she was  or  years of age her name was martha vaines and she was the

refer to he did not profess to know the rules bo had been examined by mr loveday inspector on the midland line when at milersdale upon the use of the instruments he had then made a mistake in answering in regard to one of the signals he also made a mistake as regarded the recognition of the up line and the down line lhe had been learning about a fortnight at that time mr love day said he would do in a day or two the day after that examination witness had an order to go to monsall dale where he stayed a week  while there witness turued the signals and then the station master who was

expecting an accideent to occur every minute to the   train from manchester the train had passed when begot to bridgnorthmr tillson the stationnaster at chapelenlefrith was afterwards examined and corroborated the evidence of his signalman hubbart that the signal was received line clear ilo was unable to account for the little girl getting on the baem tra i it was quite against rules ho hadseen her on the station asking how she was to get to red forestlhenry herbert loveday district inspector of the mw land railway said he hba known william kcnighlt the signalman at peak forest for a month when ho first saw him he was sent to matlockbridge to learn tho duty of a telegraph signalman he remained there about afort night under the tuition of a signalman named jones afteg that he saw knight at matlockbridge station respecting his duties witnessquestioned himslightly respecting his know ledge of the signals and impressed him with the importance of his duties a fortnight ago witness had to examine several signal porters in consequence of the new line from bedford to london being about to bo opened he found that knight had made some mistakes in his answers as regarded his knowledge of the signals he found he was not com petent but he had no doubt he would be in a few days he recommended that he should go to monsalldale station to assist the stationmaster who is the telegraph signalmau at that station in order to complete his knowledge of the signals on thursday or friday last witness came to exa min him again not haviun seen the signal porter at medlockbridge to speak to him respecting knight after his previous examination witness asked him what his opinion of knight was as to his knowledgo of his duties ho replied he acted well and never made one mistake while he was with him he also asked laster at monsau dale if he considered the man was capablo of being intrusted with the duties of a signalman re replied that he considered ho was quite capable of taking charge witness then exammed knight again at milers dale to make himself perfectlyi satisfied and he considered the man was quite capable to take chargo of a telegraph signal post he reported to that effect to his superintendent and an accident having ust happened to the previous signal porter at peak forest knizht was sent to succeed him tho coroner here rca the evidence of knight and the witness said the moment nry taking the peg out by knight would be an indication to the chapel signalman that the line was clear it could not he taken for anything else the pez should not have been taken out till the train had passe there are posi tive instructions as to that point a man with ordinary intelligence is capable of taking charge of a signal inmonths time it is not a heavy post as only a few trains stop to shunt always where there is a straight line f us it is only necessary to pass the signals backwarts an or wards the duties are simple hec had cautioned knight in general terms and showed him the importance of not touching the needle unnecessarily he consilered knight to have made the greatest progress he had ever seen and be considered that the report of mr jones that he had not made one mistake was somthing remarkablethe cononer in summing up remarked upon the dii crepancy in the evidence of knight compared with that of mr loieday as to the number of times which mr loveday had examined knight as to his duties and his knowledge of the signals it was uite clear that according to kznightg own opinion he had but a very imperfect knowledg of his duties and that when he was first examined by ir love day he made a mistake as to the signals and was also igno rant of which was the up and which was the down line matters which might occasion a most serious acci dent whether knight was examined once or oftener by mr loveday it was evident that the examinations couli only have been of a most superficial character that in some considerable measure mr lovedays opinion ol his qualifica tions was formedon the testimony of others and that it would have been better had he given knight a more thorough examination himself there was this howeter to be said that at the time of the accident the re gular signalman at peak forest was lying ill at the devonshire hospital buxton with his leg amputated and another man had therefore to be found to supply his place and no doubt mr loyeday havin a favour able opinion of knight thought he miglt intrust him with the situation as to who was the culpable party in cennexioa with the accident the jury if they con sidered that knight through thorough negligence or grosa ignorance had permitted the accident were placed in a mosbt awkward positiou they must then find him guilty of man slaughter they would however consider whether there were not extenuating circumstances that might justify them in arriving at another verdict and whether being an in experienced man knight might not have done the wrong he no doubt had committed in the hurry of the moment un intentionaly and vtithout any desire or thought to do mis chief for his own part he would hardly recommend them to return a verdict of manslaupghterone of the jurymen inquired whether any person present knew how many servants of the midland company there were employed at the peak forest station as some of the jury thought that negligence had been shown by the station master and two porters being all away from the signalbox at one time at teamr thompson said that knight before he left should have apprised the stationmaster of his intention to leavein order that the stationmaster might take charge of the signals till knights returnthe same juryman said that knight appeared to be a ner vous man and not calm and collected in his mannerthe room was then cleared of all but the jury in order that they might deliberate after about twenty minutes absencethe public were again admitted to the inquestroom whenthe coroner said the jury had returned a verdict ot accidental death asin their opinion knight had nothad sufficient time to learn the duties of his office and that at the time he was appointed to that office he was not compe tent to discharge its duties also the jury had re marked upon the discrepancy in the evidence that had been given as to the number of examinations to which knight had been subj ected to by mir loveday before his ap p ointment to office knight having stated that there had been only one examination and imr loveday thatthere were two or threeexaminations theonly way in which he the coroner could account for that discrepancy was by supposing that knight did not reckon a questiont put in a pertinent manner by mr loveday as an exa mination aud that mr loveday so considered it the jury at the samne time expressed a strong opinion with regard to the conduct of the stationmaster at peak forest that he ought not to have left the signalbox especiauy after sending the signalman knight on au errand without some one being in the box to take charge of the signal they felt they could do notbiog less than cen sure him for that conduct he the coroner thought the jury were perfectly right in the verdict to which they had comemr loveday said that he had taken knight to millers dale and examined him once on derby race tuesday and again last thursday or friday most certainly he had exa mined him twice at the least before appointing himthe coorxer at the conclusion of this inquest about  oclock proceeded by special train with the wvitnesses to new mills wlere about  oclock he opened the inquest on the sufferers by the second collision the evidence wonld no doubt be in a great part identical with that at the first inquiry the second inquest concluded at  oclock this morning with a similar verdict and similar expressions of opinion by the jury
