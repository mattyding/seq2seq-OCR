i foreign intelligenceaustriaooat our own correspondentvienna sept the internal difficulties of austria may be great the reorganization of the empire on a new basis maybe stil in embryo the financial difficulties mayseemappalling and constitutional life maybe in its infancy but the boons the peoples of austria are already deriving from this feeble beginning of a new system cannot be overrated one must have known the country and above all the good town of vienna some  or  years ago to appreciate the ltull ralie of the changes which have takenplace the laustrian govertniett except during the passing moments of reaction has never beena tyrannical government in the proper sonse of the word the easygoing south german of austria is by his very nature unfit to be the tool of a harsh and systematically oppressive government there were occasionally outbursts but the fury soon sub sided and the old dfbonnaire character soon re asserted its sway austria alone of the three go vernments whiclh concluded the holy alliance seems to have thoroughly adopted that plausible but impracticable programme according to which sovereigns were to be true shepherds to their people doing everything for but nothing with their people like china austria had conceived the relations of a sovereign to his people as those existingbetween parents and their children and certainly no hen for her chickens or monkey for its offspring ever showed such tender and anxious care as the old austrian government bestowed on the people i to guard them against all evil and to preserve them from every danger became the ruling maxim air may convey infection and movement may occasion acci dents with children so austria was closed as her meticauy as any sick room under old practitioners and au movement except perhaps a little constitu tional under the eyes of everwatching nurses was preventedthe cordon drawn round the frontiers was as strict as any that quarantine ever invented against arrivals from plaguestricken countries when the stranger came to the frontier wherever he came from and whoever he was the first idea always was whether he could not be kept out  the least flaw in his passport or the least informality was if not quite fatal at any rate an occasion for delay which allowed time for watching his ways and discoveringy whether he did not come with some object or other which in some way or other might render his pre sence obnoxious like his person his luggage under went the same close scrutiny it was not tobacco or lace so much as ideas which were the object of the search every article was turned and returned to see whether it did not conceal some strip of a newspaper or a letter as for books the first process was to take them away the more innocent the book the more carefully it was examined lest there should be some writing between two leaves after passing through all these ordeals triumph antly the stranger became as if he had been an own child of the paternal governmentan object of special care and solicitude  he was never for an instant lost sight of and if anything occurred the least suspicious he was politely sent out again as for newspapers there was a sort of general prohibition which could only be removed by special permission the only exception was made in favour of the augsburg allgemeine zeitung which had a subvention from the government to present all foreign matters in the true orthodox way the letters enjoyed besides a special privilege they had a whole office to themselvesthe black chamber which was attached to the foreign officeand was famous all over europe for the skill with which it opened and closed letters with out leaving any trace of the operationwhile so much care was taken to prevent infection from abroad the infant steps of the good people at home were watched with even greater anxiety in hungary this was difficult enough for having at least the semblance of constitutional freedom and personal liberty freedom of speech in the county assemblies and in the diet could scarcely be effectually inter fered with although the attempt was made more than once btut unsuccessfully but being separated from the civilized world by large strips of countries which did not enjoy this privilege hungary was almost as effectually debarred from intellectual in tercourse with the world as the rest of austria be sides censorship although illegal according to hun garian lawwas kept up in spite of the protests of the diet but if the hungarians would meet and talk among themselves and would not recognize pass ports or any other restrictions good care was taken to prevent them from spreading their heresy fur ther among the good children and making them naughty an inner cordon was drawn between hungary and the rest of the empire and every hungarian who overstepped the boundary became by that alone an object of special surveillance all this paternal care however touching was thrown away it made the children only more greedy of forbidden fruit and often just of that which was the most unripe had there been no restriction thle evil would have perished but as smuggling makes the acquisition of forbidden books and newspapers much more expensive what was most highlyflavoured and what most stimulated the palate was most welcome and most sought after while the corrective was neglected dreams of theorists eloquent harangues of foreign agita tors most exaggerated and exciting became the staple food the effects showed themselves in the outbreak of  when even the good viennese played at french conventionalists and barricadeswell all this old world is changedthoroughly changed and as far as i can observe hitlherto individual freedom in all except religious matters is as great in the western half of the empire as it is in hungary in the socalled good olden times there was no individual security guaranteed by law but practically there were few cases of violence after  this was altered for the worse and it is only since the compromise with hungary and since the reichsratlh has placed personal liberty under the guarantee of the law that a radical change can be said to have taken place you come and go to and from austria and you move about as freely as you do in england no one asks you who you are and what your business is for any one like myself who has only known the old system it seems like a dream as censorship is abolished books and news papers come in as freely and as far as my experience goes as regularly as in any other country on the continent my experience with letters is too short to be conclusive but they have been hitherto equally regular and untouchedbut the most extraordinary thing is the change in the press the vietnna gazette and the osterreichische beobachter whiclh was edited by the foreignoffice were once the only pap ers now not only vienna and provincial capitals bult small towns havo their own local papers and especially in some of the organs of the different extreme fractions of the austrian nationality you find things which very likely the boldest organ of fenianism in ireland or england would hesitate to in sert while in france germany and probably italy such outbursts would not be tolerated for aninstant the present law on the press in austriaas well as hungary still insists on certain ad ministrative formalities such as guarantees when the paper is established but once established the paper is out of the control of the govern ment and can only be prosecuted before a jury you know too well how difficult govern ment action in such a matter is in england in any case wrhor public feeling in the place where the offence has been committed symnathizes with the offender how much more here wlere there are so many burning questions still at issue i a case presents itself just nowwhich ilustrates the diffi culty as you know by telegram there is an idea of prosecuting the organ of the ultra party in hungary for publishing the an swer of iossuth to the presidentof the consti tuency of vacy which has elected him as their re presentative although the ideas expressed in that answer are repudiated by all but the extreme fac tion wore the matter brought before a jury even in the present moment of agitation it is ques tionable whether a verdict could be obtained rem the jury and if the government fails it is in a much worse position than it was before tho removal of such restrictions and tutelage of the press as has existed in austria must of course produce some excesses but freedom brings its own remedy the more this freedom extends and the more papers are started the smraller will be the evil one will correct the otheraustria has changed indeed and so has vienna outwardly for the interval formerlv occupied by thewalls of the inner town and their glacis has becomo a new town after the mode of new paris but the viennese seem to stick to old habits and as yet but little patronize the boulevard or ringstrasse which yet some time or other must become the chief artery of the town at present there is but little life in this broad thoroughfare nor is there much to invite loungers like most of the new paris boulevardsit is too wide and the trees are as yet too smal to give in these hot days the shade which is indispensable for comfort it seems scarcely credible but there has not been as yet an hotel keeper sufficiently enter prising to transfer his hotel to the new part they prefer sticking in the musty inner town where there is no air and plenty of smells although the viennese are fond of outdoor life they are not apeopleof fla nuars on a fino sunday like yesterday for nistance the whole town wiu flock to the pretty environs to spend the day there but on week days as of old unless thero be somo special attraction such as a good band in one of the gardeng or apopular playf at one of the theatres they are as a rule but little seen out of doors and by  oclock all is as dul as in a small provincial town of course this is the dead season and every one who can manage it is out of town but the mass of the population is here and seems but little altered from what it was  and more years ago after the intoxication of  during which i left it seems to have relapsed into the old rstate of quiet easy er jment little disturbed by the changes all around it not that it was ever sheepishly inert for it vented its feelings by keen wit which had almost become proverbial but now that it has full freedom to talk andread the papers it does not seem to wish for much more all the movement which has led to the recent changes or nearly all of it proceeded not from tho centre but from the extremities of the empire indeed it was but a protest against the preponderance of the centre no wonder that vienna did not take the lead in a movement directed against herselffrancefroam ourt own correspondilntparis thursday sept  atrthe topic of abyssinia is decidedly a favourite one now in paris and the patrie has just published two columns concerning it from the pen of count r du bisson m du bisson does not date his letter but he appears to write in paris on the strength of letters of the th of july received from abyssinia it will surprise you to learn how well informed they are there and thatau thesecrets of the foreigdoffice are conscientiously delivered over to theodore three months ago at gondar they knew the effective strength and composition of the expeditionary corps and even the numbers of the regiments at that date in liondorn the expedition was denied and the letters dated three montbs ago contain the same de tails that the military newspapers have published within tno last fortnight the emperor theodore knew that  camels were to bo farnished by the viceroy that massowah was chosen for the base of operations and that they feigned to proclaim very loudly the iuysuion of abys sinia by the tarenta otherwise the lied sea when in formed of this plan he said the english arc either mad or imbecilemad if they attempt what they say imbecile if they imagine i fear them in fact the purchase of the camels at onco enlightened tho cunning negus as to the point of attack really selectedaccording to m du bisson by way of the red sea the paths are al impassable by camels tra vellers and merchants have repeatedly tried the experiment without success the only practicable road for camels he asserts to be by way of galabat and matamah but that involves  days forced marches tbrough the egyptian soudanand crossing the bogos the benihamier bahria taka the pro vince of khartouim with halts in the towns of kassalah and guedaref hle says that the difficul ties the english army wiu encounter are immense and will baffle au calculations au foresight this illomened prophet sayswe will not speak of the guedaref worm or of the tmnia one is safe from them if one never drinks water we will say nothing of the gigantic defiles of the absence of roads over mountains inaccessible to europeans of the rains that commence in april a frightful deluge which breaks down thc strongesttentschanges rivulets into torrents and rivers into oceans drowning tho plains for two months and leaving them during the threesucceeding months ravaged by typhus and by the pernicious fevers engendered by mountains of detritus in fermentation of carcasses of ani mals in putrefaction under a sunheat of  deg centigrade we will not point out the desperate position of an invading army in a country which has already been methodically ruined sacked and burnt surrounded on au sides by pesti lential marshes hemmed in by fanatical free corps impla cable in their hatred inexorable ia their vengeance inde fatigable in their attacks of an army cut off from its base of operations by muddy and mephitic oceans without com munications without the possibility during onethird of de year of obtaining supplies and consequently obliged to take with it provisiods stores medicines ammunition for four months woe wiu not dwell upon the absurdity of employ ing iu endless defiles strewed everywhere with rocks fallen from the mountains a cavalry accustomed to the plains of india draught animals accustomed to the sandy easy paths of the desertin provinces where often man alone serves as beast of burden helping himself with his feet ad hands all that concerns the skilful english generals and their so welluorganized commissariatafter thus pointing out everything that he says he will not point out this friendly gentleman pre dicts that neither  nor  soldiers indian or english will suffice to rescue the prisoners whom he maintains to be still in the power of theodore who will pitilessly cut their throats this must have struck numbers of persons as highly probable even before m du bisson pointed it out but the question now is not conifined within the narrow limits of the rescue of those few unfortunate men if the prisoners are killed it might be some consolation to get hold of theodore and dispose of him by means of the halter he merits no chance of that says the oracular bisson in action  of his most valiant warriors lukantankuss adopt his imperial costume take similar arms a horse like his a suite as numerous so that it is impossible to recognize the emperor or to know where he is theodore may be killed but his successor will be machcha his son warlike full of audacity intelligence and acquired knowledge and moreover the idol of the army tho english may gain negative battles leading only to the possession of deserts wasted by fire and when they have spent  millions of francs abandoned to vultures and hyenas  of their soldiers and got messrs cameron rassam stern c massacred thoevictorious and decimated rremnant of their army win go and reembark at massowah the emperor of abyssinia will still be theodore or his son and the british flag wiu not the less continue to sweep the filth of the palace of gondarin a note al du bisson informs us that the two english flags taken from the consulategeneral and from mr rassam are upon certain solemn anni versaries dragged through the imperial apartments and down the staircase with hootings and outrages and are afterwards put back in the most unclean corner of the palace where they are habitually keptwhatsoever the result of the campaign the in vading force is to have no easy triumph accord ing to their french friend the abyssinians areheroes intrepid indefatigalie and almost invul nerable they can mareh  leagues in ten hours fight for a whole day without food or drink sleep in the water and in the mud always plein dutmour whatever m du bisson may mean by that and inspired with a fanaticism equauled only by their hatred of the foreigner the women are the modern spartans in battle they form a sort of rear rank taking care of the wounded and bringing upammunition under thehottest fire thecoward dho retreats is no longer a man his wife divorces him his betrothed rejects himhis priest curses him paradise is the lot of the fallen hero the coward goes to the other place but it appears accord ing to count du bisson that theodore in the ex pectation of this war of which it seems that the treachery of our foreignoffice long since warned him sent for military instructors both european and american and that some of them have arrived and others are onthe road or about to set out he has also bought several thousand breechloadersand c m bourgon a french name perhaps a friend of m du bisson has organized a manufactory of cartridges specially for these new arms machdcha the heir to the crown has been put at the head of an army corps one raz enghedda commands all the sharpshooters andas he understands french and english the foreigners are under his orders some othor particulars are given apparently de rived from the gondar gazette m bardel another french name is still according to m du bisson the minister in favour i do not however find his
