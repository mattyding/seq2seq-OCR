the oxford beforimers of  dbthis is the unpretending title mr seebohm has prefixed to a volume which contains much in teresting information bearing on the religious his tory of europe during the period immediately pre ceding the reformation the oxford reformers are colet dean of st pauls in the early part of the reign of henry viii erasmus and sir thomas more between them an intimate friendship sprang up during their residence at the university leading to a common action in their several spheres for the next quarter of a century and leaving behind it the most important results the different course taken by the religious reform in england and ger many may in no small degree be explained by the infuence of these three remarkable men and singularly enough most especiauy of the firstwhose name is at the present day by far the least familiarjohn colet the founder of st pauls school was the only survivor of  children of vhom all but himself died before their father sir henry colet a wealthy merchant of the city of london in some favour with the most avaricious of english kings henry vii after taking the degree of lla at oxford and being presented to a living and pre bendal stall colet left england for some years of foreign travel these were spent partly infrance and partly in italy lorenzo db medici had just died and the semipaganism which under his auspices had succeeded to the superstition of the middle ages was being vigorously as sailed by that prince of revivalists savonarola the time was one of seething change the scandals of pope alexander vi and cssar borgia had re volted the morality and the general ignorance of the latin ecclesiastics excited the contempt of all the world the capture of constantinople by the turks had driven men of letters carrying with them a knowledge of greek literature into italy and westerm europe and grocyn and linacre had already returned to england and were intro ducing the new learning the one at oxford the other in london aided by the most power ful of au agents of civilization the newly discovered art of printing what was to be the issue of such a state of things where a vast in toelectual expansion came together with an uni versal contempt for the ostensible representatives of christianity while in the meantime the outward fortunes of the church appeared even worse than its internal condition nearly five centuries had elapsed since the christian world had been sum moned to take arms against the mioslem and now it was calculated that mahomedans exceeded christians in the proportion of five to one ithe ertlculars of colets life during the five years of his travels are unknown except from a couple of passages in the letters of his friend eras mus from these wo learn that singularly hostile as he was to monks in general he had in italy found some whom he allowed to be men of real wisdom and piety and also that during the whole time ho was abroad he had been a diligent student of almost everybranchof learning then available the canon and civil law history the principalfathers of the church and even the schoolment were with him mado a preliminary to a familiar acquaintance with the scriptures to the schoolmen and also to st augustine he appears to have entertained a dis like but he was charmed with the learning of origen and jerome and curiously enough with the mysticism of the pseudodionysius which he took for the genuine areopagite but above all he devoted himself with enthusiasm to the writings of st paul andimmediately on his return to eng gland in the year  he repaired to oxford and commenced a series of lectures on his epistles although beneficed colet was not at that time even in deacons orders which he received in the following year being then about s years old tsome of the notes of his lec tures are preserved in the library of corpus christi college cambridge and they are most re markable from the circumstance that they consti tute perhaps the first specimen of that method of interpreting scripture which alone finds favour with scholars and is destined ultimately to meet with general acceptance entirely abandoning the notion of a multitude of meanings derivable from a single text which had been formally laid down by aquinas and adopted by his successors till it became an axiom colet confined himzelf to the single object of bringing out the direct practical sense which it was the design of the sacred writers to convey to those they addressed to ascertain this he was careful to consider the drift of the argument the circum stances of the time and the position both of writers and readers  all of which points he elucidated from whatever material he could find without any regard to the traditionalinterpretation of fathers or school men thus he illustrates from suetonius the state of society at rome and the special circumstances which rendered it needful for roman christians to be urged  to be obedient to the higher powers and  to pay tribute also he compares the ex pressions of st paulwiththose of st johnpointing out their real harmony in combination with a di versity in the way of looking at the subject and to this sound philosophical method he added an un mistakable earnestness which made erasmus say to him  your words have birth in your heart not on your lips the doctrine of tho absolute verbal in spiration of holy scripture under which the sacred volumehadgrown to be a mere arsenal of texts found in colet a determined enemy re held with jerome that even the evangelists had not been ex empted from occasional slips of memory not with augustine and modern bibliolatera that the admis sion of the least error in the scriptures hazarded the authority of the whole the manner in which he comments on the first chapter of genesis proves that had he lived three centuries later he would certainly not have joined in an outcry against the critical examination of the mosaic writings how ever much he might have disapproved the task being undertaken by those who were imperfectly qualified for it casting off all traditional theology he took his stand exclusively upon the scriptures and the apostle creed and recommended young theologians over whom he had influence to keep firmly to these and let who would dispute upon whatever lay outside of this circle when it is considered that the great text book of the time the summ theologica of aquinas which contains nearly  pages is professedly only intended for beginners it is scarcely possible to ap preciate the enormous revolution which such a principle as the above was calculated to bring about in the religious life of the nation when it once came to be accepted the theology of the catholic church in the days of colet was in fact a huge congeries of innumerable dogmas which from the time of augustine gradually gained a lodgment for themselves inthe gaps of revelation first as hypo theses then as ancient opinions and finally as uni versally accepted traditions in many perhaps in most instances they were adopted for the purpose of reconciling religious faith with the conclusions of a science which had itself grown up by a similar pro cess thus passages fromthe psalms were adduced to sanction the geocentric theory of the solar system at the very time when thab theory itself was on the point of toppling over under the wei ht of cycles andopicycles revolving spheres and the rest of the machinery which had been dlevised to account for the observed phenomena of planetary motionit was during the first year of coletslectures at oxford that erasmus arrived there with letters of introduction to charnook the prior of st marys who was one of colets greatest admirers the two were made known to each other by charnock and from this moment a friendship sprang up between them which lasted till the death of the englishman the mind of colet was essentially devout while that of erasmus would perhaps in another age have occupied itself in literary pursuits without any special regard to their religious utility strongly urged by his friend to imitate the example which he himself had set and expound some of the prophetic writings of the old testament he could not prevail on himself to curtail the general culture to which it was his ardent desire to attain when he should have prepared himself adequately for tho task es pecially by a thorough knowledge of the greek lan guageo he promised colet that he would devote himseif to the service of their common lord but before eecuring this key to all ancient learning he refused to undertake any special theological task i for nearly these three years past he says in a letter written in  i have buried myself in greek literature nor do i think the labour has been thrown away    whilo thus working in tho garden of the greeks i am gathering much fruit by the way for the time to come which may hereafter be of uso to mo in sacred studies for i bave learnt this by experience that without greek one can do nothing in any branch of study for it is one thing to seo tfhllcorcford rfeformers of  beiog a bisto of the fellowork ofejohn coletbrasmts and thomasgoro by frederic seebohm

present day was in the commencement of tho th century a herculean labour no assistance could be gained from printed books oral instruction was only to be procuredin italy and it is touching to see how the poor scholar entered on the drudgery of teaching and the even more unpalatable task of soliciting assistance from his rich friends in order to procure the means of going thither at the very moment when his efforts seemed about to be rewarded he was doomed to a grievous disappointment he was stopped at dover by the customhouse officers under cover of an obsolete statute which forbade the ex portation of the precious metals and the purse ful of golden crowns which had been got toge tlier with such pains was confiscated to the ex cheanuer hle arrived in paris broken in health and spirits reduced to poverty and with the prospect of visiting italy further off than ever it was to procure the means of subsistence at this time that he composed the adagia and bad he not fortunately attracted thnotice of the marchioness de vere with the tutor of whose son he was acquainted he would probably have succumbed to the misery and broken health of which he was for the next few years a victim but a better timo was coming in the year  he wrote and two years afterwards published his enchiridion miliis vhris tiani the christian soldiers dagger a little treatise which perhaps puits the issue between a formal and a spiritual religion more directly than any controversial work in existence for some years it circulated only aniong the more ad vanced thinkers but when the protestant move

was previously unknownat the time erasmus was writing the enchiridion his friend colet was made dean of st pauls and thenext year the two friends met again in london and resumed their intercourse with each other and also with the other members of the old oxford set grocyn linacre and more who were all settled there the fortunes of the last had been most checkered he had shared the enthusiasm of colet and erasmus for the new literature although  or  years their junioraud had his own tastes been consulted would probably havegiven him self up to the life of a scholar but providentially even for the cause of letters and certainly for that of religion his father was of a different mind he had intended to make a lawyer of his son and on finding that his mind was likely to be distracted from the study of english law by more fascinating pursuits he removed him suddenly from the uni versity at the age of  and entered him at new inu his success was great enough to justify even so summnarya

procuring the payment of a subsidy which had been granted to meet a con tingency that never came to pass twofifteenths had been voted for the scotch war and although there was now peace the king demanded not only the grant but an additional fifteenth as an aid towards the expense of marrying a daughter and knighting a sonthe latter having in the meantime died these demands were opposed by more and the king had to content himself with less than a fourth of the sum he had asked for en raged at the opposition to his extortion he throw mores father into prison and compelled the son to retire from public life so completely was the young mans spirit broken by this cruel treatment that he meditated becoming a carthusian monk and with a view to entering a monastery com menced a course of asceticism which in some of its features he retained to the end of his life but he was diverted from his intention partly by the in fluence of colet and partly by his admiration for the views of pico della mirandola a disciple of savonarola whose writings he studied with intense sympathy and even translated some of them into english gradually he resumed his practice at the bar and began to recover the high position from which the anger of the king had thrust him when erasmus came to england to see his friend the new dean of st paurs he found more translating luoan and writing latin epi grams containing bitter satires on monks and ty rannical princes he was perfectly fascinated by his talents never he says had nature united so fully in one mind so many qualities of geniusthe keenest insight the readiest wit the most convincing eloquence the mnst engaging manners  he himself was fortunate enough at last to secure the means of visiting italy the eircumstances however under which this long desired journey was performed were not agreeable he was to take charge of three pupilstwo sons of dr baptista the physician of henry vir and a yotung scottish noble man then archbishop of st andrews and who seen years afterwards was kiled at flodden field to italy however he went the arrangement with the sons of baptista came to an end in a year the most unpleasant year of erasmuss life he too his doctors degree in turin found bologna besieged by roman armies commanded by pope julius in per son was flattered and promised advancement if he would remain in italy and finally returned to eng land and became a guest of more in bucklersbury in the year everything now promised well for the cause which the three friends had at heart the cause of learning of religious sincerity of liberty henry viii had been to some extent educated in the new learning he was personally fond of colet and he did not inherit his fathers quarrel with moro who indeed presented him on his accession with a richly ulluminated volume containing congratulatory verses erasmus when he reached the house of his host found thelatterin excellentspirits allthoughts of monkery swept awayfor he had become a husband and tho father of a little girland with apparently the best prospect of fame and fortune before him lt so happened that on his arrival he was attacked by a painful though not dangerous complaint and to kill the time his books not having come he put on paper some satirical reflections on men and things suggested especially by the ex perience of his recent travels on more returning home one day from the law courts with some friends erasmus produced the manuscript for their amusement they were delighted with it and in sisted that he should complete his design this he did  andin about a week the celebrated praise of folly was finished the book is a satire upon follies of all kinds from that of tho bookworm in his study to that of the pope on his throne grammariansphiloso phers

from which he anticipated a success which was not realized but it gave him at any rate leisure and timofor tho preparation of his great worlk the publication of the scriptures of the now testament in their original languagesoon after the accession of colet to the deanery of st pauls he determined to devote the greater part of his privato fortune to securing the cultiva tion of those branches of learning to which more than to anything else he looked for a true eccle siastical reform this design found its fulfilment in tho foundation of the school which from its situation in st pauls churchyard has obtained the name of stpauls schoola name which commemo rates neither the founder nor the object which hemainlyhad at heart he himself dedicated the school  to the child jesus an image of whom in the atti tude of teaching was set up over the masters chair with the inscaiption hear ye him  mly in tent said colet  is by this school specially to increase knowedg and worshipping of god and our lord jesus christ and good christian life and manners in the children on the front of the school were set up the words  schola catechlizationis puterorum in christi opt axc ffle et bonis literis anno christi hidx the importance attached to the latter particular gave great offence to the sacerdotal party of i the day colet banished from his school vithout mery al te sholsti wrterthe corrupt lati s heters it wich rnoantblind foolsbrought in poisoning the old latin speech and the very oman tongue used in the time of tully and sallust and virgil and terence and learned by st jerome st ambrose and st augustine that abusion whichl the later blind wvorld brought in and which may rather bo called blotteratuere than litteraticre he determined to have none of the consequence was as in all similar cases that he was calumniated as a godless secularist  a certain bishop he tells erasmus in a letter who is held tooto be one of the wiser ones has been blasphem ing our school before a large concourse of people declaring that i have erected what is a useless thing yea a bad thingyea more to give his own words a temple of idolatry which indeed i fancy he called it because the poets are to bo taught there  this bishop was in au probability fitzjames who then filled the see of london and was unceas ing in his endeavours to ruin colet though not a lollard himself colets preaching had been so acceptable to the lollards that they used to advise ono another to go and hear him bishop fitzjames who ardently desired to extirpate this heresy naturally entertained a bitter aversion to wards a dignitary of the church whoso position and character made him a rallying point for the offen ders and he probably felt instinctively that an ecclesiastical system like that existing could not fail to be undermined by tho new learning as it gradually leavened the nation more indeed face tiously warned colet of the storm of malice which the  heretical greek ho had introduced into english education was likely to excite your school he said  is the wooden horse pregnant with a brood of armed greeks for the overthrow of our barbarian troy within two years therefore of the establishment of colets school fitzjames and two other bishop exhibited articles against the dean for heresy from the nature of the charges it is easy to understand the hostility towards the offender one was that colet had preached that images ought not to be worshipped another that ho had asserted that when christ commranded peter  to feed his lambs there was no allusion to the expenditure of episcopal revenues in hospitality a third that in speaking of the practice of reading sermons he in tended to cast a slur on the bishop of lon don  a fourtb that he had translated the paternoster into english but the archbishop warham rejected the articles at once without call ing on colet for a reply fitzjames however was not to he baffled and the next year endeavoured to embroil colet with the king then bent on a war policy by representing that colet had preached against even just war but elenry violent as he was by nature was not the man to be made a tool of by the malice of others he sent for colet and bade him go on boldly reforming by his teaching the corrupt morals of the age telling him that he was aware of the plots of the bishops against him and that colet might rely on the royal favour and protectionit is indeed impossible to contemplate without a certain amount of compassion the consternation which must have been produced in the minds of the ecclesiastical digaitaries of the timevwhen they looked abroad and beheld on every side the presages of the coming storm brought up in an age wlien they themselves had been regarded and not altogether unjustlyregarded as the representatives of culture they found themselves all at once at the bottom instead of the top of the intellectual scale all around them heresies were springing up which they could not comprehend and therefore could meet only by force in the convocation held in  increased severity against the lollards being urged the advo cates of the measure were asked to point out any scriptural authority for capital punishment of heretics an old divine immediately quoted the text  amreticum honinem post unam alteranque correptioncm devita taking  devita to mean  de vitd tolle one bishop  a youth offered erasmus a benefice and a considerable sum of money to undertake his tuition for a year but erasmus though in want of money thought the task too hard an one and declined the offer several of mores

tinuauyincreasing reputation to each of the three friends colet went on regularly preaching at the cathedral of st pauls and the influence he ae quired must have been very great indeed for in spite of a suspicion of disaffection to the existing ecclesiastical system he was appointed to preach on three special occasions of peculiar importanceto the convocation assembled for the extirpation of heresy in  before the king on the commence ment of his second continental eamnpaign in  and on the occasion of the promotion of wolsey to the cardinalate in  in each of these instances he showed himself the same earnest practical christian he had ever been perfectly uncompromising in the inculcation of christian duty and yet so wise and moderato as to leave rno vulnerable point to his enemies the first of these discourses is given by mr seebohm in english and if it be compared with the last effusion whieh a similar opportunity recently called forth will certainly carry the suffrages of most protestants over its suc cessor of  years later date erasmus in the meantime was becoming the most celebrated man in europe his praise of folly was read everywhere and secured attention to whatever else proceeded from his pen the interest indeed excited by the continental war distracted for a time the attention of the english from the cultivation of the new learn ing which had at first been taken up so warmly and erasmus on this account determined to leave cambridge but he was offered a pension and a position of rank by prince charles of the ntherlands and in  he set off for basle to superintend the printing of the great work of his lifethe first edition of the new testament in greek he was now the leading literary celebrity of the age servatius the prior of the monastery of stein in which he had passed his boyhood tried to allure him to talke up his quarters among the fraternity but although erasmus replies in a tone of personal friendliness to his correspondent nothing can be more decisive than his condemnation of the monastic life he says i have tried to find that ode of life in which i should be the least prone to evil and i think assuredly that i havo found it i have lved with sober men i have lived a life of literary stady and theso havo drawn me away from many vices it has been iny lot to livo on terms of inti macy with men of true christian wisdom and i have been bettered by their conversation whonevor the thought has occurred to mo of returning into your fraternity it has always called back to my romembrance the aionsy of many the contempt of all converse how cold i how lacking in christian wisdomi feastings more fit for the laityli tho mode of life as a whole one which if you subtract its ceremonies from it has nothing left which seems to me worth havingthen after enumerating the productions of his pen up to that time he says i have made np my mind to work at sacred literaturo to the day of my death great men say that in those things i am successful where others aro not in your mode of lfe i should entirely fail although i have had inter course with so many men of learning both here and in italy and france i have never yet found one who advised me to betako myself back again to yonyet he commends himself to the prayers of the prior and ends with  farewe my once pleasanteompanion and now reverend father at mayence he was warmly received by the archbishop a man of liberal views who only the year before had rescued the aged reuchlin from the fangs of the inquisition proceeding to strasburg he re ceived a public entertainment from the learned men of that city and in fact was treated with the greatest distinction at every halt until he reached basle at this city a printing press had been set up  years before by john auerbachwho not only united the characters of printer and scholar as indeed was universauy the case at that time but had collected around him a knot of educated men animated with quite a missionary spirit for the diffusion of learning he had educated his three sons in latin greok and hebrew that they might continuo his own work at the time of erasmuss arrial the duity of correcting the press was un dertaken by a young man of great ability and considerable wealthbeatus rlhenanus whose namo often appears in erasmuss letters  so tho roucihly had the basle coterie their hearts in their wore by way of a joke erasmus was introduced to froben auerbachs successor as another person on the discovery of who he really was ho was re ceived with open arms his inn bills paid and hiini self servant and horses transferred to tho houso of frobens fatherinlaw tho rumour of his arrival spread througlh tlhe city and the illustrious stranger was instanitly besieged by all the notabilities of the place with offers of attentions of every kind he had come however with a very different object than that of being feted andalthough gratified wvith the homage he reccived lie prevailcd with his ad mirers to

warham archbishop of canterbury the novum instru mentum as he termed it to pope leo xl the time was a most critical one for the interests of religion the sensuality of alexander vi and the warlike ten dencies of julius il had produced a kind of semi pagan latitudinarianism leo hated the bigotry of the schoolmenand had declared himself in favour of a peaceful policy  but the tendency to scepticism in italy was most alarming erasmus himself although expressing his firm faith that in the long run the authority of the scriptures would prevail yet did not conceal his apprehensions that  under the pretext of the revival of ancient literature paganism would again endeavour to rear its head there was indeed ample ground for anxiety it han become the fashion in high society at rome itself to profess belief in the philosophy of pliny and aris totle and to scoff at the christian faith the uni versity of padua was a focus of atheism and its most renowned professor pomponatius was the author of a worlc in which he denied the immortality of the soul on the other hand the doamatie school of divines set themselves rigidly against any cultivation of the  heretical tongues greek and hebrew and with the same blind infatuation which distinguishes their representatives in every age strained every nerve to keep open a gulf between christianity and reviving science but erasmus as colet before him had confidence in the victory of truth in the fair field of investigation he in tuitively perceived that out of the nettle danger the flower safety was to be plucked and the words with which he declares his sentiments in the para clesis or address to the reader prefixed to his edition of the new testament may be advan tageously adopted at the present time when a spurious ecclesiasticism has taken possession of so many degenerate sons of the anglican communion the sun itself is not more common and open to ll thavir the teachidg of christ other philosophies by the very difficulty of their
