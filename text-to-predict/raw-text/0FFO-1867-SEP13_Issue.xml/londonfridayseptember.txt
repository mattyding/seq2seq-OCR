i londo br fda y september  of the tens of thousands of englishmen who have visited and will visit tho great show in tho champ do mars this year how many will bring back any valuable return  the special benefit of tho exhibition will probably in general be slight the great crowd will have made some acquaintance with the outer circlo of alimentary substances applied to practical purposes and may flatter themselves that they have tasted russian tea and exhausted the varieties of american drinks the innermost circle of the fine arts must impress au visitors with the extent of painted canvas it contains and if it does not succeed in giving us dis tinct views of the differences of national character and feeling it must convey to englishmen a melan choly but wholsome consciousness of the vulgarity which is the predominant characteristic of the pro ductions of their own countrymen between these outermost and innermost rings lie belts of un known character which most visitors traverse as rapidly as possible in passing from one to the other they leave witlh a vague impression of some thing between a bazaar and a fairwe publish today an account of the paris exhi bition which will give it a different aspect to many who have visited it and suggest some conception of the uses to which a visit may be turned to those who have not been there it is written by a workman our contributor travelled with one of the bands of excursionists workmen like himself who have visited paris under the auspices of mr layards committee we aro thus admitted to a work mans view of the exhibition we have a workmans criticisms upon the varieties of work manship and the working capabilities of different nations it will soon indeed be apparent to the reader that the writer may claim some distinction among his fellows some of the leading points of his history are revealed in the course of his commu nication he started apparently from shrop shire and it is made evident that he was many years since perhaps is still employed as a painter upon chinaindeed he confesses to have been a participator in the fabrication of old ssvres ornamented with desigans after boucnex and wat teau for the english markot in addition to this he has been thrown among the iron manufactories of the country and he prepared for the exhibition of  a collection of the fossil plants of the coal fields of shropshire oar contributor must thus rank among the class of artist workmen andif this detracts in any degree from his representative character as an ordinary workman it adds to the intelligence and weight of his opinions the eum mary of his impressions appears to agree with the conclusions already forcibly expressed by other observers and recently repeated by lord gnaxvmln at manchester that there is danger of a decline in the excellence of our home productions from the insufficiency of the technical education of the english workman of the iron manufacture he says that if we are to keep our lead or even maintain a position abreast of others the iron workers must have a better scientific knowledge of the materials they use and the results thoy seek to accomplish it is probable that in this expression of opinion we find some trace of the effect of a complete exhibition of the progress of foreign manufacture on its own ground englishmen are in general so confident of their own superiority that they are staggered when they find foreignworkmen can do any good stroke of work it is worthy of remark that at the beginning of the century one of the fathers of the english irontrade as it has since been developed predicted during a stay in france a dangerous rivalry on the part of foreign workmen but all that has happened has been a useful emulation stimulating the activity of each country we ourselves have no apprehension that we shal aot continue to hold the same position with respect to our con tinental rivals as we have hitherto maintained it may be that in tho distant future when other countries possessing great stores of mineral wealth but as yet inadequately supplied with labour shall have been enabled by the increase of population to develope their resources we shall bo put upon our mettle but as long as the contest depends upon relative skill and mastery of manipulation we shall not be anxions about our position in the industrial arts tho scientific education of the country is backward as it is throughout europe but we trust it will be naturally cultivated with out being forced into prominence by special bounties when our contributor enters upon a consideration of rivalry in the ornamental arts we are not so assured the catzaallor of the excheqerm onceo avowed his opinion that wo never could be an artistio nation we are he declared too busy too much oecupied with toil and trade to be able to cherish the sensibility of beauty or to cultivate the sense of form or colour if we are indisposed to acquiesce in this permanent con demnation we must confess to the existeneo of pre sent defeets the national appreciation of graeo is feeble and uncertain when we come writes the workman of the paris exhibition to highclass ornamentation in iron earthenware ehina or glass the superiority of french art is obvious the french collections of faience exhibit a richness of colouring which is not seen in english produc tions it is admitted indeed that in ordinary de oration for the general market england probably stands first but there is no power to go beyond this line in support of the same oviewit is observed with reference to porcelain that the best specimens exhibited by englishl manufacturers are painted by french and even german workmen in eleganeo of outline and delicacy of tint these artists excel all rivalsis it true that our artistic deficiencies are really attributable as mr dxsazl declared to somo natu ral disqualifications under which we suffer  it is noteasy to believe it lb is especially difficult when we remember that although tho forms of artistic de velopment be many the spirit of art is the same and in many branches we have not been undistin guished if in literature we have at different times been not only eminent but foremostif we can point to a period when gainsborough and reynolds were almost the sole represen tatives of the highest pictorial art in europe we cannot persuade ourselves that we aro neces sarily shut out from distinction in the arts of design and ornament a nation naturally devoid of artistic sensibility must show its deficiencies every whero and at all seasons tho worlman who has favoured us with an accoant of his visit to the paris exhibition has a different explanation of the reason why we are backward in the cultivation of the orna mental arts of common life the french workman has artistic education forced upon him the english man gropes his way after principles and practice while his rival is instructed in the best schools and is directed to the best models our correspondent even goes so far in tho heat of iiis feelings as to de clare that the rulers of english workmen have denied them education though he almost immediately qualifies this wild charge by translating it into another that english workmen have been left to find out their paths for themselvos this latter statement has been and is still to some extent true but it by no means follows that it proves mis conduct on the part of the legislature we have since  established national schools of art which havo done and aro doing much good in the education of the artistic faculties of workmen but it would be easy to overstep the limits of profitable interference even in the art education of the people it is certain we can buy superiority in the decorativo arts at too high a price the greatest excellence in the manufacture of porcelain was attained according to our correspondent in the years which were marked by the greatest degra dation of the french people and it may be added by the establishment of a royal manufactory sup ported at an unknown expense there is no neces sary connexion between beauty in the forms and adornment of cups and saucers and the decadence of a nation but a tendency on the part of thelstate to patronize and stimulate the ornamental arts must be accompanied by a reciprocal tendency to dependence and a loss of private energy if our workrmen have been left to themselves and have in consequence failed to attain the position as artists which some of theo workmen of other countries fill there are compensating advantages which they enjoy it is not too much to hope that we may in the future be able to reconcile the ines timable benefits of individual development with the growth of national taste and to point to products of english art worthy to vie with those of foreigners without being overrun with an army of art teachers still more without being burdened with national manufactories
