greater victories are wroughtwhen the present exhibition was proposed to bo held on tho other side of the channel clubs were formed is largo establishments and inducements were offered for workpeople to visit the exhibition but for somo reason or othor as time wore on men grow careless they coased sub scribing and even in works where firstclass medals hrve bean gained they abandoned tho projeoct

ticket for tho exhibition joined the throng pass ing through the gates into the grounds stretching right and left and filliag up the corners of tho great square of the champ de mars which we found to be an exhibition of itself laid out with care and skill with winding walks lawns lakes and cascades it contains tomples palaces tents and those humbler habitations which characterize dwellers on the

similarlyrepresented and other nations arc the same  so that the visitor wanders from egypt to tunis from tunls to china visiting their theatres scanning their features and costumesbefore entering tho building let us say from our own ex perience that somo previously settled plan and arrangement are necessary for seeing its contents to advantage foronr selves having a speclal object to serve we confined ourselves to certain departments taking the great rings separately and diving down the avenues that intersect them only occa slonally we had set ourselves the task of paying special attention to the iron pottery and porcelain departmentswith regard to the first wo have only to look at this vast building and its contents to believe with francis horner that iron is the soul of every other manufaoture and the mainspring of civilized soclety it forms the greatest gun the heaviest shot the longest rope the sharpest lancet the most powerful and the most delicate machinery and the strenuous efforts pit forth by competing natious in its improvement show how very much they are impressed with the belief of its suprome importanco as an element of prosperity in no one thing so much as this does the pre sent exhibition show suoh a rapid advance along the leading paths of progress and never probably was a more complete attempt made to ropresent the metal itself in tho various stages of its manufacture or to brlng together for pur poses of instructive study the minerals out of which it is manufactured the great beauty of hickss engine and other american machines the improvement and inventive iess of those of francaes in the winding and pumping engiaes of l a quillacq some of which have already found their way into this countryand the beautiful metallurgical and miseral

italso by means of compressed air serves to ventilat tho mine as an instance of the ingth of timo which it takes for an invention of this kind to becomo matured we may mention that the famous john wilkinson beforo referred to invented similar machines  years ago wbich he called iron men but which in consequence of the prejudice of theminers fel into disusesome of thefrench mining aud manufacturing proprietors we observedexhibited models plans and drawings not only of their works but of schools chapolsand workmensdwell ings showing that they consider it in some measure a duty to attend to the social moral and intellectual condition of their workpeoplo and from facts coming to our know ledge respecting tho means of education supplied the care taken of sick workmen aud the provision made for them in old age it really does appear to us that the right steps are being taken by manufacturers for the purpose of surround ing themselves with intelligent and contented populations this circumstance might possibly accouut to some extent for the fact that there is more economy in the use of fuel and more care in utilzing materials in connexion with the iron works in that country than in this we saw no such plans or models in the english collectionsin connexion with mining it might not be out of place to observe thatprofessor goepert so well known to the geolo gists of this country as a successful teacher of that science exhibits fossils and photographs of fossil plants found in association with the coal measures the photographs con sist of beautifullyexecuted plates showing the structure of the fossils and of natural fossils upon which the scientific might feast their eyes for hoursthe couection is interesting as showing how widely the samo conditions prevaied under whichthe flora of the coal measures flourished the writer of this report made a similar collection of fossils from the shropshiro portion of the english coalfield for the exhibition of s which was purchased by sir henry de la beche for tho national museum jermynstreetsome of the foreign and engush exhibitors in metals also show specimens of clays found associated with their iron ores others clays and pottery made therefrom the art of turning to account tho plastio material naturo bequeathed to us agos since and which she herself has partially worked up in her own laboratory is one of the earliest and most in teresting among manufactures french english and others exhibit specimens of what clays found in their own localities are capable of producing and the terra cotta group certainly showe great progress to have boen made in the quality of he articles the greatest advance however appears to havo beon in the mixturo of suitablo materials and their adaptation to architectural purposes one of tho advan lags being the cheapness at which highly orna mental works suitable for fine decoration can be accom plished and another the almost indestructible quality of the articles produced as a more scientifio knovwledge of the primary elements of clays has been gained a more judicious mixture of the materials has been effected so that unequal shrinkcage and consequent warping have been avoided at thesame time that hardness and durability have been secured ornamental baildings of this material in the grounds of the exhibition and the very handsome public structures in some english towns show the extent to which it is capable of artistio treatment in the various styles of constructive decoration by colouring the material of which the tesser e forming some of the most interesting pic torial mosaics is composed all through the evil which lost us somo interesting examples of the art in former times by the action of the air or the wear of traffic has been avoided and durability secured the examples of coloared mosaics and others of panels striegcourses friezes together with other means of architectural enrichment are highly inte resting ad the prices which we find in some instances affixed show that they are brought much more within public reach than formerly very fiuo examples of the several clays used are exhibitod tho most complete variety being found in the messrs maws collection england may challenge the world for the quality and variety of its clays and no part of england can boast a greater variety of saimples than theiron districts of shropshire where the works of these gentlemen are situatedthe collections of earthenware in the exhibition are in structive fand for variety and exoellence england no dmubt maintains that superiority which has so long distinguished her in ordinary decoration for tho general marlet it is pro bable she stands first there is nothing however that we saw in point of artistic finish to compete with some of the jars of the french manufactur wedgewood has some ex cellent figure subjects but ono cannot got rid of the idea that it is a mnistake to put such good things on such an inferior body while the painting of birds and foliage on tho jars and jardineers in thefrench collections impress yon by a richness of colouring not incodsistent with the material of which indeed little is seen in fact when we come to highclass ornamentation in iron earthenware china or glass the superiority of the french art is obvious as long as wo confine ourselves togeometrical forms in ham mering pressing turning on the lathes or printing on the surface we have no difficulty in holding oar own bht where an intellectualism is concerned or a free educated hand is required in decoration our deficiencies become ap parent the fault is less our own than our rulers who have denied us education or who have at least given us nothing to fit us for our destinations in life but have left us feebly groping in the dark in life for ever feebly attempting to overtake lost opportunitiescmnnawe should not have ventured to offer an opinion upon this department of the exhibition after the able and ex haustive articlo which appeared in thc times somo eweks since but that it is to use a word fast getting into use our apecditd  exhibitors from this side the channel are not we fancy quite so numerous as on former occasions but tho contest has been closer and the merits are not so much on one side as formerly the collection in the royal savres court is in some measure beyond the reach of criticism but a few considerations even here sngest them selves the ordinary run of savres patterns it strikes us have mothing to distinguish them from the every day pro ductlions of other manufacturers in france and england in fact taking the same class of goods the superiority is on the side of the french and english manufacturers the colours too lie on tho surface of the glazethey have a dry amdhusky appearance and would easily be affected by acids the only novelty they exhibit is the production of white sultjects inrellefon celadon asd othlerquiet looking gromds

soon be plenty of imitations in the market any one look ing over tho magniicent collection of the imperlal court willperceive that some of the specimens are labelled putc tenssre and pte dur saud he wll observoe a corresponding differenco in the quality of the surface the distinction lies chiefly in the quansity and quality of the glae on one the glaze is incorporated ivith tho body and allowa thecolours to sink during the firing so that they appear soft and mellowv in the other the glaze is so hard that the colours romain upon the surface and have a husky appearaneu the quantity and quality of the glaze on all china manufactured here prior to the great revolution was such that the whole sur face including the colours might bo denuded yet upot putting the pleco through the kldn it would come out roc glated out own opinion is that the trae pdtc tendsrc as made duringthorelgesof louis xv andlouissxvihas not sinco been reproduced in france or england and that thnearest approch tolt was that msdo at rantgarw about  yenrss ago specimnebs of whieh now fetch as high price as old sdvres ohina from wbat we know of the former and from acefaculastmdy of the latter wo believe both tohbave beenifits bodlesthat is bodies the materials of which are ftrst mixed then fired and lsstly ground up into cday itbe result of which was that thoy had a vitrl fied appearance tbrounhout it was therefore a puste and absorbed a considerable quantity iof glaze which became fully incorporated with it and which it gain gave out ia the enamelling kiln let any one examine a piece of ancient sdvres or nant garw china and he wu lind them to have a yellow waxy torture and tint totally unliko any poreelain of the present day the expenso of makingitruined the nant garw proprletors and the cost and risk arising from its liabllity to crack in the kiln have deterred others from making it in england a very near appproach both to the old smvres and the nantgarw is mado by using a larger pro portion of felspar kaolin and bone than in ordinary china but this also increases the risk by rendering it tho more subjeet to fly or crack in sring thirty years ago when the rage for old savres china was at its hierhest a fewy londondealers in old sevres china made large fortunes in purchas ing white specimens or thoso slightly decorated and having them repainted and regilt in this country their agents in france attended sales and sought every opportanity of bnuy ing it the slight sprigs of flowers were then removed by fluorio acidandelaboratelypainted subjects of flowersbirds cupids and figures chiefly from boucher and watteau were painted in richly gilt shields with turquoise green and other grounds white dessert plates were greedily bought at prices varying from half a guinea to a guinea which wero resold at from five to ten guineas in order to deceive the purchaser the sharp touches of tho chaser on the gold were rubbed off by the hand sometimes a dirty greasy rag was employed to make it look as though it had been a long time in use to increase the deception the china when finished was sent off redirected in london in french ani knowing old lovers of savres china with long purses were apprised that a package of choico articles bought of madame  or at the dake of s salo had arrived and they flattered themselves highly in being privileged to see the box opened bargains were quickly struck on the spot lest the article might faluinto other hands the buyer fancy ing himself fortunate in securing a costly articlo before others had had a chance even of looking at it the writer has several times seen specimens of his own painting at noblemens houses which he was informed were choice productions of the royal sevres works pur chased for large sums in returning through lon don from the paris exhibition the other day he saw in a shop in the strand similar old acquaintances whiclh tho owner values no donbt at a high price and which he believes to have been altogether the prodactions of the last century at the old savres works it is not neces sary however to havo fritg body in order to produce the same effect upon the surface  a good thick glaze with a high firo will enable you to get the same mellowness of colour and effect in proof of which we may mention that some time time ago one of our first and keenest manufac turers purchased a purchased a pair of his own vases be lieving them to be old sdvres and introduced them as ex amples they had been bought from his own warehouse in white were painted by the writer in the old savres style sold in london and bought some years after by the manu facturerthe rage for old savres china did more good than is gene rally imagineditencouraged the importation of somo of the best specimens of french ceramic art and the close imitation to which it led had the effect of educating a class of artisans wiso subsequently turned their attention to english porcelain painting and led to a rapid im provement in the art in this respect the english manufacturers the english aristocracy and the english publio generauy benefitted by the expenditure of french funds in tho improvoment of the ceramic art which gave a spur to improvement in this country in fact whatever may be said to the contrary the writer is of opinion that the old savres china as manufactured up to the revolu tion had merits which no china in the world besides pos aessed and which have not yet been surpassed although thousands of pounds have beea expended by the more ad vanced manufacturers of china in england in their efforts to produce the rich turquoise anl the nore delicato roso tint to which the famous madame dubarry gave her name the imitations excopting with regard to the latter colour are generally poor and feeble for lucid transparency com bined with a creamy mellowness of tone for richness of grounds and gradations of colour it remains unequalledthe objection to pdte kendre and soft glaze commerciauy is that the surfaco is easily scratched and the great deside ratum is to combine tho qualities of the two in other words the problem to be solved is how to have hard glazo and yet have the painting soft and mel low and this can be accomplished by a little ex tra thickness of glaze and by preparing tho colours with less flax so that they might stand a greater heat in tho enamelling kiln some of the french and some of our english manufacturers havo recently softened their glazes to suit the colours some uso a softer glaze for orna ments as there is no danger of scratching and a harder for ordinary dinner and dessert ware minton uses a softer glaze than formerly and moro of it  hence the rich grounds and soft sinking of the painting into the glazo speci mens of which are to be seen on his stall the same may bo said of copeland consequently their grounds rival those of modern france in design modelling colour ing combination of colour and general decoration we should say these houses are equal to any either french orenglish ono thing worth mentioning before leaving this part of the subject and which wo have not seen noticed by critics is that the most remarkable specimens those upon which these eminent manufacturers most rely are paintings by fronch and german workmen we mention this merely as one of the colateral faots supporting the great truth that in matters relating to the higher branches of art wo aro deficient there is no english flower painter equal to hurton and if we except allen there are no english figure painters equal to thoso employed by raingo and other frenoh manufacturers we except a kinsman of our own mr c groy of chesterterracelondon whose pictures on porcelain in the oil and water colour department havo been pronounced the best in the exhibition because he is a painter of pictures only tako leroseys desort service with subjects from tho ceilings of the palace of versaiues his mi niatures of tho emperor end of the four italian poots or the figare subjects in tm raingos collec tion and there is an elegance of outline a delicacy in the flesh tints and an artistic treatment generally which shows how well the author has profited by the advantages which france affords to her workmenoeraiuo statuaryin addition to tho savres works we visited those of it guile who besides enamelling manufactures bisque figures many of which find their

like it in england we were informed by m guilo that he took special pains in having his materials ground so as to have all of an equal fineness and that for this purpose he washed off the finer portions and submitted the coarser to another grinding so that the same material would be returned to the miu four or five times there is no doubt that this would tend much to prevontunequslshrinkage

duty in the biscuit kiln to which they are afterwards sub mitted by this means they say thoy are enabled to correct errors or flaws beforo the final firing and so to avoid lossin conclusion there are a few facts and thoughts which for want of time and space wo can only group together in the first place there does not appear to be so wide a differ ence in francebetween artists and artisans between the man who designs ard the man whose duty it is to work out a design as in ths country asw e heard an english work man in andother branch of trade observo oi paris there is much more credit to an englshb orkman it ho is clever for a frenohman bas so many advantages that if ha only havo moderate talents he canscarcely help but be a good workman he has exceuent schools to give him a primary education and go where ho will there is something to educate his eyo ana deevato his taste we have been groping our way in ignorant and bigoted security and quarreuing in which way education should be given or denying it altogether while other nations have been getting before us and if this exhibition have no other effect in england than to convinco us of our deficiencies it will have bad its missionso far aswe arx conerned the present prosperity of this coun try is so unmistakeably interwoven with its manufac tures and the preeminence of theso depends so much upon now adaptations discoveries and improvements as to demand for the workers in iron china and other departments the readiest and best educational training and enlightenment this nation can givo them it is not only idle but suicidal to dream of remain ing where we are we must strike out in new paths we must advance with the world or lose caste and trado to gether how many men know anything ab all of the mato riab

and paintiugs of nature in the mine interpreting at each stage the emblems of earlier states and existences such an education would tell in many ways it would tame and civilizo tho barbarous savages of our mining districts and eufranchise them as men while in france we did not see one single case of dirumkeuness or one frenchman auarreuling with another and we heard the same remnark made by a dozen others at least weo wero struck as others were with the courtesy showyn by man to man and by the affection displayed to children and to old people wo believe that the working men of paris and their wives dress more plainly live less expensively yet enjoy lifo more than workin men in eng land and we attribute much of this to the superior educa tion they receivewith regard to paris itself
