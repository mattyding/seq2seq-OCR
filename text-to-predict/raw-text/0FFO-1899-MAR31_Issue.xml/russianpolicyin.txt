russian polacy in syrarox oni  o tconslatopile ol in orthodt ecclesiastical circles here there is much bitter lanientation conerming the growth of russian influence over the church in syria and palestinean influence which is gradually up planting that of the ecumenical patriarch it is but little raore than a yearago that the phlnar began to realize the fact which less optimiist observers had already discerned that rpussian endeavours were directed to that end and that appreciable progress had aheady been made towards its attainment it was not however until some time after the appointment in  of m beliaieff as consul ia damascus that russian policy plainly manifested itselfthe incident which ora particularly appears to have opened the eyes of the cecumenical patriarch was the resignation in february of last year of mgr spiridion patriarch of antioch whose position had become untenable owing to the systematic opposition of the majority of the synod acting under pussian inspiration this body consists of  prelates of whom five are of the greek ana seven of the syrian arab race and this syrian group forced mgr spiridion to resign it was their settled purpose to bring about this result fortheyhad been taughtby consul beliaieff that they might expel tho creatures of the patri arch of constantinople from the patriarchal and episcopal sees of syra and palestine and then constitute an autocephalic church with an exclu sively semitic syrian hierarchy and the holy sepulchre itself as the seat of its central autho rity obviously a church thus constituted must look abroad for political support russia would afford this support and in return the local political influence of the church would be exercised to promote russian interestson the resignation of mgr spiridion mgr germanos a greek bishop of tarsus and adana wvas apdointed locutm tentns and was instructed to prepare to elect a new patriarch in the traditional emannerthat isto ask the ecumenical patriarch for a list of three prelates ode of whom the synod elects but while this was proceeding the vali of damascus nazshn pasha who is on the very best of terms tvith consul beliaieff informed the synod that an iradd has been sent to him from constantinople ordering that the new patriarch should be chosen from among the bishops of the patriarchate to the exclusion of au other prelates this was glorions news for tho  native as distinguished from the  greek  pary the synod forthwith couvoked a meet ing of notables of vhom about  attended and appointedcanelectoralcolomiteeoftenpersonswho with the bishops prepared a list of candidates which they proposed to send to the ecumenical patriarch with a request tiat he would choose tnree names from it ana returnthemtothe synod for final election but lr germanos declined to countenance these innovtions and refused point blank to sign the minutes of the meeting whereupon the synod deposed mttgr germanos appointed as locafm taxs in his stead mgr lalateos bishop of latakia a syrian and about the middle of last ayv forwarded their decree to constantinople for imperial ratificationnio action was taken here upon this procedwre and for over nine months lgr germanoa re mained nourn ecmns with mgr malateos wait ing to step into his shoes but the russian ambassador in the private audience which the sultan gave himi on feruary  delivered to hisiajesty a message from the tsar in consequence of which orders were sent in all haste to nazim pasha to inform ii gernanos of his d eavition and mcir mnalateos of his appointment and to bid the new locuraz tonzs proceed at once to elect a patriarch on receipt of these messages about march  the synod began preparing to elect a patriarch according to the method taught bv consul beliaieff which mgr germanos had refused to adopt if carried into effect it wvill make the patriarchate of antioch a close thing for the native prelates and its exltended applica tion would secure for them the patriarcfiate of jerusalem also it is therefore not surprising that the phanar should have sent as it did a few days ago a deputation to tho palace to present in the names of the patriarchs of constantinople jerusalem and alexandria a formal protest against the innovations which the majority of the ynod of antioch encouraged thereto by the russian consul and the vali seek to impose upon the ecumenical patriarchate to this protest no reply has yet been madeit may be mentioned that since the appoint ment of m beliaieff to the russian consulate at damascus a large number of schoolsover  in northern syria have been brought undler russian influence and patronage and are served by russian professors the russian imperial palestine society founded some years ago with the ostensible object of assisting rssian pilgrims to the holy sepulchre did not at the outset inspire the ecumenical patriarchate with any distrust nor is there any visible remason escept ing the increase in the number of its schools at jersalem bethlehem and nazareth why it should be distrusted now such however is the case and the phanar looks upon the russian palestine society as the wolf in sheeps clothing which is seeking to devour the influence of the qecumenical patriarch in the eoly land
