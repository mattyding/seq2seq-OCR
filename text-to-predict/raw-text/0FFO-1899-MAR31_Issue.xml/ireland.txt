justice meredith presiding at the chief land commission in belfast today gave judgment in the important appeal cases heard some time ago in cona nexion with the estate of the marquis of dufferin and ava his lordship in tee course of an exhaustive judg meat said the holdings were situated on the dufferm family estate to which the present landlord succeeded prior to  se was a minor and the management of the property remained in the bands of an uncle during his minority he came of age iu  and at once proceeded to make himselt acquainted not merely viith the general features of his propertybutwith every holding on his estate ee visited he told them everg farm school mad cottage he msoe himself thoroughly familiar with the history of his estate the particulars of the various leases and ten ncies under which his tenants held and the circumstances of each individual tenant he found that almost the entire estate vas in the occupation of lesseholders many of the leases being of ancent date se found in some cases two or three generations of the original lessee occupying separate portions of a lease holdmig acuost the first thing he did was to reduce of his own free nill the rents payable to him by � a year these and other details he mentioned in his evidence and allusion was made to them at that stae es for the purposeof showins that so far back ats l the mfarqcis of dnfferin set himself tho task of acquiring and did acquire the most intimte knowledge of the mnauapement and working of his pro perty and of the relations existing between landlord and tenant upon thle estate nor wras the interest thus early manifested allowed to die out through inter veng years and until the present hour he had main tained the position he then took up and no one who heard him examined could entertain a doubt that he was in a position to spek with accurate knowledge born of personal experience ertendiag over half a cen tury as o the existence or nonexistene upon his estate of any of the usages prevalent in the province of ulster which were known as th el stcr tenantright enstom he the chairinan used the words ofthe first section of the act of  advicedly it was too often forgotten nowadays that the ulster tenantright custom assumed various shapes and occasionally he might say disguises every one who knew anrything about the ulster tenantright custom knew that it varied very much on estates a very few miles from each other so said lord chancellor sullivan in  macilroy v brooke the ulster tenantright castom was not uni form it exists and manifests itself in a variety of usages therefore when a claim founded on it is made in respect of a particular holding they must in the first instance find out what was the usage applicable to the holding so said lord chancellor ball in  lendrim v dlasley these and masny other authorities established that before any tribunal could determine whether any particular estate or any particular holding upon an estate was subject to the ulster tenantright custom it was necessary to ascertain  whether in ract an estate usage existed   the nature and limits of that usage s that the usage so ascertained and earmarked was one of the usages prevalent in the province of ulster in the present eases it was adimitted an estate usage existed in fact but it was contended in behalf of the landlord that its limits were so narrow and is restrictions so numerous that it could not be classed among the usages prevalent in ulster and knoivn as the ulster tenantright custom on a careful review of the entire evidence and attaching to the testimony of lord dunfforin the weight wvhich for thu reasons he hail alroady indicated they thought it deserved they had arrived at the conclusion that the usages proved to exist on the dufferin estate notwithstanding restric tions and limitations by which as they held it was checked and qualified was one of the usage prevalent in ulster and was the ulster tenantright custom in

delivered con demning ritualistic practices and the following reso lution was passed  thats we deeply deplore the increasing and illegal iritualism in our irish church services nd the sacerdotal teaching in our pulpits and that feeling such to be due in a great measure to the inexplicable apathy of our bishops we call upon them to use their powers with a firm hanid in repressing all rlemanizing practices specially exhorting our lay brethren to rise to their privileges to resist innovations to insist on their rights at the ensuing easter vestriesand to withhold all support finiancial or otherwise from all romanizing clergymen from the missionary sceiety known as the spg and from all other romanizing agencies and also that while reprobating in the strongest terms all acts of violence we at the same time cannot but feel that upon the sacerdotal con temners of our doctrines and services the primary responsibility for all such excitement must be laid  a resolution was also passed urging their members of parliament to mive their most strenuous opposition to the proposed inoman catholic unitersity bill for ireland and also advocating the establishment of a protestant party in parliament
