a rbussian statesmanthe russian library edited by w t stead began well by publishing as the first volume of the series the  reflections of a russian statesman by k p pobyedonostsefe procurator of the holy synod of russia translated from the russian by robert crozier long witb a prefaco by olga novikoff the volume cannot bc said to be very attractive for the general public because it deals mostly vith abstruse subjects in which the maajority of ordinary readers are not much interested but it deserves to be studied carefullly by all who wish to understand thoroughly the undercurrents of political and re ligious thought in bussia the name of m pobyedonostseff is well known in western europe but the common notions regarding his character and activity are in many respeets in accurate and much that is written about him is to say the least misleading in his own country he has often been misrepresented and even mali ciously caricatured this fact can be easily ex plained when the russian educated classes im meliately after the crimean war were carried away by a violent enthusiasm for western  civilization  and  liberalism  in all its forms and a large part of the young generation losing their mental balance plunged into a dangerous intellectual current which threw many of them into the abyss of nihilism al pobyedonostseff attempted to stem this current and thereby made himself the reputation of a retrograde an obscu rantist a byzantine and a dangerous enemy of all progress intellectual social and political more recently his name was associated with the persecution of jews and heretics and he came to be looked upon in many quarters as a russian torquemada a truer conception of the man vwll be found in the short and vigorouslywritten preface by mme noviloffhis name she  tells us stands for religion as opposed to atheism for orthodoxy as opposed to itomanism on the one hand and protestantism on the other and for authority as opposed to anarchy in him all the irreligious forces or modern nihilism as well as the theological quacks with their sham remedies for the ills of the soul have long recognized the aupreme embodiment of all the principles against which they wae unceasing wxar    even his worst enemies will not deny that during the whole of his life h pobyedonostseel has never even been accused of acting oa any other than the loftiest political and religious principles he certainly has carried out his convictioms wih honest pertinacity he is not a man of compro muise he is a man of principle and he has been true to his convictionswhat his convictions are we cannot under take to expound in detail but we may indicate them vaguely by a few examples iiis first essay is on church and state as a good russian and a faithful member of the eastern orthodox church he approves of state churches cavours celebrated principle of a free church in a free state is in his eyes an abomination  the church as a community of believers cannot and must not detach itself from the state    its duty is to inspire the people with respect for the law and for power and to inspire in power respect for human freedom on the other handthe state must show in itself a living faithuncer these conditions alone viul the sentiment of respert for the law and of confidence in the power of the state he maintained and strengthened among the people    the system of state or established churches has many defects many inconveniences and many difeiculties  it does not preclude the possibility of antagonism or conflict but it is absurd to suppose that it has outlived its time and thalt the formula of cavour is the only key to the solution of all the dliii culties of the most dificult of questionsin another place he points out that the applica a tion of cavours formula in the united states zias led to an uncdesirable predominance of the roman catholic churchthe second chapter is entitled the new democracy and here also m pobyedonostseff shows himself a good sound retrograde he does not disguise his contempt for venerated demo cratic institationsthe history of mankind bears witness that the most necessry and fruitful reformsthe most durable measuresemanated from the supreme will of statesmen or from a minority enightenetd by lofty ideas and deep knowledge and tbat on the contrary the ex tension of the representative principle is accompanied by an abasement of political ideas and the valgarization of opinions in the mass of the electorsand the methods employed seem to him as objectionable as the fundamental principle is falsethe manipulation of votes in the game of democracy is of the commonest occurrence in most european states and its falsehood it would seem has been exposed toll yet felw dare openly to rebel against itorganization and briberythese are the two mighinstruments which are employed with such success for the manipulation of the mass of electorsthe tricks of unscrupulous orators also must not be overlookedthe crowd is easily attracted by commonplaces and generalities inzvested in sonorous phrases it cares nothing for proof which is inaccessible to it  thus is formed unanimity of thought a unanimity fictitious and visionary but in its consequences actual enough this is called  the voice ot the people with the pendant  the voice of god it is a deplorable errorclosely counected with it is the dogma of the sovereignty of the people which is dealt with in the third essay under the title  the great false hood of our time the dogma has led naturally to parliamentary institutions and we are told thatthe institution of parliament is indeed one of the greatest illustrations of human delusion    on the pediment of this edifice is inscribed  all for the public good  this is no more than a lying formnals parliamentarism is the triumph of egoism its highest expression all here is calculated to the service of the ego in the parliamentary fiction the representative as such surrenders his per sonality and serves as the embodiment of the wiul and opinions of his constituents  in reality the con stituents in the very act of election surrender all their rights in favour of their representative    the peoplo loses all importance for its representative until the time arrives when it is to be played upon again then false and flattering and lying phases are lavished as befoe some are suborned by bribery others terri fied by threatsthe long chain of manacuvres are spun which forms an invariable factor of parliameutarism yet this electoral farce continues to deceive humanity and to be regarded as an institution which crowns the edifice of state poor humanity  in truth may it be saidmumdus ralt decipi deciaetrli obyedonostseff for his part evidently pre fers though he does not expressly say so a good thorough oldfashioned beneficent despotism sans prarses after enumerating the most notorious evils of parliamentary govermnent and referring to those which are peculiar to austria where they are complicated by the struggle of nationalities he exclaims providence has preserved our russia with its heterogeneous racial composition from like misfortunes it is terrible to think of our condition if destiny had sent us the fatal giftan allrussian parliament  but that will never be trial by jury so far at least as continental countries are concerned finds quite as little favour in his eyesit was at once reckless and irrational to entrust to the justice of tbe people the decision as to the guilt of tn accused person wwithout devising practical measures of discipline and without plrepratory study of this alien institution in the iana of its origin and with all its complex strroundingsthe press comes in for still stronger condemna tion after a significant allusion to the father of lies m pobyedonostseff sayswe are bidden to believe that the judgments of news apers and periodicals the judgments of the socalled press arcthe expression of public opinion this too is a falsehood the press is one of the falsest institutions of onr time    experience proves that the most contemptible personsretired moneylenders jewish factors newsvendors and banhrupt gamblers may found newspapers secure the services of talented wriers and place their editions on the market as organs of public opinionthese quotations might be indefinitely multi plied but we think we have given enough to show what manner of man mi pobyedonostseff is and what the principles are which be wishes to see applied in russia his political influence is no longer so great as it was in the time of alex ander ml buthe is still a factor which cannot be overlooked with regard to his present position tadame novikoff says in her preface m pobyedonostseff by his deep learning and his lofty charaeter has secured for himself ono of the highest posstions in an empire which even the blindest nowbeginto see is the dominating power in europe and asia he is not afraid of speaking his mind freely to his emperor and he is just as unbiased in appealing to the masses of his readers his worst foes cannot deny the perfect frankness and honesty which permeate his boo the opinions of a statesman who for many years has held such a position in an empire like russia are surely well worth the attentioa of the westerm nations m pobyedonostseff is the gritic in the staus to him as to all of us russians te parliamentary theatre of the western world per forms a long tragicomedy which occasionally ascends reflections of a russian statesman by i p obedonostaef graatbrichardsto tragedy and sometimes sinks into farcm we can observe it dispassionately critically and sometimes evex sympatbeticallywe do not know whether the western world will feel grateful to mme novikoff for the con descending sympathy which she assures us she occasionalsy extends to it but we must gently protest against the assumption that she and m pobyedonostseff ropresent all of us irussians
