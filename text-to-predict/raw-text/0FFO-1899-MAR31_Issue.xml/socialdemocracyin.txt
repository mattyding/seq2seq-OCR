social democracy in russiai enom our own cornrsapondmntvienna waci the russian social democratic periodical entitled the catsc of labottr hasforwaided to the vienna organ of the party the arbeiter zcitung a secret report frcm the chief of the moscow police to the governor of that town it contains tho important revelation that social democracy is really making headway in russia thanks to the development of native industry the writer begins byobserving that all the re volutionary groups wecomed the social demo cratic movement in the hope that it would enable them to direct the power of the masses against the government the german socialists dis covered the way of combining the promotion of their ideal aims with the daily requirements of the labouring classes they thus naot only rendered their doctrines intelligible to the work ing man but made their party appear as the genuine defender of his interests the success of these tactics in germany could not fail to affect other countries including russia the russiau revolutionists abandoned their old flag and hastened to join the new movement the adoption of the new method spared them the necessity of long argument for the conversion of the workers to their views it was only necessary for them to give expression to the needs and wishes of the discontented masses translating them into positive demands these were so intelligible to the labourer and affected his interests so closely that the circulation of a few handbills was sufficient to incite  whole factory to strike workthe chief of police observes as a noteworthy circumstance that the labour movement which originated in the agitation of the revolutionary ele ment afterwards developed independently thus working men who knew nothing of the doctrines of the party and hadc only heard rumours of the success of certain strikes followled thle example given freouently with satisfactory results ee attributes the success of these strikes to a want o forethought and vizilance on the vart of theauthorities and their oflicial agents these successes have an extremely dangerous and prejuidicial effect upon the state inasmuch as they constitute an elementary school for the political education of tne mworkig class they confirm the confidence of the masses in their own power teach them more practical methods of combatand train anzd gire promisnence to specially gifted individuals oi greater initiative they further convince the labourer of the possibility and advantage of combination and of collective action in general at the same time they render him more accessible to socialist ideas which be bad previously regarded as idle dreams the consciousness of a solidarity of interests with the labouring classes throughout the world is developedin these local struggles this involves a recognition that political agitation inthe social democratic sense is indispensable to victory the chief of police is therefore of opinion that the state should deprive the revolutionary element of this powerful weapon all the more so as no far reaching reforms zppear to be necessary for the purpose all that is required being an extension of the activity of the existing authorities repressive measures suffile so lon as the revolutionary agitator preaches pure ï¿½ocialism that is no longer the case when hetakes advantage of abuses of the prevailing order of things in the circumstances it is necessary to nt the ground from under his feet the agitator should be deprived ofhis best weapon and this mibht be done if the worker ivere provided with a legal means of improving his hard lot in this way the labouring masses would be divided and lose the force upon which the agitators reckon wvhile the vounger and more energetic would listen to the latter the average working man word prefer the less brilliant but safer legal method of securing redressaccording to the chief of police not only the labourers but the employers are often guilty of infringements of the law the latter cannot accustom themselves to the idea that their workmen as parties to the contract existing between tlem have equal rights with themselves it frequently happens that in differences in which the employers have been found to be at fault they have dismissed the spokesmen of the cjanjos this arbitrry conduct harle legally pormissible is highly dangerous from a political standpoint it practi cally deprivesthe laboulrer of his right of com plaint and thus embittered leaves hirm a prey to the revolutionary agitatorthe writer proceedsto argue that as thelabour movement nowv absorbs the entire energy of the revolutionary element it should be nader the strict surveillance of the political police assisted by the manufacturers and the ordinary guardians of the peace the circmnstance that aitators have latterly been in a position to atte ntheir ends by legal means is due he says to the neglect of the factory inspectors it is therefore the dulty of the police to keep a watchful eye on everlthinl that affectsat e labourmg classes the present situationm is eso dsuieting aud he activity of the revolutionary agitators is so intense that the combined action of al the auttho rities affected will boe necessary to cournterac it jee recalls the fact that the ministry of thc interior which reeognizes the gravity of the situation instructed the provincial governors last august to order the police to keep a sttict watch on factories and workshops as well as on the homes of the labouriag classes and to report immediately any excitement that might become evident among them they were at the same time to remove as far as possible the cause of their discontent when they had ground for corn plaint as to unfair treatment by their employers it vas proposed that inquiries should be held into the causes of labour disturbances as being matters of a political character a suggestion in which the mfinistry of justice was in perfect agreement with that of tlhe interiorin the further course of his remarks the riter says that it is necessary for the police to intervene in labourr disputes as the faetory inspectors are not capable of settling them these inspectors are overvhelmed with work ana are consequently not in a position to perform their duties in a satisfactory manner within a perio of three nonths the poliee had to intervene in no fewer than  disputes of the kind which would otherwise have led to serious disturbances if bis occurs at moscow twheie the forces of the govern ment are concentrated how he asks must it be in the pirovinces  the chief of police concludes his report wvith the sugcrestion that most of the provincial strihes wvich necessitate the employ mnent of jmilitary and exercise such a powerful influence on the political views of the labouring classes are due to a lack oi supervision on the part of the state
