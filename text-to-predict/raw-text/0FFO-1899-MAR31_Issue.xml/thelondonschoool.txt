against the scbooland mrw c tagg elerk tocamberwell vestrymr lyilph straey in presenting the case for the london school board statedi that the district was a growring one  that there was at present a delciency of accommodation in blocks w and s for the  children for whom it wvas proposed to erect a building and  that these blocs wrould havo to be considered alone as the education department had by ictter allowved them to be taken as onemr rogns called for the letter allowing this bat it was not produced he said that if the principle of isolat ing blocks was accepted they might have a school empty just outsido the boundaries of a block although it would not be talien into accountmr stanley contended that blocks w and x in east lambeth should be cousidered a single district by itselftle coxnssaoneir said he should not lay down any hardandfast line such as that contended for by mr stanley hear hearmir st aedd stated that the retarns from which mr stanley had got his supposed  deficiency were not accurate inasmuch as children who in all probability would go to voluntary schools were scheduled in one case where there were seven children in a family five of them went to a voluntary school but the other two were scheduled although of course there was every probability of them not being sent to a board school when they came to be of suficient age again people occupying houses of less rateable value than � sent their children to the wilsons grammar school or the mary datchelor school two secondary schools in the block but no allowance was made for them hie read the resolution adopted by the vestry in  and re affitmed at their last meeting strongly disapproving of the proposal to erect this school as it was unnecessary and would depreciate the value of the property in the neighbourhood he called attention to the fact tbat according to the london school boards pnblished reports there were now some  empty plaees in the board schools of the metropolis and that that mneant that the london school board had sunk � capital which was bearing no fruitmr bogers quoted figures published by the london school board to sbow that kr stanleys contention that there vwas a deficiency of  places in subdivisions w and x wasu tterly fallacious hle stated  that the neighbourhood was not a growing one which was proved by the last scheduling of the london board which showed  fewer chidren in east lanibeth  that the needs of the neighbourhood were already overprovided for by the new peclkhamroad board school and others of the board schools to the extent of  roll accommoda tion without reckoning in the frrther empty free places of the voluntary schools therein   that the school board had increased its roll limits in the immediate neighbourhood within half a milo of the centre of tho area in dispute during the last four years by  the number of children admitted to these places having only increased by  he protested against the school board getting up evidence from documents closed to others then actina for the prosecution and finay sitting im judgment on these matters tlhere should he some chec upon the boards figures as scheduled from time to time for they were wholly unreliable he had seen this proved in one case mn a letter to the times where  children scheduled had dwindled down to  requiring school accormmodation but in this instance it confined to block w on the boards showing by their own figures up to march   he contended that in the pro posal to build a school costing � the demand ws based upon the fact that it was needed for  children over live and  babies just out of their mothers arms hear hoarthe second p art of the inquiry was then takenviz as to the suitability or otherwise of the cuthillroad sitemlr wmrtelxy said that three sites had been sug gestedone in camberwellgrove another in lovevalk and the third at cuthillroad he contended that a board school so far from injuring a locality improved it the school board as ar economical body loud cries of  oh  desired a cheap site and were there fore willing to consider suggestionsmir tsdale progressive member of camberwell vestry opposed the cuthillroad site protesting against it as an unnecessary pulling down of houses whilst cheaper sites which were empty had been ignored by the bordthe rev j b clank as chairman of the maanagers of the crawfordstreet board school stated that  of their children came from cethillroad and thereabouts their school being very near cuthillroad there were now  vacant places in the crawford street schoolmr sr cbdi stated that as a local representative he had been besieged by persons anxious to sign a memorial against the proposed school these were the residents for whoso supposed advantage the building was to be erected this school if built would quite change the nature of te immediate neighbourhood the rateable value of the houses in some instances ran into e or � a yearreplyni to a question mr walerr school board visitor said he had never failed to obtain a conviction against parents in the neighbourhood in question upon the ground that there was not suficient accommodationmr gooca school board
