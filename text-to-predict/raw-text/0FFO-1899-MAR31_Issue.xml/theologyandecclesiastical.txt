reprinting in book for a continuous treatise but an exception milmade in favour of dr fairbairns able and striking volume ca olicis rom ani axsglicaz tho different chapters of wyhich havo appeared at various times during the past  years in the cnt mporary vrerieu the book suffers no doubt from the circumstances of its composition but the treatment is throughout so thoughtful and so free from narrow polemical bias that it would be un gracious to criticize too closely the form inhich dr fairbairn has thought fit to make this valuable contribution to the history of religion by  catholicism even when pualified by the term  roman he explains that no does not mean the church of rome but the tendency expressed in the anglican revival the book is aphilo sophicai and historical not a polemical treatise still less a party manifesto of nonconformity tcrsus the established church the keynote of dr fairbairns position is struck in the first essay the churches and the ideal of re ligion in christs religion as studied in the new testament he maintains there is a complete absence of sacerdotal ideas  he spoke of himself as a teacher never as a priest assumed no priestly office performed no priestly function    made no man a priest created no order of priesthood to which any man could belong his k ingdom of heaven  was a  kingdom of the truth  and all who were of the truth belonged to it men have not yet risen to the clear and full comprehension of this ideal and the tardiest in reaching it are those organized poli ties or institutions which boast themselves sole possessors of christs truth and life  ie as dr fairbairn proceeds to contend the church of rome and the anarlican church under the influence of the  catholic revival their ideal of religicn according to him is  sensuous and sacerdotal emphasizing the idea of the church attaching suca great importance to orders and the sacraments that without a duly constituted ministry and sacramental grace true religion is impossible whereas the true ideal is spiritual and ethical dr fairbairn admits the good service that has lbeen done to manlkind by the churches be admits that the medieval churcb with its papal supremacy derived from and reflecting the imi perial supremacy of rome and its priesthood adapted from the old testament was a necessary stage in the religious development of the world buthe regards the  catholic revival  of the present century as a retrograde movement in his view  good ecciesiasticism is bad christianity  from a historical or philosophical point of view it is difficult to resist some of dr fairbairns conclusions but he is probably oversanguino in thinking that the tide will soon turn and that catholicism has had its day the rule of authority vermes reason with the sacerdotal and sacramental theories on which it rests still domi nates the church of rome and has won a strong foothold in the anglican church dr fairbairn himself notes that the broad church school is a dirainishing factor in anglicanism and in a lncid and masterly analysis of the mental influences that determined newman he shows how that great intellect was driven to the conclusion that the use of reason must land him in infidelity and that the only refuge for religion lay in authority this part of dr fairbairns work is perhaps the most interesting and valuable his analysis of the circumstances and ideas which produced tho catholic revival in england is well worth study but he gives too little weight to the argu ment from actual experiencethat without some outward forms and organization such as the churches provide religion as a matter of fact languishes a purely spiritual religion is not woriable in practicecatow gossi on the epistle to tie roansthe motive which leads canon gore to publish his practie exposition of st pauls sfiiszae ro thr roess john murray is beyond all praise it is true that he has already done the same sort of work in respect of the sermon on the mount and the ephesian letter but the epistlo to the romans pre sents greater difficulties than either of these to the ordinary mind which knows that it is the armageddon of all the controversies and is apt to leaire it alone there is only this difference of treatment that this epistle demands two volumes instead of one and that for certain interesting notes on questions like conscience and the atone ment we must wait for vol ii for the present it is enough to see how canon gore can fit him self into lathers favourite panoply and we may say at once that he makes out a strong case for his natural line of interpretation which is this justifying faith both admits a man individually into gods favour anld makes him a member of the community of the justified  justifica tion is in fact  the basis of the new cove nant  with a new israel thus  the unmerited boon of forgiveness  must always be coupled with  inheritance in the consecrated body at the same time it is obviously unfair to allege that the council of trent  in its general view of our fallen human nature  was truer than luther to st pauls idea for luther who as canon gore says elsewhere became individualist had his individualism forced on him by the failure of the  consecrated body  in his day to promote personal holiness not the least valuable part of the exposition is that which deals with the rela tion of modern science to such questions as liuman depravity and the unity of the race  the universal moral consciousness  admiits the first evolution has helped us to believe the second to turn to smaller matters we are glad to find canon gore using his authority to tell those englishmen who disdain the revised version that they do so often because they  do not really care to understand the meaning of the message one curious and unconvincing piece of criticism is worth notice canon gore in speaking of the  salutations  of st pauls letters contrasts the formality of that to the thessalonians with the richness of those to the romans and to titus surely the  formality  ap plies far more to the two latter for he is in troducing himself to men whom he does not know in romans and is trying to give dignity to young titus the thessalonians whom he lias just ieft may be treated curtly as intimate friends on the whole the exposition is notable anid full of valuepaumne theologyin paul teb mat the

psycholo gical experience  involved in the obscurity that attaches to all spiritual processes which the subiect of them caunot adequately explain to himself  tho threefold account in the acts we are

altogether extinct should turn to our peayer boon conouitry artd gcoscience by canon page roberts smith elder he will not faii to find that the socalled latitudinarian is very much alive and if we may venture to say so very much improved the history of the voltume is that some years ago the canon preached at st peters verestreet a course of sermons on various features of the prayerbook he did so then not from any desire to minify  the faith a verbwvhich should be useful to drmurray but becauise he is anxious to retain within the church  those whose dogmatic creed at present is short eis efforts are directed not to the production of a loi de circonstane for the present distress but to the extinction of all reiigious shamsfrom the  solitary devotion  in which the sporting paper and a cigar take the place of the bible and the incense of the spirit to  the depressing and anuemic  prayers at the laying of foundation btones these are forgotten he adds as soon  as the penny paper and the infinitesimal coin buried with the foundation stone creeds however we must have and let such as cannot swallow the whole of them be content with  the half or the quarter as to the bible it may not be exactly abreast of the last results of modern scienco but he goes on to argue in a sentence that must have sent a titter through the charch we should ourselves be no more capablo of understanding the science of a thousand years hence than esau would be of understanding hegel still anxious for the good of the man who takes his faith in  quarters the canon urges that the muchquoted form of absolution of the sick  is only for a great offender with a burdened conscience some of the psalms are horrible  these should be eliminated the irreducible minimutr of belief on the still more troublesome topio of the inspiration of scripture is that  god is more to be seen there than kle is anywhere else after all this cutting down we confess that the canon has still plenty on which to fix his own sturdy belief and that of his followers and he suffers from no inability to put what he holds into incisive and even luring wordssuort noticnsa new and important series called the oxford library of practical theology sends out its first instalment in rxlagaox by the rev w c e newbolt longmans the editors of the series are canon lneiwbolt himself and the librarian of puseyhouse and if these two do not sufficiently indicate the type of churchmanship involved in the effort the names of future contributors leave us in no doubt at all the object of the writers which is  to translate the solid theological learning of which there is no lack into the vernacular of everyday practical religion is beyond all praise scarcely any man of our time is better fitted than canon newbolt to inaugurate an effort conceived on these narticular lines at the same timo he has the defects of his qualities and the large body of devout laymen would as wve believe read him more profitably if he were less rhetorical thus the admirable chapter on  doubts which starts from the truism that  faith must always be a difficult and delicate thing is largely consumed by an excitablo duologue between the canon and the doubter of various degrees whereas soberer reason ing would make less demands on the attention and even on the doubters grammatical instincts sometimes again as in the matter of worship argument gives place to allegory but these weaknesses apart there is much in the book that will rest in the  devout laymans  memory for his goodyet another  new series  makes its bow to the theologicallyminded layman with thes boon or job bythe rev edgar c s gibson dd methuen these  oxford commentaries  are under the general editorship of the warden of keble and he with his several colleagues pro mises to  try to combine a hearty acceptance of critical principles with loyalty tohe catholic faith the series is only meant to include  such books of the bible as still seem to need further explanation  yet the list at present in cludes the books of samuel and st matthews gospel but omits  ecclesiastes  and the apocalypse lr gibson at any rate may well come first with the  book of job which it is not easy to interpret with loyalty to the catholic faith for to that the patient patriarch sits rather loosely at the same time  job  may be truly said to need further interpretation and for an excellent reason the poem has taken its place in litera ture the scholar compares its  warhorse  to vergilsanditssometimesfatalisticcouplets tothe close of the cdipus tyrannous or the lineswhich are quoted here in plumptres version from the even greater gloom of the oloneus  and he is glad to be reminded that sophocless dpas efapoehas its elder brother in jobs  eyelids of the mornin but dr gibson helps us to go into deeper mysteries than these and his  loyalty to the catholic faith  is not allowed to bar oult his common sense he will not for instance be a party to the statement that the churchs doctrine of original sin finds utterance in job xiv  and he strictly guards against the idea that the famous  daysman  passage is an  intimation  of the atonement at the same time in illustration of the word he might well have referred us to the use of  the day  in i cor iv and elsewhere the still more familiar locus which has its permanent place in the burial ï¿½erviceis fully an fairly dis cussed through several alternatives dr gibson coming finally to the natural decision that only a belief in a future life satisfies the requirements of the words used we should add that the prolegomnenca will be found both wise and adequate for the author upholds the judicious verdict that the book of job  is a dramaatic poem with aprobable historical basis that the actual event belon as to primitive and patriarchal times but that tle poem itself is much later and perhaps contemporary with the nd isaiah the pub lishers are to be congratulated on

followingf pas isage from a fine sermon on  the simplicity ofchrist fairly represents the authors attitudethose intelletual formulas of religious troth which we call creeds confessions and schemes of

convincing plea for a more spiritual and inward religion than much of the christianity of our day confessedlyis these sermons appeal to thoughtful minds but we doubt if mr brooke makes sufficenï¿½

natures mr stopfordi brookes teaching may be satisfying but it will be somewhat  caviare to the general in tee perfect life longmans canon knox little reproduces a number of addresses delivered in london and elsewhere which were probably moro impressive to hearers than to readers their oratory being of a kind which depends less on literary form than on the living personality of the preacher the sermons while very spiritual in tone are earnest practical appeals for a high standard of life and it is fair to say that though their author obviously sympathizes with the extreme high church school we find comparatively little polem ical bitterness or narrowness he cannot it is true resist an occasional gird at protestantism and at the divorce laws and he somewhat ostentatiously speaks in language inconsistent with the prayerbook and thearticlesofthe sacraments of confirmation penance orders unction and matrimony hle has the full courage of his opinions and in regard to what he dislikes is by no means mealy mouthed thus he speaks of the inoncon formist conscience  as  a handy expression for the mogt vulgar and revoltinaform of hypocrisy  of  socalled liberal urcmern  whose chief delight seems to be found in abusing their church   of the danger of wild and fanatical protestantism  and of  the reactionary paganism too evident in much of our modern education  of  the irreligion or halfbeliefs or ignorance or stupidity of vellintentioned but uninstructed christians  of  the cowardice or worldliness or unbelief of those in the higher ranks of the clergy these however are occasional lapses the general tone of the book is both christian and charitableunder the title tnxology as scioo mac lehose dr hastie professor of divinity in the university of glasgow

estimate of the value and present position of german theological speculation strikes us as judicious and true his designation of the late principal caird to whom he pays a warm and welldesrved tribute
