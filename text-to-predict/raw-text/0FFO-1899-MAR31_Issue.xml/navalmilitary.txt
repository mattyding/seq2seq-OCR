ehanges in musketry regulations issued from the war offioe for fire discipline and the preliminary training for field firing which is no longer a range practice but is made a part of the field training of the company under its captain sir redvers buller says  it is more easy to say what fire discipline is not than what it is it is certainly not inteaded to be a hindrance to legitimate individual action of the soldier not a drag which so delays his fire that he is always in the position of offering his adversary the first shot in a street row the mn who does not pat up his hands tiui after he is hit has but a poor chance it is the same in war officers must always strire to give their man the advantage of the initiative fire discipline may perhaps be described as the training which teabhes mre unit and other commanders so to observe their means fire that they can at every critical moment suggest the right range the best tirget and the proper desaription of fire and at the same time so control their men that they have them well in hand prepared for anything while it teaches the men to dbey automatically and immediately the orders of their comnder the mancauvresground sud not ile rifle range is the proper place on which to train the soldier in the final etago of preparation for battle on the rife range the soldier must be taught to use his rite to aim correctly and to shoot as well as his indiridualitywill permit instruction of supreme importance but after having learnt his drill on the drillground and the use of his weapon on the rifle range the soldier has to

by railithe beielsgesetzbzaft the offacial legal organ for the german emtpire devotes the whole of no   consisting of  pages to the details of the new law regulating military transport by rail the chief distinc tion between the conditions prerailing during peace aud war is shown in the fact that during peace the war office of each german state controls its own military trnaport whereas in the cases of mobilization and war the prussian war ofice assumes the sole control for all the states for the purposes of mobilization and war the whole of the german network of railways is divided into line sections and each section i in charge of a line conmmandant it is evident however that it may not be necessary to put the management of the whole of the railways on a war footing even in time of war and the division of the railways into sections permits of any portion of them being treated on a sepaate basis as occasion may arise the nmlitary authorities for instance ma find the existing railway service suffcient in any partiular district or they may arrange with the ordinary raitay officials for extra trains or they may further arrange that military trains shall be run in the course of the  hours whenever the line is not other wise used this may still be insufficient and it may then be found necessary to declare the particular line or lines to be entirely under military manaement in this extreme case the ordinary timetable is wupended and the militarytimetable introducedthe plan upon which this military timetable is drawn will be underetood when it is explaned that the ordinary railway authorities keep the military authori ties fully informed of the transporb capabilities of each linethat is to say every locomotive carriage truck j is scheduled with a description in
