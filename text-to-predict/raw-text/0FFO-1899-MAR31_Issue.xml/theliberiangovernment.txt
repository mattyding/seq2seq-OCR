tje liberian goverinmeatt loana general meeting of bondholders of the liberian government seven per cent external debt of  convened by the council of foreign bondholders was held yesterday at the councilhouse  iuoorgate streetmir w liddedale who presided said thlt they had met to consider an arrangement for the settlement of the debt which bad been in default since february  tho history of the debt was brief but very un fortunate a loan of � bearing  per cent interest was nominally issued in s at  per cent the interest was secured on onefifth of the entire customs duties of the republie while for amortiz tion a capitation tax of  per annum wasi to be levied on all male citizens the customs duties assigned o the service of the debt were estimated to produce � per annum and the capitation tax  but as the entire revenue of the repelblie in  was said to have produced less than s he feared that these estimates vere very optimistic the council of foreign bondholders and the bondholders committee had done everything in their power to in duce liberia to resume payment and their representa tions had received the unofficial support of her majesteys government bat the government of liberia had always pleaded that the ftancial condition of the republic did not permit them to make any offer at length in february s the legislature passed a law authorizing the government inter alia to  negotiate a scheme for the better regulation of the ficanees of the republic in sui manmer as to secure the prompt regular and systematic payment of public obliga tions in augustlast mfessrs barclay and stevens the secretary of the treasury and the attorney general of liberia arrived in london and at once entered into negotiations with the council and the com mittee which regulted in the ad referendum arrange ment now before the meeting he then referred to the principal provisions of the arrangement pointing out that no reduction of principal was contemplated but tnat interest was to be reduced from  per cent to  per cent for three years rising  per cent every three years to a manium of  per cent per annum the first payment of interest to be made on october  next anortization was to commence after five years by an accumulative sinkdng fund of  per cent per annum applied by tenders or by purchases when the bonds should be under par or by drawings at par when they were quoted at or above par for the arrears of in terest from february   to the st inst the couneil was to issue certificates not bearing interest redeemable when the principal of the debt should have been extinguished the result was that each  bond would receive  against a nominal claim in respect of arrears of interestof � as to securty they had first the export duty on rubber of six cents per pound which was to be paid by the exporters direct to the liberian consulgeneral in london and to be handed by him direct to the bank charged with the service of tho debt the liberian government further undertook to hand over any sunis that might be paid by the syndicate who worked the rabber monopoly to be likewise applied to the service of the debt the com mittee feeling that the rubboer duties alone would not provide sufaient security demanded additional security vhich was given by clause yi of the arrangement this being to the effect that the service of the debt should be further secured on the general customs revenue of the republic at the time the arrangement was entered into it was contemplated to form a regie for the collection of the customs revenue and it was hoped that the scheme would be approved by the liberian congress the proposal failed how i ever to become law and so instead of clause vi aclause had been substituted under which the govern ment assigned as extra security onehalf the duties on obacco and powder the amount of bonds expected to come in under the arrangement was about � tf therefore the duties assigned to the service of the debt produced anything hlke what was estimated there wfould appear to be a reasonable margin of security for a good many years to com e anidthis remark held good even if as mauy as � or � of bonds came forward and wvere admnitted in the event of default on the part of liberia to carry out the arrangement the existing rights of the bondholders would revive so that they would not be asked to sur render their present bonds looldng at all the circam stances of the case the council and comnittee recom mended them to accept the offer now submittedreplying to remarks by several bondholders the caefark said that the original loan was a heavy barden for such a country as liberia to assume and the conditions which had existed there had not been favourable for the dlscharge of their obligations it appeared however that matters had been improving somewhat of late the great increase in the price of rubber having had a good effeet on the finauces of the rcepublic le was hopeful that the arrangement wduld be carried out by the governmentldr j arl browi proposed a resolution for acceptlug the arrangement and requesting the council to take the necessary steps to carry it into effectmr wixaoir seconded the motion which was agreed to unanimouslyresolutions were aiso passed expressing the hope that in accordance with the assurance given bv the secretary of the treasury proper provision would be made by the liberian government for the security of the bondholders in the event of the revenue company being established and assenting to the proposed deduction of onefourth from each of the two first coupons as a contribution to the council for their services and expenses it being explained that the liberian government could only be induced to provide � of the � required for
