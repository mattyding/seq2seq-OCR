a physician in ordinary atthe court of kvvwazghsurot our spaygrai correspondentchen lienfang the most celebrated native physician in china returziing to his home in this province from attendin e on the emperor at peking did me the honour of calling on me some days ago a brief account of his ex periences at the capital may not be without interest to readers in englandwhen the edict was issued calling upon the provincial viceroys and governors to send native doctors of distinction to peking to advise in regard to the emperors illness chen lienfang received orders from the governor at suchau to leave for the north with out delay this in itself apart from the uncon genial and unremunerative nature of the duty of which chen was well aware was no light under taking for a man of delicate physique whose age is over three score years and ten but there was no possibility of evading the task ihe accordingly left his large practice in the chargo of two con fidential assistants or pupils and having re ceived from the governor a sum of  taels for travelling expenses and remuneration in advance made his way to peking and reported for duty to the grand council when he arrived there he found three other native physicians of considerable repute already in attendance summoned in obedience to the imperialcommands dr detheve of the french lega  tion had already paid his historical visit to the emperor and his remarkablo diagnosis of the son of heavens symptoms was still atfording amusement to the legations the aged native phybician spoke in terms of undis guised contempt both of the french doctors com ments on the caso and of his suggestions for its treatment his own description of the emperors malady was couched in language not un like that which writers of historical novels attribute to the physicians of europe in the mliddle ages he spoke reverently of influences and vapours at work in the august person of his sovereign learnedly of heatflushings and their occult causes and plainly of things which are more suited to chinese readers than to those of she times nevertheless his description pointed clearly to disease of the respiratory organswhich he said had existed lor over  yearsto general debility and to a feverish condition which he ascribed to mental anxiety combined with physical weakness before he left pekingy about the middle of niovember the fever had abated and the patients symptoms had decidedly improved  the case was however in his opinion of so serious a nature that he decided to leave it if possible in the hands of his younger confreres an object which by dint of bribing certain court officials he eventually achieved asked if he considered the emperors condition critical he re p lied oracularly that if he lived to tee the chinese xewv year his strength would thereafter return gradually with the spring and the complete restoration of his healtuh might be espectedsome few days after his arrival in peking chen was summoned to audience by orders conveyed through a memoer of the grand council  the emperor and the dow ager empress were awaiting his visit in a hall on the south side of the palace the consultation was curiously indica tive of the divinity which hedges about the ruler of the middle eingdom suggestive too of the solidity of that conservatism wvhich dictates the inner policy of china chen entered the presence of his sovereign on his knees crossing the apartment in that position after the customary kotows the emperor and the dowvager empress wvere seated at opposite sides of a low table on the dais or stovebed and faced each other in that position during the greater part of the interview the emperor appeared pale and listless had a troublesome irritation of the throat and wvas evidently feverish  the thin oval of his face clearlydefined features and aquiline noseb gave bim in the physicians eyes to use his own words the appearance of a foreigner the empress who struck him as an extremely wellpreserved and intelligentlooking woman seemed to he ex tremely solicitous as to the patients health and careful for his comnfort as it would have boeen a serious breach of etiquette for the physician to ask any questions of his majesty the empress proceeded to describe his symptoms the invalid occasionally signifying conffrmation of what was said by a wvord or a nod during this monologue the physician following the custom ary procedure at imperial audiences kept his gaze concentrated upon the floor until at the command of the empress and still kneeling he was permitted to place one band upon the emperors wrist there was no feeling of the pulse  simply contact wvith the flat of the hand first on one side of the wvrist and then on the other this done the em press continued her narrative of the patients sufferings she described the state of his tongue and the symptoms of ulceration in the mouth and throat but as it was not permissible for the doctor to examine these he was obliged to make the best of a somewhat unprofessional descrip tion a s he wisely observed it is difficult to look at a patients tongue vwhen his ex alted rank cam pels you to keep your eyes fixed rigidly on the floor the empress having concluded her remarks on the case chen was permitted to wvithdraw and to present to the grand council his diagnosis togrether with advice as to future treatment which was subse quently communicated officially to the throne the gist of his advice was to prescribe certain tonics of the orthodox native type and to suggest the greatest possible amount of mental and physical restin reply to my inquiries as to the emperors diet chen observed that it would of course be highly beneficial were hegiven a moderate amount of meat food this howvever he could not have suggested since itl was contrary to the confuscian doctrine tre had been given to understand by one of the court officials that the emperors daily fare con sisted almost entirely of rice seasoned wfith the usual condiments but there was no way in which he could have obtained reliable information on this point and any direct inquiries during the auldience were naturally out of the question certain of the patients symptoms were suchn as to preclude the adminis tration of the tonic most usually prescribed for anuemic subjectsa decoction of ginsengsummiang up the results of his audience chen observed thiat under the conditionls attendant on prescribing for a chinese emperor one doctor was just as good as another and that the fate of the patient must necessarily be a matter entirely in the hands of providence he thought that the emperor was receiving all possible care and attention bat that the restraints and limitations imposed by court etiquette prevented much being done which might otherwise assist in the restoration of his healtha few days after the first consultationif theword can be used in siuch a casechen was again summoned to audience he observed a marked reduction of temperature bnt the patient was even more listless than on the previous occasion the interview con sisted of a monologue as before the dowager empress being apparently very anxious to prevent the invalid from speaking on the following day chen received a present of two handsome riding jackets a mark of imperial favour which did not prevent him however from sending in a petition to the grand council in which he stated that his aged mother was ill and asked that he might be re leased from further attendance at court and per mitted toreturnhome anddischargethe obligations of filial piety this petition apparently aroused certain suspicions in the mind of the sovereign or of the august lady who guards the throne the excuse being indeed somewhat conventional for a rescript ordered the grand council to ascertain if the facts were as stated chen was for tunately able to demonstrate to all concerned at a cost of some eighteen thousand taels that his mother was in existence and in bad health and the council having memorialized to this effect a second rescript permitted him to return to his home accordingly he left the capital with all convenient rapidity poorer perhaps in purse but richer in wiedom by tof a unique experience the three other native octors remained in attendancei muay add that the mother of chen lienfang is sctually in existence and that his filial devo tioni was not purely imaginary
