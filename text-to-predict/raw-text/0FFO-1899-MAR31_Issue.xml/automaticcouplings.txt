a utoma tic couplingscorrespondence that has recently taken place in the times on the subject of automatic couplings is an indication of the excite ment caused in the railway world by mr ritchies bill the clause which provides for the  use on all trains of couplers for carriages and wagons coupling automatic ally by impact and capable of being un coupled without the necessity of men going between the ends of the carriages or wagons to uncouple them is the part wvhich is chiefly obnoxious to the railway managers as has been already stated in the times the measure if passed would not mako this provision as to conplings effective until a period of five years had elapsed and even then discretion is given to the board of trade the bill providing only that that department  may carry oeit tee pro vision not that it shall mir ritchie has now promised that legislation shall be preceded by inquiryas is well known automatic couplings are largely in use on american railways and before very long they will become universal in the united states the problem to be solved by an inventor in designing an efficient automatic coupling is of extreme complesity and it is one to which a large number of persons have turned their attention mr hopwood of the board of trade has stated that  patents have been taken out in this country whilst there are several thousands in the united states the american inventor had however an easy task compared to that which has to be overcome by any one who vould devie an automatic coupling for british use the fundamental difference in the condi tions that would have to be met is that in america central coupling of trains without side buffers was already in use whilst in england though the drawbar coupling is in the middle of the carriage the side buaters present a very grave difficulty in the way of the problem in english practice we have a continuous drawbar and le coaches of a train are coupled up as is well known by means of a double shackle connected by a right and lefthanded screw wyhen the coupling has been put in position to connect the twvo coaches tbe latter are drawn together by the operator turning the screw and a certain amount of compression is thus put upon the buffer springs in this vay making the comu pcsition of the ewhole train an elastic but loose entity in addition to the screw or shackle coupling side chains are generally used these hang loosely and only come into play if the spring coupling be broken they might how ever in the opinion of a number of railway engi neers be well dispensed with as it is considered that if the screw coupling break the jerk on the side chains is more than likely to carry them away alsoin the american coupling the hook or coupling device and the buffers are in one when it is desired to make a connexion between two cars they are pushed topether the hooks by which they are held are interlocked by the force of impact and the buffing part of the device which takes the place of our side buffers also has its springs compressed these latter springs being attached to the drawbar there are several patterns of automatic coupling in use in america but they are so arranged that all or nearly all are interchangeable and they are mostly alike in fundaanentai principle if therefore two different types of coupler come together they will interlock and consequently there is no difficulty in running the stock of one company over another companys line that at least is the principle of the system  sometimes it does not work out quite perfectly in practice amengat other american automatic couplings in genera use may be mentioned the janney the standard the gould the buckeye and the kational  the firstnamed being perhaps the best known the automatic locking device and buffer consists of a massive malleable iron casting in america wvhere the foundry practice is excellent annealed iron castings are found to answer but steel might if desirable be substituted for iron in this country this main part is called the  draw head attached to it by a pin is a movable part known as the  knuckle this consists of a piece of iron of l form which pivots at its angle on the pin in the casting the massive drawbead is attached to a shank which fits into the underiaame of the car and connects solidly with the drawbar the latter is surrounded by a sdiral spring or springs which are contained in a suitable iron casma called the  yoke  or  strap pocket and this is firmly fixed in the underframe this part of the mechanism is lnown as the  draft rigging it will be seen therefore that in this arrangement we have a coupling and a buffer in one when the cars come together the knuckle is pushed into a locking position in which it is then held by a sliding wedge actuated by a spring or by a falling pin the wedge or the pin holds theknuckle inrigid connexion witb the draw head and inthis way two firmly interlocking hooks are formed when it is needed to uncouple the carriages the wedge or the pin is drawn out and the knuckle turning on its pivot allows the couplings to come apart to withdraw the wedge for the purpose of uncoupling coaches a chain is attached to it and this is carried to a hand lever fixed at the side of the coach the hooks can therefore be disengaged whilst the attendant is standing clear of the trainit has been said that the american device cannot be applied to english stock so long as the sharklecoupling and the side buffers remain and as an american automatic coupling cannot i be coupled to an english shacklecoupling the dificulty of the situation from this point of view will be apparent if the two systems were in use the old and the new must necessarily come together at times and it would evidently be an impcssible task to transform the whole of the  english railway stock from nonaultomatic to iautomatic coupling in one nightit is therefore the  transtion period  which creates the difficulty in introducing automatic couplings as was very rightly pointed out in a letter recently publishea in h times our correspondent was however incorrect in saying that  the two ie american and english sys tems cannot exist on the same vehicle if he had said that the two systems cannot be used together his remarks would have been beyond questioning but as a matter of fact there has recently been brought out an arrangement by which the american automatic coupling can be fitted to the present english drawbar hook in such a way that the former can be put into the position for being used or it can he swung out of theo way so that the shackle coupling can be utilized we recently had an opportunity of examining this new arrangement as applied to the earriagestock of one of the big northern lines the drawvhead of the automatic couplingin place of beina formed in one with the stem that connects it to tle draftriggingis cut off short leaving only a very short length of drawbar attached the latter is formed in sucha way that it can be hinged to the shank of the existing drawbar hook of the ordinary english coupling arrangement when it is required touse the automatic coupling it is swlung up into the horizontal position and held firmly there by means of a pin which secures it to the draw bar hook when it is owng out of use the same pin holds it rigidly in a vertical posi tion so that it does not awing about with the movement of the train the device is one of those simple invenations that makes an engeer feel annoyed he has not thought of it before himself the drawbar hook lends itself very perfectly to tho arrangement whilst its efficiency for using with a shacklecoupling is not impaired lthe side buffers of course have to be put out of action before the automatic coupling can be brought into play this is done by running the buffer atems in so that the buffers are back on the buffercasting where they are held in this position by a simple deviceit may not be generally known that efforts have already been made by various railway com panies to provide a coupling arrangement which ahaflsave the alternative of either the automaticor existing english systems there are one or two means by which this has been attempted to be accomplished but most of them take the shape of a large frame which surrounds the automatic coupling and thus occupies the place of the shackle coupling these devices however have evidently been got out in a hurry and have a very temporary appearance but the effort is worthy of notice as showing a praiseworthy anxiety on the part of railwav authorities to use the safe and more enlightened american system even without legislaive pressure the public may hope therefore seeing a simple and effective device has been introduced that automatic coupling will go ahead whether mr ritchies bill pass or notprobablythe introduction of automatic coup lmgs in this country will lead to a more extended application of the vestibule train american railway engineers andwe think also english rail way en ineers who have been in america con sider the vestibule the complement of the automatic coupling the vestibule is of course that flexible passage which connects two railway coaches and which is now fairly well known as exising on the best english trains it consists of a bellowslike projection from the end of the carriage and is made up of a steel frame extended bystrong springs and covered with leather or indiarubber when two of these projections come together they form the passage between the coaches the steel frames to which reference has been madeand which form the end of each projection or the middle of the passage when the projections are joinedare pressed tightly together at their surfaces by the springs and thus to some extent form a buffer fuch e fufil however two other important funcions the first is preventing vibration and the second minimizing the danger through collision the former effect is secured ly the support one carriage gives to another on account of the friction between the steel frames the top of these frames being near the top of the carriageand thus at a distance from the origin of vibration namely the railsthe momentum of oscillation of the roof of the car is effectively damped with regard to safety the great danger from long railway cars in caso of collision is  telescoping the under frame is the strong part of a car and when two underframes are pushed violently to gether one is very likely to mount above the other and slide over it the comparattively weak bodies of the vehicles are easily broken ud and the passengers inside naturally suffer now the two steel frames of the vestibule having con siderable vertical extension prevent telescopingfor so long as these vestibule frames are not broken up the underframe of one car would have to mount to tho top of the other car beforo the two could lie parallel the force of the collision is thus taken up by the extremely strong under frames these are now made of steel anct though they may be distorted by a violent collision the act of bending them even to a small amount absorbs a great deal of the energy of the collision so that the car bodies may escape destraction the vestibule arrangement works in very harmoniously with central automatic coupling and central buffing for various reasons which it would take too much space to detailthe american system lends itself particularly well to taking curves the loss of energy due to side buffers working round bends is very great unfortunately this was not sufficiently recognized by the early railway engineers who actually constructed several important railway stations on sharp curves this is very well from an artistic or architectural point of view the curved roof and platforms having a very pleasing aspect the locomotive engineer however looks at the matter from a very different point of view the greatest power is always required in starting a train butwhen the train has to be started with all the wheels binding on the curved rails of a bend the locomotive power must be enormous compared to that which would suffice for ordinary running the connexion of this with side buffers is easily seen the buffers being pressed together by springs which are of equal compression when the train is on the straight upon a curve being taken the buffers on the inside of the curve are forced together more stronaly than those on the outside of the curve in fact the latter may be hardly touching and the springs thus out of action in short the tendency of the train is always to go straight and any violence done to this natural inclination must be at the expense of locomotive power as a practical example of this fact one often sees a pilot engine attached to help start a train out of a curved station naturally with central buffing this defect does not existthe remarks above made refer to passenger stock the problem of transforming the coup ling and buffing arrangemedts of goods trains is one of greater difficulty there are a number of wagons in this country with  dumb buffers that is without springs and to deal with these would add to the complication again in order to allow heavy goods trains to be started they are loose coupled that is to say each wagon is attached to the other by slack chains so that the locomotive puts in motion only one wagon at a time tntil the whole are set going this of course places the american coupler out of the question for the essence of it is that it creates a firm and flexible train the american freight train is however altogether a different thing to the english goods train their cars are bigger their engines more powerful and the trains often run at far higher speeds than do ours the american practice favours tight coupling for freight cars and this brings in another most important feature in the united states they are able to use automatic brakes this in turn allows the freight trains to run with safety at higher speeds than would other wise be the case so that they can take their place with passenger traffic without causing undue obstruction the safety that results from the absence of having to shunt and generally from doing away with the crawling goods train will be apparent to any one who has studied the question of railway accidents in this country  but it will also be plain to the railway engineer of great britain that an immense field of labour is opened up by the suggestion of advancing our undoubtedly primitive system of carrying goods by railway to that which would at all approach an ideal p lanit should in this connexion be said in fairness to english locomotive superintendents and de signers of carriage stock that they are hampered as compared to the americans by the narrow width allotted to them on the permanent way our tunnels our platforms and other arrange ments are such that greater width cannot be obtained until all are altered and this of course means a work of enormous magnitude and expense it is a work which railway companies are hardly likelyto undertake from benevolent motives towards the public one of the greatest diffi culties due to this want of transverse space which the locomotive engineer has to face is in the de signing of his engines the everincreasing power needed with inodern trains makes it extremely difficult to get in the motive parts of the engine  but even if these can be arranged there is difficulty with regard to the boiler the designer is now at his wits end to know howto get the firegrate area needed to burn the amount of coal to generate the steam required but even if gratesurface be supplied there is diffiulty with heatingsurface bloilers can of course be lengthened almost indefinitely but it is well known that it is only the first part of the tubes of a boiler that is thoroughly efficient for efficiency falls off enormously as length is increased the american locomotive engineer with his enormous firebox and high engines has therefore an advantage which is not possessed to the same extent by his british ccmfrete in fact we are suffering in this country from having been pioneers the engineers of other nations have been able to find out by experience what is most needed in railway practice but our solid constructions were com pleted before such experience was gainedmadam tussaumsthis popular exhibition in the
