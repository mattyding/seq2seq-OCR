the approahntng crisis in  scottish dissentfro a scootmi cocimspondznvthe negotiations which have been proceeng for the past two years and which have for their objects an incorporating union between the two leading dissenting presbvterian bodies of scot land have zow reached what is regarded bytheir leading promoters as the penultimate stageduring winter and early spring the presbyteries of both churches havo been engaged in discussing the de tails of the scheme of union drawn up by a joint committee although these include the most difficult questions of creed polity and fnance no opposition to the scheme as a whole has been exhibited of a sufiiciently serious character as to oncourage the belief that the proposals will be totally rejected in miay when they come up for virtually final consideration by the united pres byterian synod and the free assembly in some highland presbyteries indeed where what is known as  constitutionalism or adherence to the very pronounced establishmentarianism solemnly affirmed by the founders of the free church in  has still soaae influence majo rities have declared against union but the once powerful  highland host  is now little better than a disorganized rabble not perhaps without distinct ecclesiastical principles but certainly without cohesion and without a leader the rev murdoch macaskill of dingwall the suc cessor to the pastorate of the once cele brated dr kennedy whose marvellous and almost mystical power north of the cale donian canal was so great that he was able to prevent previous negotiations for a union between the free and united presbyterian churches from being carried to a successful issue has accepted the new scheme in its essentials within the past few weeks too an important concession has been made by the frers of the project to sensitive celtic orthodoxy a growing desire among the laity of both the negotiating churches to be relieved from the acceptance in its entirety of the confession of faith led to the passing by synod and assembly during the past  years of several declaratory actsactsthatis to say  declaring the sense inwhich the churches accept the confession and expect it to be signed by officebearers belonging to the laity such as elders these declaratory acts have always lreen resented and denounced in the lighlands as savouring of heterodoxy and as an attemptto undo the sacred work of the wesminster divines nor was this dislike lessened when it was ascertained that according to the draft scheme of union  office bearers  in the united church of the futuro were expected to subscribe to the confession in the spirit of the obnoxious acts to mollify this opposition the plan of union has been so modi fled as to allow officebearers the option of signing the confession either in the strictest and simplestsenseor interms ofthedeclaratory acts it is evident that the leaders of the union move ment on the free church side anticipate that this concession will so reduce resistance to their pro posals in the higblands as to render any schism that may taie place whenthenewchurch is actually constituted a distincety negligible quantityon the other hand the active promoters of the union who are confined almost entirely to the ranks of the free church clergy are by no means satisfied with its prospects they admit that if it is carried through this result will be due notto the enthusiasm butto the apatly of those sections of the laity which embrace both the wealth and the culture of scottish dissent there may seem no connexion whatever between the purely political schism in the ranlks of liberalism caused by mr gladstones conversion to home rule and the ecclesiastical projects nonv under the consideration of the free and united presby terian churches but it is beyond doubt that the liberal unionists in both bodiesand they include nearly all the laymen who are socially and otherwise influentiallook with disfavour alike upon the present proposals for union and upon the movement for the disestablish ment of the church of scotland which it is sup posed would gain in strength from the consum mation of that union they consider it suspicious to say the least that dr rainy principal of the chief theological college in connexion with the free church and the foremost champion of the union should be both an ardent disestablisher and a pronounced eome iruler in any case it is quite understood that the great majority of the liberal ujnionist laity in the negotiating churches will not enter the communion which will be created by their alliance but will become members of the church of scotland there will be no formal secession from nither free or united presbyterian church but the establishment will be enlarged by accessions from both precisely as the scotthsh episcopal church is being enlarged by accessions from the esta blishment the apathy which so alarms the union leaders is also partly due to the im pression on the part of the more reflective mem bers of the two churchesan impression which is crystallizing into a beliefthat if the present proposals are sanctioned by the sunreme courts of the two bodies the union will be one in name and not in reality serious controversy has been avoided up to the present time because dr rainy and his supporters contemplate the relega tion of a final decision upon all important differences between the negotiating communions to the united church of the future these are very great the two churches do not take the same view of creed subscription their methods of supporting their clergy are quite opposed to each other they also hold opposite doctrines as to the duty of the state in connexion wviththe endowment of religious teaching the free church is in theory strongly establishment arian the united presbyterian church is pledged to what is known in scotland as the  voluntary principle   in other words it is hostile to any and every form of alliance between church and state yet according to present arrangements the churches are to enter into an incorporating alliance with these different systems of creed finance and ecclesiastical polity abso lutely intact it is not surprising that a feelina should be gaining ground that an alliance basea on  open questions  can mean for the united church nothing but dissension followed by dis ruptionbut the gravest feature in the situation is the virtual withdrawal of the clerical leader of the united presbyterian church from any active concern in the union movement the rev dr hutton of paisley occupies in that body as commanding a position as dr rainy holds in the lfree church he is principal of its theoloical colleoe he is the life and soul of tie liberatonist movement in scotland and is chairman of the body known as the disestablishment council which controls it bat he has never indicated any love for the pro jected union when the proposals of the joint committee of the two churches came up for con sideration before the presbytery of which he is a member he criticized them sharply both in principles and in details he has never associated himself with dr rainy in platform advocacy of the union qaite recently however he has taken a more serious andaggressive step as chairman of the scottish disestablishment council and as an enthusiastic adherent of the voluntary principle he has issued a manifesto denouncing in the strongest terms mir balfours schemo for the settlement of the university question in ireland in this document dr hutton went out of his way as it seemed to attack the system of granting state aid to denominational training colleges for teachers this pronouncement has caused great alarm in the freee church which possesses several flourishing training colleges that are like the corresponding institutions connected with the church of scotland in receipt of state subsidy it was understood that no objec tion was to be offered on the part of the united presbyterian church to the free churehenstering into the contemplated alliance with these training colleges as they are but if principal hutton foilows up his denunciation of the colleges by practical opposition to them the church of the future wvill be imperilled speaking on behalf of those highland clergymen who have wgith reluctance agreed to support that scheme mr macaskill of dingwall has declare that if it comes to a ncuestion betweeninzioii and training colleges union must go muchthereforedepends onthe action of principal hutton at the metifg of the united presby terian synod in may he may have it in hris power to wreil proposals which have in reality never touched the heart of either of the bodies that are supposed to be consenting to them
