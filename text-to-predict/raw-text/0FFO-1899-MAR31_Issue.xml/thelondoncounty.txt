colonel lockwood mp presidingtho cnrsujst at the outset of his remarks ex pressed the great regret of the directors at the retire ment of mr georgo banbury from the chairmanship of the company but expressed much eatisfaction at te fact that they had persuaded their colleague to remain a meraber of the board where his long experience and untiring energy would they were sure be of the greatest advantage to the consumers and the pro prietors for the six years in which r banbrry acted as chairman their company passed through a series of crises demanding the employment of tbe greatest tact and energy ably assisted by the officers and having secared the unswerving loyalty of his colleagues their late chairman was able successfully to combat these difficulties but ithe continued strain and everincreasing responsibility made too great a demand upon his strength and on the resumption of constant supply in december last dr banbury wvas reluctantly compelled to retire from the chairmanship at the boards unanimous request he the spealker had assumed the highly re sponsible duty of chairman in the hope that he miight be of service both to the proprietors and the consrmers during the past halfyear the revenue had increased �s as compated with that of the corresponding period of the previous yearan incresse for the yexr of nearly  proving that there was plenty of elas ticity and commercial vitelity in their undertaing a very large portion of their district compsised houses of the poorer  clss with low rateable values and those annually built vere more or less of the same description they therefore received less per house for water rental than any other company still the enormous trade turnover the extended build ing operations and the increased meter rents favour ably augmented their revenue under the head of maintenance the increase reached the tremendous total of � during the drought all the water that could be spared by other companies was taken and dis tributed in the east london district and this water alone cost the company over � while the distri bution and other expenses incurred by the local authorities cost them a further sum of probably about � the amount payable to the chamber lain of london under the siuking fund provisions of the companies acts  and s was � which had been debited in the account the sinking fund was first established in l by lord cland hamiltons committee because purchase of the com pnies was then imminent amd this was stated to be the reason for forcing it on the company that they might not get a profit out of the new capital then being asked for if purchase were not imminent its intro duction was unprecedented and it alpplied to no country company anywhere the increase of water rates � might be considered satisfactory although not so large an increase as for the corresponding period of  over  the enormous expenses incurred by reason of the drought accounted f or a ood deal of this de ficiency the amount received fromthepublicasthorities being very much less the directors frankly admitted and deeply regretted the shortness of the supply of water during the latter part of s the company were the pioneers of the constant service and adopted it not only without any notice from the local authorities to do so but without even a suggestion outside the board room that it should be given the company had always been alive to the growing requirements of the district as the population increased from the founda tion of the company in  up to the present session of parliament they had introduced a large number of measures for securing and improving their supply for the iacrease of works plant machinery and storage their policy of meeting all rquirements had been consistently pursued and would had it been allowed to prevail have been sufficient for all needs with the exception of the unexampled drought of  in s the directors foresaw that greater storage capacity would be needed within a very shlort time and steps were at once taken to survey land prepare estimates for acquiring the same and for the extension of reservoirs in  a bill was introduced to cary out the first instalment of the reservoir scheme which their engineer had laid fully before the commission what became of that measure was notorious opposed by the londoncounty council on the ground that it was unnecessary and only introduced for the purpose of enhancing the seluinprice of the undertaking according to what had been said by the member for hoxton the bill was rejected on second reading in  a bim almost identical in terms was introduced and only passed the second read ing by a majority of one for it was strongly opposed by the london county council rmembers of marlia ment vthen the measure went before the com mittee hovever the mreamble was not only declared proved hut the committee urged that the works contem plated should he pushed forward with all possible despatch and inserted a special clause in the bill to render this obligoatory ca the company it should be borne in mind that if the y bill had not been re jected the temporary reversion to intermittet supply in the years  and  would not have bien neces sary with respect to the recent drought it was en araldled in jevertg uaiceand follo wdaseries of droughly periods lt eonttnued for  montiw up to last october and during this period there was scarcely a drop of rain and the daily flow of the lea for each month vas   sir two and five million gallos the average yearly fall in the lea valley was about ink but from september  to september  it was only about sin or jst half no sunh deficiency had been observed during the  years in which records had been kept at green wich and as they were aware tbe scarcity was felt over a very wide area and many places suffered from want of water far more severely than east london on aullgust  the companly were obliged to resort to the intermittent supply and this was continued up to de cemoer  last at the end of february they had  millions of reserve water the central fact of the occurrence ens the almnst total failure of the river lea caused by the long drought au the work authorized in  bad been complleted by the summer of  the storage lhad been increased by  million gallons warned by the eperience of g they went again to parliament in  for dower to increase their storage the land had been aeariy all acquired and the new reservoirs were on the eve of construction but the failure of the lea placed all previous experience of their engineer and other ti perienced water engineers at defiance  the wkter engineers estimate fd future requirements ad posible drought could onlybe based on the uorst and lowesv gures of preunous years the gauges at fieldss wver had previously shown an average of  a day for the three driest months in  the flou for three months oecr cieldss lyeir was   and  millions head the river fallen no lower than thils and had the drought of  been nly a moderately unusual one the resoulces would hive huaeed to tide over he period m ithout ny stoppage of the constant supply they had beenasled wrhy they did not make the necessary connexionsuntil after the scarcity begausnd they had been blamed for neglecting to do so but the only company whichbad water to spare wvas the new river company with whom they made arrangements in july to give this company al they could spare the only other companr which had water available for them was the southwark and vaushall which however had none until their bill which became law on july  was passed it was of no use making coanexions untill there sas something to pass through and their communications with hie southwark and vauxh company were commenced inngust and finished with uxampled rapidity it might be remarkred that the southwark anld varhll cornpanys bill was opposed by the county council as was also the east london companys bill of   autho riig them to take water in ease of emergency from other companies ifthereforethe counclihad had its ow way there would have been no possibility of help at all eccept perhaps from the rewv iver vhen the direc tors fcund that there wfas a necessity for shutting dow the constant supply they did everyhig thatthdman beings could do to mitigate the inconvenience and no expense was spared it might he interesn to kow that so unlimited was the discretionary power given by the directors to the local authorities that a one district the distribution of the water by watercarts had cost as much as s per  gallonsequal to over  times as much as the company would get per  gallons for the wiole of the water so distributed in face of all this anxiety and distress and oulaty he could not help regretting that a section of public men should have made this calamity an occasion for political agitation and accusation against the company while the directors were daily striving to alleviate the inconvenience from which the poplesnffered some members of parliament were conemning their admtinitration he could not help thinking that it would have been maore seemly and con sistent on the past of the representatives of the people in the east london district if their lanage had been less inflammatory and more consistent with facts the simple fact was that the drought which was univer sally admitted to have been the worst ever experienced was the cause of the whole trouble  it was beyond the forecast of any hmnmau being and was a disaster for which nobody was responsible and which was felt in many pnrts of the country more severely than in the las xvalley and the astend of london accord ing to any calculations that could have been made from previouslyrecorded figures the companys resources were sulscient the ndw services laid on numbered  which wbs  more than were con nected in the corresponding halfyear of  these new supples averaged � s lid per house or about l above the average all over but ls d per house less than te average for the corresponding period of  in addition to this  new meter servifes had been coinected which was about the same as for the corresponding period of  teters had been very generally adopted where there were uses for water other than for domestic purposes the average per house naturilly fluctuated according to the description of the residences erected one of the principal works carried ont during the past halfyear was the laying of a in main from the companys reservoirs at baggerlane through snaresbrook and wanstead andt the continuation by means of a itin main acroess wvansteadliats and forestgate into east an for the purpose of increasing the pressure in east brsn and the easterly portion oi the west ham district the main had now been in use for some time mid had answered its purpose very well in october the directors ordered a new powerful tripleexpansion pumnping engine of a capacity of ten million gallons a day for the lessex district the increase of which was going on at an abnormally rapid pace this engine should be at work by next autlunn all the engines mains and planthad been kept in good condition the deacon meter bystem had oeen extended with most satisfactory results tfhe royal commission on the ietropolitan water s pply alluded to in the last two reports had now uinished the taking of evidence and hearingthe arguments of coznsel and had sat altogether for  days the report vould be anxiously looked for both by the company and by the public the commission issued an interim report on decem ber  in which they dealt with the question inferred to them as to the wisdom of intereommunica tion beteen the companies systems during the recent drought the unusual severity of which was recognized the schemes for coupling up tho mains of the various companies as well as the intercommunications already made to suppiy this company in particular were favourably reviewed at the wharncliffe meeting of the proprietors on the th ult the two bills pro moted by the company now before parliamentone for the extension of reservomr capacity in the lea valley and the other for obtaining and ensuring atemporary supply in case of emergency and so legaling the means of obtaining water from the southwark the kent the lew river the grand junction and the west middlesex companieswere approved and both of them had been read a second time the pros and cons of the bills would be sifted by the eommittees after easter a joint bill promoted by the eight metropolitan companies had been read a second time it provided for a large and complete system of intercom munication for any emergency and for obtaining by any company water and if need be by a greater supply from the thames this was the scheme as sub mitted to the royal commission and approved by them this bill was also approved by the sbareholders at ihe same wharncliffe meeting the governmeat too had introduced a bill dealing with intercommunication between the companies and the supply of water by the company which had to the company which needed although the commission had not yet reorted the london county council had introduced four bills deal ing with the water supply tha first was the same mufair bill which had been promoted before for acquir in this companys undertaksg the compays indlertsking was proposed to be transferred to the county council in  tho price to be ascer tained afterwards by a onesided arbitration wbiih the council could postpone anld yet the company i books servants and property cnerally were to be banded over to the council ihe second blim of the council was to enable the latter to acquire a lsrgc watershed in wales and to construct reservoirs there  the councils other bills were incidental measures for tuntely the house decided that the welsh reservoir bill must not be considered until after the report of the comnmission was issued  and the council had them selves put orf for the present the second resding of their rurchase bill tenders for  of the three per cent debenture stock issued under the companys act of ls were receivec and the stock allotted on december  the average price realized was � ss d per cent the whole of whibhlad been duly paid they recommended a dividend at the rate of  per cent per annum less incometax for the halfyear paynble on the th prox this would absorb � and leave an unappro priated balance of � the purity of the water kad been certified by sir edward erankland professor sir william crooke d professor james dewr as usual the directors had the fullest confidence in the future commercial prosperity of the eompany they believed that if the proposed bills became law they had safeguarded themselves against such a calamity as felluon them last year and they were sure that the shareholders would cooperate withthe directors in the future as theyhad done in the past in making the necessity f or a good and copios supply of water assured and in seeing that the true interestaof the consnmers were not overlooked cheers he concluded by moving the adoption of tiereport and tbe payment of the dividend mentionedmr binbert dsrtox seconded the motionmr fnmen ic tzdroin alluded to the oppositiowhich the companvs bills had met with from the county  council as pointed out by the chairman he could he said understand that when the council were called to account they would endeavour to justify themselves by stating that tbey had acted as they had thought best in the financial interests of the ratepayers wbat he could not understand however was the anudacity of the council in endeavouring to show that the responsi bility rested with the company and in aronsmg the ill feelings of the eastend of london against the very company whieb they had prevented from carrying out the works which would have avoided the effects of the late dronght the different companies had now brought forward a scheme which would cost them a large sum of money without bringing them in any addi tional income bet wvich would secure the h astend of london should another drooght occur even as severe as that of s  and yet the county councilwere not ashamed to obstruct this scheme also in everpossible way the chairman of their committee lir dickenson had given evidence before the cormnissioa showing ht thc council had onlytwo ideasto acquire the water companies at less than the real value of theii undertaldngs and to prejudice the compsaies by excitin g evcry pasion that could be aroused agaiut thenl inmins of uneducated people ignorant of the wlole circumstances a good deal of responsibility in this connexion also he maintaiued attached to a portion of the london pressthe cairsaaz then put the resolution and it was carried unanimouslya vote of thanks to the chairman and directors brought thepwoccedis to a close
