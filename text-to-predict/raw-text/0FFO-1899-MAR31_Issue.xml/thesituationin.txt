latest intelligencethe situation ln samoaaacaxn and german viewsfrowi ouxt ow cobmspoeijdnew york alricir there is little comment yet on the fighting in samoa but the herald traces the trouble to its true source saying that  the action of the germnan consul in affording continued encourage maent to the pretensions of mataafa has resulted in deplorable events special and general press despatches from washington indicate that the government takes a serious view of the matter that biataafa must go that the german consul ought to gothat is clearly th official opinion the suggestion that the american admiral acted with the concurrence of the german consul is directly denied by yesterdays apia telegrams it is moreover admitted that the admiral had authority to tuse force in accordance with the decision of the majority of the consulsin this crisis as throughout the recent troubles the british and americans are seen acting cordially together the views of these twvo governments so far as is known are also iden tical so that the present situation resolves itself into the question whether england and the united states taking their stand jointly on the treaty of berlin shall yield to germany vhose chief official in samoa has throughout sought to substitute bin owvn will for the solemn covenant between the three treaty powers this government has shown itself con ciliatory it has made everyallowance for the german disposition to support german officials it has been willing to waive matters of strict right for the sake of peace it lhas tried to con sider samoan interests as well as those of the powers it has given the german government credit for honest intentions even though unable to understand why its offending agent has been sustained or tolerated down to the present moment but the present crisis raises new and delicato questions which it is here hoped germany will meet in a different spiritturougir trles aaincywashington aixcn vthe newrs from samoa has come with startling suddonness to the omficials here and has tempo rarily diverted attontion from the fighting near manila the deepest interest attaches to the atti tude of the berlin govermnment at first there was some apprehension that grave international complicationsmightensuobut no such gloomy view is now entertainedl though it is recognized that the shedding of blood constituter a very serious and delicate situation it is declared that the position was discussed in advanco by the representatives of the three governments and that the real crisis occurred last week when the possibility of an outbreak was considered not withstanding the strained relations it was possible to secure an understanding which it is said will prevent the present outbreak from causing a rupture between the united states and germany or between great britain and germanyit is officially understood that germany posi tively ordered the captain of the falke to re frain from any active movements a high official vays it is evident that bloodshed is due to the united efl ort of the american and british com manders to protect the peaceful elements of the population against the lawlessness of mfataafa the iritishamerican case rests upon the para mount necessity of preserving order altogether apart from consular differences it is not considered probable that germany will raise the direct issue on the position so stated and the beiief is expressed that there is a growing disposition in germany to hold herr rose accountablethe navy department this afternoon issued the latest despatch received from admiral kautz it is dated aucldand yesterday and says  the situation is improving since my telegram of th via sydneythe date on which the despatch was sent from samoa is not given but it is presumed to have been the rd the navy departmeut declines to make public admiral lkautzs telegram of the th but it is lknown that it reported the admirali arrival and gave a brief review of the situation considerable maystery is considered to surround the despatch given out today as it seems almost inconceivable that admiral kautz should not have made any report on the events of the eight days preceding the rdlatrvsthe date th inst of admiral kautzs despatch sent vie sydney appears to be the date of forwarding from sydney not the date of despatch from apia it has nowv been learned that it gave the result of the investigations made by admiral kautz after his arrival at apia his conclusions fully sustained the contention of the british and american consuls which was in exact accord with the conclusion already reached by commander sturdee of her majestys cruiser porpoise it is believed that the despatch left apia on or prior to the th instsir julian pauncefote visited the state depart ment today great britain and america are act ing in complete accord not only in regard to the general solution of the samoan problem but particularly in reference to the force exerted by the british and american naval commanders admiral kantz it mow appears acted within his instiructions dr von hollebon the german ambassador was also at the state department todaypresident mckinley expressed much regret on being informed of the latest developments of the situation today and has requested full parti culars from the american officials in samoa at the earliest possible momenta portion of the above appeared in our seeond editionof yesterdaymox oun own coxsneposxxrberlin laucn the news received from samoa by way of london this morning has excited great surprise snd regret but i hasten to add that pending the arrival of fuller information the german press refrains from comments which might give rise to an embittered controversy or imperil the result of the negotiations in which england the united states and germany are engaged only cone telegram on the subject of the british andamerican intervention and the bombardment has been received from the german consulgeneral herr rose it is evidently the sequel to a previous message which has not yet arrived and is to the following effect the bombardment continues in accordance with military orders many of the whites have left their residences the chiefs belonging to the tanu party who had been banished to other islands have been brought back to iupolu the arms and ammunition which were taken from the adherents of tanu on january  have been returned to themthe latest development of events in samoa is deplored here mainly because of the influence it may exert on germana public opinion the establishment of excellent relations between england and germany and the prospect of co operation on the part of the two powers in africa and elsewhere commended themselves on the whole to german public opinion although they toolk it bysurprise there remained enough of the old jealousy and suspicion however to make it difficult forthe german government to convince all sections of politicians that the policy of friendly cooperation with england was being carried out with a due regard for german interests the events now reported from samoa may it is feared give occasion to the suspicious gnd mistrustful section of german public opimnon to reproach the government with the first fruits of its ravroadwmci with enland and with theunited states  at the earliest opnortunity these critics will esclaim  the engtish and the americans unite to opposo you and their ships of war bombard apia before the eyes and in defiance of the protest ofyourconsul  this i understand to be the most poignant element in the regret vith which the news from samoa has been received in quarters wvhich are authoritative and responsibleon the other hand thero is no inclination to form a premature judgment on the action of the american admiral the commanders of the british ships and the british and american consuls but  learn that the following points are regarded for the present as inexplicable tth provisional government with mataafaat its head had been unanimousld recognized by the british the german and the american consuls on what authority did admiral sautz convoke a conference on board the philadelphia and proceed by tho votes of a majority to abolish theprovisional governmy t lhere is nothing in the samoa act which conld justify such pro ceedings lt is true that as was announced some time ago admiral eautz sailed for samoa wvith instruc tions  to act in accordance wvith the decision of the majority of the representatives of the powvers if an emnergency arose wvhich did not admit of delay even if tee importantquestion of the compatibility of these instructions with the samoa act be left oult of account it seems remarkablo that nothing is said in the reuter telegram as to the nature of the  emergency  which has now compelled the admiral to actthe interests of mataafa i am assured do not in any way influence the attitude of the german government thero is in no quarter an nclina tion irrevocably to espouse tbe cause of that claimant to the office or king the whole point of the german complaint is that the samoa act appears to have been set aside and the protest of the german consul to have been overidden vwith out so much as an intimation of this new policy to the german government the provisional regimne in samoa was established bv the tbree consuls subject to the assent of their respective governments that rgime according to the german contention could not be abolished writh out the unanimous consent of the three powvers concerned the action of admiral kautz and of those vho approved it was therefore not only a contravention of the samoa act of  but also a breach of the provisional agreement concluded by the three consuls on january  of the present yeari have thought it desirable to state the german case as fully and fairly as possible but i repeat that in spite of whllat nas happened there is a strong desire to efiect an early and satisfactory settlement of the samoan troubles it is pointed out by the bmrliner neveste nacwichtem that interventions of the powvers and bombardments have taken place in samoa before now wvithout precluding an ultimate understanding on the part of the three powers germany herself landed a force in  in order to attack the same mataafa whoso cause her consul now espouses the germans fell into an ambush and were massacred and the memory of that disaster as well as of the loss of the three german vessels in a hurricane at apia in march  forms a senti mental link which attaches german feeling to the islands it is moreover claimed that the interest of tho germans as owners of plantations in samoa exceeds that of tho americans and the english togetherone thing appears to be clear amid the conflic ing views and opinions on the chronic samoa difficulty the germani government adheres strongly to the provision in the samoa act which requires unanimity in all decisions of the three consuls in order to tender them effective in reply to a recent proposal of germanys to enable the three consuls if unanimous to impose new municipal taxes america proposed to add as a further requirement  the approval of the three governments or at least of a majority of them the german goverdment assented considering that the addition had little practical signiicance but it made a reservation to the effect that its assent was not to constitute a precedent  in the sense that the decision of samoan questions could be voted by majorities of the three govern ments it is manifest that the constitution of samoa as established by the berlin act of  suiers from the fault which proved fatal to the kingdom of polandthe libenom trefo which carlyle described as  an everflowing fountain of anarchy joyful to the polish nation the power of one of the three consuls who generally happens to be the german to arrest all business fom the election of a king to the imposition of a tax by his sole veto must inevitably continue to render order and progress impossiblethe following semiofficial ciomnnuniqug was issued this afternoon a question recently arose between the german and american governments on the ground of a rumour to the effect that the ijnited states had given the american admiral instructions to act in accordance with the decision which might be adopted by any two representatives of tho three powersgreat britain germany and the united states in consequence of this rumour the german government made representations to the american ambassador in berlin to the effect that the berlin treaty required the unanimity of the three powers and called attention to the dangers which might surely be expected to result from a contravention of the treaty in any respect what ever the american government sent a candid and conciliatory reply which was reeeived in berlin with great satisfaction the reply recog nizes the necessity of the unanimity of all three treaty powers as the condition of any ordered poliev or sustained action and leclares that the anerican admiiral is only empowered to act in accordance wvith the decision of the majority of the representatives of the powers if an emergency arose admitting of absolutely nodelay and that a ratification by the unanimous vote of the threo powers would have to be solicited on the earliest opportunity and that no permanent settlement of any kind could be effected without a unani mous vote of this kind the american govern ment cabled to its representatives in samoa to adopt a most friendly and conciliatory policy to wards the german representatives and towards german interests in the islands and carefully to avoid everything xvhich might be misinterpreted or might cause iufeeling inouou aunirms agaxoyb rlin maaca s the nationa lzeifung commenting on the news from samoa remarks that it appears that the representatives of great britain and america tlhought that they had ground for the belief that the mataafa party was auting in contravention of the berlin treaty after pointing out that it is not mentioned how a breach of the treaty was committed the journal says the telegram bringing the news of the fght ing states that a meeting of the consuls and senior naval officers decided npon disavowing the matanfa government which previously had been recognized provisionally by all three consuls this meeting had no jurisdiction and could not take any decision from the mere fact that itrepresented a majority only the unanimous approval of the three consuls can impart legal significance to any decision the german consul however issued a counterproolamation and whether the english and americans had suficient reason for resorting to armed intervention to pro tect their interests on the ground that these wereviolated by mataafa is a question regarding which further explanations muvst be awaited so far the only result of the decision taken by the maeeting appears to have been destruction and anarchy
