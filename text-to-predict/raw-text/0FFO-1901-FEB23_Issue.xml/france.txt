franceifroms our own correspondentparis fes in the discussion of the senatorial amendments of the budget by the chamber today an attempt by the radicals and socialists to extend the pro gressivo scale of tho death duties so as in extreme cases to conilscate no less than  per cent of the inheritancewas shaumelessly supported by the reactionaricswho thus hoped to embarrass or overturn the ministry or to produce a dead locl with the senate m anthimemnard pro posed without previous notice a new clause increasing the leath duties by onetenth for an inheritanee of three millions by onefourth for five millions by  per cent for ten millions and by  per cent for  millions the acting president m aynard urged the impropriety of such improvised proposals and hl kilotz wvhile approving and even wishing to enlarge the scheme advocated its severance from the budget m caillaqu minister of finance pointed out that the proposal wvould wreck the new system of death duties and m cochery on behalf of the budget committee insisted on its separation from the budget and its reference to tho committee amid great uproar the separa tion wvas agreed to by  votes to m kilotz then proposed the mlenard scheme with a continuance of the progressive scale up to inheritances of f or upwards after another stormy scene urgency was voted by  votes to  m rouvier as an ex mainister of finance dwelt strongly on tho danger of sudden proposals wvhich had not even been printed but simply read out by the presi dent a tax of  per cent he said was really not taxation but confiscation ml cochery taunted the government with having itself intro duced the progressive system and thus broken down all barriers the chamber agreed by  votes to  to discuss the clauses or rather the single clause of the proposal m caillauux then vindicated the moderate progressive system incorporated in the budget and deprecated fresh proposals wvhich could only wreck or com plicate it he urged that that system should at least be allowved a fair trial the proposal of mi klotz was however adopted by  votes to a resolution proposed by ml gauthier de clagny calling oni tho government to support the scheue in the enate wvas lirst postponed till monday by  votes to  andithen adopted by  votes to  thus ended a sittidg which wvas a series of surprises showing the unscrupulous ness of the opposition in suppqortijn scliqwesdirectly contrary to their professed principles and also the necessity of m waldeckrousseaus speedy recovery for he alone has the tact and presence of mind to cope with these dangerous tacticsm wvaldeekrousseau it is believed will be able to attend the chamber on monday for the resumption of the discussion on the associations billm delcasse has submitted to the senate a convention with italy which empowers extradi tion in the case of the attempted murder poison or kidnapping of a sovereign the head of a foreign state or a member of his family these not being political crimes a similar convention was concluded with belgium in  with luciemburg in  with monaco in  with denmark in  with holland in  and with the congo state in i have thus far confined myself to a mere mention of the strike at montoeaux les mines in that department of saoneetloire nvhich for cen turies has been a source of wealth and strength to france naturally here as in every place where there is a considerable output of coal the struggle betwveen the miner and the company that exploits him is almost a normal occurrence formerly the discontent of the working man who complained of insufficient pay made itself felt in riots and revolution a manwho descends every morning in a bucket suspended in the void and who with head bent doni and eves dimmed by the obsciurity works for whole days to wrest from tho entrails of the earth the coal which is sent up to the surface to accumulate for the benefit of the proprietor or sharebolder will always be the easy prey of agitators but today there is a legal right to strike and when outside intervention does not make itself felt it is only rarely that the ollivier billfor the strike lawv dates from the empireresults in scenes of bloodshed even the terrible carmanx strike wvith its bombs ended without bloodshed and without making a gulf between the two portions of the nation thlis general truth is due to tho faet that thus far tho vast majority of strikes have remained purely social and economic in their character the struggle being generally between tho wvorking man eager to obtain a higher wage and theo employer who resists the inroads that menace his capital and it being yior the most part sincere reciprocal concessions have usually brought the quarrel to an end with out public order being disturbedtoday it is nothing of the sort by anl odd and somewhat mysterious coincidence striles of late have assmned the character of a sort of con tagious cruption attacking labour corporations of all kinds we have secn striles breaking out almost siinultancously among cabdrivers tailors railvay eruplohijs and miners in places remote from one another one has inevitably asked one self what unknown agitators acting simul taneously on such various points could thus be attempting to revive these conflicts between capital and labour at last we seem to have the key of the mystery the strike of alonteeaux les mines has during the last  hours visibly lost its economic and social character and become political by the side of the miners union vwhich appears to be a regular socialist organiza tioin known as the  bed tunion was formed a new union controlling a miriolrity of the miners wvhich opposes the tricolour flag to the red ilag and is known as the  yellow union this union protests its desire to work and complains of being hindered by tho  red union evi dently orderly persons would be disposed to sym pathize with the  yellow union if the struggle were simply andl solely ono betwveen labour unions vithout any outside interventionunfortunately during the last  hours a move ment has arisen which very rightly arouses the distrust and sumpicion of impartial inea the other day it was noticed that the  yellow union which seemed to have at its disposal a consider able capital was organizing among its menmbers an abtmdant distribution of good soup tbus putting its members out of all risk of physical want but until just now the origin of these funds had not been revealed to us the journals oe the nationalist opposition have opened a subscrip tioni list wvhich in twvo days by donations fiom purely reactionary and antiministerial circles has collected several thousands of francs the names of the subscribers riecall very remnarkably those on the subscription list opened for mine eenryand taken together they forum a significant indication as to the nature of the antigoverii mental and antirepublican opposition violent articles stimulating the hatred of the rival unions seek to prove that the government is taking the side of the socialists and inciting labour against capital the object in a word is to use the strike as a political instrument the hlope heing to bring about bloodshed out of wlhiclh rioting and revolt woull issue to be ingeniously propagated by infamous maneyuvres until we witness the real revolutioni oni both sides it should be satid imprudent and almost crimiial wvords lhave been uttered and while the oie party blames the government for having talcen the precautionary measures of sending soldiers to mlonteeaux les mines the other secks to paralyse these efforts by providiiig the socalled unioii of order wvitli the means of prolonging anl attitude vliieh tho rival union coiisiders a defiance anid provocationthis is enough to show tho necessity of calling attention to this struggle a struggle that naturally causes anxiety in france as indicatiiig that the rival parties arc bent on pushing things to a decisive arid even disastrous end in tho midst of all this tho goverdunent seems to be utterly apatlieticand does not feel apparently that it has sullcieint energy or is sufliciciitly surc of itself to sot the lawvs in motion and to bring before the courts those wlho are overtly seekinig to iiicite the one party against the other and are using any and every wveapon that miay securo them the rervanchel at home wvhich is their whole programme and ambitionthe attempt of a few socialist mayors oll the strength of a law of  to forbid priests to wear their cassocks in tire streets has naturally excited derision today at villejuif the justice of the peace declared tirc order null and void such attire not affecting public order orsecurity
