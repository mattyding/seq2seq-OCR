electrical lfghttacg of theembankmentthe little electrical generating station which yblondon county counoil has erected by the side of the district railways charingcross station for the special purpose of lighting the embankment and westminster bridge is to be formally brought into operation this afternoon it is interesting to note that the embankment was also the seene of about the earliest experiment in publie electric lighting tried in this country for on december  s the smetropolitan board of works was responsible for starting  lights with which a portion of it was illuminated in spito of certain critics who maintained that even at that time there were more promising methods available jablochkoff  candles were omployed and although the system was subse quently extended and oven installed on waterloobridge and holbornviaduct it was ultimately abandoned as unsatisfactory and electricity gave way to gas againthe total number of lamps to be erected under the present scheme is about  distributed along the parapet of the embanlment the side of the pavement awvay from the river and vestminsterbridge less than half that number hoevcver are as yet in place for the council determined to concentrate its energies on the parapet lamps and press on the work so that they might be ready for use at the present time leaving the rest to be finished sabsequently lvhat the public will see tonight there fore nill bo a line of betveen c and  lamps fringing the river from wvestminster to blackfriarsbridge these are placed in tho lanterns of the original standards de signed for gas jets when the embankment was made this was not the original intention of the council for it was not thought that the lanterns were large enough to contain arc lamps but the gilbert arc lamp company of chingford pointed out that its aro lamps were short enough to go into the lanterns and the council finally determined to adopt them the standards thus remain almost exactly s they were the only alteration being that the samno company has fitted the lower part of the lanterns with ribbed glass in order to diffuse the light these lamps on tho parapet burn for  hours without attention take five or six amperes and are of tho nominal power of  candles each tho circuits are arranged in parallel series of ten lamps each and this is believed to bo the flrst instance in which this arrangement had been adopted with aro lamps of such small amperage fo public lighting fhe rest of the lamps to be installed on wvestminsterbridge and along the other side of the embankment will be inore powerful taking  ampered each burning gs hours and having a nominal candle power of about  on the bridgo ono will be fitted in the contre brauch of each of tho threebranch standarda over the piers on the embankment new standards will be erected on the lerb provided wvith a lowvering geas designed by the gilbert company so that ladders will not be requiredl for the purpose of putting in nev carbous when all thoso lamips are in operation the embanlment should becoine one of the best lighted thoroughfares in the worldin the powerhouse which is a building of white stone vith some pretensions to oleganco there are installed four twopole dynamos of the anchester type having a capacity of  icilowatts each at  volts made by messrs mcclure and whitfleld of stockport these are ropodriven by four horse power  stockport  gas engines which aro fitted with selfstarting gear and with duplicate ignition to ensuro certainty of action a sealed bypass is also arranged romid the meter so that if the mechanism of the latter should fail to act a supply of gas will still be available the olectrical energy is con veyed to the lamps in copper cables with paper ianiua tion and lead coverings made by the st ihelens cable company of warrington they are laid in the subway which was provided under the pavement by sir joseph bazalgette whon the embankment was constructed rhe switchboard by wvhich the distribution is regulated was designed lby the councils electrical engineer and is arraniged so that any circuit can be run oif any of the four dynamos and changes mado quickly and conveniently the wvhole plant indeed has been carefully designed to guard against breakdown and in the event of its occurrence to reduco interruption of the light to the smallest possiblo limits
