parli a menthouse of lordstile declaration against romancatholioismfiiay feb the lord chanculor took his seat on the wooisack at a quazterpvz  ooloek lord braye had the following question onthe paper  to ask the primo minister whether he can hold out hope that the government wll speedily introduce into parliament a measure to wholly abolish the oath imposed as obligatory on the sovereign of this country by statute which was solemnly taken by his majesty the present king in this parliament that is to say the oath in which almighty god isinvoked to bear witness that doctrines held by the catholic church not only as awful sacred and stupendous but also as vital and fundamental are false the noble lordsaidhe wished to postpone the question until such time as the government had further opportunity for taking the matter to which it referred into consideration the matter was no doubt under consideration owing to a memorial or protest signed by a number of roman catholio peers against the oath which had been taken in that house by the sovereign and he therefore asked leave to postpone the question until the matter had received further con sideration by the governmentthe marquis of salisburyi do not know whether thero is any object to be gained in delaying the question which tho noble lord wished to ask excepting bringing him down again unnecessarily though i am very anxious to give an answer which would be satisfactory to the noble lord and his coreligionists i do not wish to leave on his mind an impression that there are any doubts in the matter wve all of us deplore the language in which that declaration is couched and vely much wish it could be otherwise expressed but wvhon it comes to altering an enactment which has now lasted as far as i know without serious question  years and which was originally included in the bill of rights it is a matter which cannot be done without very considerable thought wve must remember that an enactment of that kind repre sents the passionsfeolings and sensibilities of the people by whom it was originally caused and that these lhave not died out they are not strong within these walls but there are undoubtedly parts of tho country where the controversies which tho declaration represents still flourish and whlere the emuotions which it inidicates have not died out before an enactment is proposed with all the discussion which must precede such an enactment we shall havo to consider how far it is desirable to light again passions which sleep at this moment for an occasion which is not now urgent and which we all earnestly hope may not be urgent in our lives i do not wish to debar the noble lord from any action which he may think it riht to take but i wish to doint out to him the extreme difculties and anxieties which would accompany any such attempt with respect to the actual question of legisla tion i need hardly observe that it is rather a question for tho house of commons than for us because here i do not imagine there would be any doubt whatever about thle result of such attempted legislation but i couldnot be certain that a very strong feeling milht not be excited elsewhere  and i notice that possibfy with a view to that consideration tho leador of the other house in answer to a question said that at all evonts for the present year ho did not seo the possibility of having the requisite opportunity of bringing the question before the house i am afraid therefore however deeply i sympathize with the feelings of the noble lord nd vwish there had been no cause for their being appealed to that my answer would have to be of a discouraging charaoterearl spenicer said he felt it was important that if possible the words of this oath should be modified so as not to give offenco which it gave and rightly gave to the consciences of our roman catholic fellowcountrymen hear hear he heartily agreed with the noble marquis that they would not have the necessity of hearing the oath taken again in the house for a very long time but if there was anything in the contention of those who said that the form of the oath should be altered then he hold it was not right to defer its alteration by statute much beyond the present time the noble marquis referred to the great length of timo the oath had been on tho statutebook but a great many things had to be altered owing to change of circumstances and change of opinion without having regard to their origin lie for one did not at all agree with the contention that the oath should be altogether dispensed with he thought it was essential considering the very strong feeling on the subject in the eounryhatherenoudboomeoath or some declaration which would prevent the throne from being occupied by one of the romanl catholic faith wvhile he felt that he also most strongly felt that the oath in its present form wasunnecessarily ofensive to roman catholics  andalthough he was a strong protestant himsell he did not at all believe in the necessity of the continuation of the offensive words in the oath he vontured to press u on tho noble marquis the urgent necessity that win a reasonable time the government with theirlarge majority and all their power should look into the matter and endeavour to after the form of the oath a much greater step than the alteration of the words of this oath was the passing of an act in s or  which enabled a romanatholics to be lord chanicellor of ireland he was the first lord lioutenant of ireland who had as a colleague a ronian catholic lord chancellor lie very well recollected the feelings that were excited at the timeand he had been the object of attaclr on that account but there vas not a single act of the irish government which affected iijuriously the interests of the country on account of a roeman catholic being lord chancellor of ireland that was a greater change than any mero modification of the rings oath and while as he had said he considered that some form of oath must exist he hoped the covern ment would refer the question to a committee or as he would prefer would take action themselves to make the oath less offensive to roman catholicslord iierries said he had already mado upthis mind to move that a committee be appointed consisting he hoped of members of botx parties including perhaps the archbishop of canterbury to inquire what modification it might bo possible to introduce into the declaration which ivould make it more agreeable to a large portion of his malajestys subjects bie wished their lordships to remember that this declara tion was not only offensive to the teolinigs of his ilajestys own subjects but also to many of his nearest relations thus for example the russian imiperial family were by it branuded as idolatrous and superstitious persons surely it was possible for thebritish ltegislature in this country to make some alteration in the declara tion it must astonish a large number of colonists and also a great number of people throughout europe that such a declaration should exist at this time of dav in this home of religious toleration before the end of the session he should bring this matter forward unless he could get some other per who was likely to have more influence thanl he had to do so and he hoped the government would bo prepared to assist in the iormation of a committee wvhich would receive the general approval of all classes and which might devise some modiflcation of the oath which would be satisfactory to the feelings of the roman catholics of this countrylord braye asked the noble marquis by wny of supplementary question whether the oath could not be converted into a declaration an oath was a very ditferent thing indeed from a declaration a declaration was a thing within the province of politics whereas an oaui essentially came within the sphere of religion this oath compelled the sovereign to call god to witness that tho vorship and belief and creed of an imnienso majority of christians were idolatrous including as hid been pointed out the whole russian empire a dcolaration would not give offence in the same way as an oathnlo further answer was returnedtile loss of the prmiiose htlllord muskerry asked whether the board of trade inquiry as ordered into the loss in december last of the ship primrose hill of liverpool had beenideferred owing to pending libel actions between private individuals whether in view of this vessel sailing withouta certi ficated ofieoer and certain other allegations as to her manning it was the intention of the board of trade to proceed with this inquiry  and also wihether ns these inquiries were held in the public interest the board of trade would consider the advisability of discontinuing the practice of theirbeing snbordinntedto cases of purely private concernthe earl of dudley said it was qulte truo that the inquiry into the loss of the primrose bill was according to the usual custom deferred while the libel action between the owners of the vessel and the prorprietors of the liverpol courier newspaper awaited hearing that action bowever had now been disposed of and bad resulted in a verdict for the owners with ï¿½ damages as regards the last part of the question he regretted that he could not make any promise that the board of trade would depart from the course that it had hitherto followed in cases of this kind the custom of deferring the inquiry into the circumstances of any particular casualty while a civil action in connexion with it was pendlin either in the hlghcour or the admiralty court seemed to himto be based on sound anad equitable principles to act otherwise maight hve the effect of oeriously prejudicinf the position of the various litigants and he could net thank therefore that unider these circem stance his noble friend would wish to presslhis sugges tiontheir lordships rose at five minutes to  oclock
