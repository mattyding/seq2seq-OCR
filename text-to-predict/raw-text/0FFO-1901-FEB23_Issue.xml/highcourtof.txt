questions to the jury and havo taken the responisibility of ruling aftenvards which he thought woould have been tho most proper course to follow lie did not intond by any observations he might mnake to reflect iil tho slightest on mr brown and his advisers but all he wvishea to indicate ivas that be re garded these charges as very serious andas cbarges wbich should not be put forwvard except on evidence wyhich could be supported tho charges against messrs burr lotter and marley were substantially that thoy conspired hy inflating the price of shares by iletitions sales between october sg and may ls and then maintaininig the price by tho samie moans and by promoting the plaintiff eompaliy with the object of unloading by means of the plaintiffs money at the iniflated price lf it bad beoen material to coissider the rights and liabilities of persons who had gone into the market anid raised the price of the shares by bogus sales he thought there would have been ovidence to be considered biit the point he ruled to be fatal to this part of the plaintiffs case vas that he could find no evidence that the conipany was promoted for that purpose he was satislied by the evidence given that there wvas a teson fide scheme for the discovery and winning of this coal iil kont anud that the scheme wvas boe tiic on the part of mr burr nothing however vas put to tr burr which ouht not to have been put and if it had been a question of liis testimony against that of others the record of mr burr would have required verv serious consideration but he was satisfied that there was no evidence that the company was promoted in order to take up the syndicates sharos lrightly or wvrongly it was promoted for exploration in kent coal and he should have ruled if the case had not been wvithdravu that there was iso evidence of fraudulent or improper promo tion of the company iie did niot consider that thev had aniy duty to inquliro into deley or wvant of skill in wviining the coai  but he believed mr grifithls evidence tht despite disasters and troubles thev worked steadily on and there was no evidence of anvthing but a bonex fidc elfort to wiu the coal he thought sir r reid bad acted properly in wvithdrawing the charge of conspiracy against the directors suich a charge we a criminal charge aid wvherever it was tried it wvas the duty of those wvho imiade it to prove it by affirmative evidenice and not to rely ous more suspicion boi had seems these directors in the witnessbox and thought sir it ireid had taken the only course open no bins in withdrawving these charges he also rued that there wsas no evidence of negligenice against the directors it was difficult to define culpable negligeiico or gross business negligence  but he thought the judges had always hold that in order to snake directors liable somethiing imore than mere negligence or vant ot prudence or reasonable caro must be proved and thlat there must be present a degree of recklessness which amounted to misconduct and he was satisfied that theso gentlemen believed that to putrchase the syndicate shares wvas a prudent investment they said it wvas at mnarket price anid it wvas a remarkable fact that the shares did stand at the flgure at which thev bouglht until thie disaster in november as to mr turr he had o right to comnplain of the crossexamination as to his business position ile lid not think even his own counsel had maintaided that mr burr had a clean conmnmercial record but whether it wvas so or not the lawv of england was ust and fraud muist be proved agaiiist him just as icas against anybody else he had not to estimate the real value of the stock or shares received by the plaintiff company buit thero vould have been great dificulty in estimating tho damages resulting from

of the shares was fixed at i tho shares wero fluctuating in value and afterwards fell bolow thatt price the position then was that currio was entitled to have the transaction carried tlirough by

execute a tranusfer to that name and to hand the transfer to the defenidanits anud receive a clequie from them for the prieo at the rate of  of course in order to got the slaros from willis currie

this action it naust be shown that ctirrie or his niominee had gone thirougls the forns of producing the shares wilth a transfer from the certified registered onvner of the shares to the name given by the clefendaiits that tender must be proved unless it could be showvn to havebeen waived by the defendants tho only difficulty in tio case was whether tho defendants conduct amounted to a dispensation to willis or currie of tho necessity of tendering a transfer his lordship came to the conclu sion that tho defendants had showvn tbat they svould not accept the shares if they wvere formally tondered no doubt in the first instanco willis had demanded of the defendants w vhat he was not entitlod tonamely he askedthe defendants to  muake down  the shares with hsi the defendants refused to do this becauso the result of doing so would have been to create a newv contract betwveen the defendants and willis sad the defendants wvould have lost their rights as against currie this question had been inquired into by the stock exchange committoe at the instance of willis and the committee had deided rightly against williss contention but currie had a perfect right to require the defendante to accept a transfer from waillis tlho defendants had however tlaken up the position tlhat they wvould have a fornsal completion wviti currie ailti with no one else and theyiutiniated that to willis and
