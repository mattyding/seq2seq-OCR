chinacount von walderseesexpeditionfrom outj own corurspond mtaberlhin feb a german telegram from peking states that count von waldersee has  postponed  his intended advance in consequence of the assent of the chinese government to the demands of the foreign ministers for the punishment of certain offenders i learn that although the projected expedition has for the moment been abandoned the preparations for it have by no means been discontinued the expedition was abandoned or rather  postponed as the telegram says because the chinese court gave way and named a date on which it was prepared to fulfil the demands of the powers as they affect the punish ment of highplaced chinese criminals if this solemn engagement were not kept count von wvaldersee wvould doubtless be ready to adopt those extreme measures with wvhich he has threatened the chinese it is a mistake to suppose that the abandonment or  postpone ment  of the expedition was in any way due to representations made by any foreign minister in peking certain views were doubtless expressed by mr conger acting oni instructions from washington but theso views wvero not in accordanco with the vastlypreponderating opinion of the council of mlinistersnew york fer what seems an official statement conies from berlin that counlt von wvaldersee has postponed his threatened expedition because china submits to the powers demands still washington is not reconciled to count von waldersees action the president seems to forget that but for the moral support he has given to china wvhich throughout has encouraged her to delay and resist count von nvaldersees menace would not have been necessary but what china sees now is that wvhile the powers will use force to coerce tho united states will not use force to protect her celestial client the president of course never meant to but china till niow seems to have believed or hoped lie wvouldthrough iieretss agencyparis feb the figaro today in an article on the chinese situation says it is assumed that chinas consent to the terms of the powers is not the work of the ministers and that it is fieldmarshalcount von waldersee who has obtained thisi result by threatening the court with war if ithis is the case there is reason for congratula i tion for the result shows that in a delicate i situation where certaini jealousies might have been feared soldiers

correspondentberlin fgb in the house of commons on tuesday some surprise was expressed at the roundabout way in which the shanhailwan railvay was being re stored to british control through the medhiun of  the oerman rgovernment thisdescriptionof the method of procedure was not formally correct the railway was in point of form handed over to count von waldersee as commanderinchief of the international forces in order to be restored by him to the british i have no reason to doubt that if the influence of the german government was exorcised in any sense it must have been on the side of british rights but the temporary russian occupation bore the aspect of a military measure endorsed by the commanderinchief it was in that capacity therefore that count von waldersee took over the railway from the russians and not as a representative of the german governmentthe wellinformed munich alpengeine zeitung says that the estimates for the chinese expedi tion for the iinaneial year

grodelcoff which according to the commenlts of other russian papers gives a striking illustra tion of the difference betveeni the russians and tho gcrmans in china in the matter of the treat ment of prisoners this telegram contains a request from the chinese dzian dzun of tsitsihar  to lay beore his majesty tlieemperor of russia the profound gratitude and thankfulness of the entire native population for the gracious libera tion of prisoners and the humane treatment of them this outburst of chinese official grati tude has been called forth by the simple fact that two wounded manclii prisoners wiere sent back rejoicing to their homes and families after four months in hospital the incident is apropos just now when the russian press is more outspoken than ever in its condemnation of the infamous and revolting character of thc german expedi tions and of german condiect generally in chinageneral grodekoff further telegraphs that he has abolished the stato of var in the mongolian
