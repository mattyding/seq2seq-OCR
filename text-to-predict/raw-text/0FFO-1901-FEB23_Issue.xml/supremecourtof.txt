justice bruce at the trial of the action without a jury roported  the tiines law reports  the action was brought to recover from the defendant company remuneration for services rendered by the plaintiff as a director of the dofendant company the plaintiff claimed in the first place � as ono years remuncration from november   to november   and that portion of his claim was admitted he claimed in the second place remuneration from novomber   to may   tho date when he resigned his ofrice as director remu neration for this latter period at the rate of � a year amounted to � s id and this part of the claim was in dispute the defendants contending that the plaintiff was not entitled to claim remuneration for a period of less than a years servico the st article of the articles of association of the company was as follows  the directors shall be paid out of the funds of the companiy by wvay of remuneration for their services and exclusive of travelling expenses the sum of � per annum per director and suchi further sums as shall from time to time be deter mined by tho company in general meeting and the same shall be divided among them in such proportion and manner as the directors by agreement may determine and in default of such determination equally the said smn of � per annum may be increased but not diminished by the coripany in general meeting mlr justice bruce was of opinion that the reasonable construction of the article was that a director was not entitled to remunera tion unless he had served for a complete year he was further of opinion that the plaintiffs claimsn ws not in the nature of a claim to salary to which the apportion ment act of  applied he accordinglv gave judgment for the defendants the plaintiff appealedmr edward bray appoared

article of these articlos of association had been rightly construed by mr justica brnoe it differed frona the article dealt wvith in the case of svabey v port darvin gold mining company  megone  he read it as meaning that a lump sumeg � in the case of there being four directorsshould be dividedaamong the directors wvho had served for a complete year it was argued on the part of the plaintiff that the article should be read as meaning that the directors should be paid at the rate of � per annum per director but that was not wvhat the article said in his opinion no director was entitled to re muneration except for service for a complete year this was in accordance with two previous decisionsviz a decision of mr justice cozenshardys in  saltonv new beeston cycle company  s i ch  and a

mnr justice ranrvell was of opinion that the act of s coutemplated that the commnissioners would eniter into contracts of twvo sortsl for the constructionl of works or supply of mnaterials to the city wvhich would become their own property and whiich hie called constructionicontact ad  fo th suplyof water for cleansing conr oacs ord other itlminant for lighting the city bycompeanies or persoins

that notwithstanding tho generality of tile language of sectioii  that sectioni applied to construction contracts only mtoreover section  ought to he road with sectioii  of the act of  and in hlis opiniona it would be idle to enact that a commissioner uwho was a shiareholder in any contracting company should not he eligible to vote on the contract if the lucre fact of his being a share holder

contract for this there can be no reason anid such a construcetion cannot he accepted his lordship thecn discussed other sections of the act of  and continuied as follows it does not require argumenit to prove that all contracts dealt writh in sectiois  are also referred to and dealt with in sectioui  and it is almost impossible to suppose such ciscsided legisla tion as wiould apply the stringeiit proviisions of that section to construction contracts oiily and leave it lawvful to any commissioner aldernsalis or conimouu councilmnais to have the largest interest in any contract with thje com msissioners that is not a construction contract as to the meaigo section  the iniportant point for decision is whethera corporator or sliarehsolder of an incorporated compaisy is or is not interested directly or indirectly in any contract entered into with the company it was admitted on behalf of the plaintiff consipany that as a general rule he is so interested and indleed to deny that would be equivaleiit to saying that in case of a contract within an incorporated compaisy no persois whatsoever is interested though the whole fortuines of the corporators or shareholders mnay depeiid upon the contracta conteii tion wvhich is manifestly absuxrd but beyond what i thiiik aisay fairly be called the asain contenitionviz that only construction contracts are withinisectioii this plaintiffs have contended and the learnled juidge has in their favour held that the act of  and puarticularly section  thereof proves that under the especial legislation affecting the cosnisissioners of sewvers a shiareholder is iiot considered as being interested in a coiltract made by his company though he must necessarily share in any profits or loss that mnight be the result theoreof if there wereoivords in the act of ssi isecessarily involving that conclusioneffect must be given to them but iso usiers con jecture based on probable grounds wouldi be suhlicieilt for theoupse h argument of the plaintiff adopted by the pleraprneds judge turnis entirely siponi section  of the act that is a section not relatiisg to concluided con tracts hut to discuission asd votes antecedent to con tracts it refers only to commissioners and isot to alder men or common councilsnen thougis they are dcealt wvith by section  of the act of  tise sectioni was obviously intendedi to extend still furtiser the disabilities of comnmissioners and there is nothing to indicate that any relaxationi of the provisions of the earlier statute was intended  but whilst providing that no coniimissioner being a surveyor solici tor or agent of a company wnith wvhom it is inlte ided to enter into a contract shall sit or vote it applies iiatiurally the saiiie provision to a share holder of the conmpany it would be strange indeed if a suirveyor solicitor or agent werer prevented froma sitting or voting and a shareholder permitted to do both but i rom the fact thait a commissioner shareholder is prohibitedi by section  to sit or vote npon tise question of entering into a contract with his compnyla it has been argued that he could isot be possessed of soon an interest as under sectizn  of the act of  would render thie contract if and wvhen made null and void it wvould be imnecessary it is argued to prevenit him from sittiisg and voting if the fact of isis liolding shares would of itself avoid theo contract tho argument loses sighit of the fact that a shareholder commissioner miglht by takiisg part is and vnoting as to the expediency and policy of a coistract with his company exercise perh aps a decisive iiflhuence oni the entering inito suich contract and vet isight not hbeis the contract was signed be any longer a shiareholder or ally longer a comnmissioner us either of whlich cases the con tract would be unaffected by section  tihere is in fact no necessary comiexiori betwveen section  of the earlier aisd section  of the later act and it wvould be illogical and mierely conjectural to sassumne thsat theo later section shiouild inbrpret time earlier lse conclusioii i arrive ut is that a shareholder coin iisissioner alderman or commson couiicilosan is interested within section  aisd thalt the eoxisteisce of his interest is sufficient to render a contract wviths his corn pany null and void ihe fact that express provision has beis iisacde by parliansent that a member of ais ordinarv municipail council shall not be precluded by being interested oiuly as a shareholder of an incorporated coiiipany from taking part iii osaking a contract between his company and the corporation of which he is a muemiber only emnphasizes the distinctioii in this respect betwveen ordinary inunicipal corporations and the city coro aso  to which nosiunilar parlianiontary provisioii exists or apparently ever has existed mr danlckwerts pointed out that in legislation relating to the city corporation clauses sub stantially similar in effect to section  of the act of  have been regularly iniserted from a tinie long anterior to the date of the municipal corporations act  down to the present time this disposes of tho sugges tion that tho legislation of  was a mere experiuient
