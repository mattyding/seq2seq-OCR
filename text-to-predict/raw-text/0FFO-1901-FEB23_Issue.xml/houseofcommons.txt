were precedents such as those of isottinghiam hlarwich and other places at nottingham  persuns wvere scheduled for bribery and at maidstone  at nottingham however the offence was the first while at maidstone this wvas the third offence le held that in the case of maidstone the writ ought not to be issued at all the borough was notoriously and incor rigibly corrupt at the recent election bribery
