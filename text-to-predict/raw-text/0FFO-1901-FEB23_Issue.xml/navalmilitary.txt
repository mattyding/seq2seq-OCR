disobedience to orders was resumed yesterday at devonport col lurbuul again prosided  col wv w m smith was deputy judge advocate capt and adj wynellmayow th border rogt was prosecutor and mrx p t pearce defended the prisonercaptain scaife was recalled and examined by the president he said that his grievance as regards pay did not disappear after the letter of december  because leave was again cancelled on december  when he left youghal he considered that his pay for november was according to the custom of the regiment  days over due he did not apply for his pay during november because it was not the custom in the regiment for the psof any month to be paid until after the month had expirc but he made personal application in the orderlyroom for his november pay between december  and  before writing his letter of december the presidentas rogards the urgency of your private affairs which is the reason given for your requiring leave what steps did you take to satisfy your superior officers of the facts relating to the urgent nature of those affairs tbe commanding officer of the th border regt was informed verbally that some private affairs urgently required my attention in my letter of decem ber  to the adjutant of the th border regt notification was made regarding urgent private affairs on december  a telegraphic communication was forwarded to the chief staff oficerat cork to the same effect the prisoner added that he also proceeded to cork on december  for the purpose of seeing the general or one of the staff officers to communicate personally the information which might be required to support his application in order that he should proceed on leave at once those privateaffairs were not settled yet but were if anything more urgent then in decemberthe presidentcan you bring anvthing to show that your leave was stopped on deceniber  owing to the non payment of your messbill and not on account of your etter of december  refusing to do duty the judge advocatethat is hardly a compellable questionon the advice of mir pearce the prisoner made the followinng answer to the question  there is nothing to say so tar as i am aware of but leave was granted to me after the letter of the thnamely on the th the prisoner said he should like to add that he went into cork on december  to ascertain why the general com manding at cork had cancelled his leavethis concluded the evidence and mr pearce proceeded to read the prisoners statement of defence lae pointed out that the charges wero not only serious as regards himself but that the decision of the court might affect hundreds of thousands of his majestys forces ilis cause he believed to be the cause of the whole army snd the question for the court to decide was whether an officer or soldier in this free country was bound to serve without pay as to tlhe nature of the contract which exised between the crosvn and the officers of the army the acceptance from the crown of a commission entitled the holder to full beniefts including pay of the rank to which ho was entitled an officer could not resign his commission whenever he liked as in every contract so in this thero must be mutuality there was nothing in the regulations to showv that when the full benefits includiog pay wvere withheld tho bolder of the commis sion could aelbject to serve if the holder of a coxa mission could be required to serve without paythat was to say without the ful benefita of the commission he was deprived of those benefits and the commission ot the sovereign was partly annulled or made void to the extent of the benefits annulled there was noprinciple of law which said that an offcer must serve for is life more especially without receiving the benefits and privileges conferred by the commission bie made no contract to do so ile agreed to serve for an equuvlent to withhold which was regarded in sectionof the ar my act as a crime it was obvious from the rules from the army act from the queens regulh tions from the royal warrant that if officers or soldiers were entitled to expect and to receive the various pasyments and privileges due to them according to rule of the itoyal warrantthat regimental pay should be issued monthly in advance on the lst of the monththat was not a permissive but an imperative or obligatory rule it was laid down in section  of the army act that the pay of an officer should be paid wfithout any deduction and the object of that vwas made apparent by reference to the queens regulations rule  whicz requred every officer personally to day his mess bill on or before the th of each month and by rule  it was stipulated that no officer would be allowed leave of absonce while his mess bill for the past monthlwas unpaid the object of all this was to put the officer upon a safe and proper financial basis if it were not for those vise and judicious regulations it would be impos siblo for men of comparative poverty though may be soldiers of brilliance to occupy with credit to themnsolves enid honour to thoir country the position of officers in his majestys british army though when callod upon there was no loeal difference between a militia and a regular officer there was this material differencethat the one adopted it as a complete profession whereas tho other anixious to serve his country was simply placing hinself under training to come up in case of emergency for him it might be more necessary at times to havo leave to attend to his affairs axising out of civil life so that on him the hard ship was even more clear than it would be on the regular officer wvith regard to the evidence that it was usual in the battalion for the pay to be a month in arrear tho prsoner submitted that that was a violation of the rtoyal varrant and beinm illegal could not affect the issue on the question of his being absent without leave capt scaife contended that by the governments violation of their contract be becamo a person who was not subject to military law it wvas urgently necessary for him to come to plymoutb wvith regard to the charge of defying authority he pointed out that it was open to the court to deal with him under tw o sections in one of which the word  wilful  prevailed and in the other it did not assuming but not admitting that he was wrong in sunposing hmself not to be subjct to military law he did not wilfuiy dell authoritv o pointed out that he held the dbo and his services rebutted and refuted any criminal intent all his acts were the acts of one imbued with the idea that he was acting entirely in the right would it bo right to punish him as a criminal because be was unable through illhealth both on december  and  to avail himself of the leave granted him by the memorandum of december  which leave apparently without rhyme or reason aud without any intervening communication was cancelled on the th a cancellation indicating a policy of vacillation remarkable indoed  he had arranged on receipt of the memorandum of december  to proceed to attend to his urgent business what elso could he do than that which he didproceed to cork using his utmost endeavours to secure leave which had been granted on november  cancelled through no fault of his own on december  granted apin on december  and cancolled on december  o whom could he appeal under such circumstances but to tho bigbest autority available not being able to reach that power he left a mcmorandum notiwying his intention was that the act of one who was wishful of deserting or wvas wilfully defiant the deputy judge advocate in his snuming up asked the ourt to considor what would be the effect on discipline if a soldier on a charge of refusal to obey orders in the field pleaded that his pay was  month m arrear even su osing he could establish that such non payment was due to neglect of duty by some superior of acer or to babitual neglect by tho authorities at the closo of the judge advocates address the court sat for an hour and  minutes with closed doors and then adjourned until this morning
