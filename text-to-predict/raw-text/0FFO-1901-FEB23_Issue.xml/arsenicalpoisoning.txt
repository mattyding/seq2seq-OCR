arsenioal posotmngthe royal commission on arsenical poisoning met yesterday morning at the westminster palace hotellord kelvin presided and the other members of the commission were sir nv alart dyke imp sir w s church president of tho ryal college of physioians professor t e thorpe frs government analyst mir h cosmo bonsor and dr b a whitelegge his miajestys chief inspector of factories dr g s buchanan one of the edicl iinspectors of the local government board is the secretary of the commissionthe following were the terms of reference to the commission to ascertain with respect to england and wvales the amount or recent exccptional sickness and death attributable to poisoning by arsenic  whether such exceptional sickness and death have been due to arsenic in beer or in other articles of food or drink and if so a to what extent b by what ingredients or in what manner the arsenic was conveyed and c in what way any such ingredients became arsenicated and  if it is found that exceptional sick ness and death have been due to arsenic in beer or in other articles of food or drink by what safeguards the introduction of arsenic therein can be preventeddr c h tattersall medical officer of health of the borough of salford examined said he was responsible to the local government board the witness read from a report which he had prepared there was a great rise in june  in peripheral neuritis which increased in november many it appeared were cases of alcoholio neuritis ile obtained samples from  breweries each case was visited and all the sufferers were beer drinkers maniy of them being employed at a particular brewery other cases not traceable to this brewery were also found the amount drunk varied from  to  pints a day examination showed absence from lead poisoning the analyst could find nothing physiological examination was also resorted to then they heard of dr reynoldss discovery nidprofessor delpine found traces of arsenic large quantities were discovered and sulphuric acid wvas found to contain arsenic coming from mlessrs nicholson who supplied mressrs bostock it was impossible to obtain accurate accounts as the public ivere naturally reticent amost of the cases but by no means all were among the poorer classes nine hundred and ninetysix were reported from all soiurces even those who drank very moderately suffered fronm impaired digestion in august and september there was a marked diminution bostocks sugar wvas found to be used in many of the breweries supplying the incriminatedbeer the numnber of deaths registered from alcoholio neuritis was in eight months of  no less than  there were  deaths in salford probably due to arsenical poisoning from beer and others also were in a dangerous condition there was an increase in  and  which steadily grew till juno  when it became enormous in  miessrs bostock became a limited company and pushed their business they had always used an acid made from pyritesa dangerous source cases attributed to alcoholic neuritis were often he was couvinced alsenical poison ing the earlier cases were not so marked at the end or november suggestive symptoms disclosed themselves nervous disturbancessensory and motorwere well marked gastric and intestinal troubles were not so frequent in s cases  muales and  females were aected women being more susceptible thanmen itwvas to be remembered that women obtained their beer from one source to a larger extent than men the cases were all adultsmost of them persons from  to  ln  cases he found the dates of the illness and a steady increase to the end of november wvas discovered there was clear evidence that this ouitbrealk lasted from june to i he end of november this period coincided with the supplies from bostocks after november  none of the contaminated sugar was used by a salford brewer it was difficult to get information of the amount drunk by individuals who were naturally disposed to minimize t he amount of arsenic in a weektaken even by a moderate drinker was found to be half a grain whereas even th was dangerous in some cases the amount would be as much as four grains on november  he issued a circular to all retailers that the inspectors would take specimens and that the sale of adulterated beer wvas punishable after december  no such beer was soldubsequent cases arose but they were from beer drunk before that period for arsenic was by no meansevanescent in its effect twelve thousand barrels were destroyed in salford in giving an account of brewing methods the witness said that generally some other form of sugar was used in addition to or in substitution of the malt though a great deal of beer wvas made simply from malt and hops glucose was largely used and so was iivert sugar which vas cane sugar treated with sulphuric acid in summer preservatives against the sournig of beer were much used hop substitutes nera also used but he found none in the five brewveries which he had visited in messrs bostocks  per cent of white arsenic was found in the sulphuric acid in some cases the proportion was as much as  per cent by weight the witness then referred to the tables which exhibited great variety in one case where bostocks sugar was not used th grain per gallon was foiund the usual dose of arsenic as medicine was from th to th of a grain though even with the smaller amount the dose had sometinmes produced vomiting or diarrhcna lhis showed that for some an infinitesimal dose was dangerous the witness described the mode of making glucose and other sugar materials messrs bostocks filters whether before or after tho reburning of the charcoal disclosed arsenic native sicilian suphtur was the only safe method of making sulphuric acid for food purposes but  per cent wvas unfortunately made from pyritesby dr tuonrpxit was not stated at the inquest that stone  was used as equivalent for pyrites it was used as short for brimstonehsui nal the reading of his report dr tattorsall said that in malt variable qliantities were found all the arsenic was introduced in the process of kilning when the drying wvas by anthracite coal the proportion of arsenic was least especially in double floored kilns it was desirable that anthracite coal alone should be used six samples of barley were examined and slight traces of arsenic vere found ï¿½ltventy sanmples of hops weore examined bhut the anmount of arsenic was not eiiough to injure im proper kitning or bad sulphuric acid wvas responsible tor the presence of arsenic by clinical symptoms mid poet imirtcie examinations the presence of the poison was discovered if uialt and hops alone were used there would be little danger and the proportion of arseniic could hardly be more thani th of a grain a gallon it would be unreasonable to forbid glucose or other manufactured substance as with proper precautions they ought to be safe chemical manufacturers as well as retailers should be bound to label the presence of poison in all their produiets the food and drugs acts ought to be made more stringent there onght also to be a stricter laiv as to the inotification of disease this startling and steady increase of mortality did not at the time strike any one as demanding inquiry there should also be a special investigation on an ex banstively sciontific basis of all foodstuffs but for the kindness of professor delpine this outbreak might never have been traced to its sourceby the caalrutmasthe population of salford was about since december he sent out forms to all the medical practitioners of salford for particulars of any cases of illness he also inquired of the poor laxv authorities thirtynine cases not in the previous list were discovered but the illness was found to have begun before novem ber in some cases in the summer hle had not found illnesses from confectionery or jans of which he had examined abotit ten samples bostocks sugar and glucose went to none but brewers hle explained the position to almessrs nicholson amid tho illness traced throngh bostocks sugar to their acid they said they had zde no change in the acid since january and it was only before the inquest that the truth was discovered messrs nicholsons answer was  so far as they could re momber  there had been no change in the source of supply to be just to messrs nicholson he wvould not like to siiy there was wilful reticence beers from the same brewvery w ere found to vary in many cases the qulanltity was more than onethirtysecond of a grain in a pility siit w iamt dykemiedicl men umay have been mistaken in caases of alcoholic neuritis and have failed to rcognize arsenic long before suspicion was aroused it was a oke among workpeople when a man was ill that he bad been drinking beer and many of them took toby iuit w s citurtcnuis experience was that beor was usually the source of peripheral neuritis the male drunkard wvas a greater drinilker than the woman  but the average woman drinker he believed took more than the average man blt out of  deaths  were female  male when he inquired of messrs nicholson he was told tho oflice wvas closel and the answer given to him was only one of impressionby mir bonsorin the case of beer said to be made from malt and hops alone lie relied on the brewvers statement there wvas no analysis he knew of no process of discovering glucose after fermentation all metallic poisonings were similar there was an analysis made for lead but there were no traces of lead poisoningby dr tllorirethe connexion between the amyl alcohol and peripheral neuritis was established by an in quiry at manchester large doses of ethyl alcohol wererequired hte was inclinee to think whisky produced peripheral neuritis but in manchester beer was a commoner even the prodominant causeby the chalsitaythere was no difference between peripheral and alcoholic neuritissit wv s chubmcu observed that peripheral neuritis rnight be due to other causes than alcoholby dr tehorpeaessrs nicholson admitted that they knew that the comnnon bov sulphuric acid contained arsenic bostocks had been customers of nicholsons for  years messrs nichoison said they had no know ledge of the use made of the sulphurio acid by bostockshe did not think nicholsons knew of bostocks connexion with brewing his impression was that nicholsons knew very little of bostocks he felt sure that this epidemic nvas solely traceable to this arsenic bostocks said they bad made no change in their sugar for  years brewers told ihim of the niarked falliug off in tho connanptioii of beer  some of these were using bostocks sugar the uniiversal presence of a common antecedent ii all the cases led him to attribute the alady to arsenic perfectly pure sulphuric acid might he admitted be made from pyrites but he stiggested the restriction to sicilian native sulphr because the amount of the acid used for food was sinail and it was desirablo to ensure absolute safety ouarantees aud nwatching processes had a tendencv to break down he knew tour or five invert sugr m akers but to none excentbostocks had appreciable quantities of arsenic been tracedby sib w s churchby personal examination and from the information of brewers he knew the sugar was bostocksby mr c boxsorbrewing would reduce but not eliminate the arsenicby tho chairmaanvegetabe substances sometimes took up arsenic from the soil but in iuapprociable quantitiesby dr wnhitiileggetlie beer destroyed was from breeries only anld not fronm retailers of the large amount destroyed hi publichouses he had no record li knewv of no industries whence arsenical poisoning might arise there wvas no unusual influenza which might perhaps be a predlsposing cause arsenic was he thought proved by this epiuemia to be inore of a cumrulative poisou than chemists hacd thought that would cc some extent accoulit for the slighter character of the earlier cases duties were imposed on him under the food and drugs act to take samples  lie could not exactly define his duties there was inspection of beer until  but it was found so uniformlly purewith the exception of a little wvater now and thenthat the inspections and analyses wvere dropped prosecutions were impending over retailers it wvas only wvith the retailers that he hat relations except wvhere the retailer had a guarantee he could not go against the wvholesale dealer lit would be a good thing if an accused person had the opportunity of chlalleiing an analysis there ought to be more stringent rules aainst both wvholesale and retail chemists under the sale ot food and drugs act in his opinion no beer should contain more than th grain of arsenic per gallon his ideal was a universal notification of all disease  but there should certainly be so of all pauper patientsby sir w har dyfietho public health and the sale of food and drugs acts wvere the only sources of his statutory poiwrs ife could only demand to examiine a brewery in case of strong suspicionby proffssor tiiotepf and dr wsiiltleggein a case of ravesuspicion he believed he could under the public liealth act enter a factory and order the destruc tion of adulterated food or drinkby the chiirmaaxthe public analyst he thought was only an outside servant of the corporation in his opinion the food and drugs acts should give greater power to analysts and prescribe a scale of fees according to the difficulty of each analysisprofessor tsiorpe referred to the act of  as giving larger powersby the uhairtanthe seller of a deleterious article ought to be punished whether he knows of the adultera tion or notthe ciiairsiax thanked dr tattersall for his valuable evidence and expressions of opiniondr ernest s reynolds assistant physician to the man chester royal infirmary and visiting medical officer to the mlanchesterworkhouse infirmarywas the next witness the symptoms of alcholic paralysis were sensory followed by motor disturbances there were also mnental symptoms the sensory symptoms wvere twitchings bumings and a peculiar and rarelyfound teiiderliess the latter symptom lie thought was only found in alcoholic paralysis and arsenical poisoning and in tropical disease the motor symptonis were a loss of power producing an eccentric gait paralysis of the hands and also of the diaphragmroducing difficulty of breathing also dilatation of the ueart anddropsy loss of memory of tinie and place were also commonly found at the royal infirmary the average of these alcoholic paralysis cases from  to  was  a yearby the ciiairmahe thought these cses were commonor in manchester than elsewvhere except perhaps liverpoolcontinuing the wiitness said that the syniptoms of arsenical poisoning were vomiting running of the head and nose rashes headache  also herpes or shingles later developments were certain chronic sain affections and profuse swveatings there were gieat resemblances between alcoholic paralysis and this poisoning but the pigmentatioii of the skin was found in the poisonin but niot the paralysis for four months no one had suspected from the sensory and motor symptoms anything hut alcoholic paralysis though there had been many observersby the ciiairitnanit was hard to say whether alcoholic paralysis socalled was ever due to anything else than alcohol the old idea was that it was due to spirit drinking but in  ho came also across a pure beer drinker who had alcoholic neuritis he never found a pure spirit drinker who had neuritis though he had known a lady who dranl a bottle aiid a half of whisky a day and others given to like excess these did not suffer from alcoholic neuritis thero was little alcoholic neuritis at edinburgh glasgow and belfast this made him doubt whether the alcohol wvas the cause the witness then read a letter from sir william gearv confirming his view but lie had no doubt that alcoholic neuritis was sometimes caused by spirit drinking last sumsmer there was a startling increase in the cases of vhat seemed to be alcoholic nieuritis and of shingles the presence of herpes ledhim to suspect arsenicas all the patients wvore beer drinlers arsenio was the only known drug which produced shingles testing the beer in november he found arsenious crystals dr dixon also obtained crystals of arsenious oxide in s there was a singular epidemic in paris called aerodynia which wasnot discovered to be arsenical later a similar epidemic broke out at hycres which was traced to arsenic in the wine there was another case in  at havre and this was homicidal in cbaracter rie resemblances between all these instances wvere very remarkable and be had no doubt they were all arsenicalby the chairuanhis first observations last year were in june the mastimunu of cases was reached in november there were great differences in individuals  and one would be scarcely affected by a quantity which was dangerous or fatal to othersthe scales on the soles of the feet and other minor symptoms might at an earlier date have distinguished alcoholicparalysis from arsenicalparalysis it was thought at one tinie that arsenic was rapidly elinsinated  but it had been showvn that it was stored up in the body and even in the bones it was talken out of solution especially in the liverby tho cjiairmansince the beginning of october at the crumpsall infirmary he had had  patients  males  females at the lroval infirmary he had seen  cases of whom i were wonvien the women suffered more than the men the women were often deterred from going to the inflrmary when the cause of the illness was discovered ihe mortality was six times as great in women as in men some of these patients had not taken more than a pint and a half of beer a dayby sir nw s csiurchtho terns alcoholic neuritis he thought wvas first used in mianchester about  his opinion that it was more prevalent ii lllan chester than in london vas based on i conversations with londoii physicians his doubt as to the alcoholic origin of the disease was founded on sir william gearys letter in some of the cases before  the peculiar svmptoms of arsenical poisoning wvere disceriied  but in these cases there was sio pigmientatioi his reason for thinking arsenic was cumulative was its proneness to seize on the tissues the nails and bones this had also been supported by cases in which arsenio vas given as an ordinary drug taere were more slight cases anioig the men than amonthe womnen but he was inclined to think the real total of the women was greater thiui that of the menby dr wriutleggealcohol he thought pre disposed people to arsenical poisoniug laity of the patients were in good health arsenic stored in nails andhair was priicticelly elimiastd as it did not come back into the system he kneiv of no experiments with living animals to throw light on the question he attached no importance to influenza as during the last four moonths there had been less influenza at crumpsall than for ten years there was comparatively little peripheral neuritis in the richer classesthe inquiry was then adjourned
