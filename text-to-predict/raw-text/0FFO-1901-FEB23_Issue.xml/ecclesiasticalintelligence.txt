proceedings closed with a cordial vote of thanks to lord and lady wimbornekellys  clergy list  is deservedly known as a convenient and trustworthy reference book at a moderate price its information is sufficiently recent to include the name of the new preacher at grays inn and the formation of the bishops college at ripon its supple mentary matter is especially useful such as the list of masters in holy orders in the various schools and colleges and the list of foreign chaplaincies which has overlooked a not very recent change at anitwerp there is some im provement in the colonial information but the directory should realize the importance to the colonial bishops of having the names of their commissaries in england given correctly thus the bishop of bombay is credited with a commissary whose address is trinity college oxford but who will hardly recognize himself as the  rev f nurse another useful item which wants attention is the information about the church societies both the secretaries of the bible society are incorrect the treasurer of queen annes bounty here given has been dead for some months and the alleged treasurer of the clergy widows society resigned more than a year ago these are howover small blemishes in a service able workthe following letter has been addressed to the dean of manchester under date of february  dear mdr deanat the request of a large number of parishioners who bave complained to us of the processional image of the cross which was carried and repeatedly elevated at the cathedral upon the occasion of the memorial service of our late beloved queen on the nd inst we bave consulted an authority upon ecclesias tical law and are advised that it was an illegal act we therefore feel it our duty to inform you of the fact and also to say that we have the testimony of many who sere opresent that the proceedings referred to were very pain ful tothem and caused them such indignation that it was wellnigh impossible for them to rememuber the solemn purpose for which they had come together as churchwardens wo cannot but think that to show such an utter disregard to the feelings of both churchmen and nonconformists who were present by invitation from you upon that solemn occssion was nothing less than a scandal and a gross insult the cathedral and parish church of mlanchester is a building for worship accord ing to  the true protestant religion established by law and it is needless to say that those who responded to your invitation naturally expected that nothing of anillegal or contentious character could possiby be intro duced the processional imnzge of the cross was there fore an unnecessary an unwarrantable and cowardly in troduction of wvhat savours strongly of idolatry at a timeo and under circumstances that wvould preclude any demonstration againt it but we beg to say that as we believe that no good reason can be assigned for such a departure from the custom of three centuries in our parish church and seeing that there is not even a sugges tion of such a thing in the book of commo praaer that images are so strongly condemned by the word of god also that the homilies of the church of england declare an image and an idol to be ono and the same thing and seeing that such are opposed to the common sense of the laity we shall be in duity bound to prevent such a breach of good faith in the future therefore beg to inform you that should the image referred to be again brought into the parish church we shall feel compelled in fulfilment of the obligations of our office to publicly protest against it and to use our authority as church wardens to prevent such atransgression of the law unless you give us reasonable notice beforehand of the authority if any upon which you do it and if any unpleasant con cequences result the blame will be entirely your owvn it is also our duty to point out to you that the words miay eternal light shine upon her god save the queen witwhich you concluded your discourse to the young people of the grammar and high schools at the memorial service on the st inst appeared to us to be a praver for the dead which were it so would be so thoroughly out of harnony vvith the beautiful words of our burial service which describe those who depart hence in the lord as in joy and felicity therefore needing no prayers that w e venture to ask for your assurance that no such thing as a prayer for the dead w as intended by vouue are yours faithfully n msauowcstorr flesav r price tsios ilay ward churchv ardensat the general chapter of the english benedictines

northern provinee resumed its sittings yesterday at york minster the members having first attended service in the eboir when the sermon was preached by the bishop of durhamat the joint meeting of both houses the president the archbishop of york said they might expect a few words from him noting the remarkable circumstances under which they met they were on the brink of a new century and at the beginning of a new reign the wonder ful woman who had secured for herself not only the affection of a vast empire but the honour of almost the whole world had gone from them but they i might regard this great sorrow as only a blessing in disguise and let it pass awvay not into forgetfulness but into a blessed memory and while this sorrow was allowed to pass away into the splendour of a more beautiful light they had to enter upon this new reign full of courage of faith and hope the ling needed their most earnest prayers  his position was one of tremendous difficulty the subject he asked them to discuss was church reform that was a large work and an ominous work let them remember first of all that there could be no reform of the faith that had been once for all delivered to christs church but there might be a reform of those human organizations by which the work of the church was carried on the immediate reform in all their minds at the present time was the reform of convocation itsolf and the request they were about to make to the powers that be for liberty to make that reform from within the second point was that of the constitution of the house of laymen by which they hoped to take counsel with men who would be recognized by the whole church and the nation as fitted to express the national mind and feeling in matters connected with the outward welfare of the church for that day he thought the first of these subjects would be sufficient to occupy them it was very desirable that they should have the opinion of convoca tion on that question there was no fear that to use the language of the world the votes of the unbeneficed clergy might  swamp  the others or that young enthusiasm would displace calmer wisdom there was a means of escape from this difficulty altogether and that was by not iving votes in the same election as that in which tho oneficed clergy took part but by allowing them to havo representatives of their owvn in the different dioceses according to their numbers the question of the constitution of the house of laymen might fairly wait for a little hear hear there was a great deal to he said on the subject end he had only sigmofed his general opinion on the proposals now before the church they thought if they discussed the matter in their may meeting they would not have lost any time hear hearthe hiouses afterwards sat

usecby one speasernamely tfhat they should give the laity powerf or he thougnt it revealed the subconscious belief that it lay in the clergy to give to the laity what really was their inherent right further he would observe that as church legislation con eenedothe wellbeing of the commonwealth parliament would never eonsent to forgo its right to discuss such legislation he would accordingly weleome the establish ment of a grand committee for dealing with church affairs pari amenth adrnot the time end energy to deal with church affairs f they had an authoritative body a neatman of the differences which now existed would sappear but convocation containing no lay element was not a fit body to settle the constitution of the new body the only dpt body was the laity themselves or as he preferred to put it the whole churchafcterw acon watvins considered that they ought to have the opinion of the laymen on the proposals he moved an amendment approving of the participation of the laity in church affairs and requesting the president to commend the working out of the problem to the hiouse of laymenthe bishop of hiuna moved en amendment approving of the removal by legislation of doubts as regards the power of convocation to reform their constitution and emend the representation of the clergy end heartily approving of the provision for constituting hiouses of laymen and empow ering
