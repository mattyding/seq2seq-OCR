dealing with the causes to which the disorderly and ruffianly conduct among the juvenile population of london was traced by competent judges and referring to some of the principal organizations already at work to rescue this particular class of boys and girls frons the debasing influence of their surroundings continued as follows  the combined experience of workers in these various fields who have lately been gathered together in conference on the subject points clearly to the necessity of enlisting public support in the promotion and development of all such worlk as is described above with a view in the first place to strengthen the existing organization s to attract more workers to their assistance to mako them more efficient and to lighten their financial difficuiltiesin the next place to encourage the formation of clubs evening schools or companies in con nexion with the various brigades where the need for them is shown to exist and to cooperato with any other agencies or associations in obtaining playiug fields for cricket c and in providing for tho combined nceds of the clubs of any district bv the establishnment of a common gymnasium or the like there is in particular great need for the extension of club accoimmodation by existing organizations for the benefit of those lads within the area of their work whoso admission to the existing clubs is objected to by their present members the report concluded by emphasizing the two great needs which were being felt by the wvorkers in this cause throughout londonnamely personal service and funds for the furtherance of the above objectsmtlr dictsinson chairmaan of the conference thon moved the adoptiols of the report he explained that he was not the originator of the schenie sow presented the bishop of stepney whose absence they all the more regretted because of its causeillhealthsir henry biurdett and many others including the late bishop of london who had taken a great interest in the question of the social condition of the poorer people of the metropolis called a conference and discussed amon themselves the evil and the remedies for that evil ana it was not until tho scheme had assumed a certain shape that he was invited as chairman of the london county council to becomeidentifled with it what was the evil which they were considering  it had unfortunately for want of a better name been termed  hooliganismhooliganism  wcas not an evil itself but a sign of it it was a symptom of that which it was hoped this meet ing might do something to rectify it was a sign of something wrong in the social condition of the masses of the people in our great towns and he thought that no one could watch the rapid growfth of town life especially in our enormous metropolis without seeing that tlsere were real dangers attending the neglect of the social conditionis of the vast masses of the population apart from the question of selfpreservation there was a higher object we desired to see our nation sober healthy strong and industrious and yet we allowed many of our boys and girls to grow up in a con dition which renderod it almost inmpossible for them to become so there was an immense need for means of relaxation and education of a general character for these poor young psople it had already been met to sonse extent but not to a sufficient extent in the metropolis parishes representing only  of the popu lation wvere provided with clubs and other similar institu tions for the young and the remaining  were practically vithout anything of the sort there was no idea of putting forward an heroic remedy they wanted to work with the existing agencies and ho believed that if they could coordinate the system now in operation here and there it would be possible to do a great deal of good as to funds it was proposed at present to limit their appeal to betvween � and �oo which would enable them to carry out their investigation and get together their organization he hoped that when the autumn cause if they wvere furnished avith the money now askced for it would be possible to put before the public a defissite proposal which would meet with the support of all parties they had called their league the twentieth century league they were thankful for the immense amount of work dono by voluntary agencies in the th century and they wanted the th century to recognize that work and place it on a permanent basistlhe bishop of kensington in seconding the resolu tion said that he had been requested by the bishop of stepney to say that the fund which it was hoped to raise should be devoted not to the inauguration of ismuv institu tions but at any rate at tho outsot to the maintenauce and strengthening of those already in existence llear hear the bishop of stepney also wished him to lay stress on this that the institutions which should receive particular spoort wnere those established for rough lads mn rough workingclass localities speaking for hsmself he thought that the movement shoul be interdenomina tional in characterin other words that the tmd should he raised fot a common object and then distributed among central bodies connected

supported the resolution said that he thought the word hooliganism was more of a danger than a safeguard to london ile believed thait the press would do an immense service if they would omit that wvord from the newspapers and substitute for it what it was in realitystreet rulilanism weo did not want to thronv a glansour over this class of disorder and the sooner the word was abolished and the hero tvpe of street ruffian was got rid of the sooner it would bo possible to grapple wvith the evil effectually the reason why the conterence had not dealt with hooligans in the report vas because they belonged to the police lhey had passed beyond the stage when they could be influenced or ood to a sufficient extent the aim of this league wonod bo to get hold of boys and girls on leaving school and provide them with means for adequate exercise and rational amusement under proper conditions about  clubs were required to supplement the agencies already in existence they asked tor � at present
