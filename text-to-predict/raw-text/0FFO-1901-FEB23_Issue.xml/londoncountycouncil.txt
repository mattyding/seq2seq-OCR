joint comnnittee of tho london municipal society and the motropolitan division of the national union of consorvative associations was held last eveningt at st martins townhall charing crossroad in en prt of the snuniciped policy of tee conservative cantldatee for the london county council lord faresihar presided and those present included lord goorgo hamilton hip tho earl of leinnoul captnin mjn xpxr j  flewnt mtp sir ueorrfardell mip mr ih p hartrl dcairman of the con servative partyon the london county council sir m r bhovsggree mp lf antrobus mr ialine ir emden olonel clrord probn and hrr j g hay halkett seoretary of the municial societythe c atwan said that the bogey of the nonparty character of their opponents hadt ben dispelled by the somewhat heated blessing bestowed on their opponents by the leadin whips and wirepullers of the tadical party at st ames shall cheers it was fair to olaim for the conservative party of london the term con structive for it was to that party that the existence of the london county council and the borough councils was due as well as the franchise assimilation bill  end he could only urge upon the eleotors of london the importance of returning to the council next week those who were identified with that policy for it must be considered most inportant to london that there should be complete harmony between tho local bodies london parliamentary representatives were almost entirely con servative e borough councils contained a large con servative majority and it remained in the power of the conservatives of london to make the necessary change in the representation on the council hle was anxrious to impress upon them how strongly he was opposed to the regulations that had ust been issued by the water com panies hea hear thoy all knew very well that the poloy of the conservative party in london had been in avour of the purchaso of the water companies an authority being created for that purpose  and the president of the looal government board had said that it was his intention sooner or later to introduce a bill for that purpose therefore there could be no doubt that the conservative party in london were in favour of the purchase of the water companies but these regulationsad nothing whatever to do with the conservative party they had no more to do with the conservatives than with their opponents he wisbed to use the most uncom promising language and to say that he absolutelynounced them and he ditl not see that there was the slightest chance of their ever becoming law cheerslord george hamilton mp moved  that this meeting is of opinion that the large powers possessed by the london county coumcil for improving the dwellings of the working classes should be exercised with greater energy and more regard to the interests of the poorer members of the community than in the past ad the meeting further believes that it is only by the sensible policy of frlendly cooperation on the part of the london county council with the govermnent and the borough councils that the harmonious working of the whole system of london government can be promoted and the settlement of pressing london questions can be secured that this meeting accordingly calls upon all electors who desire continuous progress on sound lines to vote for the conservative candi dates wvho are pledged to support this policy as the chairman had said they were fighting to a certain extent this contest on party linesthat wvas to say the political element was not excluded  and however desir able it might seem to certain persons in the district that these municipal elections should be fought upon another basis his own experience extending over many years of political work was that it was practically impossible to eliminate them in the orst place it was the only means by which they had a recognized organization which could select the best and eliminate the worst candidates there were a very considerable number of persons admirably qualified to come forward and do good work on municipal councils but who had not tho time for the initiation and creation of an organization by which their retuuin could be secured but though the political element wvas and would bo introduced into the contest they wished to do nothing in any sense unfair or mi any way to give expres sion to views or ideas which would in any degree un necessarily introduce party politics or in any way damage imperial interests outside at the recent meeting of their opponents at st jamesshall he noticed that one of the speakers said the conservatives were flghting under a dirty khaki rag the language seemed to him to be unfortumate and that any one should have used it was to be regretted especially when tho person who gave utter ance to those sentimeuts wasan exminister of the crown hear hear at the last general election as lord tweed mouth must recall the one object of his political party was to try and get inside that uniform which he now denounced as a dirty khaki rag  and it was only because a considerable number of gentlemen who had not previously aualidled themselves for that uniform at the last momentonned it that his political party was saved from anniblla tion he deprecated language of that kind because when an exminister of the crown made use of it what effect must it have on other countries or in south africa  they had in the house of commons been compelled to listen to statements which they knew when circulated in south africa impeded the settlement of the question there and largely increased the onerous wvork imposed on our troopslet them while working on political lines carefully avoid doing anything of a similar character and let them cousider what on municipal grounds wore the special claims of the unionist party to the confidence of the metropolitan electorsthte unionist party amn tes housing problemthe conservative party wero frequently taunted by their political oppononts with taking little interest in social and domestic questions prominent members of the progressive party claimed the confidence of london on the ground that they had well administered beneficent acts which had been placed in their hands for the benefit of london by the legislature he asked them to consider which was the political party that had passed these beneficontacts take first the mostimportant municipal question which could attractany ones attention overcrowding and the housing of the working classes during the last  years the conservative party had beon in office  years and the xadical partyha beeninoflicea similar time every single measure affecting tbh housing of the working classes had been either passod on tbe initiation or with the support of tho conservative govern ment and not a single act bad ever been put upon thestatutebook by their radical opponents hear bear the resuit of giving a majority in the house of commons to the unionist party had been that on that most important municipal question they had made the best use of their opportunities wvhat use had the progressive party wbo had been continuously in a majority in the london county council made of the powers which parliament had placed in their hands  tho upshot of their attempts to modify and improve this difficult question of overcrowding was that they had contrived at considerable cost to the ratepayers to unhouse many more people than ever they contrived to house hear hear he looked upon this question of housing as an iinperial questicn of the ntmost importance lh burden of empire was increasing there was a constant migra tion going on from the country to the town and he thought the one great danger shead to this country was that there might result from that a deterioration in the physique and stamina of the english race hiear hear nhe gentlemen who had had control of the affairs of the london county council apparontly had declined to make use of the powera contained in part s of the last housing act unless they could at the same time achieve some financial f ad of their own a prominent progressive leader some time ago stated that they lid not intend to take up the housing question in earnest until thoy could put a tax upun ground values and ground rents what sent up house rent in london was that the demand for houses was in excess of the supply it was practically impossible no matter however ingenious the proposal might be ever to et hold of such a division of the rates as that thoy would bo able to tax that part of the property of a housenamely the ground upon which the house was builtin such a way that the incroased tax they put upon it would not ultimately fau back upon the occupier in the meantime what happened  these schemes of improvement had been delayed and the price of the property which would have to be acquired had largely gone up so that the first result of unnecessarily nursing an impracticable fad was that the council had not been able to give effeot to the beneficent intentions of the legislature coming to the industrial life of the metropolis he said that factory acts and measures of a similar kind which tho council had to administer had without exception been put upon the statutebook by the conservative party herefore the inference they might fairly dra v was that in the house of commons where they bad had a majority they had succeeded in their legislation and on the other hand the progressive party in tbe county council where the had a majority had failed in the administration of those acts the best thing therefore that london could do would be to apply the same experiment in the county council which tbey kmew had been so beneficial when applied to parliament cheers ileferring to the question of commercial and technical education he expressed rogret that the large fund placed at the disposal of the county council for that purpose had not been properly applied broadly speaking the part of the councils administration which had succeeded was that which had receivod the support of the mioderate partythe water supplyalluding to the proposals of the london water companies to impose fresh regulations in regard to fittings upon the consumers he said that if the water companies were not in existence it would not nave been possible for them to issue rogulations hoow came it to pass that the water companies wero in existence and tbat their property was notlong ago acquired by the ratepayers of london  wonty years ago lord beaconsfield brought forward a proposall for the purpose of acquiring thewhole of the property of the water companies that proposition was made just before a general election thore was a little manuipulation on the stock excanngeand the stocls of the various water companiesi ran up high their political ojpffonents took the utmost advantafge of thisincident without investigation they proceeded to de nounce the polioy which the conservatives put forward and when at the general election that p arty was defeated sir nvilliamn harcourt who was home ecretary proceeded to exercise all his powers and skill for the purpose of destroying the scheme not only were the proposals of lord beaconsfields government rejeoted but nothing was substituted in their place every man who looked back to tho proposals wvhich lord beacons fields government then made knew that if they had been accepted millions of pounds wvould have been saved to the ratepayersof londonandthe londonwatercompeniis powers end property would long ago have passed under the oontrol of the ratopayors of london cheers he had always been of opinion that the water supply of a great town should be in the hands of a public trust but notwithstanding the rejection of the conservative pro posals of  years ago he would undertako to say that if the progressivo majority had been in a reasonable framo of mind in the proposals which they made on behalf of the london county council years ago we should have achieved the purchase of the water companies while every reasonable man who had looked into the question had como to the conclusion that it would be advisable that the water companies property should bo acquired on the part of the public they all agreed that there was no reason why the sbare holders in those companies should be robbed hear hear some three years ago mr chamberlain made suggstions in the house of commons which if we tedwo d bave settled the whole question all he aske w an acceptance of the proposals of the royal commissionand reasonable methods of asssin the value oltho property to be acquired vnfotunately the p oposirafn wa put on one side and the proressves mow complaining of the proposed regula tions had only to thank themselves with regard to ldr sidney webbs assertion that the acceptance or rejection of the proposad regulations dependued on the future composition of the london county council he said that llr walter long exercising a judicial function i must adjudicate on tho reolations according to the facts and merits of the case trought before him if it were true that the administration and decisions of persons in authority who belonged to thei progressive pt ere regulate by the considerations referred to by l rit seemed to him a most connclusive reason why they should taohe good care to have a unlionist majority on the london oounty council cheers le hoped that all the candidates present woud be uiccessful if so they would be embarking on a sphere of work o the utmost interest they would have to deal with social and residential problems of great manitude and of great complexity questions of this u ipnd wear nowhere preseted in so interesting a way as in connesion with the metropolis of the empire and those who w successful and were returned to the londoin countv counol would work for a people who wore woa working for cheersmr htaunrts in seconding the motion alluded to the qestion of the proposed water rue lation s and said that the conservative parton the bon dunty council had fought against t onse regulations had spoken in wpaspetior to them and were pledged to resist them wsth regard to the housing acts he asked whether their administration was to be left in the hands of a party which had brought to hear upon that administration neither energy nor success or in the hands of the con ervative party who had proved their genuine interest on the subjectwhere they had had the powernamely in parliament that the radical orty had failed was scarcely denied even by themeenve a idgmaent had practically gone by default if a radical majority was returned to the county council the conflict with the government on the water question would continue and the settlement of the question would be delayed if on the
