the indian tea industryfrom our corresponditcalcutta feb every one eoncerned in the tea industry is deeply interested in the report of the select com mittee of the viceroys legislative council which today presented its report on the bills dealing with the assam labour question i should explain that coolies for the tea gardens are recriited in chota nagpur principally under a law which makes penal any breach of contract the government in the present bill originally proposed to raise the rate of nvages one rupee monthly but a compromise was effected by the select committee under which an increase of half a rupee is to be given in tlhe second and third years wvhile labourers incapable of full tasks vill be given foll pay for the first six months and then an indenture for half tasks these modified proposals have been strenuously opposed by the proprietors of gardens while they are considered by mr cotton chief commissioner of assam as inadequate to meet the case of the labourors the report is signed by mir rivaz mr raleigh mr cotton and mr bolton oflicial members and mr buclinghamj sir allan arthur and mr robert henderson nloeofflcial miembers the last three record minutes of dissent as regards the raising of wages urging that the necessity of an enhancemaent has not been substantiatedmr buckingham says that the evidence placed before the select committen clearly showvs that the coolies are in a better financial position than they have ever been it is further demonstrated that the wages earned arc considerably in excess of the actual requirements of labourers the necessaries of life generally being cheaper than at any period during the last  years or more wages in assam are generally higher than in the tea districts of bengal where coolies emigrate under a free system the tea industry is not in a position to bear an additional tax as proposed enhancement will assuredly mean a general rise in wages throughout the provincesir allan arthur writes that the increase is not justifled under normal conditions but to press for it at the present time when the inclustry is admittedly face to face with a crisis seems inconsiderate and unwise not only in the interests of the garden proprietor hut in that of the labouring classes the effect of an increase of wages will only be to nake it more difficult for the planter to give employment to the labourer a serious consideration when it is remembered that only a year ago the viceroy was pleading for millions in india who were starvingmlr henderson writes that the wages earned are sufficient to permit labourers to live in a thoroughly comfortable manner on the other hand in the present critical state of the industry the proposed increase would prove ruinous and would result in the closure of many estates thus ultimately affecting in a most injurious manner the position and prospects not only of the whole labouring population onithe tea estates for whose benefit the rise in wages is intended but also of those many others whose prosperity is dependent on that of the tea industrvmr cotton in a note appended to the report says be is glad to identify himself with the report of the select conimittee he is unable to concur however in the recommendation of the committee to abandon the original clauses under which a mtinimum wage was to be fixed at six rulpees monthly in the case of a man and at five rupees in the case of a woman during the whole of their contract he states that there has occurred a gradual general rise of wages in assam as well as in other parts of india in which the tea garden coolies have not participated this general rise in assamn amounts to an average during the past  years of  per cent the present average rate of wages paidt for unskilled labour in assam is more than double that of the minimntm wage prescribed by the act under which coolics enter into contracts the miinimum rate prescribed by the present law is insufficient because it is little more than a coolie is able to carn at his own doors without emigration but it is far less than he can earn in the neighbouring coal mines or in calcutta or in the tea gardens in the duars where he practically gets all the advantages given in assam wvithout the disadvantage of the penal contract for a term of years a coolie wlho expected to be sure of five rupees a month in assam an ascriptus glebm is able to earn six to ten rupees molnthly in service as a free man nearer his home the riiiininzto rate has alvays been insufieient to procure suitable labotur for the assam tea distriets this led to the buying and selling of labour which was a regularly established business elmployers now paid for every labourer recrmited under the penal contract  to  rupees whereas  years ago they paid for the same class of coolie  or  rmpees this difference of so rupees repre sented the increased cost now incurred by the tea industry in procuring labour the total annual loss incurred on account of their buying and selling transactions whichh vere so objection lable on other grounds wvas not less than llakihs of rupeesmr cotton argues that the insufficiency of wages leads to the importation of a bad even the worst class of labour and is one of the principal causes of the excessive mortality among contract labourers vhieh during the past  years avoraged   per thousand he had found that in certain cases the wvages paid to labourers wer insuncient to minatain them in a healthv condition it was not an uncommon experience for inspectors under the act to report regarding gardens where coolies had an underfed anvemie appearance where the deathrate was high often in spite of good sanitary arrangements and desertions were numerous indicating discontent among labour in his opinion the chief cause of this unsatisfactory state of things was the in sufficiency of wages he denied altogether that the increase proposed would have tho result of putting employers to such additional expense as would deal a dangerous blow to the industry there was no reason wlly with a suitable adjust ment of tasks the increase of wages should in volve increased expenditure in the majority of gardens where the coolies were well treated and contented some inconvenience no doubt would be caused by the general alteration of task rates but there was no reason to suppose that it would be seriousthe report will be discussed at the viceroys council on march latzra meeting was held today to consider the assam bills a number of planters were pre sent mr begg president of the tea associa tion presiding telegrams protesting against the proposed increase of wages were received from  districts of assamresolutions were passed stating that the meet ing viewed with consternation and alarm the probability of an immediate increase in the duty on tea imported into the united kingdom as the duty at present levied represents a tax on so per cent of the market values which already threatens to imperil the existence of the indian tea industry it was resolved that a representa tion on the subject shoukl be made to the viceroy with a request that his excellency would telegraph the same to the secretary of state il order that it might lie considered by the cabinet before the budget wvas presented to parliamenta second resolation was passed protestidg against the proposed increase in the nwages of coolies as the necessity for sucil has not arisen while the industry is unable to bear any addi tional burdenby lidoburopean tclgraph
