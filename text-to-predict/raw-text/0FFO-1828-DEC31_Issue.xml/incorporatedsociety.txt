ithe increasing support which the incorporated society is daily receiving will exert themselves to the utmost of theirwer in promoting its imnportant designs the reverend gentleman stated that on reference to the documents an hexed to the printed reports it vill ito found that the society is receiving increased support one of these docttments contains an clahtornte aceone of the exertions of the society ducing the last  years and kives a statement of its receipts md anndal disbursements in the first of those years  thereceiptsamountedonly to aboutflarising partly irom stock and advanaes by goverament which surm how ever it appeared had annually increased and in lo the ineome of the society amounted to iimtul rom tnese state tnents it appeared that in  although the society had been steadily carrying on its exertions for upwards of a cen lery the annual subscriptions were only about  which lhowever hlad gradually increased and lnow amounted to  tafsi which fact afforded the best testimony of the increas vd and increasing zeal of the people of england let us next corsider fr what design this soclety was established its ob jects are to promulgate the gospel to carrv blessings to is tant rcgions and convev to those nations who are in darkness the livtht and glory of the kingdom of heaven the society thtrds the most important benefits to those individuals who are annually leaving this nationome from mercantile anct other occupationi and some emigrating in conscquence of a overwhelming population itt certain dstricts or other local causes it fofrows these to distant

dons have been raised againrt the society on the zround that its exertions are not of a sufficiently missionary character it is true that by the charter of king william iii it is said to be established for the support of an orthodox ministry in the colonies but such never were its sole objects in proof of which we mtay refer to the annual reports turn to the east and we there read of mrssionaries assembling on the moun tuins the stirrounalng iviliabitants who collect around them with sstonishing devotion and afford ample scope for the in teresting details which are given if we look to the west we aind the sme undertakings but conducted on more advanced trges wve there have descriptions of the bishops visitingit cergr contirming the young consecrating churches founding schools suiperintending colleges and setting on foot in various departments similar institutions to those vhich stave placed our own countrv in that distinguisiting station which she so preeminently enjoys above other nations these facts afford sufficient grounds ltor encouragement let it next lhe asked whether the support wwhich the fociety receives is sfual tos its meansgwhether there isa wuperabundantsupply t is to be regretted that tbere is not  n reterence to tne o cuments before alluded to it will be found that  vears ago the number of missionaries employed was  there are now about  the same is the case with the churches the number of schoolmasters and catechlists has increased in an ndequate proportion and these form one of the most import ant portions of toae societys operations lyere no clurcbes bave vet been erected these individuats asemble the people tozether to join with them in the admirable deeoeions of ourliturgy and read and explain to them those homiliem and oound evcarelical publications which are sent out for that very pnurpose is then our support sufficicnt for these under takings the most sirnple answer to this question is by re ference to the expenditute and we there find the expenditure for the last year has been  which forms an cxcets of nearly o above the teeepts within the same period the wtsl expenciture of the society above its ordinary receipts dtrlng the last ceiet years is about  this is a proof f tfie anxious demand and pressing need fbr those spiritual edlvtntages which it is the object of the society to convey in i his mlajestv issued his royal letter for collections in evey parish toroughout the kingdom in aid of the funds of ejodiety and in pursuance of which collecttons were made ehe reult of which was ninsr gratifying the subscriptions ameunting to the sum of  it was principally from that fund that the society was enabled to extend its operations an the east and at the same timo to apply the greater por tion of its regular funds in the mvest it is to be hoped that as nine years have now elapsed since that letter was is sued hlis llajesty will be graciously pleased to repeat the same but whether or not the society will proceed in its operations to the utmost of its power at the begin oivg of the last  years there was not one diocess or dis arictcommittee at the present time they nmount to  in

he observed hat from the stads atd avocstions which many then present had parsued they were dedicated to the altar and that gospel which it was the objett of tbe society to torward and there fore knowing the inestimable advantages which it possesseditoaught to be their wish and endeavour to convey tnose bless ings to all nations but he trusted also that the societv woult receivc support from the junior rmembers of the university nany of whom received liberal allowrvncea from their friends oind it could tpot be too much to expect that they would be stov sonie support tn such an institution as the present the rev doctor in the course of his speech paid a tribu te of re apect to the memory of the late archbishop of can terbury one tof the nost zealous supporterg of the incorporated society otnd coclawled a long and able address of which our limits counfne us to a brief outline by reading the resolutionthe rev protessor lee seconded the resolution obserr ing that to him it appeared the society grew much faster in labour and in love thani in support it had erected and esta blished chuarches which were morniunents that would prove the oclety had not boon formed ini vain and iu ture genera twsrs would have to record wlhat it had acconmplislied the rev gentleman said he had received translations of the first four books ot the pedtateuch in the pcrian language and fotnd that great tare had been taken in their compilation and although thev could not be said to be absolutely perfect they vee well go up and would stand tbe test of critzeal observa tion tbe desgs of the society are the fpytherance of the iospel and when he read the commands of our saviour he could xtot bait feel that we oughit to do all in our power to eup portsuc an estabiblinmnt it is not for us to liestillwhilit so mosny are id ignorane and darkness and whilst we have it in our power to render assistance itt a nation likc tlf it appearsdifficult to think what excusc can be raised for not strenuoeagly supporting this rcciety it is our duty so to do aind as christians ant as men we ouzht not to elate to flinch from the discharge of it in this diocess ihe hesitated not to nay that four persons out of five did not contribute one far tthinzand lie therefore thought the society wtas notsufficicntly known this is n cause in which we are bound to exert ouselvs and in which we arc called upon to do our duty and rthal have to answer to god for the neglect of it it is ex presly commanded to go ouit and preach the gospel to all dations and we have the assurance ot his beloaed son that li

and to bc employed in this good work but there is another whom i must not omit to r aitemir thomason whose labours are ituly astonishing he revised and improved martyns persian translation hehas improved to a great extent the arabig version of the bible and he is engaged in tranmlating the old testament into hindoostanee he was constrained by the illncss of his wite to come over to his natise country and hating been deprived of her he accepted a chapel at chelten ham and an handsome pension of above  a year from the east india conpanv whom he had served for  years but he found he could not proceed with his translation here and he was not happy whilet any thing he could do tor india was neglected and therefore he threvr up his pension and his churchi and is gone back to calcutta it is probable that at this very hiour he is irn iing therein orderto complete tne work he has begun snow i say again my lord thcse are the men to be sought out and sent forth as agents of thc society and if the superfor officers in the esdcety and the difirent committees breathe the same spirit we can not dosbt hut that we shall reccive a divine blessing upon our labours only let the commanders of our

will rise to the occasion and the laitv will catch the fadnee and we shall not see any longer in our subscrip dons a long list ot ones and twos they will swel in stantly to tene and twenties and with their secret prayers no less than with their public contributions will the peopleof this land unite their emtleavours to spread the knowledge of christ and to the utmost extent of their ability to

meniber of the church of england must be aware of the great objects of this society and the prapciplea upon which it acts and therefore cannot but be fully sensible of the duty of forwvarding its
