the sastindia company and the greatteazdealersthe differences which hlve for some time existed betwven  thr hon east india company and the most considerable teai dealers of the country are dlaily becoming more invetcrate and irreconcileable the complaints made by the latter are that fair play is not given to them and that advantages commen surate with those derived from their body to the powerful mo nopolists are withheld in consequence of the very active competition in the teatrade and the verv small profits arising fromr it to the wholesale ilealersprofita which are certainly if we judge from the companys owr books of sale and theirs trivial in comparison with the profits of other irades nititout taking into calculation tlse losses contingent upon it or the large capital required for kecoing it alivethic tea dealer came to a resolution in the beginning of october last to address the hon court of directors the eastindia companv arc in the hiabit of charging the

respectfully to call your attention to the very heavy clarge of  lot money to which we are subjected and which we are aware cannot besupported by any claim of right or of advantage to the trade it is true that this charge originally we believe a per quisite to one of your respectable servants has been for many years when the trade was very differently circumetanced sub nitted to  but in the unexampled competition which at pre sent pervades every branch of trade the most rigid attention to economy by the reduction of every annecessary charge has become indispensable and the teadealerg of liondon cannot be expected to continue any expense paid in their own wrong we beg to submit to your honourable court that you are not to any cxtent the warehousekeepers of the goodsa of others so that the charges of the west india dock and other public companies differ as widely in principle as they are comparatively unimportant in amount the teas are lotted solely with a view to the advantage of the sellers and in proportion to that advantage is the dis adevantage to the wholesale buyerv beg therefore respectfully to request that your ho nourable court will direct the charge for lot money to be dis continued and we remain with the greatest respect hon sirs your obedient humble servantshere followed the names of the  greatest teahouses in london london oct  sitnilar remonstrances and requests were made from the principal teadealers of edinburgh and leith to the courtthe court of directors hesitated about the propriety of granting this request atd the teadealers waited iu anxious expectation for the presumed acquiescence of the honourable memberson the last ale day at the commencement of the present month a partner in one of the most eminent teahouses in the kingdom addressed the chairman air muspratt upon the subject and begged to be informed whether the wholesale buyers were to be liable upon that occasion to the usual charges for  lottingto this mr muspratt replied by stating that the subject was one of very great importance and was at that moment under the consideration of the court of directorsthere was still further delay and the dealers construed the hcsitation rather too advantageously for themselves on sa turday all suspense upon the matter was quite at an end the memorlalizing partv received the following explicit commu nication from the ron couzt east
