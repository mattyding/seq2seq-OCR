from kent to caith ness were now arayed in behalf of the maligned and per secuted protestant of ireland and this too at a titne when there wras so much sad cause fbr doubting the steadiness of those

property of kent is in favour of cathdlic emancipation the brunewick clubs have manifestly failed in engandand though on this question the people rnay not be so much alive as we would wish them the dissentient re still more opposed to brtunswick clubs than to catholic emanciptiongemromian catholic association relanda meeting of the associdtion took place on christmasday mlr oconnell suggested that no letters taking up the time of the association particularly upon that day should be read by any of the members ile was opposed to the reading of the lettersmlr corpinxrt observed that alr oconneu had also been opposed on a hlte occasion to letters being read merely because the writer did not assent to his quixotic expedient of a mission to englandmr ogoratn mahtozi deprecate these

deal out his sarcasmsa i can bear to be abusedar coppingerthis is mr oconnells mode of ex planationmr oreilly said both speakers should be called to order by the chairmir oconnell denied that order had been violated by him there were persons to be found even among themoxss qur every upporruncy wcastretnections andt sow disntust to such a length hae gomc worthy and honourable members gone that even his integrity had become a matter of discussion the lodgment of the rent in his name as a mat terof convenience to the association had formned a ground of accusation against him although his owrn

gentlesnan had introduced the subject of the rent and the manner of its lodgment he begged to ask from which of the two accounts designated by the numericals  and  were the funds to be drawir to support the pageant of alr oconnells entrance into the flouse of commons on the rst day of the session  great confusion and cries of  order  orderhearmr oconnell rose amid loud cheers he had no ob jection to answer the question of oir copplnger whatever might have been his motive for proposing it the funds of the country as a matter of justice to himse f and to his family should of course be avaulable to that object his sacrifice ot time during the period of tertn when hls hours might be va lued at several pounds sterling would be upon his part sa crifice enough the noblemen and gentlemen who accom panled him to parliament would of course defray their own expenses except in the instances of the leading mnember of the association wito could not so orell afford itmr coppargemtit is clear tben that the job will cost the rentpayers anrong whom are the unsheltered husband man and sorrowing wldow some  or ol order order under the pretext that a great national object is to be achieved the contributions of the patriot people of ireland are to be squandered in giving pomp and circumstance to mir oconnells desperate and futile enterprise cries of  order and  put him downair oconnellit is
