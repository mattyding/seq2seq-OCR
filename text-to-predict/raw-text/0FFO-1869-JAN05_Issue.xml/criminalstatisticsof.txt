cuiminal stxrtriscs of the aitmythe re port lately ijsued by lieuterantcolonel henderson on the discipline and management of military prisons in  shows that the decrease in the number of cases of corporal punishment has been very considerable thus in  which was some years before military prisons were esta blished the number of men flogged in the army was   the strength of the army was  so that the propor tional number flogged was  per cent in t thero wvere  corporal punishments on a strength of  or  percent and in  there were only  corporal pvuishments on a strength of s or   per cent he decrease in the proportional number of mon flogged has been most marked since  the percentages being  in   in s  in   in   in s  in  and  in s the numnber of convictions showvs a large incresse for late years bet there have been considerable disturbing causes within the last two years to account for this apparent augmentation in  the conivictions numbered  per cent of the strength of the army in  the proportional number was  per cont in eacn of the seven years  respectively the prrodor tiou percent wvas n     and  the proportional number of deserters to every  effectives was tj in i  in   in    in    in   in   in  aud  in   in  the proportional number was   and in  and  respectively the proportional number was onl  and  of the whole number of  men flogged in  only  such sentences were carried out in the united kingdom between april  and december  or calculatingtheratio forthe complete year the number isbrought up to theremaining  sentences being carried out amon thl troopb in tic colonies where the systen of nmilitary prisons is extremely imperfcot now that the terrors of the lsh no louger exist as a detcrring influence on men whose dispositions lead them to commit acts of violenceaggravated insubordination or disgracefulconduct it is to be hoped that the discipline of military prisons will be rendered thoroughly efficient lieutenantcolonel henderson reports that the most serious obstacle to the efficieucy of military prisons was the want of accommodation on the system of separation of the wlhole military prison accommodation of the country onehalf is on the very defeotive associated system and a large pro portion of this half is iu the military prison at alder shott a cell building however to be constructed at this camp win replace the wyooden huts now in use there as a prison in  out of an average force of  men  or per coutwere committed fordesertion    or  per cent for absence without leave   or  for drunkenness   or   for disgraceful conduct  and  or  for other crimes in  out of an averago force of  men  or  per centwere committed for desertion   or  per cent for absonce without leave   or  for drunkenness  or  for disgraceful conduct and  or  for other crimcefrom these results it appears that tho greatest proportional number of committals under any one head was for drunken ness this is porhap the most fertilo sourco of military crime the actual number of committals for this offence slightly decreased in  bnt the explanation of the large rnumber of committals is to be found in tho fact that soldiers who were formerly sumnniarily convicted and sentenced to short periods of imprisonment in regimental cells by their commanding officers fordrunkenness aro now tried by courtmartial and sentenced toimprisonment in a military prison thus causing a considerable aegmentation in the number of commnittals for that offence lookitng at the results for each of tho  years s respectively it appears that tei proportional number percent of strength committed for drunkenness was in england         and  in seot land       i  and  in ireland         and tll the medical returns of the military prisons at home show that the health of the prisoners during the year  was less satisfactory than of late years the proportional num bers treated for sickness to every  an confinement was nearly  in  in  it decreased to about  in  it was  in  it was  and in  it was about  in  it had decreased to ui and in  to rather less than   in  and  respectively it was  and  per cent theofollowing interesting statement is furoished of the age service country and roligion of the prisoners wlho were admitted into the military prisons in  of  prisoners  were under  years of age  were aged   were aged  and  were aged  vears and upwards  of the prisoners had served two years and under  had served under seven years  had served from seven to  years  had served from  to  years end  bad sered nioro tban  years of tbh total number of prisounrs  were english  were scotch and  were irish gancing at their religious persuasion it is seen that  were protestant v were rcsbyteran and  were roman catholic lieutenant colonel hienderson referring to the subject of education states that when it is considered that the regulations for the eniploymnentof nmen in prison provide at least an hour and a half for the instruetion of those in the lirst and second classes and in part of the third class and for additional opportunities ofselfiumproveument after the vork of the day is euded it is evident that fewsoldiers should leave the pri sons without having made some prugressat least towards reading and writing particularly wben in addition to the advantages which would be gained by the power conferred by educationit isremembered that inability to read and write operates as a bar to promotion in the armv  but as far as can be asecrtained from the reports on thesubject of education which are very imperfectit app ears that not nearly so mucht good is effected as might be this is perhaps owing to the absence of anything in the school system by which the men can be slinnlated to exertion sand it is a question whether the means provided are worked to the best advantage the soldier who can neither read nor write must clearly iave less inducement to abstain from courses which lead him into orime and punishment than the man wbo is not labouring l under ssuch disability
