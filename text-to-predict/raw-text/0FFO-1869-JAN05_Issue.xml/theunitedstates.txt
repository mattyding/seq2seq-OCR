third correspondent writing under date of december  to the nyew york herald from fiavannah saysi t is a fact that a gigantic iusurrection exists in this island and that it is supported or countenanced by the great uiass of the native populatiou the exceptions being insignikcaun in point of numbers that it has had many encournters with the spanish troops in which its supporters have iuflicted quite as much if uot more damago than they have sugered  and that the best informed among the disin terestei or unprejudicc lare already beginning to calculato on the ultimate success which shall leave the cubans free and injependentthese letters however vere written a week before the changes above noted occurred in tho command of the spanish forces which was on de cemher caleb cushing who mysteriously left this country last week on a secret mission for the state depart ment it lhas transpired is on his way to bogota to aid the negotiations for the darien ship canal these negotiations have not made such favourable proress as was desired aud secretary seward therefore sent mr cushing to forward them it appears that two parties are in communication with the government at bogota about this canal one is the company of newv york capitalists who intend to construct the canal and who lesire to obtain the necessary power the other is secretary seward who has proposed to new grenada the text of a treaty providinig for the rights of the united states to tiie joinit use of the canal and to protect it by military force if necessary both propositions have for some time been in the hands of the american agent at bogota but for somie reason he has madle little progress now the negotiation is to be pushed and it is ex pected that mr cushing will soon bring it to a favourable terminationowing to complications growing out of the threat ening condition of affairs in the east it is probable that the hon edward j morris the united states minister to constantinople will soon be recalled it is reported from washington that he has become obnioxious to the turkislh government on account of his avowed sympathy with the cretan insurgents blacquie bey the turkish ambassador at washing ton is said to be instructed to ask for mr lorriss recallthe troubles at new orleans arising from the presence there of the peruvian ironclads continue they have recently got into difficulty with the custonhouse and the collector of customs seized one of the transports that brouoht the crews from new york on appeal to washington however she was released there seemls little prospect of getting a sufficient crew to take the ironclads away and if spain and peru again return to amicable re lations of which there is a prospect it ie probable that peru will return the ironclads to their former owners in this country and refuse to pay for themthe  protective tarif advocates are beginning to express fears that congress at the present session will not lemislate to suit thenm an unexpected op position was developed in the senate on dec  to the  copper tariff bill already passed by the house and which has caused such a commotion in the country its friends wanted to force it through at once for fear delay might raise too strong a pub lic opinion against it in tho senate on the th senator chandler repnblican of michigan moved to take up the bill to this senator whyte de mocrat of maryland objected saving that he hoped it rould not be taken up because the large in terest affected by it the copper smelters whom he in part represented regarded it as a piece of class legislation designed to benefit the few at the expense of the manyand desired to have their objections to it presented to congress he had been informed by the chairman of the committee havingc the bill in charge that it would not be called up until after the holyday recess senator howard republican of michigan said he earnestly desired to have the bill acted upon at once in order to forestall impor tations of copper that might have been ordered in view of the anticipated passage of the bill senator vickers democrat of muaryland thought the reason for immediate action given by senator hloward not a good one because if orders were sent to europe for foreign copper not much of it would get into the country during the christmas holydays senator elorrill republi cau of maine did not think this bill if passed would give any real protection to the copper inte rest senator chandler said he was anxious to have the bill taken up feeling confident that it could be passed without delay and added thab if it were not acted npon at once orders would go to europe by telegraph for large quantities of foreign copper which would come in at the present low rate of duty and glut the market senator sherman republican of ohio said that he was in favour ofmie bus out opposed to taking it up now because as chairman of the finance committee he had felt warranted in saying that it would not be acted upon before the holydays and he did not wish any one to be misled by this statement senator ferry re publican of onnecticut said the bill might nn doubtedly be passed todag if pressed through the senate after the whip and spur manner ofthe c previous question in the house bub not otherwise hle read a letter from a former presi dent of an american copper mining company say ing that the billthough pressed ostensibly in the in terest of the lake superior mining regionwas really designed for the benefit of speculators in copper ztocks and other mining shares and that the effect of it will be to destroy the business of smelting from copper ore the letter also stated that it na neces sary to use foreign carbonates in smelting american ore the senator hoped the bill would not be taken up because he desired to present certain views and statisticc on the subject senatorhoward replied by reading a letter from a tennessee copper smelter commending the bill and saying it was much needed for the protection of american copper interests after some f urther debate the motion to take up the bill was lost by a vote of  yeas to  nays this disposes of the various tariff bills pending in congress
