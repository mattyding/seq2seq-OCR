very little excepting at the ends where the lashinishadbeen carried away on theupperdeltbere were eight or ten bales of cotton not as wet as those in the hold there was a little loose cotton on the upper deck torn from the bales as they were sent over the side the ships anehors were there and pumps believed the cotteon remained on board until after the sale witness and the other surveying officer on the way back in the tug consulted as to the nature of thereport to bo made the naval officers were unanimous but there was a difference of opinion re ceived a communication from mr lewis as coming from the prisoner relating to the survey in consequence of that com munication the surveyiog officers recommouded that the ship and cargo should be sold for the benefit of the under writersa

the occurrence read from tbe log as follows the wreck and cargo were this day sold to captain wilmshurst for the sum of lat the sale the wreck and cargo were knocked down to mr lewis for the prisoner mr lewis said in bidding  twenty pounds for captain wilmshurst after the sale the work on the wreck was resumed on the th of august by captain wilmshnrsts orders volunteer labour being sent for on that day thought no commissioned officer wasin command of the men after the sale but always before the sale commodore dowell arrived at ascension in tho rattle snake on the d of september by the merchant vessel rajastham cotton was shipped for england the loading commenced on the th of august and continued to the th of septeniber inclusive on board the steam mail packet roman on the st of october cotton was shipped by order of captain wilmahurstby the courtto the bestof witnesss knowledgethe cot ton sentby therajasthan was forthe underwriters that sent by tho roman was the property of captain wilmahurat it was daylight when the bremcnsis struck on the reef andwhen witness hoarded her the next day her mainmast was through her bottom and the means available at the isand could not have got her off when the work of saving cargo on the th was abandoned there was a cer tain amount of rsk to life one man having already beeniiulled tlought there was nothing in the state of the weatherbetweenthelth and th to make tho workof saving cargo more dificult than ir had been previonsly the sale was a ipublic one but no one bid excepting the pri soner tne men generally commenced work at the wreck at  nm and left off at  pm the bremensis was wrecked about half or three quarters of a mile frofn english bay where a portion of the cargo was lanled the cotton was discharged from tho ship into lighters an they were afterwards towed by the tug to the pierhe and to english bay was on board the bremensis within three hours after she struck the masts wvere cut away by the request of the master of tho ship he offering a reward of  to any man wbo would cut away the lanyards of the main rigging thought all the available seatnen of the flora were emplovel on the wreck told the prisoner frequently that were thera more men snore work could be done a store porter was the auctioneer at the sale so merchants from st helena were present tlhe master of the rajasthan was present did not think there were  persotns altogether present thought all the island heads of departments ere present due notice was gziven of the sale but was not aware of any noticebeing given that volunteer labour would he alloivedif any persou bought the wreck only two persons lived on the islal lsidbes persons under the government when the wreck was first boarded by witness she was between  and  yards from the nearmst shore wlhen the wreck broke up it was not more than  or yards on witness first visiting the bremensis the tug was maele fast to the ships stern twice anl had the tug been a more powerful vessel the ship woulht have been got off the reef with the greatest case the tng at ascension is about horse power heard the crew of the bremensis ordered to abandon the ship by the captain and lall that night she was left with not a soul on board in wit nesss opinion had tho crew remained on board and on the upper deck that night there would have been danger as the tnain mast was tbreateningto go by the boara at every surge but thought the crew might have been rafe nuder the ship topgallant forecastlecrosexamined by the prisonertbe wind was fair with fine weather for the bremeosis when she struck on the rece in the first instance on thc lth no attempt was mado bv the crew of the bremensis to save the cargo but they hid their best to save the ship nvhie on hoard the sails were reset on witness quittiug the shipsonieremained setothers were leowed up the stat of the masts reudered it danger ous to send men aloft there was a difficultv in inducing the crow of the bromensis to save cargo in witnesss judg ment the crow of the bremensis so long as they remained under the command of their captain and is offlicersif left to themselveswould have saved the cargowhenthe shipgoton shore the captain and his officers had proper command over the men afterwards the crew were asked to volunteer to cut away the masts hut none came forward the captain of the ship told witness that he considered the service of such dlangerthat he would nrt order any of his men on the duty and at this time the reward of  was offered it was essential to the safety of any one

tleshipof her inasts while themasts remained standing the saving of any cargo could not have been attempted the crew of the bre mensis at one time did strike work was on board the wrcak three or four dayssavingeargo and was incapacitated from remaining longer by a sunstroke several men of the floraerer injured and one killed in tll wvork of salving the cargo during the time employed on beard the bremensis every thing was done that could be done with the men at witnesss disposal they averagerl about  or in number on the inquiry before commodore dowell he remembered snaking somestatement but no more men could have been spared fromn bis department than he bad as more men than were employed on the wreck were required he would have employed the carpeutcrs sawyers wheclrights and all the marines the carpenters sawyers and wheel rights wvere employed in the dockvard at ascension aud the marines on the publio works on shore thought that considering the valuable nature of the bremensis cargo and with none of her majestys ships in har bour at the time the public service would not have suf fered much for a few days by the withdrawal of these men from the public service the clain for salvage on the part of the floras ships company witness thought might have heen greater had that course been pursued while witness was mn charge of the bremensis her master did not complain in any way of the manner in which the ship was dealt with or the cargo being saved did not know the prisoners solo reason for nllotting the work of the crew of the bremensis on shore was because they were lo cated in english bay there was one tug and seven ligbters available at the island for saving the bremensis cargo to a certain extent the fact of there being but one tug limited the number of men who might be usefully em ployed on the wvreck was aware that a part of these men were ernployed in loading the raasthan the loading of the rajastbau commenced on the dav after the men were taking offthe bremensis governmentstores had been landed from tho rajasthan and vere lying on the beach exposed to the sun prvious to the tb but could not say whethor any remained at that date they boing rolled away as opportunity offered some of the floras men vere employed on this duty at tho time of making the gairvey on tho bremensis the work of saving the cargo was in wit nessas opinion such as the prisoner would have been justi fied in ordering to be done in the inquiry before com modore dowell remembered saying that the ship and careo being the private property of captain wilmhmnrat after the sale he did not thinkhe would be justified in ordering men to wrork at the cargoa statement alleged to have been made by the witness at ascension before captain grant was here read by the pri soner as followsthare was a very great stench down below when sbe was surveyed and does not think that having reference to their bealth and usage of the service it would have heen a proper place in which to order men to work the ship and cargo being private propertywitness those were precisely my words but had re ference to the ship and cargo after both had been purchased by captain wilmahurt and that is what i meant by private property at the time of the survey the sale ha not eru made commodore dowells inquiry was held long after tho survey and he put the question to witness as to the polioy of employing the men on the wreck after she was sold believed that commodore dowell sent volunteers from the rattle snake to the wreck after the sale to assist in saving cargo at the time of the survey the bremensis was breaing up very fast between decksand had the northeast rouers set in the ship would soon have gone to pieces the master of the bremensisappeared very anxious to getaway from the isnd at the time of the survey as he said it would not pay to savethe cargo at the time of the survey did not remem ber the master of the bremcnis protesting against the ship being condemned without the cargo but he said it was not legal to condemn one without the other he was very anxious indeed that both should be condemned and became so loud in his remarks that witness was com pclled to request him to leave the office at that time all the dry cotton bad been taken out of the bremeusis but was not all on board tho rajasthan at the time of the survey there were some few bales of cotton on the upper deck of the bremensis some floating about in the hold aun the greater part under water the mnster of the bremcnsis said that the wet cotton left in the ships hold was not worth salvage but witness did not believe him he said further that as soon as the dry cotton was shipped iu the rajasthan it would become a ne gotiable article the master of the bremensis ex pressed a wish to go bome by the first mail but heard him say nothing about bils of lading he did say witness thou ht that as soon as he got a cargo for the rajasthan he shouild have done his duty by the underwriters mr good ridge the master of the rajastban saw both the hull and cargo of the bremensis he did not positivelv re fuse to sign nny report that he did not do tbis as such a report was never fuuy drawn up but he detnurred to the opinion entertained by the naval officers as to one cargo saying that he did not think it was legal to condemn one without the other wit ness gave as a reason to the master of the rajasthan for en deavouriug to save the cargo instead of condemning it the fineness of the weather and the cargo being verv valuable very possibly might have said to mr goodridge that the more got out of the ship tho greater would he the salvage and that if arecommendation were made to sell the ship and cargo and governumentahould buy her no salvage wonldebo got was not aware that the master of the rajasthan had any interest in desiring thatthe cargo should be condemned nor could be say whether his judgment in this respect as an experienced merchant captain was unbiased or not the wreck of the bremen sis could have becu sold to the captain of the rajasthan and her pumps anchors cables windlass pumpa and various other gear would have been worth to nim  or  a recommendation to sell the ship or cargo one without the other was never madeas the survey ing officers were under the impression it would bo illegalthe prisonerwas that not what you insisted should be done and is it not one of the charges against me that i sold the cargo as well as the shipwitnesswe did not insist that one should be sold with out the other we recommended that both should be sold in consequence of your having stated that you were notprepared to give any more labour to clear the ship witness continued in answer to further questionsbe lieve now that it was wrodg at the time to seu either ship or cargo the first recommendation of the surveying officers was not made officiallv and the second was made purely in consequence of tbe statement by captain wilmshurst that he had no more labour personally tbe prisoner said nothing to witness on the matter thought it possible the captain of the rajasthan might have bought the vessel and cargo after signing the recommondation that it should be sold thought so while acting with him on the survey he did not say he meant to purchase could not say why he did not bid for the ship should think fewer men were employed on the wreck after it was sold than while it continued the property of the underwriters be lieved that the property cotton sent on board the roman belonged to the prisoner he having bought the whole foro did not know it was sold to pay the ex penses of the volunteers who saved it knew nothing then of certain conditions of the sale or to whom sold hfad heard since his return to england knew that volunteers were paid for saving the cotton before it was shipped and was under the impression that the mouoyeame from the prisoners private purse was now aware that the property salved after the sale after the payment of the sal vors was held over for ana had now been banded over to tbe underwriters knew mr mathews of ascension who claimed to be a representative of lloyds in his capacity as sneh was not aware that he protested in any wav against the sale he was not present at the sale there had been a question in ascension of establishing a canteen store and doingawawith the sutlers storo kept by mr mlathews messrsaveob and co the owners of the sutlees store were under notice from the admiralty to quit the islana remembered the prisoner having alluded to the salvage of the cargo after the sale when he said  we shall now overcome the obstacle we had in not having capital to start the canteen dont remember anything being said about tho underwriters at the time the survey was being made out captain webster of the bremensis he thought said  yes the survey is at my requisition and i shall actuponyvonrrecommendationor not as i think properreexamined by prosecutorod the evening of the thof august
