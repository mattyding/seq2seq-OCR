together all the funds received in charity nnd in rating for thereliefof pauperismsndlsioswed the vast amnounts thus raised and contended for a conjoint administration amonig those present were mr loucke mp mlr r ravwlinson cbdr stewart and a very large num ber of clergymen guardians and gentlemen connected with philanthropic institutionsthe charitreh said it had been supposed the discussion on these questious would be to show an antagonism to the present systen  hut this did not ncessarily follow it was noped that out of these discussions suggestions would ariso for supplementing the present system and that an earnest inquiry as to tho working of the law would be instituted as he had said before ais conviction was that there was an enormous amount of suffering in london which no one ex cept now and then nnoficial persons cared about investiga ting and it really did seem to him that more heart should he brought into the administration of the law he could assure the meeting that there was no desire on the part of this association to call into questiou the conduct of parish officers and he should be sorry to see the discussions come down to that level the whole question was as to what means were best for providing against existing evilsmr townsend opened the discussion by contrasting the working of the english ponr lavws with the system naiopted in france and the great difference he sail was that wvo gave every person a light to reliefa right which was denied in france with oursystem no class of the community was satisfied wvile he declared the french system worked welli and whereas english pauperism coat directly   a vear in france the cost w as but onesoventh of that sums thus the cost of thefreneh pauper was as f it to the sum of  s tho cost of the english pauper he drew from these facts the conclusion that our system required alterationmir e websters declared that the tide of pauperism woild never be stemosed until the idea of the right to relief was abolished hear he considered it would be wise for the guardians to hare the power of refusing relief and he suggested that the givers of cbarity sbould make guardians their almonersmr brooc denied the assertion in dr stallards paper that pauperism stood in the same relationship to society as a crime for lie said every man bad a right to the means of living and society had recoguized this right if a man were debarred from this right ho bad a right to take from society his means of lividg therefore relief must be given to a necessitous man who should be compelled to work in return for what he receivedmr bates advocated emigration as the only nieans of conquering the iucreasing pauperismmir u aodmvun consideredl it was of primarv importance to inquire what were the causes of the enormous increase in pauperism amtong those causes ho believed wvere tho enormous imperial taxation aud the inequality of rating both of which he believed pressed upon classes and assisteil in makin the rich richer and the poor poorer another thing which led up to pauperisi was the present system of buitig on short leases wahich ledto tbhe landed and house property being throwvn into a few hands and at the samuo time caused the sbelter built for the peoplo to be such as to assist in tho breeding of a nation of paupers he wyent on to ald that though pauperism and crime cost the country hirectly at least ooor a year nothing liwhatevcr was ulone to prevent these evils he condlemned indiscriminate al losgiving and the offering of indiscriminate medical relief and lie ured that relief should be given to hesithy paupers iu return for worksir wv dznison cb exgovernor of mladras sup ported the view that the rich were getting richer andl the poor poorer and he stated that wbereas in s this coun try wsis saving  annually it was now saving t od the other hand lio said the feeling which formerly existed between employer anl employed had greatly changed and not for the better io was proceeding to deduce arguments from these facts vhen ie was stopped by his time having expiredmr pattrerson of the working mens clubuinion after condemning the poor law srstem as an admirable one for manufacturiug paupers by degrading the recipients of relief conitended that the relief should he given before the people became degradedand that assistanceshiould be given to keep people from pauperism he declared that the working nien as a class were provident but that they depended upon societies they themselves formedand which foundered iu the time of trotible leaving the workingmen to find loans at  per cent interest he called for inquiries into the work ing of the societies which she loswer classes depended upon feeling sure that such inquiries would tend to the bencit of society

who spoke with respect to the french s stemii of relief and he denied that that system was supe rior to the englisb as to the proposal that the givers of bounty should makethe guardians their almnoners he de clared that givers of charity would uever consent to such a course asto the best means of giving relief he instancel the systemisin marylebonewmhere the guardians knew everv family and evers person to whom relief was given and a registry he said was kept from wlich tile history of every recipient of relief couli be stated there were associations and socicties of relief which gave support to people isho had never sought relief froni the recognized authorities and this bad never been doiie to an extent enough to pauperize a parishb even like marylebone as to dr stallards pro position to put the relief unmler a magistrate it was lis the speakers happiness to sit svith five nmagistrates every week anid he found those gentlemen no difrereut from other gen tlernen a laugh the

working man fell ill he wvent to thohospital and when he bad been a fewdays out of wvork he became tbo recipieiit of poor relief or begged even though he was well paid when in work the working man was well paid for his labour he was now fully in pos session of political power and should be taught to think of his future as that of a selfdependent being the speaker went on to notice dr stallards

miadridmr locsex ap said he had attended as he had sup posed tihat the question of seeking a poor las commiission would como before the meeting and he should have opposed the proposition that reform was neciled in the admimuis tration of the poor law he was fully convinced and he had urged it since he had been in parliament the one great question which should take precedence in all reform was the equalization of the poorrates in the metropolis which he urged sbould be treated as one union as matters stood the poar were driven out of tho rich parishes where they hall aboured and fell for

the employers of surplus labour but that the local authorities shouldi find the means of dealing with the labour thrown upon their hands the one great point to which he speaking vith the experience of
