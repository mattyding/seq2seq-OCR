londoiv tuesday jar uay  if no obstacle occur in tho meantime tho con ference on the dispute between turkey and greece will meet on the th inst and as the discussion is to bo confined strictly to the points indicated it is thought that three sittings wil be sufficient to bring the business to an end though tho assembled diplo matists are not to enter upon a general examination of the socalledeastern question there can be no fitter timo for the nation to consider its duties in a region respectiig which it has contracted public ob ligations our present position is defined by the peace of paris whicl followed the war of  that war vas undertaken to maintain the independence and integrity of the ottoman empire such was the political phrase of the time and it sufficiently ex prmsses tho purpose which tho statesmen of england and franco had in view and for which the english people at least were so zealous that they forced their policy on a reluctant premier but the phrase was not understood by any public man or by any section of the people as involving a mere military alliance with the sulta much less an approval and support of turkish institutions nve went to war for turkey and not for the turks the primary object for which france and england spent so much blood and treasure for which austria committed her act of  splendidingratitude  in occupying the principalities and for which cavou with the foresight of a states man cast in his lot with the wevter pwower was to secure from rdian sgressim thoe regions of eurodp an asia which ar nowgoverned by the sultan and to allow their population time and opportunity for peaceful development the object was attained and it can not be doubted that since the destruetion of the russian power in the black sea and the abolition of tho russian protectorate in the principalities there has been a period of comparative tranquillity and progress in the european provinces under the influence of its western allies and a sense of its own interests the porte has removed the remaining grievances of which its christian subjects com plained and though there is we are well aware much that is corrupt and barbarous in the system of administration and some thing that is sitiu offensive in the social relations of the people professing the two religions particularly among the less educated classes yet there has been even within the last few years a progress both material and moral which every impartial in quirer has observed the general prosperity and advance of europe have extended to these secluded regions and if the antiquated processes of turkish administration do check to some extent the de velopment of the country there is a general agree ment among all trustworthy witnesses that mussul man and christian have equal cauise to com plain in fact the mussulman says now that he is worse off than his christian neighbour for the latter pays his taxes and sits at home while the mussulman not only pays in money but is subject to an inexorable conscription and sees his children taken from him to serve over an immense territory from the adriatic to the persian gulfthe consequence of these changes is that the christian subjects of tho sultan the majority of whom are of the slave race have made great mate rial progress obtained substantial political equality and furthermore are achieving a sort of intel lectual independence so far as we may predicate a policy of these people it is that they should remain under the government of the pofte until they have attained something like a national consciousness in the european provinces moreover the experi ment of the fusion of christians and aiussulmais in the same commrunity is being tried on the largest scale and with the best chance of success since men of the same race and language are divided in religion and their tendency is necessarily to live more in ac cord as the old traditions of dorninatioin on the one part and subservience on the other pass away such being the stateof things thirteen years after the peace of paris the question for us is whether there is any sufficient reason to abandon the policy which at that time received the assent of all the great powers of europe if such a policy had proved to be against the interests of the inhabitants of the empire there could be but one answer no theory concerning the balance of power no jealousy of russian ad vance conld justify us in upholding a worthless state if the turkishl government could not fulfil the duties for which governments exist we should have no iight to do evil that good might come and maintain a tyranuy over millions of men for the sake of the european equilibrium but all the evidence is the other way it is only necessary to read the reports of our consuls and the statements of residents and traders to be aware that the conditions of wellbeing and progress exist in all but the most reimote parts of the turkish dominions if even then we were not bound by treaty to maintain the integrity of the ottoman empire it would be our duty to do nothiing to overtlhrowv it feeling as we do that its destruction in the present state of the world could only lead to the advance of the russian ersapeno to sovereignty or suzerainty over a number of feeble and lhalfdeveloped comniuni ties tho aggressors in the present affair are the greeks their notionone w hich we believe to bo entirely mistakenis that they could play a great part in europe and form a govern ing class over all the eastern christians in a re vived byzantine empire it is however worthy of remark that the christianis of turkey have been more eager to shake off greek influence than ottoman domination the bulgarians for instance thought more of being rid of greek ecclesiastics than of the civil and military auithority of thle pasha as we havo before re marked the greek population of eurolean tturkey is less than a million and if it has no political or moral hold over the other christians hoiv is the transfer of power to be accomplished  where is the force which is first to subjugate four nmillions and a half of mussulmans in europe and then to control a jealous christian population  everv consi deration of policy therefore forbids us to coun tenance an attack on tho turkish empire from without of course if the fabric collapses from its inherent weakness it is no busines of ours to prop it up if the raahs rebel if any section of them can establish their independence or show they have struggled hard for it and deserve to win it we are not bound to wvithhold our sympathies but wlhen we see piratical attacks directed against a part ol the sultans dominions by a foreign governmenit wwhen we hear the greek boasts that turkey shail never be let alone that she wyas made to spend so many millions last year and shall be mades to spend stiu more next year and the year after that and know that the vain little nation wvhich does this mischief is merely playing tho ganme of a grtat aggressive power behind it englishmen cannot hesitate on which side to exert their influencethe policy which this country has followed we believe to be in the main wiso and prudent and though it may no doubt require modifications from time to time its general tenour need not be departed from in a few words it is to support the independence of the sultans empire and at the same time to insist in common with the other great powers and particularly with france on the absolute equality of the sultans subjects before the law it is not our duty to enter into the reli gious or national animosities of tho greeks no doubt they have had plenty of provocation in past times and the turk must not be surprised if the sins of his fathers are visited upon him in the form of an irrepressible hatred on the part of men of the greek race every old man can remember the massacre of scio and the campaign of ibrahim pasba in tho morea and of course the atrocities of the time are not pauiated in the narratives current among the greeks but the ferocious old turks of thosedays aro in their graves or near them and the polity of the empire is so completely changed that the mussulman ruler is now much nmore of king log than king stork there is nothing that we can seo to prevent tho various races and religions from living in harmony together if tho great powers which desire tho peace of the east do their duty in urging the reforms which re nain to be accomplished our true policy is to bring men of all religions under tho influence of civilization and this will be hopeless if we acquiesco in the principlo that any hostilities under any conditions of treachery and duplicity are perinis sible against a sovereign or a populatioun which is without the christian pale
