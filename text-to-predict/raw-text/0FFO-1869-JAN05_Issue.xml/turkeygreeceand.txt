turkey greeoe and hungarypwrm oupr special correspondentipestp dec i it was quite a relief to have two holydays and a j suinday following closely upon each other and thus be spared all the speculation and conjectures of the  papers on the probabilities and posibilities of the conference to be held on the turcogreek conflict altlhough so close to the east aud in the way of  being tolerably wellinfarmed about what pasesthere in the present case these opportunities are ot little use to us as the negotiations on the confer ence are being held in the west where you have more means of information than we have herebnt it will be well to remember that besides those who are taking so much trouble about the matter there is another party who may likewise think herself entitled to a word upon it and who seems to be altogether forgottenturkey as far as we know tioe negotiations are going on about turkey but without turkey which up to the last few days had received no official notification of any project of conference all that was done was to induce turkey to prolong the term originauy fixed for the departure of greek subjects and vessels from turkey from a fortniglit to five weeks and this was obtained by urginig the hardship of sending away at so short a notice peoplo domiciled for years and engaged in large business transactions rather than as a delay which might be used for coming to an understanding about a peaceful solution of the conflict that has arisenthis could perhaps scarcely have been otherwise for before coining to turkey with propositions for a settlement of the difficulty the treaty powvers had first to arrive at some arrangement among them selves but still they must be prepared for a far greater diplay of independence on the partof turkey than they have been accustomed to of late yearsi cannot enough impress upon your readers that by tho accassion of the present sultan a new ele ment has come into turkish politics which must be reckoned with and it is an element the influence of wlhch is at this moment decisive and yet beinig al togother of a personal character it is diflicult to estimate  can tel you most positively however that this new element was thrown into the scale lately more heavily than ever before and its weight turned the scaletho uncomfortablo position in which turkoy has found herself since the treaty of parisneither alowed to defend herself nor effectually protected by her friendslias been grievously felt by tho mahomedau population the display of vigour and decision on the part of the sultau has met there fore with general approval if you do not hear so much noise from stamboul as from athens you may depend upon it that the determination of the turks not to bo played with auy longer is equal to the enthusiasm of the greoks the men wliose names have always been connected with a policy of inde pendent action aro coming into tho foreground and taking tho lead moro aud morethis is tolerably apparent from the circular note vhich tho turkish government sent to its re presentatives abroad at the first intimation of a conferenco being projected the note is very calm butprecisoand decided it shows that the turks this time know quito well what they want tho gist of tho argument is that turloy is not the aggressor she only defends herself against the pro vocations of greece which allowed her moreover to remain a passivo spectator of the way in which sho violated international rights turkey has shown forbearanco enough if the powers really wish to cnd tho conflict they ought to see that grcece is mado to observe international obliga tions or they should let turkey take her own measures to bring the greeks to reasonstill turkey is ready to take part in the confer once but only on condition that she is not exipected to yield on the five points of her ultimattin and that all interference in her interiual affairs es pecially in tho political and administrative relations of candia should be excluded from the conferencethe answer which the tarkish minister in viennua received from the foreignofftce was satisfactory enough on the first condition but muchi less so on tho second for he was mado to understand that it was the internal administration of candia which was tho origin of the whole conflict not to touch this would therefore be tanitamount to leaving tho germ for future conflicts of course as far as the integrity of the empire and the sovereignty over crete were concerned that could be no question for discussion as the feeling now is in constantinople it is not likely that this distinction about sovereign rights will bo accepted therecount andrassy leaves tomorrow for vienna although not a fortnight has passed since the em peror left and scarcely threo weeks since all the vienna ministors wero here thero is already a mass of business accumulated which requires personal conferenco between the heunlgarian premier tho sovereign and tho ministers on the other side tho chief of this business is the future oranuization of theo hungarian militia departmont and the appoint ments in connexion witli the first establishment of the militia tho post of mlinister in this depart ment has beon held by count andrassy and it will remain for a time at least in his hands nor was it well possible to make a botter arrangement for the frstxnstituition of tho militia requires from obvious reasons very dolicato handling and no ono is fitter for this than tho man to whoso tact it is owing that tho establishment of the militia became pos sible in practice and who brought about a fair coin promise between those who would take nothing less than a separate hungarian army and those who were frightened by the very name of honvedmnuch more difficultwas the choico of a parlliameltary undersecretary he had to be some one vwho was unoxceptionable in vienina and who yet in spired confidence hore besides ho hid to be a good parliamentary debater a man of strict business habts not too easygoing but able to hold his owvn after much see king a man has astually been found uniting more or less these qualities it is m kerkapolyi one of the clearest heads among theo members of the lato diet who on that account was invariably ohosen reporter of any committee on which he sat he had taken especial pains with the army budget which w as presented to the first dele gation that sat in vlienna and wvotuld probably hive done the chief part of the business tbis time likewise had ho not been prevented by illness although he has never been in office he is ole who would easily master all the details of it so it may be expected that the choice will give general satis faction which is an inportant element of success in the task he has before himin connexion with this subiect the ministry pub lishes a notification by wvhieh the officers and nion commissioned officers of the honveds of s who may think they have claims to be employed in the now force now about to be organized are called upon to present their claims in thisrespect tip to the th of february the apprehension lest this new favour should meet with little svmpathy on the part of tho veteran heaved officers is now removed and tho difficulty on tho contrary will be to sift the claims and single out thqso who after  years intorval are still fit for service but the readiuess which is shown by all veteran ehonved offlcers in this respect is of good augutry not less so are the numerous applications on the part of hungarian officers atil serving in tho austrohungarian army or who haveotaken their pension theoidea which prevailed in the establishment of the militia was that itlshould be a fusion between those two elements that once stood against eaich other in arms soon they will stand sido by side thus the past will be really buried and forgottenamong his manifold occupations in vienna it would be desirable that count andrassy should findtime to makean arrangement betweonthe press on both sides of thoeempire torefrain from controversy not only among themselves but likewise with the prussian papers the mania for controversy in newspapeis has infected us to a frightful extent thy almost livo on each other in this way the evil originates more or less in the fact that really indepondent papers are almosb unknown in this part of the world every one belongs to some one or other more especiauy and has the task to defend this some one through thick and tbin whether this some one be the governmuent or a party or some other interest of course wlatever appears in such a paper is taken to be the expression of the viesv of the patron of the paper now some time ago somje insinuating and complimentary articles on hun gary appeared in the norddetsdche implyinig that hlungary ought to guard againist any attempt to be taken in tow by austriain a policy of retalia tion for  on this an article appeared in the pesti waplo the organ of the deak party retmind ing the prussian paper that hungary and austria are now one and the army an alustro elungarian army which would figlit bravely if attacked all the opposition papers caught hold of this and ac cused the deak party of being a partisan of a great german policy on the part of austria on this the pesti naplo published a note saying that the views enounced in the artiole which were attacked were the porsonal views of the author of it the position of the party being fixed by the speech from the throne this was taken at vienna as a disavowal of baron bousts german policy and the vienna press bureau took up the matter theesther llyd now joined issue and wave the assxace that ilot ten men could be found in the hungarian delegzvmosof war with prussia from this little squabble you may see how reasonable my proposal is to make an additional convention between the two sides not to write in newspapers either against each other or against foreign paperstwo of the austrian ministers berger and gis kra have been decorated and the fact has made great sensation on the other side people are always at to forget that the men thus distin guiished are no more on the opposition benches but are ministers they only remember that both have been early champions of democracy in austria and they find orders conferring titles of nobility if asked for a sort of treason to demo cracythe new bonds of the converted national debt are now ready and the commission intrusted writh the task is busy affixing its signatures it will be quite a boon when all the diffternt descriptions of bonds now existing
