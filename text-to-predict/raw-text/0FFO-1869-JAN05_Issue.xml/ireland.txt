difficult to understaud how so nmalignant a feel ing could have been entertained against a gentleman who resided among a tenautry who are described as being welltodo and contented and with whom except in the case of thomas dwyer he lived on the best terms as a magistrate a landlord and a private gentleman he was held i am told in tbh highest esteem there was but one person who en tertained anyenmity towardshimandhehadactually done no injury whatever to that person although under peculiar circumstances he had instituted proceedings which would have given him the power to evict it need hardly be observed tint eviction is regarded as a terrible penalty by a tenant espe cialy if he be one advanced in life such as dwyer who is over  years old with a ntnmerous family dependent upon him in such a case tho roots of an irish peasants attachment to the soil are multi plied and rendered more tenacious it is impossible to say whether thomas dwyer was the only person to blame in the unfortunate quarrel with his brother had an accommodating and neighbourly not to say fraternal spiritibeen showvn by william inwyer tho soturce of so much irritation on both sides wouild have been removed as it was he was subjected to daily hindrances and vexations which must have been the more galling to one of his temper from the fact that the person who caused them was of his own flesh and blood a man of violent and impetuous passions would be animated with some thing like a feeling of desperation if he found his accumulated wrongs capped by the greatest of all injuriestbe expulsion of himsolf and family from the holding they had occupied for years wlich was their sole dependence for sub sistence and for which he reglarly paid his rent on the other hand it imay be suppdosed that if his request had not been unreasonable orif he had not showns a quarrelsome and unmanageable disposition his brother never would have refuised him the favour he asked bnt these circumstances very little affect the chiaracter of the crime wlhat is to be thought of the state of society in which an apprehended injury is sought to be averted by asiassination the conduct and motives of mr baler had been misrepresented in the press and persons at a distance who knew nothing of his character had their feelings aroused against him as the type of an oppressive race it can only be a matter of conjecture whether the murderer was one who felt personally aggrieved or one who had been merely used as an instrument for executing the vindictive purpose of another the most serious circumstance connected with such crimes is the spirit of indifference if not positive approvalwith whichthey are received by the people it is reported in tho cork ebzminner that althouglh those who resided in the immediate neighbourhood of the deceased and esteemed his good qualities feel indignant many a remote district and some even in the town of tipperary express satisfactioni at the doom of another irish landlord it is this which constitutes as vve knon the most striking point of difference betveten engfish and irish crime the popular press points to the greater number of murders in england but keeps

published agree sub stantially as to the origin although there is some difference in the details of the dispute from the clontmdl cirolicle it wouldll appear that tho quarrel between the brothers bad beeu of old standing and that it had come to blows some years ago when mr baker interfered and procured quietness for some time by threatening to removo them both if thev did not conduct themselves quietly the contention was renewed however and became so bitter that he thought it necessarv to in terfere again and endeavour to make peace findinig that his efforts were unaviling he serred a notice to quit upon thomas dwyer wvho seemed to be the most in fault the dispute was at length referred to a relative mr wv e cole baker who proposed an arrangement which was likely to satisfy them both

has been pro duetive of irreparable mischief hearing that he was publicly attacked in prinit mir baker stated that the conduct of the parties precludod him from entering into any arrangement inasmuch as his doing so wvould be attributed to cowardice and it wrould weaken his influence in the management of the property it is alleged by some that lie really intended to carry out the eviction and it
