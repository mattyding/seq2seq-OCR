joturna ls con versa tions and esa ysrelating to irelandcontinued from thc times of dec we concluded our last notice of mr seniors book by describing the three classes into wy hich he divides the irish landlordsthe landlordl who allows his tenants to do just what they please to the ruin of his own property and to their hopeless dleinorliza tion and who is thoroughly popular  the lanidlord who interferes with them just sufliciently to secure his rents and who is as a rule tolerated but never lilced  and the landlord m ml to improve his property and the position of his tenants does what in england any landlord wonld he scouted for not cloingt but wlho in ireland is ani object of the bitteres hatred and suspicion never to l tolerated if he can be possibly got rid of whether lby fair means or foul this is a distinction whiclh it is most important we should not iierely recog nise but keep clearly and constantly in vicw when dealing with any question atecting the treat ment of land in ireland and yet it is olne which the great majority of englishmen aitolgetlher over look it has always beea our tendeny as a nationi when called on to govern other nations to act as if what suitedl us must as a matter of course suit themi or as if at any rate it would be to tiheir benefit to have our institutionls maintainsed by force if necessary among theni unltil tlhu poor benighted creatures had their eyes iradually opened to what was really for their good this tendency is perlhaps partly dcue to a deeprooted belief that wlhatever is british is best and partly to a want of that inmaginative facelty which enables a man to put himself into the posilion of those whose surroundings moral andl mlaterial are wholly different from his own it was this defieiency which according to alr kaye made lord dalhousie despite his splenllid adminis trative abilities a dangerous ruler for a counitry lying so completely beyond the range of his owii actual experience as lndlia and there can be no doubt that for a very long time our national in capacity to look at the native inlstitutionis of india from any but an english point of view more han nentralized the good effects of our philanthropy and superior civilization y with the best intell tions says mr j s mlill  we produced a dis organiation of society which had not been pro duced in that country hy the imost ruthless of its barbarian invaders in the sanmc spirit for getful of the numerous and allimnportant dif ferences existing between englanl andl ireland we establishedcthat  identity of institutions which has been pronounced by so nmany authorities among thern hlr disraeli to be irelands clief crse this identity has operatel mischievously in various ways and not the least so in making hlenglishlmeu unconsciously reason about irish affairs as if siuiilar names denoted similar things kiiuoving for in stance perfectly wvell what an english landilord is expected to do and what as a rule lie does thjey apply the same standard to the irish lndlordl ivlio lhas little in commoii with him but the naime in england agriculture is usually carried on by three classeslandlords farmers and labourers the landlord who as such to begin with is generally a popular character is niot brouight into minmediate contact as a creditor with tbe poorest and most ig norant of his neighbours but deals directly ivith the middle class of farmers who havinl inore or less capital are under little pressure to niako any but fairly remnunerative terms with hiiin and who can easily be induced to see that their interests are closely allied with his ho is in reality and not merely in name absolute master of his own land and local opinionnot only tolerates but seconids him in any rneasures which clearly coniduce to its improvement nobody thinks the wvorse of him unless it be the parties themselves imiinite diately inconvensienced if lie sets his face against subletting or subdividing or cottage building in excess and otherwvise inposes such re straints as it is his special interest and duity as a landlordl to impioso upon overpopulation it is natural and fair enough that so nmicl power should be attended by corresponding responsibility anid that heisce it should geiierallv be regarded as onc of the duties of the landlord anid of those to whom lie delegates a share of his rights in the land to see that the labourer who is willing to workl does iiot starve but when englishmen appy as the great majority do the same theorv of responsibility to the irish landlord and declare that he mnust be in some way neglecting his duty whene theil peasantry cannot get sufficient work or food they areguilty of ildicrotus injustice as mr senor saysthey mighst as well blame the  driigists of ireland i for such a state of things as the lanlords for the former have scarcely less power to prevent it than the li latter in ireland the landlord is in general a mere receiver ofrent his only relationi to lit teblalts is that of a creflitor i he has been accustomed to erect no buildings and meske no imnprovements whatever the tenants lool to him for ro help ancd on the other laud lie can exercise over tlieis little control it is very seldonm that he prescribes to thiemnary system of husbandry or if he lo so that he cain scafely i enforce it be caiinot remove them if dissatisficd with i their treatment of the land still less cani lie do so for the purpose of throwing farns together and introducing theroecesses which requiire large capi lsani large holdivs byen at the expiration of a lease tile lanliord who displaces the eisting occupier is bold the tenalt who takes his place is rash with the labourers the landlord has scarcely uny relatior vbateverit is the height of injustice that a landlord ivlio cannot without risk of beig slhot interfere to arrest tiio deterioration of liis own property or to prevent the tenants from overpopulating shouldheld responsible for their maintenance iwhezn the land fails to support them  and yet this theory of responsibility has been over and over again insisted upon by thoroughly able and just men imposed upon by their notion of the duties of the landlord as they know him in england and has led ther to make the most streiiuous etfforcs to establish a sys tem of relief which as mr senior says would be only a gigantic enlgine of confiscation aiid demo ralization and which would begin by ruiimingn the landlords and end by ruining the countrywe have before warned our readers that mixing almost exclusively with the representatives direct or indirect of the lanlded interest mr senior natï¿½ rally looks at every question from the laiidlords point of view if he had beeu able to see as much of the priests and peasantry as lie saw of the upper classes the value of his book would have been greatly increased but still lie is coimstitmstionally so impartial and so studiously eager to arrive at the truth that his inexperience rarely or niever leads himn into any theory distinctly erroneous in itself although it may cause him to overlook the con siderations on the opposite side which modify or counterbalance it this impartiality is conspi cuously displayed in his treatrnedt of the priests in whose favour scarcely one of his various inter locutors as might be expected has a word to say they are full of anecdotes illustrating the disloyalty bigotry oupidity and ianorasice of the priestbood and all these anecdotes iir senior as the faith ful mirror of the society around him care fully records but we cannot recall ono in stance in which any of his interlooutors spealk of the priesthood favourably and it is therefore to the credit of his impartiality thatwhile unsparingly pointing out all that is mischievous in their teach ing he nevertheless sums up as his opinion that  there is in it much more that is useful to their influence he attributes in a great degree the remark able freedom of ireland from crimes too common in far more prosperous countriessuch as theft burglary robbery with violence unchastity withits usu accompaniment of infanticide he lays stress too upon the notoriously warm and constant domestio affections of the irish peopleupon their unvarying readiness to help a friend or neighbour who is in difficulties the very poorest not holding themselves excused from some slight aid  and this too mir senior connecti with the teaching of the priests when however we come to look at the other side of the picture we find as we found in the case of irish murder that the national failings which the priests connive at and even encourage are unfor tunately just those which do so much mischief rocially and politically that to our thinking they more than counterbalance the moral effects of priestly teaching the priest is the sworn enemy of all real and permanent improvement this is in deed almost a necessity of his position the system which makes him dependent upon his flock for fees makes their chief evil his chief good the larger the population and the greater the subdivision of holdings tho more fees are there to be got out of marriages christenings and burials yor the same reason emigration the most potent of all remedies for the evils of ireland is opposed by the iriest since by reduoing population it reduces his sourecs of profitor unappily does priestly interference for evil siways end ere living constantly among his fockwjouma convorations a rdaiig to xreland my tassau william senior louaoa long mano green and cowith nvhom he is usually on a level in birth tastes and habits and entirely dependent on them the priest not unfrequently finds that he must either lose his hold upon their confidence and submit to a severe pecuniary sacrifice or pander to their most dangerous prejudices and passions in a disloyal community he must be disloyal and throw the whole weight of his opposition against any and every scheme no matter what its in trinsic recommendations which emanates fron governiment this is mr seniors picture or rather that of his interlocutorswe ought per haps to state not oursand it is only fair to re member that on the last occasion in which the loyaltyof the irish priesthood was triedthefenian agitationit stood the test admirably as a body the priests actively and conspicuously exerted all their influence in the cause of peace and order not uierely withdrawing from the rebellion their moral support but publicly throwing what discredit they could upon all engaged in it although by so doing they no doubt greatly weakened their hold upon a large class of their followers it is pos sible indeed that this conduct was partly due to the fact that the fenian agitation was mainly pro inoted by irish americans nvho in the land of their adoption rapidly lose their auperstitious reverence for the early associations of their religion and be tween whom and the priests there accordingly exists but little esteem or sympathy mr seniors theory is rather applicable to cases in which the irish priests find their owrn personal influence as spiritual direc tors of the popular feeling at stake when for in stance their authority is assailed by protes talnt proselytizers or an attempt is made to send to parliament a member likely to take a hostile or too independent view on qiuestioins affecting priestly interests one re iniarkable instance given by mr senior of tho bit terness carried beyond the bounds even of decency wlhiclh a conflict of this kind calls forth is worth iientioniiug especially as it occurred only six years ago a riot had occurred in consequence of some nomain catholics attempting to put down by force the proselytism of a protestant clergyman andlthis is how a dignitary of the itomish churchthe archdeacon of rathkealetakes upon himself to address the jury summoned to try the riotersthere are for trial at the cnarter sessions this week soine persons charged with breaklug the peace towards the spititual traders who have made k the scene of their atteiupts at religious ruini may say spiritual murder for every sincere catholic must and does hold that witliout faith it is impossible to please god and this saving faiththe sine qua non of escape from eter nal tire prepared for the devil and his angelshe be lieves with st athanasius and the universal church of all ages to be that  true catholic faith  without which no ons can be saved in the eyes of every catholic these i mountebanks are persons svho seek to poison to death ithe second death in the lake of fire the souls of all whom they can induce to swallow their doses if a person were indicted for an assault on a spiritual poisoner if i wvere a iurymnan i would without leaving the box acquit the pri soijer if the iutruder had conme for the purpose of robbing no jury would condemn his slaver and iu the e es of every catholic life ought to be of ess value than theeternal salvation of his soul and the faith without which tbat salvationl is impossible to be obtainedi somne years ago i happened on climbing an ascent near coolrussbeing on foot at the timeto come upon a party employed in crowbar fashion in demolishing the houise of a nuau named patrick lacy he held a farm of about  irish acres and had two stalwart hardworking eons who would have made of the land as mauch as it was possible for man to make but not such a rent as it was thought proper to demaud the house was built by that man it vas ruthlessly levelled before his face without of course a shilling coipensation if that iuaui or his nextdoor neighbour had at that moment with the weapon next to hand a pebble from the brook or rather from the road slain the demolisher of his diwelling lie would have no doubt violated the laws but i jwould venture to ask mr in what respect vould that mans act have differed froir that of moses  years ago mloses smote one that he saw oppressing an israelite dots the scripture condeun him does not st paulpraise msea and by implication praise the very deed which caused hmnn to fly from egypt can what was worthy of commen dation by the spirit of god then be the very extreme of guilt in the present daypharaoh was a lawful monarch he bad made laws with all due formality and deliberation yet moses lauchs at the law nsmites the oppressor and is praisednot by st paul but by the spirit of god who spoke by the mouth of st paul i leaving mr  and his biblo readers to unravel this knotty point i say in conclusion that no matter whatlaws or lawyers may sayno matter what old gouty judges with great horsehair wigs may have said on breaches of the peace aind all that sort of thingno honmt jurytnan will ever say  guilty on his oath unless he believes the man on trd l violated the law of god andl incurred guilt in the itht of heaven by the act charged or proved against him if the jurymnu act on any other prineiple he will break his oath as a urymas and bear fadse witness against his neighbour lie will be one to obey men rather than godthis letter was openly printed and addressed to the jurors although as mr spring rice says  in plain english it advocates and justifies mur cier and perjury the conduct of the arch deacon who inculcated these pious precepts upon his flock was formally brought to the notice of both the civil and ecclesiastical authorities and no moans were left untried to convince thera of the necessity as a public example of puntishing or at least cesssuring him the government howvever preferred to take no notice whatever of the offender wlhile all that his spiritual superior the roman catholic bishop didalthough admitted by all piarties to be  a worthy and able mian was to re quire that lie should  recant from the altar which he did in so low a voice that scarcely any one nevw what he was mumbling mr spring rice severely censures the government for their tolera tion of such open outrages as this upon law and public safetv declaring that in ireland the party of order is as much in the presence of an enemy as ever the english were in china and in each case forbearance has beesi taken for timidity and has served to invite aggression it is so hard however if not impossible for the civil authorities to interfere with a romish priest on a religious question without having the worst motives imputed to them and exciting gene ral sympatlty for the offender they wvish to punish that we can easily understand their re fusing to be drawn by even the most extreme case from their habitual policy of nonintervention though certainly if they allow roman catholic archdeacons publicly to send inflammatory ad dresses to juries encourageing violent critne and boliciting legal protection for it it is not easy to see at what point their interference could ever begin to appreciate fully the mischievous tendency of the address our readers must remember that the verdict of a jury in irelandespecially in trials for outrages of an agrarian political or religious cha racteris given a far more significant interpreta tion and is attended with far more important re sults than a verdict in england an english jury is rarely suspected of anything like class sym pathy with crime their leaning is to the side of the law and hence even when they acquit the prisoner in the face of the strongest evidence their conduct is ascribed only to their stupidity or per versity as individuals but in ireland an acquittal under such circumstances is regarded as a sign that the class from which the jury is taken are diposed to sympathize with the criminal and that while this disposition lasts similar verdicts will be given by other juries hence the acquittal of one notorious osfender will produce in his neighbour hood a sudden crop of erimes although for some time previously they have been of ratc occurrenoemr seiior instances a case in which one patrick hayeswellknown to have murdered a neighbourfor venturing to rent a cottage from which hayes had been ejected was acquitted by the jury in face of the evidence the acquittal was immediately fouowed as observant judges at the time predicted m writing by such a cropof murders that a special commissionto inquire into them was considered necessary be sides the irish peasantry think so little of shedding blood whenever certain of their favourite theories are at stake that the merest hint at murder far less an open defence of itby a priest is almost as efficacious as the famous advice  not to nail the bailifps ear to the pump one of mr seniors friends meets in australia an irishman who in answer to a question whetherhe knew such and such a hill coolly replies that he  ought to know it as he spent on its side the coldest night he ever passed waiting to kill a landlord who had promoted emigration the landlord however did not come and the would be murderer fearing he had been betrayed fled to australia  you must have been very glad i said  to have escaped such a sin  faith he answered it was not the sin that i cared about but the fear of being split upon the days let us hope are passed in which bailiffkilling drew from unconcerned spectators nothing more than the re mark what business had he to trouble the gentleman i but even now it is we fear regarded by mnany respectable irishmea of the lower classes as much the same port of excusable weakness as a london rough would consideir breaking the head of his natural enermy the policeman ngr has this cool disregrd for thsaeredness of human life beon confined tothe lower classes of irelahd xlr sefiior wiho byvthe way tells a story or describes a scene as well as most writers of fiction notwithstanding his taste for statistics and dry facts gives the true version of the incidents connected with the murder of the now famous colleen bawn and mentions among other things hoxw one of the murderers her seducer was allowed to go about publicly with impuuity even appearing at shooting parties simply because he was a man of high rank and infuential con nexions it was not until lord monteagle as a ma gistrate had forciblyrepresented to the government the publicscandal occasioned by this highhanded contempt for the law that he was arrested by lord monteagle himself to the intense disgust and astonishmnent of the murderers mother who could not understand how a rice conld arrest a scanlan mr seniors version of the colleen bawn would hoeover we fear meat with but little favour on the stage for instead of marrying and living happily ever afterwards the heroine is really murdered and the hero with his accomplice the fosterbrother and  daddy  of mr boncicaults piece is hangedwe have before mentioned that archbishop whately is one of mr seniors interlocutors fle isindeedthe most prominent figure in the journals and the clear cutting logic and homely raciness of illustration with which his admirers are familiar lose little in mr seniors record of his sayings the archbishop appears moreover to have read the journals in manuscriptfor he occasionally com ments on theories broached in themand to have carefully revised his own share in the conversations recorded wlich of course materially enhances its value one instance of this revision furnishes a curious illustration of the way in which utterlv erroneous views on the most important questions become current almost as it were by accident and how little reports from memory of conversa tions can be depended upon even when the reporter is one so exceptioually experienced and impartial as mr senior he represents archbishop whately as having asserted that in consequence of the  con siderable conversion to protestantism that had been going on for some time previously to  the converts were to be numbered by thousands not by hundrods one can easily imagine how much all champions of the protestant establishment would make of this assertion weighted with the authority of so eminient a man aswhately but as it happens he had never uttered it when he came to revise the journal he inserted the three very little but all important words it is said thus carefully dis claiming any respoiisibility of his own for the cal culation as to the number of protestant converts indeed the archbishop as reported by mr senior seems in his heart to have had very little sympathy with that restless zeal for proselytism which gave no quarter to any form of roman catholicism and did so much mischief to his favourite scheme of a mixed national education as a sincere believer in the unity of truth no less thau as a protestant divine he ardently desired the success of his own creed but he thought that this success could be best obtained gradually by encouraging a com prehensive and enlightened system of education and his strong commion sense prevented his shuitting his eyes as so many worthy protestants contrive to do to the fact that even roman catholicism with all its errors may be a less evil than a ceaseless in ternecine strife between two sects of fellowchris tians which is carried on with about equally futile results so far as conversion is concerned by both sidesthe losses balanciug the gainsbut which stirs up some of the worst of human passions and often leads directly to the most terrible forms of crime the favourite subjects of the archbishops strictures are the zealots who opposed the national education board on the ground that it wvas a con promise with roman catholicismunless indeed we ought to except the lordlieutenantcy upon the evils of which and the urgent necessity for its abolition he is never weary of expa tiating declaring that trite as the objections to the office are they ought to be kept before the public lest the concentrated interests of the few who profit by it and the wish when dealing with a country in the ticklish state of ireland to make no change that can be avoided should temdt governmentafter government to defer a proposal which will of course be opposed and in the pre sent state of parties might be defeated unless it were generally called for  no friend to the union no friend to good government can wisb to retain that office flthbso who hear that the lordlieutenaut is kept at work all day and perhaps half the night infer that he must have niuch to do i have served the office for montbs at a time the lords jus tices in the absence of the lordlieutenant perform all his duties except those connected with patronage ancd re presentation they are not eonployed for two hours in a week the lordlieutenants days and nights are wasted on intrigue and party squabbles on the management of the preag aud the management of ftes on deciding what ruined gambler is to have this stipendiary niagistracy and what repealer is to be conciliatea by asking his wife aud daughter to that concertin short on things nine tetnths of which cannot be so well treated as by being left alone the abolition of this phantom of independence is the first step towards the consolidation of the two countriesit has been the principle of some viceroys to favour the roman catholics that of others to favour the protestants  on yields to tho ultramontanes another to the orantemnoen ad i bave heard of departments in which the vacancies were filled with each sect alternately and papists and protestants were disposed like the squares on a chessboard we probably should not escape the abusa altogether if the appointments were made in england but i think that there would be less of itthe archbisbop though ready enough to make common cause with the roman catholic priests where a good object was to be gainied shows as might be expected but little mercy to their ignorance and other weaknesses he teus mr senior how one young priest hard pressed in an argument declared that such a point was beyond the range of controversy since  we did not po sess the new testament in the original greek and how another who had supported himself  by teaching mathematics detined a triangle as some thing with corners and when asked to draw it made a couple of lines crossing one another thus x but perhaps the best story in the book is the following whicb as it vividly recalls the once familiar but now almost extinct specimen of the old clergy militant of ireland we extract inx full yir senior in a letter to lord lansdowne dated september   saysthe most interesting person that i have seen is mr hastings the rector of kihmnacreenan a man well born and highlyconnected and in manner and appear ance the most perfect specimen of tho best class of the old irish olergy fortyfour years ago having served and still servicg in one of the irish militia regiments he took orders and became curate of selbiidge in the county of wicklow but the state of the country was not such as to enableany good officer to be spared so he kept his military rank and drew his pay and on sundays used to put a gown over his military trousers and boots ancd directlr lie left the pulpit put on his red coat and parauo his men he was re warded with the rectory of kilmacreenan in tho centre of the rerotest part of donegal containing  people and about  square miles ribandismorangeism catholicism and protestantism had been so fierce that his predecessor was aotually worried out the political differences he could not appease but he thought he oould the religious ones so he begged the catholic priest and the presbyterian ministers to meet him at letterkenny then and now the nearest town on a market and fairday gave them as good a dinner as the place could afford and as much whisky punch as ho could induce them to take not a little nd then walked with them in high glee round the fair much astonishmentwas escited by this strange conjunction and to strengthen theeffect he engaged them to meet bim at the borers of his own parish the meeting took placouley roao together over thovle ailndccud to evening in the whiskycabih by potations which would havedisturbed lay hends since that time he has had no reli gious differences his church now wants repair and the catholic priest has sunt bim two pounds for his own sub scription and recommaended it from the altar i do not know that this tells well on paper but delivered by the hearty old rector in his rich brogue it was irresistible
