tee revolution n spaintkprom our special correspondentmadrid jail eighteen hundred and sixtynine could not rise in madrid under more favourable atmospherical auspicos the revellers who sat up to see the old year out and the new year in have beheld such a night and behold now such a daybreak as may well incline them to look with resignation on past miseries and with confidence on future dangers the political aspect of affairs is not quite so brilyiant as that of the heavens but even in that respect we have so far gained that the period of transition and uncertainty is drawing to a close and that many of the questions with which human foresight was either unable or unwilling to deal find their natural solution in the gradual but incessant action of time the great battle of communism is being fought out in andalusia there never was any doubt as to its results the difficulty was not in conquering  it only lay in the hesitation aboutighting communism was the abortion of the re volution imaternal tenderness could not for a long time bo brought to look with aversion on the mon eter and consent to its destruction it strove to favour its development by denying its birth to hide its deformities by hugging the bantling to its bosom when concealment was no longer prac ticable it pleaded that vital connexion by which the fate of the parent would necessarily be involved in that of the offspring it bade the wouldbe child slayer choose between freedom and order it de nied the possibility of their coexistencebut selfdelusion and forbearanco had limits the people or at least the populace had to be put dovn indeed the cruel necessity of distinguish ing between the people and the populace became apparent in some of the towns of andalusia the electors on their way ito the polls were stopped by bands of resolute and even dangerouslooking men who inquired whether they were going to vote  for the rich or the poor partisanship was reduced to mere class warfare  the conclusion of all poli tical discussions says a soville letter ws the establishment of the common right to the national property and its practical application to the re partition of all property the question being based on these very simple terms it was evi dent that  the rich must either fight for or sur render their riches for nearly threo months tho less generous counsel prevailed the wealthy classes in andalusia migrated cn masse the flower of the landed and commercial aristocracy of those provinces crowded the madrid hotels had they been left to their unaided resources they wonld have been victims to their dastardly dereliction of duty and judgment would have gone against them by default luckily for them the government took up their cause as tho common cause the spanish cavaignac general cabauero de rodas went down to andalusia to overthrow the barricades behind which tho national workshops reared their heads the immediate task was to disarm the popu lace the next would be to starve them into the recognition of the duty instead of the right of work france has only one popular centre only one decisive battle in paris is needed and then there ensues silence and submission but spain hasa c court for a capital it is not in madrid that revolutionary conclusions are ever tried caballero de rodas went down to fight tho andalusian cities one by one there was a short and sharp slaughter at cadiz  the report of the cadiz gmns was suffi cient to quell jerez seville antequ ern tarifa and all the towns on the hill hnd the coast the turn came for malaga the hotbed of all social disorders from the outset malaga was not all up in arms like cadiz but neither was it au prostrate and passive as seville at malaga a portion of the armled people shrank from resistance to the government another part even tendered its cooperation  out of nine battalions of the volunteers of freedom said a member of the provisional go vernment to me seven are for us two only are against us yet not only were those two battalions up to yesterday more than a mlatch for the seven others but even today the new year dawns on their desperate struggle both against their tovn aldversaries and against the government forces sent to support themcaballero de rodas gives proof of great temper no less than of rare firmness he attempts not to conciliate for that would be a hopeless task but to intimidate to frighten rather than to tempt the multitude into submission the bloodshed at cadiz was mainly if not wholly due to the suddenness of the attack on the part of the government agents caballerogoestoworkuponaltogetheradifferentpln ele comes down on the doomedplace with something of the slow and dehberate but inevitable march of fate he makes a great display of his forces from a

succeeded ini at least tbreefourths of the southern kingdom atmalaga up to yesterday morning tbero was parleying and hopes were entertained that effusion of blood might bc avoided caballero had given the insurgents time to consider what they would do there were to be no hostilities till this morning at  oclock the refractoryvolunteers had intrenched tlmnselves behind several lines of barricades in the dtricts of the trinitad and perchel caballero occupied the railway station  pavia under his orders vas at the customhouse  the alameda and all other open loca lities were beset by the troops from the bastions of gibralfaro and from tbhsea the batteries of the fort and of two menofwar threatened the town with bombardment in the course of the day the insurgenta fired from their barricades aud had to be driven froni their foremost lines at tha point of the bayonet the contest however seemed to have led to no decisive results and hopes vere enter tained this evening at a late hour that there might be no necessity for the contemplated attack of this morningjanurajy the hopes of avoiding a severe struggle at malaga have been disappointed on the expiration of the perod alowed for a truce gencl cabauero de rodna ordered the batteries ofthe castle of gibral fare and of the tro menofwar to open fire upoa tho city the cannon i wastold was at work a greatpart of the day towards evening as a member of the provisional government assured me  all was over aud tlle latest evening paper also con cluded its account of the event by a staternent that  the commanderinchief had telegraphed that ho looked upon the malaga insurrection as terminated wve must not forget that the same conclusions had been hastily arrived at with respect to the cadiz conflict and that the government there had to con tradict assertions which had been put fortlh as posi tive and official but au i said on that occasion about cadiz i may now repeat about malaga the contest whether or not it be at an end at th pre sent moment can only have one ultimate result the subjugation of spain is a mere question of time re publican organs and committees cry out that they are being imimolated and deliberato whether they ought tomako head herein aladridorwhetherit would not be a better policy to deliver up their arms ahtici pating the governaments orders so as to avoiq both the humiliation of a submission and tho horrors of a struggle reserving their forces for such oppor tunities as may enable them to meet their ad versaries with equal weapons but whatever may be their conclusions it is quito sure that they will either not fight at all or only very feebly and in efficiently hesitation and irresolution have lost them their only chance had they not stood look ine on whilo cadiz was fauing their causo would not have been altocether desperate but after that tirst example all teo towns of spain feel that they may be overpowered one by one without any hope of cooperation or mutual rescue the provincial cities must become aware of the uselessness of a selfsacrifice bywhich the capital would never bo in a position to profit alrea y at malaga whlere the rebelious spirit was so much more activo than anywhere else tho actual resistance seems to have been much less resolute and unanimous than at cadiz theoconfidence of tho armed peoplo in its own force is already visibly shaken it wiu soon be uttorly overcome on the other hand ono can not see what the republicans could have to expect by looking upon the cause of theso  volunteers or freedom as closely associated with their own of what they could gainby identifying democracy with communism their model of a perfect community is the great north american federation and f should like to know in what country any infringement of the right of property wvould be moro strenuously resisted than in the united states shallowpated as some of these spanish republican leaders must be allowed to be i do not think they would openly stand up as apostles of communism but they looked upon the armed people and tho national workshop as a weapon in their own hands and they did not wish that weapon to be broken before it had wrought out their own purposes thodisarmament of tho populace de prives tho republicans of their armyan army in sober truth which was expected not to fight but simply to intimidate of  electors at sevile only  presented themselves at tho polls at the late municipal elections the republicans carried an easy victory but what will it be at the next par liamentary trial if al parties are sufficiently reas sured to venture upon a free expression of their wishes if no one will any longer venturo to ask whether it befor the richor for the poor that electors are going to votein the siupposition that caballero do rodass cni sade against communism may bo successful and that the authorities may succeed in reestablishing public security on a somewhat satisfactory basis in the cities tbero will yet remain not a littlo to be done before the notions of what the world acknow ledges as right and wrong may regain their full ascendancy in the rural districts the pictures given by private correspondents of tho
