to the cause of free trade to see the finance minister of russia ac knowledge that the alterations made in the tariffs of l and  had no prejudicial influence and that on the contrary they were accompanied by a very rapid developraent of national industry also that as far as the reventue was concerned the chauges in the tariff had the effect of preventing the further decrease in receipts which would have inevitably ensued if the government had not re solved in time to alter the tariff  and lastly that their effect was  an augmentation of customs revenue from almost all the articles on which re ductions had been effectedthe process by wbich the russian government became alive to these facts and at last resolved to give practical effect to such experience may be learnt from the reports of the british chambers of commerce anld from a report on the trade betwveengreat britain and russia by mr t nichell then i attach to hler majestys embassy at st peters burg presenited to both houses of parliament in it appears that about that time after makingc vain complaints of the unsatisfactory state of the trade betveen great britain and russia the cham bers of commerce were induced on the suggestion of sir andrew buchanan her majestys ambassador at st petersburg and on the earnest encourage i ment of the earl of clarendon as secretary of state for foreign affairs to send a deputation to an ex hibition of russian industrv and mr s s lloyd chairman of the associated chambers accordingly proceeded to moscow in the snmmer of  ac companied by mr j d goodman of birminghamn and by mlr t miichell of the british emibassy the reports mnade by those gentlemen and pub lished in mir michells elnebook are full of in terest the object of their mission was at once suspected bythe moscow protectionists it seems to have been very little concealed for at a banquet given by the exhibitors to the governor of tmoscow mir nmichell with great boldness threw dowvn the gauntlet of free trade and told them that their manufactures had attained such a remarkable de gree of perfection that the time had apparently ar rived for a reduction of the burden wvhich  mil lions of consumers had so long borne and for an improvement of the foreign trade and revenuo of russiathe altercations which ensued in tlle russian press between the moneyed protectionists and the theoretical professors of freetrade doctrines brouglht the question of the tariff prominently before the public and the government the chambers of comimerce of the zollvereim and of austria also came forward with violent denunciations of the commercial policy of russia and urged their governments to negotiate a better tariff with russia i as well as improved customs laws and regulations the abuses and vexations to wlhich the foreign tradeof russia appears to have been subjected are almost  incredible they nmust have dono much towards keeping up if not increasing the distrust and aver sion withnwhich russia has hitherto beeni regarded in europe the foreign trade of russia had to a great extent gone into the hands of smulggalers and fraudulent customhonse agents who easily pur chased the connivance of government officials in their profitable undertakings and as a natural con sequence honest merchants wvore driven out of the imnort tradecount bismark in a speech to the prussian ciambers in  estimated the value of the goods annually smuggled into russia at about  millions sterling  while in the report on the trade be tween great britain and rtussia it was almnost mathlematinally demoustrated that the russian revenue front customs might easily be increased by two millicns sterling by reducing the duties to a level that woould render smuggling no longer profit ablewhile the moscow protectionists vere organi zing their forcs to oppose these attacks the britishchlambers of commerce sent two mlore emissaries to  russia in the persons of mr h j atkinson then mayor of hiull and mr j wrigley of hudders field these gentlemen had interviews with mwany of the manufacturers and merchants and with vzirions official personages in russia and did their utmost to persuade them how very little russian manufacturing industry had to fear from a modifictio of the tariff at the same time endeavouring to poinlt ot what gat t advantages to the imperial reveauo anld to the interests of consumers might be expected to reult from a reasonable revisionof itithis moral pressure seems to have had some effect on the russian government which not unnatu rally may have feared to lose the confidence of in vestors in foreign stock from pursuing any longer a eomnercial policy which was both antiquated and ruinotus especially since the trade of russia with great britain showed a decrease of  per rent during a period that markled an increase of  per cent in the trade of great britain with france at last on the th of july  the minister of finance was forced to confess in a report to the emperor that the heavy burdens which the imperial treasury is called upon to bear render it incumbent on the minister of finance to discover new means of meet ing the increasing expenditure of the state and that it had become necessary to reduceo the tariff w with a view both to counteract the extensive con traband trade produced by the excessiveness of the duties and to promote the reglar trade of the countryprior however to this public confession culmi nating as it did in a recommendation to appoint a commnission for the revision of the tariff thenlinister appears to have charged certain oflicials in his department with the preparation of a draughtof an amended tariff the result of their la bours was appended to the ministers memorandum andi is given atlength in no  of the coom i met cial reports from eer majestys consuls for g their recommendations were principallylimited to a removal of the differential rates and tothe expression of duties  in round numbers quite i irrespective of the relation which they may have borne to prime cost moreover one of the appendices to the ministers memorandumn was a compa i rative table of duties levied in russia france prussia and austria in which the rates levied in the three latter countries were actually taken from tariffs that had been long previously abolished by comtnercial treaties although still applicable to countries like russia and portugal iin order to establish the average prices of manu factured goods and the relation which the proposed epecific duties would bear towards them the british chambers of commerce sent delegates to the paris exhibition of  wlhere they submitted to certain russian officials nominated for the purpose tabular rtatements of prices amd cost of production mr miehell subsequently embodied these statements in a series of memoranda which he wvas permitted to submit in the russian language to the tariff commission which assembled in the autamn of  the prussian government at the samne time re newed their representations and sent twvo commis sioners to st petersburg with the object of negoti ating greater commercial facilities but those gen tlemen were obliged to leave russia without obtain ing the desired advantages and without oven having been admitted to any discussion of the customs dutiesfrom a desire to appear liberal and apprehensive of the illfeeling which an opposite policy might have created in the country the russian goverr ment caused the tariff commission to be composed partly of officials and partly of manufacturers the re sults of associating the condemned with their judges may be imagined no means were left untried to intimidate the latter chosen as they were from aulong the most honourable and most enlightened officers of the government finding it difficult to maintain their position as impartial judges the official members of thecommission soutghtatlast only to effect compromises between conflicting opinions particularly after they had been anonymously denounced as corrupt and ignorant to the emperor the protectionist party set up a press of their own and used it vigorously for the prosecutiou of their ob jects  and not satisfied with preserving all their more important interests at the tariff commission they succeeded in obtaining the appointment of a committee composed of four or five members of the councils of the empire and of the cesarevitch and grand duke constantinethe recommendations of the tariff commission moderate as they appear to have been were then examined by the new committee and in the majority of cases set aside for still more moderate views and measures excepting in the case of greek wines which the committee referred to a much lower class of duties than french wines and in that of greek currants which are henceforth to enter the empire of russia free of customs dutyit is under these disadvantages that a new tariff has been enacted for the empire of rnssia and comes into operation on tho st th of january next an english edition of it has just been pub aished by mr mlichell in parallel columnns showing the engdlish equivalents for the russian rates the followving are its principal featuresthe number of paragraphs or positions has been reduced from  to  of which  refer to goods admitted duty freeanid  to those of which the im portation is prohibited leaving  groups or classes of duties leviable with two exceptions on specific weights or certain units the two ad veaorem rates of  per cent on readymade clothes and  per cent on linen cambric and lawn mark as it were the highest limits of the protection which the new tariff was intended to bestow on native ma nufactiures a reference however to the memno randa which mr michell submitted to the tariff conimission will clearly show that even some of the reduced specific rates rango up to  per cent and more on the value of the goods imposed the re ductions are evidently not based on any system or general plan either for protective or fiscal pur poses compared with the cnstoms duties levied in other countries the new russian rates present the most extraordinary devia tion from the general european basis and look indeed what they in reality are the result of com promises between the interests of powrerful manu facturers and those of  millions of consumers as represented at the council of the empire fortu nately for the maritime trade of russia the recom mendations of the minister of finance for the aboli tion of the differential duties was adopted by the council except in the case of tools which are still to be favoured with a reduction of duty when imported overland s illd per cewt by land instead of s d ver cwvt by sea utith the ob ject of protecting the manufactsre of tools at t peters bnor it being all the while noto rious that the russian markets are glutted with cheap german tools bearing counterfeited sheffield trademarks the official remonstrances of sir andrew buchanan the british ambassador against this injustice to british trade appears to have been unheeded and the influential manufac turer at st petersburg has obtained the premium which will enable him to impose inferior tools on the russian workman inext to the abolition of differential duties we notice with satisfaction the disappearance of the  per cent additional duties and the special bridge tax of  per cent levied at the port of st petersburg w hich taxes says m do rentern  have complicated the accounts of the customs while the bridgetax was not nnfre quently avoided by clearing goods destined for st petersburg and moscow at customhouses on the land frontierapart from these improvements in the russian tariff the folloving reductions may be mentioned as hearing more particularly on the export and car rying trade from b rn at britain to russiaa ineso reaquctons are calculated on tho rates proviousy charged at seaportsagainst these reductions must however be set off a slight increase of several duties those on cal eined and caustio soda white lead hemp flax and woollen yarn silk twist silk stuffs c and a new duty on machinery except airicultural spinnimlg weaving
