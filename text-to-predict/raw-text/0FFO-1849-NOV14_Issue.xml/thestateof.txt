the state of europefrancea portion onkly of the following intelligenoe apppared in the second oditlon of the times of yesterday the following is the letter of our paris oorre spondent dated monday  pmthe friends of m thiers announce that he has received an autograph letter from his holi ness the pope which as might be expected has gratified him beyond measure the sovereign pon tiff has according to the same authority addressed him as his dearly beloved eon and informs him that they both erred in thinking that the period had arrived for giving full liberty to the people he eulogises m thiers for his brilliautreport on the roman expedhion and concludes by giving him the pontifical benedictionit was rumoured on friday evening and on the following day that his holiness had actually ar rived at rome these rumours however were pre mature it had been feared that the pope would show some hesitation in taking that step in conse quence of the obange of the ministry and the mes sage of the president and that he dreaded lest the policy of the new cabinet should be of a less moderate character than that which characterized the late one i am assured however on good au thoritythat thefrench goveroment havej ustreceived despstches of a very recent date from rome of a satisfactory kind and which state that whatever fears might bate been entertained by his holiness as to the policy of the present french government beingless coiliating than that of the late cabinet have eatirely disappeared and that pius  wiu certainly return to his capital without any unneces sar delay we may therefore expect from day to day to receive news of that interesting event having teken place it must be understood however halt french diplomacy will not cease to counsel his htoliess to avoid all measures of a reactionarykind and to grant such reforms as wril be fomnd ex pedient vte ilinisters of war and the interior went on satuiday to the general committee of finantoee and gave detilled explanations on the foreign relations and internalstate of the country gleneral dhaut poul ww had before entering the ministry declared that it was poesible to introdace cousiderable savings ia the war budget wished to justify the hopes to which he had given rise he said tbat without diminishing the cadres the effective strength of the army might be oonsiderably reduced and tbat a saving of at least oco might be effected even on the budget of this year eso long however as the french army occupied rome it would be difficult to bring back the strength to  men in that case the effeotive strength for the year  would bo about  the minister of the interior declared on his part that the governmentproposed by a better organization of the gendamrire rnobile and the police agents to effectually oppose the tendencies of the socialists and demagogues and to reestablish order ind tran quillity the declarations of general dhautpoul were not known to the committee charged to examine the demand for extraordinary credits amounting to nearly  for expenses not foreseen in the war budget for this year and the report on which has just been distributed to the assembly this report states that the real effective strength of the army has exceeded this year by  men and  horses the previsions of the original budget and has carried up the army to  men and  horses the preceding minister general rubliere had ordered the sending back of the class of  but he thought that in order to reduce in a material manner the strength of the army that of  should also be sent home and that then the average time of service would be less than two years which would be injurious to the discipline and in struction of the soldier the committee admitted thejustice of the observations of the minister but it thought it its duty to insist that as few young sol diers should be called under arms as possible it also thought that the increase of the cajres was a real obstacle to the reduction of the effective strength of the army and in its report it reminds the govern ment of art  of the constitution whith pre ecribes that the cadres of the army should be fixed by special laws the presentation of whicho is to take

with higk patronage may look at political struggles with a sort of neatrality all that is then necessary is the pacific cooperation of ideas and doctrines but in a time of serious convulsion when these struggles are for the greater part vialent aud have for their object the overthrow or the maintenanea ef social order the part of the administrators becomes more active and their operationa more extensive and more imperative they are then the firat soldiers of order it is their duty to rush to every breach to defend it with energy and to endeavour by intelligent and assiduous efforts to closa it to resist the enterprises of anarchy is not reaction against progres it is to secure its course and enlighteu its object the policy of the govornment of the republic has two essential condi

au good citizens whom love for their country and a regard for their own interests oneht to draw round a strong and vigilant administration it is necessary that the impuis sheuld be general energetic and sustained in or der to produce all its effect we take oar example in the conduct of tho ehief of the government himself who has loudly and firmly manifested his will not to forget any one of the obligations of his popular mandate the course that he indicates to us with the sure instincts of his patriotiem is the best  let us not hesitate to engage in it with him we shall flian him couragoous

the measures which you consider necessary to strengthen authority and protect order so necessary for ths liberty and the prosperity of the country receivo mx le prfet the assurance of my very diatinuished considera tion ferdinand barrotthe following extracts from a remarkable article in the joournal des dzbatsand which is generally attributed to the pen of an eminent statesman and exministeron the present state of affairs will be found interesting instead of preducing a fusion of shades of party i only obtained a neutralization of forces said the president in his message of october  and when that phrase was read in the legislative aseembly a voice exclaimed  thit is true we hold that siogle voice to bo the true one we believe that what the presflont reproached the last ministry with was for having neutralized forces instead of uniting shades and we admit that it was for that reason that the mi nistry was chauged the difforent forces which comnoso the moderate party will not neutralize themselves more than any other but if they are not neutralized if they aro restored to their natural activity that actioa may lead to two very dif ferent effectsthey may concert together to lead to a com men object they may some day separate and even come into collision if they neutralize themselves by destroyint one another it will be worse than remaining balanced aor first conclusion is therefore that a system which neutralizes forces by balancing them must not be departed from for ono which would neutralize them by destroying them oar enemies would profit by such a fatal error it has been thought that the moderae party could not proceed in the path which was made for it and that it was foroed to re main passive or to separate we maintain that a grest go vernmental party cannot be idle to govern is to act but decided as we are not to renounce the union of the idodirate party until the last extremity we would ask whether that party has not yet a common action to exercise a common objdct to attain we would in a word examine wrhother the diversities which it contains are greater and more important than the unity of the object which it pursues the debats then proceeds at some length to show that nothing has occurred which ought to prevent the accord of the majority for this common object which is the establishment of a strong government for themaintenance of order and the protection of person and property the article concludes as fol lowswe certainly do not lightly consider political powerw for it i the mot efficacious instrument of

changes of ministry and the message of the president of the republic so far as commerce and in dustry are concerned was remarkable i have already mentioned that the effect in paris was null the same indifference was manifest at rouen havre and generally in al the manufacturiug dis tricts situated withia a short distance of the capital but no smau disquietude was produced as the dis tance increased in the south for instance the transactions in silks brandies and madder suddenly stopped but it is more than probable that they will be resumed the moment the commercial accounts from paris and the adjoining markets shall have reached tho southern departments silks of the finest quality have within the last week found a rapid sale in paris and although the manufactories of lyons now occupy between od ana ooo workmen yet the warehouses of that city are empty and the richest silks have recovered the price they were sold at long previous to the revolu tion of february several of the manufacturers are even now executing the orders of the mercers of the capital for the strong and massive fabrics in fashion  years ago watered stuffs and broad satins readily sell for f the yard figured satins and damaske are equally in great demand and were it not for the cholera which during the last eventful summer made such ravages amongst the fashionable society of paris that branch of trade would have before this resumed considerablesotivity ordersforexportationhave somewhat diminished but the manufacturers not having been able to com plete all those they received and having demanded a leng term for that purpose constant employment is secured to the workmen at least to the endof the year large quantities of artioles of parisian ma nufacture such as jewellery bronzes

three large vessels laden with these articles are on the point of sailingfrom lhavre for the argentine republicoperations are somewhat less animated in most of the commercial marts this relaxation is how ever lees to be attributed to want of demand than to the scanty supply of raw materials at havre nantes bordeauxr and marseilles the supply of coffee and cotton is so limited that merchants hesi tate to pay for them the high pricei demanded by the holdere the same is the case at nimes aubenas roman and avignon where raw silk particularly of the first quality has become ex tremely scarce owing in great measure to the failure of the crop in italy a letter from st quentin states that there is not a single loom idle in that place and that the workmen who a few months ago were earning only
