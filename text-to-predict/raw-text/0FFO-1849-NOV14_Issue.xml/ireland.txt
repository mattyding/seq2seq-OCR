irrylandworig of the poor lawfrom om own colmnpondimtdublin tueay mowumgtfhe elected board of guardians for the union of tilrush met on saturday last and after the ordi nary business had been disposed of the necessity of striking a new rate was brought uuder discussijon it appeared that the last rate struck was in march last nearly eight months since and from a call tioninade by one of the board mr keaneof thepro bable expense of defraying the liabilatien ï¿½of eaq of the electoral diejajons for the year itworud require a rating so enormous that it woeuld be manifestly absurd to attempt to enforce it all at once or the  eleetbral divisions forming the union a rate would be required varying from s ed the mini mum to ns bid the mwimff  on the pound and as it was to be borne in mixd that this estimate was made upon the present valuation which was considered much too high some idea might be afforded of the embarrassed state of the union ciot withbtanding that it had received government aid through captain kennedy to the amount of x after a good deal of diseussion at the suggestioll of captain kennedy it was resolved to strike a uniform riate of e in tue pound which it was thought would be sulbcient to meet the wvants of the union until the month of march next it further trans epired in the course of the proceedings that the beautiful watering village of kikee tbe ings towsn of the county of clare had literally become a desert and that it would be ueeless to strike a rate there until marcb some of the members present sug gested that the entire division should be exempted for the present hut there were other objections to this course and the hoard could not come to a eatisfactozy conclusion on the subjectlotd rodei and the civan  oraeormenthe orangemen of the county of cavan deeply sympathizing with lord roden on his removal from the commission of the peace have presented his lordship with an address which for plain speaking to use a very gentleterm altogether casts into the shade any previous manifestoes of a similar purport emanating from these incorrigible monopolizers of loyalty and obedience to the ruling powerswe regard they say your present position in a twofold lightfirst as individually the subject of the foulest slander and grossest misrepresentations in the public organs of popery and infidelity and at the same time the object of the scorn and rabid violence of all that is unholy and opposed to god and eis truth in the land we shall not insult you by deemirg it necessary to be the apologists of your lordship against the infamous assaults now made on you we content ourselvesv ithindiguantly repudiating the monstrous attemapt to identify you with what was illegal in its charaoter or murderous in its intention or its tendency in the course vwhich you took on the th of last july wo equally repel the preposterous assurmption that in entertaining and deciding upon the case of the accused orangemen at castiewellan in the ordinary course of petty sessions jurisdiction you were adjudicating on your own case thjb is the unfounded assertion of thoseo who in their own malignant minds had already arraigned triedand con victed you and held you up as guilty before the public of charges which were most unjustly attempted to bo fastened oni you and which in a marked manner you took that op portunity to show you considered did not in the slightest degree attach to you we now cease to regard you in your individual capacity suffice it to say tbat if there be a man in the empire whose character can stand like a rock un ehaken by all the waves of obloquy and slander which malice and falsehood can pour in upon it it is the earl of roden but my lord we believe that it is your representa tivo character which has brought down upon you all the vengeanco of her majestys government too many of whoee acts legislative and executive inti mnate their unmistakable purpose to establish popiah asecendancy in ireland and to deal out hard blows and sore discouragement against everything protestant in the land and convinced we are that the government con sider that they havo drawn a prize in being able to pounce upon one who has so long atood forward as the fearless and consistent leader of those opposed to their nefarious designs therefore not only as orangemen but as protestants we consider your caueo our own and the insults and injustice now heaped upon you as equaly aimed at and attaching to ourselves as oramgemen we are held up as the offgcour log of society the ljeviathan of the press in england in one of its late vituperative articles against your lordehip designates our institution as the twin sister of ribandismand the irish undersecretary of state in his lelter direct ing your superscdeas clearly debases the one to the low level of the other we inbabit a country where ribandism is rifewhere that murderous secret conspiracy bas shown tibelf stronger than the law to whicb as loyal peaceable subjects we havo a right to look for protection and it is our undoubted experience as cavan men that to the existence of our organized body and to tie wholesome dread of its bone and sinew is to be attributed under god tho fact that peace is in any measure restored to our once troubled borderthat ribandism is not now desolating our county and prastly agitation as it did once insulting and madden cag the protestant peasantry by its inenstrous arrays my lord wo believe indeed we know it that your experience in the county of down in thia reipect is very similar to ourown and asured we are that on theth of lastjulyyou opened the gates of your noble park to the assembled orangemen not only to receive a proffered homage and compliment from imen who loved and admired you but also to discharge a debt of gratitude to these to whom you felt you and socety at large owed so much you have increased our obligations to you by giving prominence in your evidence before the go vernment commiesioners from our printed rules and ordi dances to what the real principles of orangeism are and what is the practice of every true orangeman and surely my lord it in the highest degree outraes au sense of justice to take our book of rules in the one hand and the garbledandperverted histoy of the la mentable dollys brae affir in the other and say in the taunting languageof our maligners behoidhereorangeisil and there rangemen here theory and there practice altogether suppressing the cardinal fact that any resort to the use of force by the orangemen on that occasion was the unavoidable result of a deliberate and murderous onslaught orn unoffending mes the idea of insult or injury to raortal being far removed at the time from their mindsmen too be it remembered who entered on the procession on the morning in the vivid recollection of the patronago and support which the orange institution had received from the viceroy on its last commuemoration of the same anni vereary at a time when it was considered that an open and organized manifestation of the unwavering loyalty of its members wvould matorially aid his excellency in suppressing the robelion which then threatened tho land my lord we assert in the face of the empire and in the realized presence of him who kno eth the heart that in the midst of many and soro provocations to the contrary it is our earnest desire to reduce to practice in our daily valk that obligation which wra solemnly imposed onour consciences when we first assumed the name of orange that while by au lawful means we resist the ascendancy of the church of rome its encroachments and the exten sion of its power we should also abstain from all unchari table words actions or feelings towards our roman catholic brethren these are the principles which have through evil report and good report connected you with our institution and it was the solemn and formal recognitien of these on the remodelling of our institution in  which has rallied roundourstandard lergraen deputylieutenants and justices of the peace in this and othor counties  and except when exposed to intolerable provocation we can con fidently appeal to experience whether our practice hau not been in accordance with our principlesin reply to all this lord roden has little more to may than that he bears the indignity which has been put upon him by the government with  unrufflod ninda conscious of his integrity the falsehood of the insinuations cc more thoughtful than the noblemen and gentlemen who met at the leitrim hotel to condole with their chieftain the orange men of cavan
