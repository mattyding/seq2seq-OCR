theeermondsey murderexeoution of the manningsyslorday morning at  oclock prederick george man nang and maria manning his wife were hanged in front of ilorsriongger lane gaol for the murder of patrick connor the crime for which they suffered was com nitted on the th of august and between the act and its punihmnent three months and three days have olapsed thus affording another great proof if suchwere wanted that justice in this country pursues its victims with footstcps swift and sure and that though deeds of violonce and blood may be concocted with tho greatest premeditation thoy can rarely escape the dtoec tion and punishment even of an earthly tribunal ocon nors grave was dug a month before it received his body the intimacy between him and his murderers gave them tnusual facilities for taking his life with impunity no eye eaw nor did ear hear when the death wound was given his mangled remaina were baried in a bed of quicklime to hasten tho process of decomposition and every method that tho ingoauity of the criminals could suggest was taken to destroy the traces of their guilt the chances of light even were afforded to them the woman had one and the man noarly three weeks start of their pursues when the track they bad each taken was discovered the woman especially bad amplo moans at herposal for accelerating her escape nor was the malo convict so destitute of money as to be ablo to continue his flight yet it was all in vain they were discovered by their predominant vicesmanning by the quantity of brandy whioh he drank his wife by tho in eatiable avarice which tempted her to offer the muidered maas railway scrip for sale at edinburgh the evidenco produced against thom when tried was entirely eircaum stantial yet never wa guilt made more clearly manifest down to the minutest dotails their murder of oconnor was proved the purchase of the quicklime and the crowbar vas established and even the pistol with which the fatal elhot vas fired was produced in court though the charactor of the nurdered man could hardly quicken the desire to avenge his death and left society little reason to regret iiis loss yet the majosty of the law and the sanctity of human life wero completely vindicated his murderers were coan demned to suffer the penalty of their oaormous crime and yesterday they were publicly hanged upon the scaffoldthe almost unprecedonted spectacle of a husband and wife exocuted for murder has naturauy excited much speculation us to tho extent of their guilt respectively although in the eye of the law thero is no question of degree whore murder is tno charge proved yet mercy oftea steps in to save and the moralist recoganies different phases of sin in a deed which must always be enorfous with the mannings hovrever it is useess and perhaps improper to pursue such inquiries they were both clearly guilty of a diabolical and coldblooded murder and it cannot be for a moment doubted that they both deserved the ignominious fate which bas overtaken them the confessions of dying criminals often receive a degree of crodit to which they are by no ceans entitled  for the mass of mankind are reluctant to believe that words of repentance spoken in that awful hour when all the hopes of this world are at an end can be anything but truthful the statements made by manning therefore will probbly be received by many as trustworthy and it wiu be thought as he has represented that he was a enera tool in the hands of his wife whose uncontrolled tem per and impetuous will working upon his weak and cor rupted out not crael disposition dragged him after her into the abyss of crime the whole tenour of his confessions is exculpatory of himself and his wife is made to bear mearly au the odium of a crime ia which she might perhaps be the chief actor without being the greatest culprit mannings wife died without confession up to the last wrnoment denying her guilt or at least refusing to acknow ledge it and exhibiting an amount of courage and nerve which contrasted strangely with the terrorstricken aspect of her husband there has been a diabolical eerry of character displayed by her throughout which has attracted to her conduct a stil larger share of public atten tion than to that of manning her handsome figure fo reign origin and various other considerations con tributed to this effect and it is due to her to say that no man could have borne himself more firmly thsn sho did in the terrible part which she had to perform et as will bo ceen from the narrative which is subjoined there were some traces at last disclosed by her of a heart not utterly cadous the ecene in thcahapol before the pro coss of pinioning commenced and again the final farewell tetween the guilty couple ore the dron fell were singular il tustratiens of the truth that there is no humaa being how cver faulen in whom some sparks of feeling and earthly sym pathy do not lingerthese introductory observations may perhaps proparo the rader to form a justor appreciation of the folowing facts connected with the last moments and execution of the cri urinalson monday night the last which the miserable culprits were to spend on earth the rev mr rowe chaplain to the ol visited maria mauning in her ceu shortly after  oclock and remained with her till aftor  oclock during thv whole of that period she was engaged ia making a pro tnded confession to the rev gentleman carefully oxcluding from that confessionif such the rambling and evidently faso statements wlhich sho made may be cauedevery appearance of an acknowledgment that she had any guilty participation in the murder of patrick ocon nor sho pleaded entire ignorance of the crime be yond the fact that it had boen perpotrated by a young man from jcrsey and mr rows in vain endeavoured to draw out of her an explaination as to how she got possession of the murdered mans keya after the close of his inter view with the womaan mr rowe sought her husband aud wu with him til  oclock in the morning he considered that mhnning was perfectly resigned to his fate but he waea man of a very impetuous temperament and became very petulant when mr rowe acting on principle refused to communicate to him all that his wife had said rerpoctiugj hia share in the murder both the pri ecaers were in the habit of pressing him for this species of information but he always treated the application usiflhe hd boon acting between porsons whowere total astangers to each other on leaving for the night manning aid to mr rowe i hope to see you sir tomorrow morning at  oclock during the night which he passed without undresing he scarcely slept at all but read ear netgly and frequently the st psalm the th and th verses of vwhich ho considered very applicable to his situation during tho morning the singular idea seized himi of leaving to some of the turnkoys mementoes of him in his own hand writing and he accordingly indited the

featuroe from the public gaze she was conducted to the extremity of the chapol where the fatal procession was at once formed and in a slow and solemn mannor moved forward towards the drop the poison bell tolling and every thing argund contributing to the sovere and sombre charac ter of the spectacle the proceesion passed along a succession of narrow passages fenced in with ponderous gates side rails and chevauxdefrise of iron in its course a singular coincidence happesod the mannings walked over their own graves as they had made their victim do over his the male prisonerwalked witha feeble aed tottering step and but for the support of two tarnkeys who walked on either side of him he would hardly have been able to proceed a ghasy pal lor overspread his face and he ejaculated as hewent

mrs manning walked to hor doom with a firm unfaltering atep and over her large and strongly builtframe no tremor or nervous agitation of any kind was visible being blindfolded sho was led along by mr

the scaffold that the cord with which she was pinioned hurt her wristshaving thus described the preparations within the prison valls up to the hour of execution and given as far as they could be collected all the incidents which could illustrate the state of mind in which the condemned were during the night previous to and on the morning of their deaths it is now necessary that some account should be given of the arrangements for the spectators outside and for the realiza tionof the constitutioreal doctrine that public executions teach the people by example to avoid crime for days past as the readers of our columns are aware horeemongerlane and its immediate neighbourhood had presented the appearanco of a great fair so large were the crowds of people constantly collected there and so intense the stato of excitement in which all present appoared to be even on snnday the throng of people pouring in the direction of the gaol never ceased the surrounding beershops were crowded wiadows com manding a view of the scaffold rose to a californian price platforms were run up in every direction with more atten tion to profit than security or law and everything appeared to denote that there would be an immense attendancs of spectators to see the mannings hanged had matters beon suffered to proceed as was then contemplated some very serious loes of life must have happened but fortunately the authorities interfered the dangorous platforms were removed and barriers were erected in the most effectual posi tions to provixnt the mob from swaying backwards and for wards and becoming unmanageable above all there wvas a force of  police in position on the ground consisting of the m division under superintendont haines and the re served force of the a division under inspector otway all these arrangements which proved most effective were made on monday evening in ample time for the im monse streams of people men women and children that began pouring down towards the scene of the execution as midnight approached the current of human life once set in in that direction never ceased to flow until the morning sun was well up in the sky and the sea of upturned facos all gazing to one dark dismallooking objectthe scaffold proclaimed that the moment was at hand for carrying into effect the extreme eentenco of the law it is not easy to estimate the number of persons who were present at the dreadful and heart sickening spectacle of yesterday but they probably exceeded  the hum of their blended voices mingled together and swelling on the ear throughout the long dark night told distinctly what had brought them there as morning dawned the manner in which the as sembled multitudes had massed themselves together was sufficiently striking taking up their station on tha car riageway in front of and rather to the westward of the en trance of the gaol were the dregs and offscourings of the population of london the different elements that composed the disorderly rabble crow being mingled together in wild and unsightly disorder the nawy and irieh labourer smoking clay pipes and muzzy with beer pickpockets plying their lightfingered art little ragged boys climbing up posts and atanding on some dangerous elevation or tumbling down again and disappearing among the sea of heads from that great seething mass there rises a ceaseless din of sounds and war of tonguesvoices in every noto sarill whistles and slang calls the clatter and uproar of this babel never ceaeed for a moment yester day the sight of the drop a huge gaunt and ominous looking structure raised on the fiat roof of the gaol and increasing by a hundredfold the gloomy and repulsive aspect of the whole building failed to put the ieast check on the uproarious tendencies of the mob now it was a fainting fit then a fight and again the arrest of a thief but there was always something to keep up the popular excitement even the dreadful sight of two human beingshusband and wifehurried into eternity for the crime of murder failed to solemnize for one moment or to check perceptibly the disgusting levity of tho crowd they did not behave worse than other mobs under similar circumstances have done and that is all that can bo said of them packed up within the barriers ereeted by the police they wero power less for mischief and could easily be controlled on the outskirts of this great mass of human beings were grouped in smaller numbers a very different class of people men and women toowho had paid their two or three gueneas to gratify a morbid curiosity and who from the fashionablo clubs at the west end and from their luxurious homes came to fill the wiadows the gardens and the house tops of a few miserable little houses in order to enjoy the excitement of seelig two fellowcreatures die by an ig nominious death upon tho scaffold the best view of an execution at ilorsemongerlane gaol is to be obtained from tho tenements at the west end of winterterraco there the more reopectable latts of the assemblage yesterday took up their position and watched the proceedings with opera glasses levelledthere was an impression current that the execution would take place at  oclock but that hour came and went and there teemed to be no note of preparation eounded two men were loitering lazily ner the drop but beyond that thero was nothing visible at last  oclock struck and shortly after tho dreadful precession emerged from a small door in the inner side of a square piece of brickwork which rests on the eiat end of the prison roof to reach this heigat a long and steep flight of stairs had to be ascended and it is only wonderful that manning in his weal and tottering state was able to climb so far the visiting justices and others who wore present at the oxecution were mr freshfield mr packle mr ledger sir t a reeve mr c francis mr c t abbott the undersheriff and mr garland when the procession appeared above the thousands of spectators who were gazing at it with upturied faces immediately watched for the appearance of the wtetched creatures doomed to die manning came firsa supported by two men and acoom panied by the chaplain who read to him the apppinted ser vice of the church as he aseended the steps leading to the drop his limbs tottered under him and ho appeared scarcely able to move he first turned his faco to thecast appa rently reluctant to eye the gaping crowds assembled to watch his last mortal agony a gleam of sunshine fell upon his features while in this position and showed that the pallor of his countenance still continued when his wife ppreached tho scaffold he turned more round with hisfaeo towards tho people whilo caleraft proceeded to draw over his head the white ightcap and to adjust the fatal rope in the mean time the female drisonor had reached the drop mounting the stops which lied to it with a firm butowing to the bandage on her eyes not a rapid step and hen at last placed under the fatal beam standing as fited as a marble statue the malo prisoner had by this time recovered his firmness to a certain extent and turning to his wife he shook hands with her in token ofa final farewell the executioner then drew the nightcap ovet the female prisoners head and all the necessary preparations having now been completed the scaffold was cloared of all its occupants except the two wretched beings  who  stood upon it doomed to die tho worthy chaplain of the gaeol at ithis last moment still deeply solicitous for the welfare of so great a criminal standing on the brink of time without having con fessed her guilt once more approached and asked mrs aenning if she had anything that sho wished to say to him she replied  nothing but to thank you muchfor all your kindnoess ho withdrew deoply disappointed and when he left the husband and vife again approached each other and shook haudshavinig dno so they finally renumda their popitions iu an instant caloraft withdrew the bolt the drep fell and the senteueof the law was felfiled tihey died almost without a struggle and the bodies having ben allowed to hang for ari hour were  cut down and in thebvening burled within tho

the sole cause of her taking tho king johns head at flagger stone by which  were lost that he had once before induced her to take a house in the miloendroad and that he might depend upon this that he
