the city of london but it was true that he said the condition of the poor was such from want of ventilation in their dwel ings and wantof drainage and want of water that it becanle indispensable that some alteration should take place and a removal to anyplace in which such evils were not accumu lated would he prefeable to their present deplorable state hear hear with respect td the aleged absence of the clerk from the court on fsiday and saturday it wax quite impoesible from the nature of the arrangements in guild hadl that any basiness could be lransacted in tho sewers office on either o

everything offensive had been removed and new and com modious watericosets or outhouses had been constructed and a plentiful supply of watdb had been obtained on the very next day the whole locality

supply was scantily obtained in many parts of the neighbourhood it appeared from the representations made that whenever one sido of a district was well supplied tho other side was dry and that some
