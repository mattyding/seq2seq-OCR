loasdon wednbsday ovovbmbbr  yesterday this metropolis witnessed the most awful act which the necessities of justice or of selfpreservation can impose on a sovereign state we performed arn act of judicial slaughter dredful as the circumstances of capital punish mnent always must be revolting as areits details and beyoncau former example the horrors both of the crime and the closing scene in this instance yet they bre all tolerable compared with the thoughts suggested by a too curious scratiiv mthrough its constituted organs the whole people yesterday cut short the visible being and the moral coursa of two miserable creatures born with immortal souls doubtless once innocent ad loving with the hidden germs of the wiheat virtue and the loftiest attainments yet both cast out as it were on the dunghill and the  particle of divinity within them seat we know not where quivering and fleeting on its unknown journey to the presence of him that gave it one xaay almost take refuge in the odious spectacle from the overwhelming responsibility of the act and consult peace of mind by a blind faith in the execautive and its sacred vocation tihe most morbid oonscience however will derive
