conolusion the verdict of the jury was pronounced at an early hour this mnorning seventeen persona have been sen tenced to transportation three to five years unprisonsment and the remaining  acquitted

years im prisonment under extenuating circumstances are suchet representative mombe framboulet de ohalandar one of the last incidents which marked these proceedings is sutliciently characteristio of the ac cused the counsel for the prisoners not having been allowed to plead the right of insurrection abstained from all defence and retired from the court under pretence that their rights were violated and their liberty of action as advocates restrained the ocurt consequently assigned to the prisoners ad vocates psoc who teadily undertook the un gracious tasxk allotted to them  but they were pre tented by their new clients who not only refused their assistance with arrogance and contempt but seven protested against their presence in court urging that their very silence might be construed into a defence the senior counsel intimaed on behalf of his colleagues of the bar that their offer of professional aid was rejected the president of the court thanked them for the ready zeal they exhibited to undertake so arduous a duty at a moments notice and as i have already mentioned entered on the per formance of his own by charging the jury he however previously called on the prisonera to say sil they had in their own defence one of the prisoners baune whose name is amonget the acquitted rose to address the court but before he had uttered more than a few words he was surrounded by his companions ia the dock and compelled by force to resume his seat in silence whatever latitude may be allowed prisoners on their trial it is absurd to say that they can be per mitted to plead the violation of all law and the rights of civil war the man who is accused of robbery or murder has no right to found his defence on the jus tifioation of these crimes he may maintain that he is not guilty of them but he cannot maintain that they are legal or meritorious the president of the court pointed out very justly the inconsistency of the conduct of the accused they should have made use of the same plea of justification from the commenoement yet they summoned each day and hour of the trial numerous witnesses with the object of prov ing that they had taken no part directly or in directly in the events of the th of june or if they had that their intentions were not of a crimi nal claracter the whole of them maintained that the demonstration of that day was of a pacific nature one asserted that his presence at the con servatoire was simply occasioned by curiosity and that this feeling gratified he withdrew from the spot the prisoners belonging to the artillery of the national guard declared that their crhiie mereql consisted in following their commanding offiler without meaning to participate in any movement these declarations and this defence are not consistent with the present plea brought forward at the i last moment and against which even mi proudhon himself strongly advised them itis tho first timeobserved the president that so einaular a spoctacle has been presented it is the first time that in order tomaintain their independence advocateshavs beeh found to sacrifice that very independence and that with thein the liberty of defence means the tyranny of the orders issued by a faction the real cause however of such is to be found in the character of political offenders in prance wvhere judicial proceedings are made to terminate in an attempt at a coup de tldztre aplain downright system of defence is never suffioiently dramatio for thvem it is not the first time that this class of offenders have attempted to exhibit themselves as the victims of authority to whom au jsutice all law and all mercy are denied and make the public believe that both advocates and accused are gaggedt the concluding scene of the court of versailles may be as good a pretext as any other the pre text on the th may  was poland  that on the th jaine was rome  and today it is the liberty of defence it is not so certain however that the public wiiu be duped this time at least the fol lowing is a report of the proceedings of this morning the jury passed all tho afternoon of yesterday and all the night in deliboraion very many of the spectators among

friends the president of the republic summoned to the elysee at  oolook on sunday night the whole of the cabinet ministers together with m victor fouch the proeureur of the republic he in formed them briefly but deoidedly that after due aonsideration of the subject he had come to the determination of granting their liberty to the whole of the prisoners of belleisle amounting to  and who it willbe remembered were confined there in consequence of their participa tionin the terrible and most sanguinary insurrection of june  the ministers lookeddismayedat the announcement of so bold a design they prayed him to examine the question still more carefully and to weigh well the danger to sooiety at large by letting loose so many desperate men louis napoleon replied that he had already long and carefully considered the subject he was oonvinced that no danger was tobeapprehended from them and he further said that his con victions perfeotly agreed with those of the present able and active prefect of police who had assured him that not the slightest peril would result to paris or any other place from the liberation of these men and that above all he m carlier stated that he was ready to answer with his head for the tranquillity of the capital the ministers were encouraged by a declaration made in such terms and on such grounds  they yetsuggested to the president that amongst the men at belleislethere weremany whose perversity and whose hardness in crime were such that they would not only refase with contemptuous arrogance the pardon offered them but would even demand compensation fqr what they affected to believe were the wrongsifioteidon them there were also amongst the number many who were not guilty merely of politi cal offeences but whose previous career had been one of crime against society at largeoffenders who availed themselves of insurrection merely to gratify the lust of rapine and of murder they intreated him at all events to make a selection the presi dent could not be heedless of these suggestions he therefore consented to the exceptions demanded and assisted by the ministers the procureur of the republic and the prefect of police passed nearly the whole of the night in examining the oharacters of the numerous prisoners whose names filled the lists the result was that  described as the very worst and the most desperate men who more than realize the utmost conceptions of eugene sue of the most abandoned of the paris population were taken out of the list and as you will have learned before this m ferdinand barrot announced yesterday to the astonished assembly the fact that  of the belle isle detenus were to be released from prison what ever merit attaches itself to such an act is i am assured to be attributed to louis napoleon who took the initiative i am farther enabled to state that n carlier in his report presented on the occasion declared ia the most positive terms that at no previous period has paris been more tranquil than at the present moment and that there is not only no motive to fear disturbances of a political nature but that there absolutely is not the slightest material for any such this state of things is eurely most satisfactory it not only showa the return to common sense on the part of the working classes but also proves the ener getic and conciliating character of the au thorities those who are familiar with the cnaraoter of the present prefect of police will understand and appreciate all the value to which a declaration coming from sach a quarter is entitlede it appears to be now all but determined upon that a ministry of police will not be established the same result will however be obtained by that of a seoretarygleneralship attached to the department of the iminister ofthe iaterior but in

condemnation of their nine colleague by the high court of versailles ab ctaimed froin appearing at the sitting they remained disporsed in roupt in the salle des conforences the aserbly preoccupied with the verdict paid no atten ien to te two fdet speakers andit was only when memilo barrault acended the tribune tnat silence was rc storedm barrault said that he did not intend to tako part in the discussion but m letiboadois had yesterday violently attacked socialism and he wished to reply a few words to his attacks socialim in the opinion of m barrault and his friends was the holy ark they wero determined to de fend in the eyes of their adversaries on the right it wis a vain and dangerous idol which shoula ba destroyed at any price it remained to be seen who should be victorious both sides hoped that their causo woald triumph saturity would decide he did not however approve of the go vornment entring the lists and through the prefect of police declaring a war of extermination against socialism in so doing it exceeded its powers heo trusted however that for it honour it condemned the incendiary placard of m carlierhere m barrault was interrupted by cries of ques tion i  and the president invited him to speak on the relief fand and not interfero writh m carlier fm barrault said that he acceded to the wishes of the assembly and the president and announced that he would vote against the propositions in the hope that the minis try would bring forward a complete project of law on the subject in the discuseion of which all the sects of so cialism would be allowed to develope their system the ministry he was sure would not deceive hig expectations but hold to realize the manifesto of the president of the republic who desired acts not words the people had been boo long lulled vrith promiser they awaited and should be satiefied everybody knew the personal political doctrines of the president but he if barrault did uot agree with bim that they were summed up in the name of napoleon that name did not represent a programme or a system as aseerted in the mnessage for napoleon with all his genius was not the inventer of the system referred to which was as old as the world m barraulr then read a passage from one of the worka of m louis napoleon from whic he inferred that he was a partisan ofthaorighttolabour he then returned to m carliers proelamatidn which he said was a declaration of war against republican socialism in the namo of imperial socialism in conclusion he voted against the propositions after hearing mm rndotbenoist and m nmas minister of coomorcet who promised shortly to submit to the atssembly a project of law for the naelioratibn of the cotdition of thelabouring classes tho asoembly took the two propositiona uito consideratie i
