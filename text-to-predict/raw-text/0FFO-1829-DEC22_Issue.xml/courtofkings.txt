would content himself with stating the circumstances and leave it to them to give the plaintiff such compensation in da mages as they should think commensurate with the injury he had sustained sir aluskett was the son of a gentleman pos sessing a cornsiderable landed estate in the county of norfolk a short time prior to his marriage vwith the lady of whose seduction he complained his father settled on him a consider able estate at intwogd in that county consisting of an entire arish irs muskett before her marriage was a alis jarey the onl daughter of a most respectable gentleman in the same neighbourhood at the time of the marriage which took place in the year  the lady was  or  years of age mlr muskett was about  the ladys father gave her a fortune of  which was settled cn the issue of the marriage with a jointure of  per anu m to mr muskett for four years after the mariage the parties lived on terms of the greatest affection and harmony they tad a daughter which was the only child the defeidant ur gurney was well knowrn by name he was ai banker at norvrich and had had the honour of representing that city in parliament he was the owner of a considerable landed es tate in the county and had a mansion at keswick where he resided with his mother and sister the plantation attached to his estate adjoined mr muskets grounds and in fict the parties were neighbours they had not however prior to mir dlusketts marriage been on terms of great intimacy although they had had some acquaintance after the marriage their intimacy increased in consequence of the lilaintift espousiimg the same political cause with the defendant they were both friends of mlr coke the member for the countyand acted together in his interest ilr gumey being a gentleman of very great fortune ir mluskett whose means were not so ample thought thathe was not in a situation to be the constant associate of such a nan but still theirintimacy was coatinued for some time on the same terms as it had before eisted mr and mrs muskett about four years after their marriage went by chance to pay a visit to a relation who resided at cromer where mir gurney had a marine villa and he knowving that they were there prevailed on them to pay him a visit also this was in the year  after mrs mus ketts return froni that visit mlr mukett thought that he observed some little alteration in her manner but he took no notce of it ant it pasted over in october  however an event occurred whicb the learned counsel would now de scribe mlr aluskett was in the habit ofvisiting his father esery sunday at his residence at kingston which was about seven miles from intwood  and it happened on one occasion that his faiher invited iim to join him in the pleasure of coursing a day was accordingly fixed but something occurred to induce pr muskett to dccline go ing over to his father this seemed to occasion some con cern to mllrs imuskett who went up stairs a gentleman of the name of nash who had been in the habit of bringing pre sents of flowers and arranging them for mrs muskett in the greenbouse happened to call in the course of the moirning and he was iinvited to dine mirs aluskett however re mained uip stairs and oni being sent for to comre to dinner she came down stairs in a state of great agitation and returned up again almost immediately mir muskett followed her and then discovered that she had been writing notes to llr gurney her father was informed of wltat bad transpired andl it ieas thought expedient that she should g to his bouse and remain under his proection until a further investigation should have taken place inquiries were subsequently rade and the result was that mlr mluskett thonght it necessary to bring an action against ailr iurney for criminal conversa tion that action was tried at thetford in the year  wvhen a verdict was tound for the defenaant the learned counsel would not ask ths jury now to say that a crinitral intercourse had at that time taken place because the jury by their vertict had negatired the fact  but it was ne cessary that he should state to them that the circumstances which had occurred were such as to induce all parties to think that it would not be proper for the lady to retum to her hus bands roof and she therefore remained under the protection ofher father amr muskett left with one child a daughter was as the jury might suppose in a state of the greatest des titution so far as domestic comfort was concerned and in a short titne the suspicions which lie had entertained of a crimi nal intercourse having taken place at the time he brought the action in  became confirmed an event occurred whici rendered it inmpossible for mrs mluskett to conceal the circum stances from her nearest connexions she became pregnant by the defendant all attempts at concealment were then of no avail and mr gurney felt himself bound as a man of ho nourto remove her from herfathers house she wasaccordinglv taken away from thenceand was now living under his proret  tionthese facts would be given in evidenceand the case would then be reduced to a mere question of damages it would he beheved be said fbr the defendant that air maluskett had been in actual separation from his wife before he became acquaint cd with any of the circumstances of seduction bv the dofen dant andi that therefore the amount of damages ought to be inconsiderable in a case tried before lord kenyoa some years ago it was doubted whether a plaintiff ir an action for criminal conversation was entitled to damages where a sepa ration had taken place with the consent of both parties  but the court had eventuauy decided that that was a principle vhich had no just foundation either in law or morality the court hail said that a husband although separated frni itis wife no actual divorce having taken place had still an interest in her chastity and he had an interest also in taking care that a spurious issue was not entailed upon him besiaes it was of importance to him that his wifes morals and honour sbould remain uncontaminiated in order that there might be no barrier on that account to an eventual reconciliation ir could not be denied in this case that there liad been a species of separation before the time according to the plaintiffs sneans of proof of the last act of criminal intimnacy having taken place but the question of damages on the ground of previous separation was a very different question when applied to the case of a person who was a total stranger to the parties before the separation and to one whose conduct had led to and been the cause of the senaration if indeed it were not so the law would afford opportunities to the wiles of the most crafty seducer who would thus be enabled to deprive a busband of his best domestic comfort and then escape from the payttiest of damagesif he could only conceal the intercourse so as to render it impossible for the party to prove that it had in fact commenced before the period of actual separation in this case the learned cotnsel would lay before the jury facts to show that whether a criminal intimacy had or had not subsisted before the year  when the for mer action was brought yet that such circumstsnees had occurred as rendered it impossible for mar mus kett to receive his vife again and equally impossible for her to wish to return to his roof the learnea counsel theu went into a detail of facts to show tise nature of the defendants intimacy with mlrs amuskett prior to the former action mlrs sluskett he observed used frequently to walk in mlr gurneys plantation which adjoined her bus bands grounds on these occasions she generally toolk her child with her accompanied by her nurserymaid who walked close to her side mr gurney used to meet them at a gate which separated the two gtounds and they then went into the wood and walked there together on one occasion the i aid being at her mistresss side as usual alrs mliuskett gave an intimation to her not to be always  creeping under her nose the maid toolk the hint and atterwards kept at a miore respectful dis tance on one occasion when they were walking the maid observed air gurney conduct her mistress through tie gate and lead her to a straw hut in the grounds whe she re mained with him sbout half an hour on her return the maid observed that she was much agitated and that he bons net was bent down before her face the same intercourse whatever it was aftenvards took place repeatedly alrs aluskett had been accustomed to go to norwich in a pony chaise which her husband purchased for her the nurserymaid and tho chile went with her before her visit to cromer she used to go the direct road which was the sbortest way but after that visit shewent anotherroadwhichwasnot so good and the tistance was longer but it passed the residence ofcr gur ney on these occasions ilr gurney joined rs muskett he used to oomeoutonhorseback andon meeting her he

saw mr tiurnev in the marketplace and on their meeting her mistress desired her to go to her mothers and wait until she came to her she went with mr gurney into another street and the maid saw no more of her for two hours when she came to her the maids mothers lwhen mr msuskett went to see his father on a sunday mrgurney used to come and yisit the lady he did not enter at the usual door and mrs
