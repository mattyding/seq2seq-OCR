london tuesday decembbiz  wte insert and even request attention to a letter signed a ladlord thougl its reasoning is op posed to our own when however we called for a return to the rents which existed before the war we did not require such a return instantaneously and in every individual case but vwe are convinced that an approximation to those rents may be immediate and that they may be gradually adopted in fullwithout any reissue of the base small notes or any deteriorationof the circulating medium our correspondent says that during the war  a large amount of capital has been expended on the land ana permanent improvements made but by whom was the capital expended  by whom were the permanent improvements made not by the landlords but by the tenants which tenants also be it observed have gradually reaped the fruits or rather sucked out the marrow of their owni improvements for we deny the propriety of the word permanent except as meauaig a limited time man can effeot nothing that is per manent and what tenant ever laid out capital or made improvementson his farmexceptwithauieye to theterm of his lease or the probability of its renewal now there fore when the effects of improvements springing out of highprices arebeginning towearoutandpricesarefallen what can be more just than that the rents should revert to the amount at which they were before the prices were so high or the improvements were made or the war begun which occasioned bothas to the manner in which the revenue may be aftfcted by the reduction of rents about wvhich so much is said we see nothing in that consideration that should obstruct the measure which we reeommend and which is in truth graduauy introducing itself in spite of land lords and legislation too if the latter be opposed to it let us suppose the landlords to throw back even  per cent upon their rentsone or two we believe have done so muchwill those sl in each  become unproductive to revenue because they are returned to the tenant quite the contrary they vill probably be more productive in the hands of the tenant than in those of his landlord he will be enabled to reduce the rates by taking his full complement of labourers into employ and they must at least hava shoes if they consume no other taxable commodity and the farmer himself will have a sufficiency of agricul tural horseshis pleasure horse or horseshis hunter for riding with a view to salehis gig or light cart his ale and wine and candles in his house and stablesbut we are continually deafened with the cry that the debt was contracted when money was of one value and we are paying the interest wvhen the value owing to the diminution of the circulating medium is much increased and when we recommend a return to the rents of  is there no more money weshouldliketo know now in circulation than was in circulation at that time or before the war began  yes twice as much  so that the change in the value of money is to prevail to the defrauding of the creditor of the just interest of his debt but is to be totally inefficient when applied to the reduc tion of rents however the facts are that the circulating medium is now more than double what it was before the war began but is not at all less than it was at many periods during the war when portions of the debt were taken up and not much less than it was at any timeanothetstatement which we hear frequently and which has dishonesty in it mingled with absurdity and falsehood is that as land is taxed so ought the funds to be taxed the funds we answer result from a positive contract between parties which contract is obligatory except it be relaxed with the consent of both one man borrows money of another and the borrower becoming yet more distressed says  i  will not pay you the interest any longer or i will  only pay you a part of it my property is not so productive as it was then says the lender  you are a great rogue diminish your expenses if  you please but you have no right to plunder me  of the interest of that which i advanced upon a  solemn contract to relieve your wants and portions  of which relying upon that faith which ought to exist between man and man in the sight of heayen i have tranferred to thousands of othersto the weak the aged the infirm besides the funds do pay taxes just as much as the land in the only rational sense of the expression a man who expends a clear income derived from the funds say a thou sand ayear contributes as much to the revenue of the country in taxes by its expenditure as the man who derives the same clear income from the land and expends it in like manner to say that the land has various processes of cultivation or of taxation to un dergo before it yields its net produce to the sluggish consumer to which the internal management of the funded property is not liable is only to say that land is land and funds are funds the produce of each un dergoes the same fate when brought forth to be spent in the shape of money
