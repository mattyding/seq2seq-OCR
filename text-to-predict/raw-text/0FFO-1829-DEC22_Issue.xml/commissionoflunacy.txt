under the highest obligations t the lord chancellor for sending two of the most eminent physicians to an obscure person like himself and that he should always retain a just senseef the obligation i endca voured to convince him that this was a wrong impresion  said alr davies i do not think you are much obliged to the chancellor ibecause lie has sent your case to a commis sion and you cannot be obligedi to the loctors because they are paid fbr their yiaits he said he stiu felt obliged by the condescension of the doctors and of the chancellor i asked him how he had been treated in dr burrowvss house he said it was dreadful in the beginning i asked him if they lad applied a straitwaistcoat he said  no  but the keepers had insulted him by insinuating in a manner not to be mistaken and that rcpeatedly that he wvas addicted toa a c a  o i then told him that i had read a great mass of affidavits which had been swom in his case and that as i knew nothing of him my examination must alone proceed on such depositions i then read extracts from the affidavit of dr blundell ile became extremely angry and said  i can be even with dr blundell dr blunded has behaved in my family before my mnother and mny sister with the greatest indelicacy lt appeared at that tiue by wvhat mr davies said to me that alr pugh the brtherinlavr was labourin u nder some indisposition mr davies said that dr blundecd said  there is a screw loose there i said i do not know what interpretation you put on those words he saitd the words implied that mr pngh vwas at that time labouring under ï¿½ r  or that ir the formner part of hig life he had been severely visited by that malady mlr davies said c this is not alli will tell you something more dr blundell told me thata mar ried man of ihis the doctors acquaintance in coming back wards and forwards to his house had got his the doctors maidservant with child both parties were much alarmed on the score of their characterthe married man lest his wife should find out the affair but dr blundell told him he could settle that affair by making the slip i inquired what making the slip was  he said it meant  procuring abortion the vitness here went on to state that air davies represented dr bltndell as calling amr daviess als tention to a very pretty servant girl in the housess encou raging mr davies to seduce the girland as proposing a mode of concealing the intrigue if pregnancy should en sae dr haslam then continued mr davies next showyed rnc die affldavit of a airs ingsread several parts of it to me and he said it was entirely a lie from the be ginning to the end in the order of proceeding i thought it right to tell mr davies that i had heard a great deal from him and that he must now hear soniething from me i said  sir there are afridavits from bankers teabrokers and other persons of high character and reputation describ ing acts of insanity there are likewise affidavits of medical men of the highest integrity character and experience whe have equaly sworn to insane acts which they have observed in you what have you to say to that  he said i i can sub vert the whole of the medical evidetice and can overtbrow al the other testimony i am a man possessing enlarged powers of intellect and i am peculiarly skilful in the art of crossexamination i will defend myself i hope i shall be attentively heard because my defence will occupy at least three weeks i will prosecute every mar that has testified to my insanity all the teatrade ex pect it from me and the britifh public are interestedir the success of my cause i dr haslain had observed or au occasions in wlhich i conversed with him that whateves was the subjeet started there was an avenue that conducwec to abuse and accusation of his mother i then asked him  what has your mother done  his answer was she has desroyed my credit with my bankers she has broken of a most eligible snatch for me with a young lady of grea beauty fortune and accomnplishments  what besides  said i he answered  she is a most violent and vulgai woman she has thwarted me in every thing she pays a much attention to the lowest clerk as to the highest she has no idea of system or arrangement she never reads the news papers and she will haggle in the shop sooner than take bad money besides she ismad and wi cut her throat andl havesentsirgeorgetuthill toinvestigatce the stateofhermind he addedthat sir george had not yet furnished him with the result of such investigation i witness told mlr davies that these were very serious accusations and that if they were wel founded i thought hc had been very ill used i accord ingly requested to have an interview with alrs bywater i saw her and i wished to know if she were mad or not tc the beat of uy judgment she w as perfectly in her senses and a very decent wellbehaved anl respectable woman in every way as decent and respectable a woman in her manners de meanourt and conversation as ever i saw mr second visit to mtr oavies was on the fith of november i thought i ought then to investigate the breaking off of this marriage i asked him as he was about to be marriedwhetherhe had dis closed his affections to thelady personaly  he said  no i asked him whether he had written to her he said  no butthathethought he was pretty sure of the father i asketi him if he had writtens to the father  hesaid  yes the best letter he hadever composed indeed it vas so good thatitcould not be mended in any particular i asked him did this lettes communicate your wish fog an aliance with the family he said  no i said then as this was a good letter what was it about and when was it written  he said it was written when he was at crouchhill and had the society of two keep ers then i said what was it about sir c wetherell herc attempted to put in the letter but it tumed out that the witness had never seen it and sis charles observed that he should not for the present press the reading of the letterdr uaslam continued i asked him what the letter waw about he said the contents of the letter were that his gen tleman shoulti come and release him i said did the gentle man make any eftortsto come forward he said no i then asked him how th iletter was conveyed to the father ol the lady  he said by a man who looked over the twe keepers he said he was unwilling to tc his name and i did not press it i said  what was the answer  he re plied that the answer was that the family was on a tour ir france and that the servanttold the messenger that they nevel told any lies in thatffamily thatisalll considered itnecessar to inquirerelating to this snarriagetherewasanotherramblinf storywhich he toldmeaadwhich you havebeobreheardabout nian with a white horse and a cart he said that the pursuil was so hot that he was obliged to gallop his horse at the rat of  miles an hour to avoid the man he said that he wvalk ed back in the evening to crouchhill he said that mlr piper was with him at this time he said that on his return he saw two men that pursued him both of them in carts witl white horses and that he was very much alarmed  that he stopped and that they passed him at the turnpike that hc inquired whether they werc higglers returning from marketand that to such inquiries they informed him that they were not higglers i asked him who he thought they were hc said that they must be thieves or resurrectionmen now at my third interview which was on ihe th of november last in order to be confirmed in my opinion i went over most of the subjects apain and lie stuck to his text he did not vary he said that his mother should go that lie would not return to philpotlane without she was sent intc wvales i may make snow one general observation at the conclusion of each of these interviews i niniforinly asked this question  sir you have a higb opinion of the excellence of your own memory are you aware tbat at any period within the last twelve months your mind has been in any manner or degree disordered disarranged perverted or that you have laboured under any delusion whatever  he said that he never had in the slightest degree during the whole course of his life that he ivas a responsible agent and would prosecute those who had imputed insanity to him now suchl examination was sufficient in my opinion to wrarrant the conclusion that he was of unsound mind his mind was the same at each of these interviews i endeavouree to try his mind according to my experience i asked him about his estate he said that the stateofhis health requiredthatheshouli go into the country i asked him if the sum he had given for hli estate was not more than its value  he said he thought it was a good bargain and he asked me why i made such an inquiry i told him the reason was that from persons resid ing in the vicinity i had heard a very diffcrent storvthat it was not worth so much but that i did not pretend to judge i asked him if he thought it prudent for a young nman of  years of age who had acquired no great deal of money to abandon that counter where all tle money was to be got he said that his health required it and that he should be always prosperous he said that he was impressed with the opinion that he should be always prosperous he related a dreamn to me from which he was convinced that he should be always prosperous from what he said on this subject i was con vinced that he had been tutored mlr davies said  it has been sworn to that i see visions now i never did see visions in the day timne  and i am told that if i were to persist in say ing that i see visions it would anmount to insanity there was another instanceto the same effct he said thatas he was walking in kensingtongardens he saw a very beautiful lady ccompanied by a strapping goodlooking man that this lady had admired him very much i asked him if he had spoken sober he said no but that shc had frequently turnred round to look at him i asked him if lc had seen her a second time he said no butbliat a few days after on visiting the exhibition ho had seen the portrait of a lady re semblingher in the highest deree i then asked him did you ever intend to purchase that portrait  he said  no beeause he had learnt that that would be an act of insanitv i thought it was indelicate to ask the name ot the person who had so tutored htm but  was convinced he itad been tutored he connected his certain prosperitv with the dream he said he had dreamed the same dream several times an insane person may be so tutored as to conceal his insanity when he is asked questions i will give you ans instance a friend of mine has bcees long insane but ise walks aboutcalls upon me and drinks tea with me i say to him if otherpeople are there  now my fthend there are people here who are unacquainted with your philosophy and so dont put auy of your questions to me he takes tbe hint this gentleman goes generaly into society and i assure you the ladies are very much chiarmed with iim the last timne he called on me he told me  should go to the devil it is a common practice to fig up a lunatic mr davies told me that after he had escaped from mlr hankeys and got into uincolnsinnfields lie had about s in his pocket that he was looking for ans hotel  that he went anti bought twvo or three old books that he then felt very hungry and ivent into hlolborn to a gingerbreadbakers and dined off gingerbread hetold me that lie hadnever before tasted any gingerbread so good that it was so nice so very delicious and at this word  delicious he grasped my arrn very vialently and burst into tears i never asked him the source of the pathos or any thing of that sort laughter when he recovered from his weeping he said to me  now was not that economy sir ishiould say decidedly that as long as his niorbid hostility remains against his mother it is not safe for him to go at large i have heard the evidence of mrs brookbank i have heard all the evidence my opinion is that it is not safe for him to be at large i came to that opinion before i heard the evidence but when i heard that he would not return home when his liberty was offred to him because of his hatred t his mother aiti wvhen i heard his own solicitor say that he had raked up the ashes of his father in order to cast ignominy upon his mothermr adolr usreally mlessrs commissioners i mustask if it is to be enaured that a witness

what i meant and i did explain  think alr davies was present at this conversation i will undertake to swear that i never said any such thing as has been related of me about a mar ried man sir davies and i used to converse on medicalsubjects he was fnd of medical books and lie liked to con verse about gestation i invited him to an introductory lec ture which pleased him very much as it was an obstetric lecture there were of course prints and preparations introduced bearing on the subject mr davies was so modest and had sueh disgust of impropet conversation that i must have been not only a fool but a madman if i had ventured upon any such conversations as those which he told dr has lam i had had with iiimreexamined by sir wsrightimr pugh had no such disease as i i i le had no complaint of the kind the disease was the spitting of blood i saw that a vessel had given way that was what i meant by there being a screw loose i wished to intimate to sfrs bywater that herequired immediate care and attention neither directly nor indirectly did i allude to the   i disease there is not the least foundation for what mr davies told r has lam about making slips i state this upon my oath as to the servant maid upon my oath i never said any thing of the kind i did attend a maidservant of sir daviess i told him i thought her a pretty modest wellbehaved girlthat i apprehended she would go

opportulnitv to propose questions for the examination of witnesses i was present with mr davies dr burrows and lir daviess sister mr davies carriedon an indecent conversation on the subject of a charge against himself of unnatural propensitits dr burrows remonstrated with him but he continued the conversation i believe lr davies to have been of unsound mind from the lth of august and that he is so at the present day there is a boy atiiithe establishment oftthree or four years old mr davies is more reserved now than when he first came to the establish mnent witness was allowed to speak from his notes the reserve began arter r hoblers first visitabout the tb th th or th of september mr davies refused to answer questions put to him to elicit delusions when i referred to the indelicate conversatiorn he had held in the presence of dr burrows and dirs pugh lr davies de clined to speak of the subject on wednesdav last he told me he had been readin the evidence of his aunt alrs brooks bank and said it appeared incredible cvidence to himthat it contained a vast number of untruths i asked him vwhether a part of his aunits evidence was not true  he said be did not know but that i mighlt be able to recall it to his recollec tmon i said do you not recollect rite first visit your aunt paid you here  hie said  yes  do you not recollect on that occasion your stating that your aunt had come to kidnap yenu he answered  yes you believed it to be true i askted  yes  do you now believe that your aunt intended to kidnap you  yes nothing more on this point was gained dlr davies frequently cries i never could discover the cause he laughs frequently sometimes loudly he never stated to me the cause of his laughter i see a great dleal of insane persons they laugh andt cry in the same manner as mr davies there may be a cause for their laughter and cryin but there is no cause apparent i am not aware of it ttere seemed no cause for the laughing or crying in mr daviess case i saw nothing to cause it i cant tell what passes in mr daviess mind up to wednesday last i had reason to suppose him of un sound mind nothbsg has occurred since to vary that opi nion mr davies has been treated with the greatest possible kindness in the establishment as far as my knowledge goes he complained at one time of certain allusions on the part of the keepers numbers of medical men have
