law reportcourt of chancery momthay dec fawcett v whitehousethe lord chancellor gave judgment in this case which was an appeal from a decision of the vicechancellor the case he said was an important oiie as well with respect to the sum in dispute as because it affected the character of one of the individuals concerned in it for this reason his lordship had thought it right after hearing the case to look minutely into the evidence on both sides it appeared thatiessrs uill and co were the lessees of a certain mine in wales called the vertig iron works they had underlet the premises to messrs knight and co for a term of which  years remained unexpired at the commencement of these transactions at a rent of  per annam and amessrs knight and co were sunder covenants to repair the premises in consequence of certain difficulties or of mismanagement the works had been discontinued for a period of iive years ano messrs knight and co had offered  to hill and co if the latter would accept a surrender ofthe lease this offer had been refused and knight and co therefore became de sirous of assigning their interest to any person of respecta bility who would carry on the concern and relieve them from the lability they were under to the landlords they had purchased some freehold property contiguous for the purpose of working limestone which was very important for carrying on the works and this it appeared from the evideace of mr hancocks they were willing to ive upsto any one who would take the lease and they were wiling to make a large pecuni ary sacrifice besides messrs knight and co entered into a correspondence with mr whitehouse the defendant who it appeared was well acquainted with mining affairs and with the premises in question and heundertook to procure some persons of respectability and character to engage with him in the concern the treaty was conducted by mlr hancocks on the part of knight and co a letter by him dated in  had been referred to stating the terms on wlsich they proposed to part with the property which were that they vrere to make an ab solute gift of the fcehold land where thie limestone lay and to make in addition an advance of moncy to mlr wvite house for his use and to enable him to engage with other persons in carrying en the concern it was probably at the same time that thic advance was stipulated for in favour of mr whitebouse on whigh this case principally turned this was if the arrangement then contemplated should be ulti mately completed and whitehouse should procure some re spectable person to join him knight and co should advance him l without interest half of whicis was to be his own at the end of eight years and the other half at the end of the term if kniight and co should be indemnified against the clauses in the lease it appeared that first a negotiation had been entered into with some parties which was afterwards abandoned a proposition was then made to mlessrs fawcett and shand for undertaking the works and it was ultimatelv agreed that air sliand shoald go to wales for the purpose of inspecting them mir shand not relying on his own judg ment applied to mr jones wilkinson to assist him whio wvent over the premises withs him upon his return to mr fawcete his report was foundl to correspond with the represen tations of mr whiitechouse and thev agreed tlierefbre to embark in the concern with this view they wvent to bir mingham in  to complete the agreement mr wvhite house had instracted his solicitor air fellowes to drw up an agreement as to he  by which lie got rid of the bond he was to have givein and converted that advance into an absolute gift this agreement being delivered to xyliite house the day before the meeting at birmingham he got mr fellowes the younger to copy it alleging as a reason for that his wish that the clerk of the house should not know its con tents and that the whole transaction might be kept secret a meeting took place at the swan inn at birmingham pre vious to the meeting at the hotel and hieae a conyersation en sued to which tlirce witnesses deposed they were mr jones wilkinson mr fellowes sen and mlr fellowes jun the conversation related to the terms of the proposed agree ment and in consequence of mr whitehoues representa tions mr fawcett said he was satisfied he had done all he could and begged lie would conclude what he bad begun they then proceeded to the hotel where soine discussion en sued as to whether tessrs kiniglt and co should grant an assignmentor an underlease and that being concluded the defendant called mlessrs hancocks buckle and lee who acted fbr knight and co out of the room the agreement as drawn by m ir fellowts was then handed to them and objected to because that which was intended as a loani had been made an absolute gift whitehouse then inade a reply which was veryimterial he said lie had procured persons of responsibility to engage in the concern that kiniglht and co would therefore run iso risk of having tie lease again thrown on their hands he therefore insisted that the conclition first stipulated for had beeni performede on his part and the bond which lie was to have given as a security ought not to be hung over his head but that the advance should be an absolute gift to iiim this after some discussion vas acquiesced in the agreement was signed and delivered to mlr fellowes who was desired by the defendant mlr lvhitelhouse to mention the smiatter to nio livieg soul in this transaction mir wlsitehlouse had clearly been nego tiating fir himself and as the agent fbr messrs fawcett and shasid who were to be his future partners this fact was sworn to in distinct terms by mr hancocksand mlr joises lwilkinson in relating the conversation which took place at the swvan inn immediately before the meeting at the hotel it was said on the other hand that mr wlhlitehouse ouglit not torbe considereslas tis agent of mlessrs fawcett and shand for that those gentlenmcn acted for themselves and in support of this it was alleged that mr shand had iiade inquiries re specting the nature of tie property and had visited the pre mises before lie enitered into the contract and that be had employed mr wilkinsois o accompany him on such visit undoubtedly mlessrs fawcett and shand did siot rely inipli citly on the representatioins of mir whitehouse and thought it right to employ other persons for the purpose of ascertain ing the accuracy of those representations but this had no thing to do with the agreenient inito which they afternvards entered together it was said also that the terms of the original agreenient had been departed from and tbat an assignment had been mnade instead of an underlease wvhich had been first stipulated for this was true but this had nothing to do with the pecuniary arrangement which was the principal subject of the suit if then it ap peared that the defenaant whitehonse had while acting as ageiit for himself and two other persons stipulated for a pecuniary advantage to himself and in wvhich the other parties were not to partidpate and if he kept this part of the transaction secret from the other parties it was one which this court would never saniction what trien w as the real nature of tele transaction  the court would not be mis led by the terms in which parties expressed themselves it was said this was a loan by knight and co to whitehouse it was not a loarn properly so called it was at first stipu lated to be without interest it was not to be paid upon a cer tain condition being performred and it was afterwards con vertod into an absolute gift although that gift was liable to be defeated in certain eventsthat is the noncompliance of the parties to the agreement mr whitehouse had insisted on this being relinquished because lie said he had procured per sons of character and responsibility to carry on the concern and in coinsequence the condition was withldrawn but whe ther it was a conditional or an absolite gift did not vary the case there was a benefit negotiated for by one of the parties in which the others were not to share and it was impossible that he could be allowed to enjoy that benefit that allr whitehouse thought so himself was clear from his having enjoined air fellowes to keep the matter secret wvith this view of the case his lordship thought the decision of tlse vicecchancellor corsect and that as to twothirds of the sum in question mir wkitchouse must be considered a trus tce for messrs faweett and shaud two objections had been taken by the defendants coiiiisel the one that mlessrs kinight anid co had been iiiade parties and the other that a sum of  p art of the suiii in question had net yet been paid his lotdship thought the first objectioni untenable and that under the decree the quesdon on the second did not arise lookinig then at the wliole of the transacdon and considerinn the clearness of the evidence lie thought the decree ought to be affirmed and with costscoates v

clainmed to have that restoreda discussion of some length followed as the prior right ot openin the petitionsthe lottd chancellor observed that the petition in support of which the solicitorgeneral appeared was to claim the right of all the residue of the testator s estates after pay ment of debts legacies and annuities the other petition was to establish a claim upon the fund and therefore to re duce the residue his lordship thought the latter petition ought to have the prioritymr solicitongeneral was so desirous to open his own petition today that he would adnit the facts of the other
