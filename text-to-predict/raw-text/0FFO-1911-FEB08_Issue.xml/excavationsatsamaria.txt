exoavantone t  aierusalem r the capital of t kingdom of judab has for many years attrated the atten tion of the excavator and thearchologist chiefly ii doubt wifgtothe importanle attaching to that

the ext nsiveness ofits rumins and the costliness of a scientific exploration of its site in  howeveran expaditionwasconducted thither by dr gottlieb schuriacher the well knovm german excavator whosb work at tellelmutesellim megiddo had already wlon for him ad worldwide repue atin and professor g a reisner under ithe directorship of pro fessor d g lyon of harvard universitye b  exr inmo  the expedition to the suipport of which mr jacob h schiff of nrew york contributed so mnmificently set out in the spring of  work was commenced on april  and was continued with interruptions till august  professor reisner being at the time engaged in making an arch eological survey of upper egypt the work at samaria was entrusted to dr schumacher reisner was however able to absent himself for a short time in april and went out with schumacher to plan out the work for the year in thefollowing month professor d g lyon and with him mr c s fisher of philadelphia who had done such good work as archite t and draughtsman in the expeditions to nippur conducted by peters harper haynes and hilprecht under the ausplces of the university of pennsylvania between the years  and  joined the party tlle ruins of israels ancient capital are to be found on a large isolated hill some ft high situted aboiit sik mles northwest of ablls shechem land  rmiles from the mediterranean the hill is covered with olive orchards fig trees and poinegranates thi hill was purchased by omari who built a town called shomern samaria thereon about  bc l kings xvi  ahab the son of omri built a temple to baal there and also an  ivory palace the site being occupied as the capital of the northern kingdom down to  bc l kings xxii il kings xviii but in thatyear the city was captured by sargon who cartied off oqo people into captivity the remainder of those left in the city beng ruledby anassyrian governor il kings lxvi xviii  sargon and esarhaddon further installed  babylonian colonists in place of the exiled lsraelites the city was subsequently taken by alexander the great but continued to be occupied right downi to the time of herod who rebuilt it and named it sebaste  bc the mound thus contains the remains of four distinct cities herods city the seleucid city the babylonian city the histoiy of which lay between  the  date of israels captivity and alexanders ascendency and lastly the israelite city with which we are immediately concerned    resuts of exspedmoxthe actual diggiig in  which went on for nine weeks was productive of ample results though not of the period especially desired most of the finds belonging to the grzecoroinan period frive trial pits were dug near the modern village of sebastiyeh whichresulted in the discovery of a large building the norther end of which was excavrated the masonry was excellent and the blocks of stone used of considerable size the original building was evidently a temple of roman tirnes the later structure one of the chief features of which was a broad curve suggestive of the apse of a church belong ing probably to the byzantine period alarge number of arabic lamps quantities of roman roof tiles together with some greek andpoman pottery and broken glass were found here excavations on the citadel itself were however productive of more important results at a depth of t below the surface a massive wall consisting of large stones five courses of which are still in position was brought to light unfortunately as this discoversy was made towards the end of the seasons work itwas too late to follow it up that year but the fact that it lay buried beneath some ft of debris appeared to indicate that it belonged to hebrew times and was made by hebrew masons while further evidence of its hebrew origin was forth coming in the discovery of similar stones in the immediate neighbourlhood bearing marks sucli as have been found elsewhere and which have been regarded as betokening a hebrew paentage another trench brought to liglht two cisterns a plastered stone drain and the remains of ancient buildings while a further trench revealed a stairway ascending from the north  steps of which were partially un covered the top step being ft below the sur face the blocks of stone composing the stair way are about one yard long and are alike well cut and well laid the stairway was originally ft wide the shortest step now measuring ft and the longest abouit ft at the foot of the stairway is a supporting wall of rude masonry about sft high ard perhaps of earlier date about ft south of the stairway and a foot or so below the surface a platform com posed of thick slabs of stone was discovered ft in length and ft in breadth beneath the platform remains of earlier walls were found in a trench running south at a depth of ft was found a largne piece of mosaic boor a deep cistern and erude but masive walls on the west of the staay a large chamber about oft by ft was excavated the top of which is on a level with the lowest step and the northern wall of which is i lne with the northern wall supporting the stairway the walls which had evidently been heavily coated with plaster and upon which traces of colour were actually found are very massive and the roof consisted in an arch of which a part still remains in position a cutting through the floor of the chamber revealed the presence of yet earlier floors of beaten earth beneatl a few graffiti were recovered and many fragments of latin inscriptions on pieces of marble slabs but the only sculptures were a roman torso finely carved out of a block of white marble and probably representing augustus and portions of an unknown head of colossal size a short distance north of the stairway a roman altar was found and on the west of the altar two large blocks of stone were found bearing the characteristically hebrew marks already alluded to while in a pit not far from the altar a column cut out of the rock nearly round and about a yard in diameter still stands inposition fragments of coloured stucco were found here with greek letters scratched on them in  excavations were resumed on may  and continued till november  this cam paign was in charge of professor reisner and mr c s fisher as in  the chief interest centred round the summit  a wall was discovered which relsner at the time believed to be part of the palaee of omri and ahab while pro fessor huguies vicent a leading autlhority on palestinian archmeology shared the same opinion in a chamber beneath the palace several fragments of pottery inscribed in hebrew were found while soath of the palace a fragment of cuneiform inscription with a hebrew sealstamp was brought to light traces of an ancient hebrew tower were also discovered and the remains of the wall of the ancientisraelite city were found on the edge of ehe lower terrace the western gateway of the city being at the same time discoveredidmcaon of a s pacebut the excavations of  the reportof which has not yet been published are those which have produced by c far the most important and the most positive results so far as hebrew bistory is conbeernej s sonme of pthe londn apers have given brief amd somewhat inaccurate accounts of thework doneand the discoveries rmade ebiefly owing tothe fact that the excava tors have not as yet hd time to publishtheir eport readers may be fad to h a correbt statement based upon a communication just Â±eceived fromian american professor a member of the  archcological institute xegarding the actually ascertained facts from whith we know that besides being able to identify with practical certainty the palaces of the leraelito kings and especially that of ahab reisner ftound a large numboer of ostrka inscribed with r beautifl typeof the old hebrewcharacters the leends recorded on the ostraka are mono onous but to a considerable extent all the more mnstructive for this reason besides tlbh names of persons and places and some mnew ciphers for numerals they contain a few such expressions as oldvinee and  larified oil ehowing what ahab had in his cellars an inscribed ioyal votive offerng fromn egypt confirmed the date t his latter fact is of supreme value owing to the disturbance of the site in successive periods and the consequent dhiiculty of assilgniu dates to all that the excavations have brought to light  the as yet unpublished report on the excavations was given by lyon and that on the ostraka bvy moore accordigly the  clay tables alluded to by one correspondent of adaily paper is presumably a somewhat unhappy description of the ostraka while the letter referred to by the same writer asbaving been sent to ahab by a rhing of assyria who the writer pro ceeds dr yahuda believes was either assurbanipal or his son salnanesser ii  is somewhat enigmatical it is quite possible that a communlication from the latter king to ahab may  cone  to light  but it hrdly seems probable   that assurbanipal who reigned some  years after ahabs deatlh at ramothgilead should have troubled to correspond svith the latter presumably tdr yahuda or nis reporter has confused assur benipal with assunasirpal during whose reian israel tnay have come into contact with the assnrian colossus but of such contact no evidence has up to the present been forth commgit wouldl be impossible to overestimate the importance of the results achieved by the indefatigable labours of professor reisner and his fellowworlkers for ahab was one of israels greatest kings if oneof the most worthless from the purely moral standpoint his control over the southern kgdom was complete jehosha phat ling of udah bemg compelled to follow hqim in the field whether it were in the army of biridri king of syria against shalmaneser iior as afterwards when ahab attempted to throw off the yoke of biridri his suzerain overlord thus once imore have the dead stones of a longburied but famous pastarisen to tell agpdn the story of israels little kingdoni and the strange part she has been called upon to play in the history of the world
