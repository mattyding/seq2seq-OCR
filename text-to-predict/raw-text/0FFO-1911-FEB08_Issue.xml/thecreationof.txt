the creation of peers as aconstitutional questionifrom a corespondentit has been contended of late that it would be quite in accordance with precedent for the prime minister to advise the king to promise to create leers in sufficient numbers to outvote al opposition in the house of lords to the parliament bill and that if the prime minister were to tender such advice his majesty would have no option but to follow it or as it is sometimes put his majesty would be bound to give such a promise if he acted  con stitutionally the king it appears is to exercise no discretion and hsve no opticn the minister is sole autocrat and no inquiry even as to what are tho elements which constitute his majority in the house of commons can affect the matter to such an extent is this sometimes assumed to be the case thai it has actually been said that the unionists wil shortly be able  to compel the government to create  peers  in view of so startling an assertion it seems worth inquiring whether anything is to be found in our constitutional history to support itand finst it is advisable to ask what is meant when a particular course of action is said to be  constitutional  or  unconstitutional it has been pointed out by a learned author that these are very vague terms frequently used to indlicate merely approval or disapproval of a particular course of action hallam defines an  unconstitutional as distinguished from an  illegal act as meaning a novelty of much importance tending to endanger the established laws const hist th ed vol  p  sir george lewis says that when certain practices or usages though not legally binding on any part of the com munity have been constantly observed both by the governors and governed they are properly styled constitutional and any measure or prac tice contrary to thon is styled unconstitutional on the usa and abuse of pohtical terms p  and see hearns government of eng pp  whatever precise definition may be adopted it seems clear that no exercise of dis cretionary power van be pronounced to be constitutional without some examination into the past working of our constitution having special reference to a similar exercise of the power on former occasionsthere appear to have been three occasions in our history and three occasions only on which the creation of peers for the purpose of securing a majority in the house of lords on a question on which the house had already expressed its opinion was seriously contem platedthese arose upon the proposed repeal of the test act in  bv james ii the peace of utrecht in   the reform bill of as to the first little need be said for before james ii could create the peers to repeal the test act he was deposed in the opinion of the late dr hearn professor of modern hiistory and afterwards dean of the faculty of law in the university of melbourneone of our most distinguished authorities on con stitutional lawif the king had carried out his project and created the peers  this exercise of the prerogative would have found its place in the black catalogue of royal enormities contained in the declaration of rights government of eng p the precedent of in december  queen anne announced to parliament that arranrements were made for the nogotiation of a treaty of peace in the house of lords an amendment to the address was carried advising the queen that nopsace nid be safe or honourable if spain and tli west indies were allotted to any branch of the house of bourbon and other resolutions hostile to the policy of the tory covernment were passed in order to secure a majority favourable to the government policy  peers were created on december  t wo days later they entered the house and voted for the government the terms of the treaty were by these means approved by both hotuses and the treaty was in due course coneludedthe general sentiment with which the  new members who were nicknamed the  occasional peers were received both by the house of lords and by the country at large seems to have been fairly represented by the contemptuous inquiry of lord wharton when he asked oneof them whether they were going to give their votes singly or by their foremanothe matter however did not rest there on the accession of george i the leaders of the tory party the duke of ormond lord boling broke and the earl of oxford were impeached the two former escaped to france lord ox ford was committed to the tower and after nearly two years confinement was brought to trial in june on the trial of the impeachment bv the knights citizens and burgesses of the house of commons in parliament asembled in the name of themselves and of all the commons of great britain one of the articles charged the earl of oxford for that having  used his utmostendeavours to subvert the ancient established constitution of parliaments the great and only security of the prerogative of the crown and of the rights liberties and properties of the people and being most wickedly determined at one fatal blow as far as in him lav to destroy the freedom and independency of the house of lords he about december   being then lord high treasurer of great britain and one of her majestys privy council and assuming to himself an arbitrary direction and controul in her majestys councils contrary to his duty and his oath and in violation of the great trust reposed in him and with an immediate pur pose    to prevent the good effects of the said advice of the house of lords and in order to obtain such further resolutions of that house oi parliament on the important subject of the negociations of peace as nmight shelter and promote his secret and unwarrantable pro ceedings together with other false and evil counsellors did advise her majesty to make and create twelve peers of this realm and lords of parliament    whereby he did most highly abuse the influence he then had with her majesty and prevailed on her to exercise in the most unprecedented and dangerous manner that valuable and undoubted prerogative which the wisdom of the laws and constitution of this kingdom hath entrusted with the crown for the rewarding signal virtue and distinguished merit by which desperate advice he did not only as far as in him lay deprive her majesty of the continuance of those seasonable andwholesome counsels in that critical juncture but wickedly perverted the true and only end of that great and useful prerogative to the dis honour of the crown and the irreparable mischief to the constitution of parliaments  state trials art  pp to this article the earl answered that by the laws and constitution of this realm it is the undoubted right and prerogative of the sovereign wbo is the fountain of honour to create peers of this realm    and that the exercise of this branch f the prerogative is declared in the form orpreamble of all patents of honour to proceed exr mero motg as an act of mere grace and favour and that such acts are not done as many other acts of a public nature are by and with the advice of the privy council or as acts of pardon usually run upon a favour able representation of several circumstances or upon reports from the attorneygeneral or other officers    but flow entirely from the beneficient and gracious disposition of the sovereign that if her mÂ£ajesty had asked his opinion whfther the persons she itspded tocreate were proper to be promoted to the dignity he should have highly approved her choice since they were all persons of honour and dis tinguished merit and as some would have been peers by descent the peeragewas not greatly increased thereby and that the prerogative had been exercised by former princes in as extensive a manner ibid pp owing to a dispute between the two houses respecting the conduct of the trial the commons subsequently refuscd to appear and the imr peachmeht was therefore disnissed dr hearn points out that the earls answer except so frx as it denied that he gave advice was irrelevant the charge was not that improper persons were appointed or that the peerage was unduly in creased or that the simultaneous creation of so large a number was objectionable the gist of the offence charged was that the minister wil fully advised a measure which deprived her majesty of a continuance of the wholesome advice of tho house of lords it being the function of that house to advise the crown in all affairs of state and that he induced her majesty to exercise her prerogative in a manner calculated to injure the constitution of parlia ment hearns govt p  these points are strongly insisted on in the speech of mr hampdenone of the anagers for the commons  state trials p such was the result of the one and only instance recorded in english history of the actual creation of a batch of peers for the special pmpose of securing a majority in the house ofords to support a particular policythis transaction has been stigmatized by constitutional authorities whigs and tories alike as an unwarrantable straining of the constitution macaulay after say ing that the prerogative had in the opinion of the whigs been grossly abused saysthe theory of the english constitution according to many high authoril ties was that threo independent powers the sovereign the nobility and the commons ought constantly to at as checks on each other if this theory were sound it seemed to follow that to put one of these powers under the absolute control of the other two was absurd crit and hist essays ed  vol   life of addison p  hallam refers to it as  a resource which would be always at the com mand of successive factions till the british nobility might become as numerous and venal as that of some european states const hist lth ed vol  p the rapid increase in the number of peers in the reigns of william iii queen anne and george i was regarded with jealousy by existing peers and aroused the apprehensions of the whig party then in power who fearing that the prince of wales might after his accession exercise this prerogative in favour of their opponents introduced in the house of lords in  and again in  a bill for limiting the number of peers in future to six beyond the existing number of  lord sunderland the allpowerful minister of that day persuaded the king to consent to this proposed limit of the prerogative in referring to the almost unanimous sentence which has been pronounced by posterity upon the great constitutional question thus raised hallam says itwas justly thought a proof of the kings ignorance or indifference in everything that concerned his english crown that he should have consented to so momentous a sacrifice and sunderland was reproached for so audacious an endeavour to strengthen his private faction at the expense of the fundamental laws of the monarchy hallams const hist th ed vol  p  from this  sentence pronounced by posterity  one conclusion seems obvious if the adverse criticism of the conduct of george i was well founded it must be on tho ground that he ought in this matter of hiis prerogative to have exercised an independent judgment and not to have acted on his ministers adviceone other occasion on which a stop similar to that taken in  was seriously discussed remains to be considerednamely thlat which arose in and the consideration of thit is reserved for a second article
