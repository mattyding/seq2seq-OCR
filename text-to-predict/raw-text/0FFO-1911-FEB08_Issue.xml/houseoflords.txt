hoped that lord onslow might be able to take up the duties again later in the tsession and therefore this motion was made provisionally he was sure that it would be the universal regret of their lordships to hcar the cause of lord onslows absence hear hear during the recess he had been in comrmunica tion with the noble marquis opposite as to this subject and he thought the leader of the opposition would contirm hirxt in saying that no one was more qualified than lord balfour to fill the gap in the absence of the chairman rear hearthe mlarqais of lansdownll said he thought that their lordslhips would readily concur in the motion which had been made the house as a whole would certainly concur with the noble earl in the regret which he had expressed and at the reason for which this appointment was necessary lord onslow had been a great sufferer for some time past and hc knelv that it was with the utmost reluctance that lord onslowv had found it necessary to give up his duties fir the present at all events yheir lordships would hope that lord onslow would be able later to attend to the duties of the chair which he discharged with so much alility and satisfaction and that he might be quickly restored to health it vould be admitted also that no more adequate substitute for lord onslow could be found than lord balfour and he thought that the house was greatly indebted for the readiness which he had shown to step into the gap at this timethe motion was agreed tothe sugarbeet industrythc earl of denbigh rose to ask the following question  having regard to the hopes held out by ministers in both houses of parliament during the past session as to the possibility of assisting the establishment of the sugarbeet industry in the british isles by grants from the development fund to ask his majestys government whether they now consider that such a method of procedure is possible and if not what they propose to do for the encourage ment of an industry which would confer such benefits on our agricultural districts and on the country generally he said that the subject was occupying public attention to an increasing degree while manu facturers on the continent were watching its develop ment very closely and with a certain amount of appre hension a new departure in respect of it had taken place in holland where the manufacturers were coming to the english mariket and inviting the farmers in east anglia to grow beetroot and to export it to hiolland for the manufacture of sugar the results of growing bect had been most encouraging and they had effectually disproved the contention that the english climate was unfavourable for the cultivation of sugarbeet all that was needed at present were capital expetience and organization re impressed upon the hovuse that the number of persons engaged in agriculture were now only a half of the number engaged  years ago and that great britain now produced but a small quantity of wheat sugar was one of the necessaries of life aud fivesixths of our supply was the beet sugar iniported from the continent a question of this national importance should be taken up by the government of the day in germany austria france and america it was admitted that where ever the sugar industry had been established an enormous amount of good had been done the value of land had been raised and land which had gone out of cultivation had been brought into good agricultural value ile wanted to ask now whether the government wvere of opinion that it was practicable to develop this industry and if notwhat they proposed as an altermative measure for the revival of agriculture they heard rumours of the remnission of the sugar duty the only people who would benefit by that would be the mineral water manufacturers whole salc confectioners and jam manufacturers and he did not think the prospect of mineral water manu facturers being able to make larger profits was a matter of such importance as doing something for the reviival of agriculture hie suggested that the sugar industry should be treated as an infant industry as laid down by mill and should be given the advan tage of an import duty without an excise say for five years that would make a difference of £ a year to the factories and would be an inducement to people to come forward and invest money in the industry were the government prepared to treat this as a businesslike proposition in a businesslike way earl carrington assured the noble earl that no one on the government benches treated the sugarbect industry as a mere fad that the present government had taken great interest in the agri cultural industry was shown by the fact that a quarter of a million of public money bad been cheer fully voted for its advancement fifty tbousand pounds had been voted for the purpose of promoting horse breeding alone and he hoped that something very practical and satisfactory wvould come of thatthe earl of denbighwhat has that to do with sugar earl carritngton said that as to what the government proposed to do for the encouragement of the sugar industry he was able to say that the board of agriculture proposed to make arrange ments for further experimental growth and to give publicity to that fact but he ventured to think with the noble earl that the experimental timle was somewhat over anid it was now generally known thbat very good sugarbeet of commercial quality could be grown in this country where the soil was suitable what then was the next step  it was of course the establishment of factories for the cxtraction of the sugarfor that a certainamount of capital was  requircdhe was told a sugarbeetfactory could not be run under £ and so far investors had been unwilling to sub scribe to any large extent however several com panics had been started and the promoters were more or less sanguine of the result what the noble earl asked the government to do was to leave things exactly as they were in the matter of the sugar duty for five years in other words the government were to pledge themselves for five years to give no relief from taxation to the consumers of sugarwhich under the duty had risen from £ or £ per ton to £ or £ per tonor to the great industries of which sugar was the raw material with the old and ex ploded policy of dry nursing an infant indulstry the government would bave nothing to do at the same time as president of the board of agriculture he should be the last person in the world to throw cold water upon the efforts of the noble earl to introduce a new important and most beneficial industry into the agricultural w orld if the prospects of the cultiation of sugar beet were sio promising as the noble elrl represented thenm to be plenty of money would he forthcoming from private sources to develop it and the noble earl would go down to posterity as a benefactor of the farmers of this countrythe earl of selboritne said he agreed it was the duty of a government to be most cautious and careful in advancing public money for the encourage mnent of a new industry at the same time be pro tested most strongly against the doctrine just laid down that it was not the function of the board of agriculture at any time or in any circumstances to assist any new development in agriculture it was the experience of the colonies and of all foreign countries that when the government asisted the farmers to do what they could not do themselves especially in the matter of organization agriculture had extended and flourished when he went out to south africa a high commilssioner six years ago not a single sack of maize was exported from that country last year there were  sacks ex ported and the trade had become one of the most important in the world if the government of the transvaal held the same view of the function of government in regard to new industries as had been advanced by the prcsident of the board of agricul ture that great trade would not now be in existence it was due to the fact that the transvaal government arranged the railvay rates and the ship ping freights and supplied the stores for the maizecand thus set the whole organization in motion the quality of the maize was pronounced universally good and it had at once stcpped into the front of the european market that action of the trarsvaal government stood a chance of giving to south africa that same close settlement and intense cultivation which the cultivation of wheat had given to canada this wonderful economic transformation of south african agriculture had been entirely brought about by the action of the governmentthe earl of grewe said he was not quite certain that the interesting fats hich the noble earl had relatcel from his own personal experience were entirely rclevant to the subject of the question asked ljord denbigh asked that for a fixed term of fiveyears the duty on foreign sugar should be maintained and that no equivalent excise duty should be raised n homegrown sugar that was a definite proposal and it did not seem to him to stand in any close rclation to what fell from the noble earl aboutthe organization of agriculture in regard to which he complained of the dictum laid down by earl carring ton the boble earl mentionied railway rates that all pointed in the direction of the nationalization of english railways and the consequent fxinig of rates for the benefit of a particular industry the objection which bad hitherto been taken to that scheme was that it was of too socialistic a character they saw how ncar socialism and protection approached when it came to the question of the encouragement of industry and the wellknown saying of bastiat that a protec tionist was a socialist with an incmc o  francs a year seemed to be exemplified by ihe character of the proposal of the noble ear lord denbighs proposal was frankly protectionist and it was pro tection applied in a peculiarly dangerous and damaging way to british industries and the british cortsumet ever since the speeches delivered bv mr chamberlain at glasgow acd greenock in  they had always understood that if it were found that the food of the working classes was in any way increased in price by the adoption of mfr chamlberlains policy sugar and tea were the two articles t which they were to look by a reduction of the tas for redressing the balance of the working mans budget that was a prospectwhich must be finally abandoned in order to give the industry of sugargsrowing in this country an extra chance lord denbigh sought to prove that sugagrowin in this country was mbre important than the possible damage to the industries which flourished when the price of sugar was low he very much doubted whether there vwas any prospect of sugargrgwing in this country even in favourable circurrstances becoming an industry which would compete on the mere  question of employment with those great industries which depended upon cheap sugar and that of course was apart from the question of the interests of the consumer which would be compromised for the tervi of five yearsviscount st allw y said he was somewhat in sympathy with the noble earl lord crewe for this reason that he did notthink it would be possible either for the present government or for any govern ment that was likely to succeed to it to make the promise which lord denbigh desired he thought he was right in saying that the present government through their spokesmen in the house of commons had thrown out a suggestion if not a promise when the finances of the country permitted to abolish the existing duty on sugar he deeply regretted that he was responsible for the imposition of the sugar duty he was supported by the highest financial authority of the opposition of that day sir william harcourt and he believed that no better duty was ever proposed therefore he deeply regretted that both sides were to a certain extent pledged to its repeal then the noble earl said if they attempted to deal with railway rates they were suggesting socialistic doctrines it was perectly possible if the governtnent of the day thonght it desirable to establish a new and lower rate by legislation for sutgarbeet over the railways without any question whatever of socialism or nationaliztion of the railwashe thought there was something wanting  in the speech of the noble earl it wasadmitted bythe president of the board of agriculture that it had been proved thatsugar beet could be successfully cultivated in this country and surely everybody admitted nowadays tbat any thing that could be reasonably done by the govern ment to improve the present position of agriculture was very desirable if a great new industry like the production of sugarbeet could be introduced it would give employment and utilize the land in a way in which it was not now being used why could not the development grant be employed in some way for this purpose hear hear was it mpossible for the government to consider whether through the promotion of some kind of agricultural organization in this country which might be of enormous advantage in the extension of small hold ingsfor he believed the cultivation of sugarbeet was precisely one of the kinds of cultivation which could be dealt with by small holdersthey could not do something towards giving this importaht ndustry a fair starto would that be contrary to the principles of bree tradme would it rot be doing precisely what every one had a right to expect and what he wnan sure the president of the board o
