outside assistance to examine the question which was by no means so simple  in character as some people imagined the chairman of the committee was sir mattliew nathan the secretary to tbepost office who had given to its sece indefatiglhe zeial and devotion the first repornt of thit mrittce was eonnleted some weeks ago and would bpteseidfopailii mentwitbin the rext few days suggestions had been heard in some quarters that the principal recommendation of the report would be thc substitu tion of girls for boys as telegraph messengers who would be paid on a lower scale of pay and be had been attacked on the ground that he was anxnous to employas many girls as possible in order to save is per week each in the wages ile did not know how that report had oniinated but it was widespread and had been circulated by some of the staff journals whose contributors ought to have known better ile had never contemplated that girls thould be employed for the delivery of messages that xwas a most unsuitable employment for girls it would subject them to dangers and temptations from which they should be safegdarded the proposal whlich was a comparatively insigmificant part of the whole scheme was that scme  girls instead of boys might carry messagesinside the post office buildings from one room to another where women were wholly or largely employedgnus wcx and wagesthe number of adult situations for boys when they grew up was not large enough for their evenutna employmeit on the other irand there mere a large number of positions available for girls and it would be quite easy to absorb as telephonists or othereise these  girlmessengers the hours low worked by the boys would be rather too long for young girls it was therefore thought that they should be employed for shorter hours and afterwards receive instruction within the post offie buildings they would be employed foor fewer hours and would receive a correspondingly sraller wage but there was no suggestion that the hourly wage should be smaller for the girls than that received bv the boys the department had never entertained the idea of subsuting girls for boys i order to eicet economiessipax g tee pxrvonzatthe department desired to reduce the numaber of boymessengeers as much as possible by extending the use of the telephone of pneumatic tubes and other mechanical devices in various ways it was hoped to bring the total number of boys down from  to  every year in addition to the  boys disniissed from the service some  were absorbed a number that could not be very largelyr extended because of the
