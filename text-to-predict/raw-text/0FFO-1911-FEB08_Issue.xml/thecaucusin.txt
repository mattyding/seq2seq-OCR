the agaugs n m ain ai i  l   i experinces of the lst  session i  j  ojur austr licournespolmtin three of the australian legislstures  the federal thesolithaustralian and thatof newvsouth waleslabouris in office with a clear miajority behind it and it hats irought with it into power the same caucus system which stood it in godd stead while it was a third party and which directly it became the regular ministerial or opposition partv several of its ablest leiderss were ainous to abolish it may be interesting to noteour first experience of this new constitutional devicea hinistry perpetually and imme diately responsible to the mass of its followers and bound to submit fortheir criticism in detail its principal measures before and during their passage through parliamentdszvralorsxevc of the systemit should be understood that thisperpetual supervvision is not an essential or origmal part of the caucus system the gqverning idea of labour caucuses is that on matters afectig the pfrs platform the wlhole body of iiiembers must vote as the majority of them decides the origingl caucus was thus iather an oca sionail than a regular meeting only needed when a vote bf censure or the second redding of an important bill was iupending but enthusiastic members found regular weekly meetng during the session a valuable aid to their political education as well as a means of promoting mutualunderstanding between the various sections of the paatfor labour it must be remnembered has alwavs been a nsme comnion to men of very diversepolitical views once nimde rgzblar these meetings assumed an importance of their oevn quite apart from the mandatorycharacter of any decision arrived at the leaders were kept in closetouch with their followxcrs on points of the merest detail and while still in opposition acquired the habit of explaining tbeir own vieiws in consider able detail to any doubtful or recaleitrant member while mr watson was the leader he managed to retain a personal donminance which veiled even irom its members the powefs latent in this weekly meeting but he foresasw the possible danger and did his best to extract the sting when he resigned horever and a new leader had to be chosen the caucs woketo a knowledge of its power it was significat that ir fisher was clioseli as chairman not as leader of the partyanother step was taken whlen the party was called on to undertakc ministerial responsibilit mr watson in  chose his colleagues for himself the caucus chose them for tr fisher both in  and in  still he allotted the offices among the men assigned as his fellowministers even that privilege seems doomed to extinction particular ministers have been during the recent session singled out for attack in caucus and before his term is over the prime miinister may find himself ordered to replace at least one and perhaps to transfer another to a different departmentthis however is anticipation merely aiid probably pessimistic but the actual everyday use of caucus powers is quite strteling enough already although its nominal control of individual membersof ministers as of othets is confined to general decisions on points con cerned with the fighting platform in practice it dominates inisterial actions in considerable detail the party is pledged t act solidly in eertain matters it prefers to act solidiv in all matters it triestherefore to thrash out its internal differences in caucus but the younger members ushig the term in a parliamentary senss while taking full advantage of their power in caucus are still too undisciplined to accept any measure of control outside their obligation while that is they ventilate all their grievances and attack linisters as freely as they please inside the labour room they refuse to be guided by the majority of the party w hen its caucus decision is against them and merely transfer the scene of their campaign to the house itself where some oppositionists can usually be found to back them up this offends the old members sense of solidarity and umless he has strong personal views on the point in question an old member is inclined to preserve solidarity by agreemg with the man who will not accept defeat rather than with the minister who is bound to accept it if it comes since he is from the method of his election subordinate to the caucus so tne extremists and the grumnblers obtain power beyond their numerical weight much can be done in politics out here on the principle of  oh pay iiim whiat he wants and let him go orhe will make a scene in the streetits lhrrdxxce ox deaitcuriously enough the external effects of the caucus system seem to have fallen as much behind expectation as the internal have gone beyond it if you trust solely to the reports of the partisan dailies of course the external effects have been horible ussion has been burked debate has been stifled and brute force has flung uponthe countrys back a mass of tyrannical legislation from personal observa tion coupled with  the information given me by leading oppositionists i am inclined to discount this sort of talk very heavily in fact the very papers which today indulge in it will tell you tomorrow that the whole value of thesessions legislation resides in the amendments made by the opposition in labours crude and sketchy bils but they cannot have it both ways tthe truth seems to be this the labour partv  not unreasonably conceived that its astonishing victory in april constituted a mandate for certain proposals embodied in its fighting platform its work for the session it felt must be to take the most important and most easily dealtwithofthose proposals and shape them into definite legislation it was not inclined to lt time be wasted in re stating the arguments against the underlymig principlesthe elections had settled al that of the necessary detailed work how ever its chosen leaders knew little never havng been in office long enough to gain the requisite experience they were compelled therefore to bring down their bills in an experimental shape incluaing manv provisions which at first sight seemed necessary to their enforcement but could on reconsideration be omitted if the comparison is not too trivial their draft bills rather resembled the talk of a clever but still youangi child not quite sure of the meaning of its words and apt to use lonig and strong words to express its ideas where shorter and milder words wolid do the wbrk better when these mneasures came to bedebated ministers were only too glad to get help from any member of parliament whose previous experiente and practical knowledge fitted him to give valuable advice and it isto the credit of many of the leading oppositionists that they gave their help strarght i forwardly botl in the rouse and in priate with the one object of making the bill under consideration as good as possible in the cir cnustances other oppositionists however preferred to play the old conventional opposi ion reto reiterate the old guts repeat the old accusations renew the old obstractions as long as their opponentspatience held outyou can probably guess now whiat liappemed the irst

quite podssible to use the caucus mechanism in such a waythat bills conld be simply thrown at ahouse and passed unaltered by a dub majority but that has been known to happen inelouseswhere the
