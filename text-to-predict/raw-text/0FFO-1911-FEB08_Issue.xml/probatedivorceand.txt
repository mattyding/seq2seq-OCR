shortly before  am on the day in questionw was in the english channel about six to sevenmiles to the southwest and west ward of start point the weather was a thick fog the wind was light from these and the tide nearly low water and of little force the cheapside was making between tho and three knote through the water on a course of w c n magnetic and her whistle was being dluly sounded for fog at regulation intervalsin these eircumnstances a prolonged blast from a vessel apparently on the starboard bow was heard by those on board the theapside and her engines were at once stopped and a prolonged blast was sounded on the whistle what appeared to be a choked blast immediately followed by a long blast was then hcard from the other vessel and alniost at the same time the king alfred loomed in sight about ft away and broad on the starboard bow there upon the engines of the cheapside were at once rung full speed astern but immediately afterwards as thebest chanceof escaping or minimizing a coelsion the engines weie put full speed ahead the helm was starboarded and two short blasts were twice sounded on the whistle but altbough the ing alfred sounded three short blasts she continued to com on at a high rate of speed and with her ram immediately afterwards struck the cheapside so heavy a blow on tile starboard side aft in the way of the engineroom that the latter vessel shortly afterwards sankissus to be rimthe plaintiffs alleged that the collision as solely caused bythe negligent navigation of the defendant in charge of thee king alfred inasmuch as she i was nsvigated at an immoderate rate of speed having regard to the fog and the other existing circuma stances  failed to stop her engineswhen the fog signal of the cheapside was first heard  failed to slacken her speed or to stop or reverse in due timae or at all and  failed to make the prescribed signals for fog properly or at proper intervalsthe defendants case was that hmms king alfred bound

then he beard some thing broad on the stboard bow it sounded like the boan of a sailing ship and he remalked about it to the chief mate he stopped the engines and blew a long blast shortly afterwards they heard a squeaky sound which opened out into the sound of a siren it was on the same bearing but nearer both sounds had been reported limost immediately afterwards he saw white foam in the water

fog the engines had been eased to  revolutions it was a light fog and he could see g to  yards there was amanstationed at the sirenit was the port siren and it was being regularly sounded there vwas nothing the matter with it he ordered the engines to  revolutions when the signal of the cheapside was heard he judged it to be three points on the port bow he heard the signal foar times before the collision the cheapside loomed into sight at about  yards bearing about tbree points on the port bow he could see she waas going ahead but could not tell her speedthe officer of the watch gave the order hardaport but winess said  no no hardastarboard but before it could be caed out he gave the order to put the helm amidships stop both engines and then full astern there was an interval of about half a minute between the order to put the helm amidships and the order to stop three short blasts were blown when the engines were reversed theship had not altered under theport or starboard helm at

that was for economys sale it never became a dense fog until after the collision they were supposed to go at a moderate speedhe thonght ten knots was a moderate speed in that weather the officer of the watch had reduced to s revolutions and witness ordered them to inmrease to normal speed  when he came on the bridgeit was not true that they could only see a ships lengththe kings regulations did require them to stopon hearing a whistle forwacrd of their beam he justified the not stopping of his vessel on accouat of the distance  and to the fact that the position of the cheapside was ascertained he thought how ever that regulation was a mistake if he might say so he thought the cheapside was a vessel they were overtaking he knew article  of the regulations the helm was put to port when the officer of the watch gave the order but it had not been got hardaport when the order was countermandedhe did not blow his whistle when he gave the order to hardastarboard for it was only to counter act the effect of the order to pbrt it was not to change the course le thought the cheapside altered just before the collision under starboard helm about two points the siren never gave a spluttering sound both of them had been tried before the ship sailed the starboard siren was repaired after the collision he did not inquire what was the matter with it the admiral was on board at the time of thecollision the latitude and longitude was noted immediately after the collision and was communicated bywireless from the kingalfred to the admiraltylieutenant youngi the officer ofi the
