career of active service lord itoberts was devoting the golden years of his life to the splendid cause of niational defence that meeting like the league itself waus strictly nonpolitical and nonparty many of themn would be glad if the idcal of universal peace were realized but pending that reaization they must look facts in the facelord ranuers said that his plcasure in attending tihat meeting would be immacsurably increased if he xvere able to convince those of them who were ncot ahlrady convinced of the necessity for universal service iu our home defence and of the hopeless ness and utter inefficiency of the territorial army that there should be at present such a general fecling of security was perhaps not altogether astonishing seeing that for more than  years this country had never been seriously threatened by anything likc a strong invading force the volunteer force was never taken up in uarnest bv the nation it was loolke uipon more as a display of national senti mentas a prognostication of what might be necessary rather than as a necessity in itself it was largely the same wvith the territorial focce people would not be convinced that the territorial force could ever be required for the defence of this country it could not be conceived that that forceuntrained and consis ting chiefly of boyscould cope with an arny of tranined soldiers however powerful our nqavy might be it could not under all circumstances ensurc the safety of this country and we must havc in addit on to the navyv an army sufficient in nimbers efiicient in quality and thoroughly mobile and reaidv to take the field at a momentsi notice our expe ditionary fore which might mcan pranctic ally the whole of the ilegular army wvould be out of the way before an invasion was attempted we must therefore have a home arrny sufficient in itself to cope wvith danger from without thbat army must be based on sound democratic principles and it mustbe one in which all clases in the la ndthn sons of

believed that a strong england made for peace mfilitary training would implant discipline instead of hooliganism a sense of duty towards the country instead of irresponsibility and a strong national feeling in the place of  horrid indifference national service vrould bring classes together in a way that nothing else would bring them togethermr i r syrvrn kc mp also referred to sir ian hamniltons book and the first sea lords memorandum lie said that he should certainly have hesitated to make any criticism upon that book in the face of such authorities if it had not been for the fact that the distinguished authors bad made the very great mistake of giving their reasons yle heard with pletasure that detailed reply to the book was being prepared by the national service league and that in the preparation of that reply lord roberts was playing a conspicuous partmr c b fn who supported the proposition sail it was curious that no one had ever put forcibly before the people of this country the
