to look for guidance to the speeches of the respolisible leaders of the sections on which the government depended for their maiority the leader of the labour party had espressed his con fidence that the governmcnt would deal with the osborne judgment and the speeches of the hon and learned member for waterford showed that he and his colleagues would dictate the legislation of the government the

purview of the irish parliament in any liberal scheme of hiome rule the  right hon gentlemen replied reopudiating the three statements as untrue and misleading and saying that the mistakwapossibly due

sent to the lord lieutcant in which she stated that she was a presbyterian and was married to her husband in a presbyterian church in  hler husband ws a romaa catholic but it was arranged that they should continue to attend their own different places of worship there were two children of the marriage a catholic priest tried  to persuade her to go through the catliolic rites  telling her that she was not really married and that her children were illegitimate  she refused and her husband and she besought that they might be left alonethe priest threatened that i she did not  comply with his request there woull beno peace in the house that her husband would not live with her and that it he did hisco relgionists would cease to speak to or recognize him finding that be could not persuade her the priest left the house in an angry and threatening mod from this time onwards her husbands attitude towards her changed he began to illtreat her and told her that she was not his wife and that she was nothing to him but a common woman the baby was talen by her husband to the chapel and there baptiaed on retl rning home one day she foud that both her childrenhad been removed and her husband refused to tell her anything about them except that they were sae a day or two afterwards returning to her home after an absence of two hours she found that everything including her wearing apparel and cven her underclothing had been remnoved her husband left her but she subsequently saw him atthe place where he was working eagain refused to tell her where tbe children were and told her to go to the pdiest in whose hands he said the whole matter was hie also said that unless she vas re married in chapel she would never see the children she subsequently saw the priest who told her he could give her no information and treated her with scant courtesy she had tried to find her husband but had failed and she could not get any information as to the whereabouts of her hildren   am the petition concluded  driven to apply to you as the head of allauthority in this countryfor help i am without money but for the help of kind friends i would be starving i want to get my children and to know if they are alive and i have been told that if you ask your law officers to mako inquiries they could soon get me my ights will you please do so and help me a poor heartbroken woman lord adenmdms atdru that letter which was he thought a great tribute to the courage and spirit of this poor woman was sent to the lord lieutenant on december  the next day a telegram was sent to his excellency informing him that the belfast presbytery had unanimously resolved to support the case of mrs mccannthat it was proposed to institute proceedings and asking that the police should help to find the whereabouts of the husband s that he might be sceved a con firming letter was sent to thelord lieutenant the same day in which the help of the police was gain asked for on the same day thatthat letter reached his excellency a telegram was sent on his behalf to mrs mccann asking for certain further particulars including the name of the priest these were given so far as mrs mccarn knew them she admitted that she did not know the name of the priest but she added that he was on the staff of the iclergy of the church to which her husband belonged and that she could identify him if she saw him then came the only and the final reply of the executive it was ad dressed to the convener of the belfast presbytery on december  and was in the following terms i am directed by the lord lieutenanv to acknow ledge the receipt of your telegram of saturday and also your letter of that date received today his excellency has also received a letter from mrs mccann alleging that her children had been removed from her by her husband who had also deserted herin the absence of any evidence that a criminal offence had been committed his excellency is advised that there is nothing to warrant his interventidn or the interference of the police so far as can be judged from the  very general statement submitted to his excellency the matter appears to be one alto gether for a civil action and his lexcellency notes that the belfast presbytery proposes to institute legal proceedings presumably on behalf of mrs mccannthat letter purported to ignore the whole pointof the request made bythe woman forthe assistance of the police as a condition preceding the institution of proceedings in doing that it betrayed the elementary duty of the executive because under our constitution if any member lost the smallest article of propertynot to say his or her children and gave information to the police they did not say that it was a civil matter but endeavoured to trace the lost property the commentary on this remark able case was that all that had to be done even under our boasted constitution and civilization in the case of persons who were legally married according to the settled law of the land was that if the emissaries of any church got possession of the children and butied them away where they could not be discovered they could defy the law it might be said that if this occurred under an imperial ixecutive and with an imperial parliament sitting what argumente was that against hiome llule  hec was not misguided enough to raise that contention for there had not cbeen an imperial executive in ireland since  cheers and ntionalist laughter that was not his statement for the hon and learned member for waterford told an audience in amnerica in september  that ever since  the united trish league had been running the whole govern menit of ireland cheersmr j redmondi did not say since  butfor a long time before that toomr campbell said that in the folowing year on his next visit to america the hon and learned member made his meaning even more clear and repeated the statement with the additional informa tion that was no news to irish members but came as a revelation to english members that his colleaguae the hon member for west belfast was the de acto chief secretary for ireland cheers this case was a solemn warning to those in ireland who feared such results and he could only assure the house that it had strengthened the unalterable determination of the loyalists and protestants in that countythat at any sacrifice and cost they would struggle to retain what they believed to be the only guarantee for the continued enjoyment of their civil and religious rights to live under laws that had recelvid the sanction of that imperial parliament cheers he did not know how the government proposed to meet the position but could assure them that if they failed to give justice tothis unfortunate woman they in ireland would continue to arraign them if not at the bar of that house at least at the bar of public opinion in the country until they had obtained both justice and the stiu greater requirement of the suppression or withdrawal of this unwarrantable decree cheersmr bibrellmr bihrelli am rather sorry that the right hon gentleman should have thought fit in the dis position of his time somewhat tosmother up the circumstances of this case which i agree are ofdistressing character with  political matter and imputations which might have been left to some other of those very frequent occasions in our political life i do not propose to reply to the early part of his speech and am well content to leave the referenoes he made to my own observation in the very fair way in which he left it it must be apparent to every body what i meant and indeed what i said so i leave that matter where it is an hon member where is it  i am intellectually and miorally totaluy indifferent to the impression made by my language because i am persuadedthat it will be per fectly obvious to ans intelligenitman that imeant what isaid and said wbat i meant cheers and laughteri what i said wasyou never could  smuggle any home rule measure throughthis hoiuseabout this other matter the right hon and learned gentlemean was a very long time coming to his text hut i kneow it was there and i waited patiently the right hon and learned gentleman has introduced into it this we temere decree of thepope of rome that decree can be read in all its details by anybody who cares to obtain a copy from messrs brown and nolan printers and publishers in dublin i havenothing whatever to do with it mirs mccann is the lawful wedded wife of mr mccann according to the lavws of this realm and she isentitledto every legal right which flows from her etalus as a marrkd woman and there for my part the matter rests and must rest the right lhon gentleman in his speech in dublin laid great stress upon the fact that mrs mccann was married to mr mccalnn in the eyes of godxmr campbel said  of godand manmr birrellbut  the pope of rome is of opinion that a roman catholic should marry unless health prevents in a roman catholic chapel and if he is not so married in the opinion of his holiness he is not validly married according to the law of the church the right hon gentleman differs verv well we have a pope and an antipope laughter differing as to what is a marriagein the eyes of heaven it is i think a miatter within the limits of legitimate speculation to say that it is just possible that neither one authority nor the other knowsoris entitledto speak on that subject a laugh what we know is that these people are married andin every court throughout this realm in ireland scotland england and wvales mrs mccann is entitled to all her remedies and her rights as a married woman and when she goes into a courb of law and justlce this decree willnot be available to be read or considered bv counsel or judge my sympathies are undoubtedly with mrs mccann the case has not been tried out and i am well content simply to base my sympathy upon the fact that she has been deprived of her children who are of tender years and she does not linow at this  momeat where they are that is enough to excite my sympathy the memorial which the right bon arid learned gentleman read was of course not mrs mccains  composition but if she had written it herself and had not invoked the assistance of a clerical scribe i am certain i should have been miovedeven imbre the fict rapiiepa reitrue isthat she has been deprived of her children deprived of them by her husband bvthe laws of this country her busband is entitled to the custody of his children andto speak of it as a ease of kid±apping is obviously incorrects idnappmg itwas not in my opinion it was a most wrong and cruel act on gth part of this husband for whom i do not say a single word i know nothing of the circumstances of their married life it is senough for mato t now that they wero married that she had children of tender years that shocmine home one day and found that they had been taken awy and that she does not mnow wthere they are that happenbed some nonthsago but after a lapse of timneit camne to the knowledge of a number of influeiitial persons of character in belfast and they were interested as indeed whe woul niot have been interested in thc story which ihis pooi woman laid befoiethem all i can say is that they seem to have given her most extraordinary advice when the tight hon and learned entleman tells me that nothing eould be done thatthis womanr had no hnce unless she could lay her hands

amenable so long as she could not find her husband or the place in which her children wore detainedhr birbei am perfectly satisfied that the mother of the children upon an affidavit explaining the facts which have been read outwhich l assume are factscould have obtained in the  court of chancery an order for the production of her children which would have entitled the court to use all its powers to find out wherc they were and to have obtaied a lzabras copusand have thembrought up yet that wasnot done during all this long tunemr cadpbeithere is no proof of risdic tion e o   icmr

hyoi have only to read the speeches made by a number of clergymen and presbyterian ministers who thanked god for this easeopposition cries of name and that it happened just at this time in order to show the good people in england and scotland what would happen if llomebnule came into operation the point wvhich i make is that it would have been perfectly easy without waiting for the discovery ox ths man  to have taken proceedings that at all events is the view which iconfidently tak e as alawyr t poucuaa sd csthe right hon and learned gentleman complained very muchthat the castle did not perceive the point that petty larceny had been comnittedby the hlus band    mr campbeli said gross ouiremr birrellvell that is not a legal term the contention of the right hon gentleman was that when the father removed these children althoaugh as the fatheir he was entitled to the children he was not entitled to the clothes in which they werewrapped or to the clothing of his wife which it is alleged that he took away that point was not brought to the knowledge of the castle the woman statedthat her house had beenraided but the point was not raised that the assistance of the policewas asked in order to bring to justice somebody who had committed theft that was an afterthought on the part of the right hon gentleman himself whichhemadewfth very great force in a speech in dublin the view of the executivea view which i believe the attorney general is preparedto justifywas thatit was not a case for the polce at all  and inasmuch as the woman had behind her thewholepresbytery of thenorth of ireland it was evident that resources were available and that her true remedy was a eivil remedyas to the facts as they are now it came to my k nowledge a very short time ago that the father mr mccann a man for whom i do not say a single  word had dis appearel he has gone ad is no longer the custodian of these children i think that makes a very great differenceas hwox mlerrsxnwhere are theymr birrelli do not know but as soon as it became clear to me that the legal guardian of the childrenwho was entitled to have them and from whom they could not have been removed although no doubt the mother was entitled to access to them had gone the children being deprived of both of their guardians the time had arrived when it was the duty of the police to find out where the children were so long as they wrer in the care of their father and he was looking after thema it wvas not a case for the criminal law the police may be invoked to find a stolen pocklethandkerchief or umbrella but to say that the police may be invoked as private detectives to find children wlho are living with their father in whose legal custody they are is a proposition with which i cannot agree as soon as it camie to my knowledgeperhaps i should not say knowledge that the father bad gonei am told that he has gone i do nogr knowand that the children were without their natural guardians the police were instructed to find out where these children are and i hope they will prosecute their inquries with the utmost zeal so far as i am concerned if any sabscription were necessary to provide mrs mccann with the means of obtaining her legal rights and position i should be the first to subscribe opposition cries of  oh as etox mmngewe do not want that we want justicemr birrellwell vou do not want it and never did want it hear hear but i do want it it is a umost painful state of circumstances formrs mccann and i confess that i am thinking only of her and that i do not care very much for the angry faces of gentlemen opposite how bestthese children can befound and brought back to her custody and controlthat is the object which i have in viewto suggest that the police ought to have interfered nt an earlier stage is not in my judgment acourse wbich can be supported they are inquir ing now as best they can i am sure that after a debate in thisehousethey will inquiie with the greater fervour ind zeal i am not sorry that the matter has been brought to the notice of this house but do not let us according to the remarkable instance described in ginss baby be quarrelling and wrangling over details but letus discover these poor children and return them to their mother hearhearsir b carson dublin lniversitvi cannot but thinkhaving regardto the veryserious way in which this case is looked nlpon by the coreligionists of this lady in ireland that the ajority of the people in tbat country who have anysynpathy with her wldl feel that the speech of the right hon gentle man is absolutely disappointing and that really so far as any answer is given or attempted to be given it shovs how disgraceful and scandalous is the conduct of the executive in ireland opposition cheers i can assure the right hon gentleman that no sarcasms anduo joles will dispose of this case hear hear the people who have token it up the presbytery of belfast are people of thesame religious persuadion as the woman whose rights have been violated and arenot the cdass of men to be deterred from doing their duty by any sneers or jokes or ridicule of the right hon gentleman who never recognizes any
