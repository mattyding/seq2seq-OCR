democratic members having determined to give the presi dent their support in the senate there is believed to be a majority for the agreement but its opponents may prevent a vote from being taken

canada and the amother country our ottawa correspondent hears that two large flotations on the london market have been postponed indefinitely on the advice of the underwriterslord stratheona has received a telegram from air fielding in which the dominion minister of finance seeks to remove misgivings aroused in great britain by the policy and tendencies of the agreementeom olt own corespondentwashington fan the democratic members of the house determined last night in caucus to side with the president over reciprocity a favourable vote is now considered assured in the lower chamber where the debate upon the measure will shortly begin the outlook in the senate is as obscure as ever neither threats of an extra session nor fears of popular displeasure have been able to restore to tho republicans a tithe of the party discipline necessary for prompt action that reciprocity would pass the senate could it be brought to a vote there is every reason to believe the trouble is that even a few  filibusters either in com inittee or uipon the floor will be able to delay things until march  has come and goneone faet is certain while the lobbies of the capitol hum with intrigae and speculation and the committee rooms are besieged with protesting representatives of special interests the paper manufacturers had their innings yesterdaypublic opinion is steadily crystal lizing in fvour of the agreementilrxarusmr and contineiamno press comment is available this morning on yesterdays speeches at westminster but it is safe to assume that mr asquiths words will obtain more general endorsement than those of lord lansdowne and mr balfour americans now that they have been weaned from the theory of ultraprotection are becom ing convinced that a continuance of the fiscal wall between their country and canada is illogical and in the long run impossible greatly as they sympathize with the scheme of british imperial preference they feel that its exponents should realize that they cannot hope to succeed unless they are willing to recognize the claims of certain tendencies of modern trade as inevitable as  coninen talism  is held to be for north america it is not believed that any measure of imperial preference could have indefinitely delayed aminerican reciprocity with canada or that reciprocity of the kind now proposed need in the long run greatly prejudice trade relations between the motherland and the dominion it is on the other hand believed that in true commercial and social neighbourliness with canada there will be found to be a very real bond between the british empire and the united statestie  occe or tire jressall this has been brought out in the journalistic comment of the last ten days lhere have been but few jarring notes in the congratulatory chorus wvhich tho presidents arrangement has evoked the motif of the chorus has been praise of a measure calculated to reduce prices and to bring the fiscal systen here into accord with the desires of the country but through it has been seen the expression of genuine friendcship for the dorminion there has been no serious talk about annexation except by certain obviously biassed organs whose opinions carry no national weight the few impartial journals that mention it do so in a friendlyiacadernic way the omaha bee after remark inig that though the measure is not perfect it would like to see it ratified because the pro tective theory of equalizing the cost of pro duction at honrie and abroad is less applicable to canada than to any other country savs  both countries would unquestionably benefit by being under one government but such a contingency is doubtless far offthat the omaha bee should thus express itself when its constituency is largely composed of just those northwestern agriculturists tsome of whose representatives at washington are preparing to oppose reciprocity is character istic of the lack of touch that seems to exist between congress and the people nor does the bee stead alone the topekrh capit one of the leading insurgent newspapers in kansas has apparently little patience wvith the insurgenit obstructionissts the taft administration it says  will in establishinc reciprocity have performed an act of fa sighted statesmanship and a c ahievement of policy which will be historic the des moines regiiecr and leaer the chief progressive

says that  every opening for reciprocity and good will on the american continent means something more thlan immediate gaini in dollars and centsthe idaho statesman though ike the wash ington post this morning rather nervous lest the presidents arrangement goes too far towards free trade says that it should never theless be ratified in view of the effect it is expected to have on prices as to the agricul turists the government contention that they will not really be injured should be accepted thie duiul herald finds it hard to take seriously the attacks made on reciprocity in the mnme sota legislature and elsewhere it points out that free trade in wheat wil give anerican exporters control of the canadian surplus just when american farners are selling the eiliawuti newss congratulates the democrats of indiana onl their intention to support the president the deroit free press thinks that the failure of reciprocity would be a seriouas misfortune the cghicao news like most nlewspapers points out that only certain special interests have anything to gain by oxppdsmng it other chicago journals eomie out strongly for lreciprocity as do such organls as tho ba fjalo  f epc h cwc ans rdas already recorded the great newspapers of new york boston and the easttne visr ad luer intraenestseven in places like gloucester the head quarters of the fishermen who are busy telling congress that free fish will ruin them at port land the capital of maine the potato and lumber interests of which are up in arms against reci procity and in the far nsortliwest where the lumber people aro also agitated there is a strong opinion setting in in favour of the presidents proposals gloucester it is pointed out flourished while the elgin treaty of  was in force and canadian fish was free whereas in recent years its population has dwindled the portland daily press commends the way in which the president is carrying out the fiscal views enunciated by mtwr mckinley almost upon his deathbed and praises the maine legislatures recent endorsement f reciprocity the tacoma daily herald ignores the lumnber question twits the insrgents for inconsistency and backs the president while califorian papers such as the sean francisco cell are pleased at the prospects of enlarging the trade in dried fruits and subtropical products subhtrop icalsouni pen comentit is perhaps by southern comnment that the cleverness of the arrangement may be best gauged it had been expected that a strbna popular feeling would have atisen in the south against free lumber this expectation has been falsified because as the galveston daily news and the savannaij free press remark free lumber is at least balanced by the free entry into canada of cotton seed oil the charlestonews thinks that the president has played the trump card of his administration the naew orleais picayune is more lukewarm it holds that the farmers and the lumbermen have been sacrificed to eastern industrialism never theless it advocates the ratification of the arrangement on the ground that it will cheapen food suppliesthere are of course a few journals that oppose reciprocity but their opposition can invariably be traced to local and not to party or tobroad economic considerations the fargo forum for instance dislikes the agreement because it may injure the development of the wheat growing land in north dakota and the neiah bourhood but such comment is for practical purposes lost in the volume of press opinions of the khnd i have recorded there can be no doubt that canadian reciprocity is popular because as the boston advertiser says the president has tried to do what he believes will benefit the whole country most without dis crimination in favour of or against any special industry and because it would mean greater neighbourliness with canada
