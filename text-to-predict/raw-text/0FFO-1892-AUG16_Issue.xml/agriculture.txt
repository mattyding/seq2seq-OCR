agriculturecrop and stock prospectsthe progress made in harvest work in england during the past week has not been at all con siderable and it daily becomes more evident that a great deal will have to be done in septem ber even if the weather should be favourable to field operations during the rest of the present month it is nearly three weeks since some wheat was cut in sussex and for the last few days similar operations have been proceeded with in kent hampshire and hiertfordshire but innone of the latter is it yet general this week however will see farmers more busy in the corn fields and at its closo we may hear of much being done in the midland and eastern counties one early crop has been cut in the neighbour hood of stamford but it was a selfsown field of red wheat resulting from seeding by the strong winds that were prevalent during the harvest of last year it is spoken of as a  grand crop and equal if not superior to most of the corn in the locality rust has appeared to a very great extent causing no little anxiety to growers and some of those who have cut their wheat complain that it does not shock up so well as they had expected it would these regrets come from those who were probably too hopeful of what the thin crops would do a con tinuance of bright weather is much needed not only for the corn but for the root crops which however have grown well during the past week notwithstanding the attacks of the mangold maggot there keep comning to hand reports of the appearance of potato disease from districts as wido apart as cornwall and kent and also from suffolk but though they do not indicate any serious visitation so far it suggests the wisdom of taking precaution against it in localitieswhere it frequently occursnow that eleven months of the cereal year have passed some idea of the wheat and flour as wheat imports into the united kingdom are available during that period we imported no less than uqr b a weekly average of qr as compared with previous years these fiaures are as followsto doubt these large irnports are due somewhat to the remarkable lowness of freights as well as to the good american crops last year they more than account however for the lowness of prices ruling inthe corn marklets another feature worth notice is that in the week ending august  nearly double the quantity of english corn was sold in our markets than in the corresponding week of last year it was disposed of too as shown by the imperial averages at within d of s per qr less money if the comparison is carried a little further it will be noticed from the official figures that this years price is gs d below the rates in  is d under those of  and s d less than those of  the british farmer is not alone in suffering from a fall in price as a somewhat unusual circumstance well illustrates some farmers about  miles west of winnipeg found it impossible to get their wheat on the canadian pacific railway owing to snow blocking the roads earlier than usual and it had to be held over until this year the wheat which was red ladoga was sold in london and liverpool markets last week at s per b but had it arrived in september or october last year as was intended bv the growers it would have realized s the corn markets have not shown much if any change durinog the week and neither has there been pro gress for the better amongst stocksheep

table which is much to be de plored it shows that there has been one outbreak in mid lothian at leith where tbree animals were attacked and subsequently slaughtered the circum stances which led to this outbreak have not yet been ascertained in the week ending august  the last published  animals affected with pleuropneumonia were slaughtered as were also  others which had been in contact with affected cattle or otherwise exposed to infection these were in lancashire and one was kcilled in mid lothian on suspicion but found to be free from disease there were attacked with swine fever during the week  animals of which  were killed and  died   still remain under treatment amongst horses  have been attacked with glanders  being killed and  all killed with farcy  of the former and  of the latter being in london five animals have been reported as suffering from anthrax and there has been one case of rabiesa second application of the bouillic bordelaise has been nmade to the experimental plots of potatoes at messrs carter andcos farm at bromley there wasat the time no diseaso apparent but iti very doubt ful whether it was the result of the first dressing  mnore probably it was due to favourable weather the plants dressed with the bouillie had not made quite so much growth or foliage as those which had not been treated a circumstance which accords with the experience of m girard and others ii the plot should remain free from disease either from one cause or another some useful information will be obtained as to the effect of the bouillic on the yield though notbing may be learned as to its eflicacy to chock or prevent the diseaseat messrs carter and cos experimental farm several important experiments have been made for the improvement of barley more particularly in the matter of strength of straw and robustness of plant so that it can better resist exceptional clinistic influence in the form of wind rain or hailstorms it is con fidently anticipated that some valuable progress will result from messrs carters labours in thir direction a cross between the goldthorpe and golden mlelon has produced an earlier variety than the present gold tborpe with an

fleetstreetat the recent liverpool show a novelty was ex hibited of which more is likely to be heard this was an electric incubator invented by mr a m keays of sutton surrey the special feature of which is that the heat of eggdrawer is automatically regu lated to the th part of a degree fahrenheit it is really a tank incubator heated by radiation from the bottom of water tank the latter being constructed on the multitubular system as soon as the eggdrawer reaches a temperature of degfahrenheit an electric thermostat comes into action connecting up adty battery with an electromagnet which actuates a damper allowing the heat from the lamp to escape through the open air instead of passing through the flues of the watertank the whole incubator is wellmade and entirely automatic in its action and it is claimed that it effects a saving of  per cent in the oil used several trials bave been very successful
