manusc pttwo years aso lieutenant bower then in pursuit of the murderer of mr dalgleish the scotch trader in central asia discovered in ctinese turkestan the remains of a subterranean city in one of the excavations near which he found a curious birchbark mnnuscript which he took with him back to india for tbe investigation of scholars lhe manuscript is described as having been dug out of the foot of one of the curious old erections just outside a subteivanean city near kruclar tbese erections are said to be about ooft to ft high in shape like a huge cottage loaf built solid with sundried bricks with layers of beams now crumbling away dr hoermlewho under took the examination of the manuscript thinks that these erections are buddhist stupas which often contain a chamber enclosing relics and other objects these chambers are generallv near the level of the gronnd and are often excavated by persons in search of hidden treasure there is no reason why a birchbark manuscript thus preserved from the chanes of injur should not last for an almost indefinite periodl especially if the chamber is airtight dr loemrle has now communicated to the asiatic society of bengal the result of his examination of the manu script it is written in sanscrit of a very archaic type not in the sarada character of cashmere as was at first surmised but in the gupta character which is a much earlier form separate portions of it were written by different scribes and at different dates and the latest portion must he thinks be ascribed to a period not later than the second half of the fifth centurysay  adwhile the earlier portion must be referred to a date half a century earlier the bower manuscript as it is now known is therefore the oldest indian manuscript and one of the oldest manuscripts existing in the world it is composed of five distinct sections of which the first and fifth are medical works the second and fourth collections of proverbial sayings and the third the story of a charm against snakebite given by buddha to ananda the opening lines of the manuscript are  salutation to the patbagatas i am going to write an approved compendium of medicine called the navanitaka based on the excellent system of the maharshis as composed by them in olden times whatever is useful to men and women aftlicted with various diseases whatever is also useful to children that will all be declared in this book it will com mend itself to those physicians whose minds delipht in conciseness bat on accomt of the multiplicity of its prescriptions it will also be welcome to those whose minds love many details and the prefae concludes with the warning that the book should not be given to any one who has no son nor to any one who has no brother nor should its precepts bh taught to any one who has no disciple the manuscript consists of  leaves all of which have no been transcribed and the greater part translated by dr hoernle and toth will be published in instalnientsby the asiatic society of bengal hle has traced sonie of the prescriptions to medical works still current in bengal the expense of editing and publishing the manuscript has been undertakeu jointly by he go vernments of india and of bengal and the latter bas relieved dr hoerule of his otber duties during the time uecessary for the completion of the work while the governient of india has undertaken to defray the expense connected wvith the publication including photographic facsimiles of every page of the manu script it should be added that dr buhlber the eminent oriental scholar of vienna has come independently to the samue conclusion as dr hoernle in regard to the great antiquity of the manuscriptthe trade or yemendr tameezuddin the british viceconsul at hodeidah in his last report describes
