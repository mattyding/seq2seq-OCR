the cavalry maneitvresof ia critic who endeavours to portray eccentri cities of military arrangements has the great comfot of feeling that he is spared the in vidious task of pillorving in public any indi viduals in particular in fact he could not do so if he would for the authorities from whom they emanata are so far as responsibility to the world outside them is concerned a purely imper sonal body finding its counterpart in the french on the gerran man practicallyhowever these authorities are a crowd of personalities extending from his royal highness the field marshal the commanderinchief down to some eager pushing captain or subaltern a wearer of the cocked hat with some particular craze or fancy of his own which if it be adopted will he is sure put the army straight and each of these functionaries below the chief exercises more or less a power far greater than atpperttins to his ordinary place in the official hierarchy under cover of those authoritative words  by order when a staff is animated by a spirit of wvhat may be termed von mioltkeism narnely the working together in complete harrnonv and unison to some welldefined and unchanging end  by order can be advan tageously employed for purposes of decentraliza tion and rapidity in the execution of businessbut when as in the british army the existence of this spirit is to say the least not patent to those ontside the staff or to those under the authorities  by order too often means a shifting of responsibility off the right shoulders and the sheltering of incapacity  and it is used to cover many contradictory directions orders ant instcuctions when from the authorities some regulation is issued  by order no one can guess with whom it originated who is its real author whose wishes it convoys or finally and worst of all how long it will hold good remain nnrepealed or not be contradicted by another  by order for example the highest authority in the army has recently openly denounced on parado certain provisions contained in the infantry drillbook issued  by ordertheso provisions alronot therefore his children lie has godfathered them only  against whom does an affiliation order hold ood  when the cavalry commencedl their work as a division at aldershot three wveeks ago they carried out the instructions regarding blank files as laid down byorder only a few days later a byorder forbade compliance with the instructions which of the hierarchy was the author of the first  by order  wvhich of them checkmated him with the second  outside the horse guards secrets like these are never revealed and perhaps this is as it should be  the syndicate of authors responsible for the socalled british cavalry fanceuvres in  are therefore not identifi iable and the critic criticizes measures not menas a matter of fact there have been no cavalry tranceuvres in englandi this year for to dignify by this appellation the last three weeks opera tions of seven cavalry regiments two ilorse artillery batteries and  fmounted sappers in the neighbourhood of aldershot would be like calling electroplate silver the cavalry muddle mot the cavalry manceuvres would be a moro accnrate denomination of the performance to enable vouir readers more easily to understand tho situation it is necessary to recall some salient points in connexion with the cavalry lanmeuvras of  and it will he remembered that the berkshire downs were in  the scene of a grand and brilliant cavalry revival the only faults if such they coulld be called in connexion with it beingz a too extensive programmea too high ideal but in them the cavalry and some of their loud voiced supporters in the press discovered a grievance the direction and conduct of thenankeuvres were in the wrong handsin those of in  infantry general it was a terrible insult to the arm and the then inspectorgeneral of kcavalry somewhat lent his countenance to this vies of the case by conspicuously taking a back seat in the throng of high staff officers who were in attendance on the commanderinchief at the march past theoretically the cavalry may grave been right practically they were wroig they made as the result this year has shown a inp at the shadow and they dropped the isubstance elated by the fact of cavalry nanceuvres having taken place at all they quite forgot the low esteem in wvhich their arm is hekl by certain influential individuals amongthe nilitary authorities they did not remember the little influence cavalry as an arm has at the meadouarter staff of tho army and therefore they sought and obtained permission for the following year s to do that which is lescribed wcell by the expressive but unclassicalphrase  paddle their own canoe and this irst trip was by no means unsuccessful  in fact jan many wvays it was a decided success in the hands of the newlyappointed inspectorgxeneral oe clvalry majorgeneral keith fraser cmg the inspectorgeneral showed himself to be an iexcellent instructor ard the possessor of decided views on cavalry leading his published narra tives and criticisms on each day s operation were lull frank and candidtoo much so to please some under bis command they were fair and any officer of whose proceedings on the field of rbattle disapproval was expressed had otly him self to thank for it one fact soon became apparent that on more than one point in connexion with cavalry leadling the inspectorgeneral and the nxt senior officer a brigade commander did not hold the same views there was nothing very remarklable in twvo general officers of cavalry being of different opinions on professional matters and of this divergence of views the military authorities became fully cognizant it is only referred to here because it is an item which must be taken into account in considering the value of the work of this year when the manceuvres of  came to an end it was felt that much good work had been done and it was hoped that furtlher progress would be made this year founded on the valuable experience gained these hopes have been disappointed for this year there has been no progress whatever and in military train ing no progress is in this goahead world tanta mount to retrogression and for this the military authorities are responsible either they do not understand the simplest principles of the higher training of cavalry or understanding them do not give the cavalry facilities for appying those principles to practicein the system or rather no system of training adopted for the cavalry the  cloven foot  of the infantry mind is clearly visible and itwould seem such a holdl have the ideas propounded in the provisional infantry drill book taken on the minds of the authorities that they wish to apply them to the cavalry arm also but the working of cavalry in large bodies differs radicallv from the workingof infantry in large lodies unifcrmity is everything vwith the foriner vith the latter it is according to modern idleas little short of deadly sin with the infantry a great amountof latitude is left not only to the higher but also to the lowest leaders in the formations and the tacticalmeasures they may adopt to crush the enemy and gain a victory over him and as has been already abundantly illustrated luring this years work at aldershiot each infantry brigadier sends his brigade to the attack according to his own fancy battalion an cleompany commanders inlulging in tactical vagaries of their own and yet the whole proceedling are strietly in accordance vith the spirit of the provisional drill book laid dowvn for that rm as the infantry fight proceeds so gradually vanishes the possibility of any exercise of control by the higher leaders and this falls to those of lower degree but with the cavalry the case is altogether different here the commander reigns supreme and retains his influence up bt the rlecisuve moment of the combat and even afterwards in the pursuit or the retreat it is he who determines the constitu tion the number the disposition and the employment of the lines the cooperation of the eorse artillery wvith the cavalry he lets his division know beferohand what he wants to be done andl the way in which he wants it done by practicea a mere signal from him suffices to assure him that in perfect conformity to his own views every brigade regimental and battery leader wvill do implicitly as he wishes and the division gradually accustomed to the methods pceferred b its chief becomes a militarvmachine ready at any moment to put forth its full power to cavalry manceuvres moreover many regiments come for one season only and are not brought again for some time into brigade it is therefore essential that in a succession of seasons the training should bo uniform  and therefore should if possible remain for some two or three years at all events ii the same hands when last year majorgeneral keith fraser as inspectorgeneral of cavalry was placed in charge of the manceuvres it seemed as if the authorities intended to make his respon sibilities a permanent reality and to give the cavalry at home a chance of uniform systematic training but this is not the case for this year the control and conduct of the manceuvres was handed ovcr tothemajorgeneral cornmandingthe cavalry brigade at aldershot in three succes sive years this big cavalry school has been under three different headmasters generals sir e wood keithfraser and sir baker russell what a number of scholarships and exhibi tions the boys would gain from any ordinary school conducted on such educational prin ciples the difference in ideas between two of the generals named is notorious and has alreadv been alluded to  it is doubtful whether there is much agreement among the three on anvthing with each there has been a different syllabus of instruction a different programme of work past experience has been thrown to the winds and the higher cavalry instruction after three years experiment on it is simply chaotic and as the authorities treated the inspector general of cavalry as a nonentity in  so they have treated his successor in  except that the latter was generously allowed an adc to break the otherwise melancholy solitude of his rides about the scenes of battle our cavalry cannot hope to be properlv trained until the authorities can be induced to regard cavalry manceuvres as a form of training of a most diffi cult character and one demanding for the arrangement and carrying out the supervision of an experienced cavalry soldier versed by know ledge and experience in the art of teaching cavalry to work in masses let them select whom they like but some continued tenure of office is indispensable to insure good results being obtainedbut at all events when the authorities decided to give his conqe to the commander of last year they might have tried to render the task of the incoming commander easy by passing on to him nny available staff officer who helped to carrv through the manceuvres of  although the military authorities seem to hold a different opinion it may be safely asserted that the draw ing up satisfactory sclhemes collating umpires reports and aiding a chief in putting together full instructive and wellwritten narratives and criticisms requires practice there was at aldershot one officer the daageneral of the cavalry division in  who then gained experience of this sort of work but instead of utilizing his services on the divisional staff a complete brandnew staff was appointed by order and the officer in question knowing every inch of the ground and having viewed all last years operations from bcoth sides acted as brigademajor to one of the brigades and gave it a great advantage over the other the divisional staff this year consisted of colonel dickson th dg aag and captain broadwood th lancers daag these officersdidtheir best under the novel circumstances in which they were placed but they would freely admit that if employed in the same capacities next year they would do even better owing to the experience acquired all that is insisted on here is the superlative folly of changing an instruc tional staff en masse each yearand now we pass on to the constitution of the cavalry division under the command of sir baker russell the division consisted of the st brigade under colonel truman late th dg with captain burnmurdoch brigademajor  and the d brigade under colonel e wood for merly th hussars and at present commanding the regimental district at eounslow major the earl of airlie th hussars and adjutant of the hampshire yeomanry acted as brigademajor tho regiments in the st briade were the th and th dragoon guards and the th hussars with i horse artillery battery under major hay lt is the brigade which has been a year at aldershot as such and took part in the manceuvres last year last year major hay worked with another brigade against it at the manceuvres during the recent operations the brigade has in the opinion of competent critics worked as excellently as a brigade of british cavalry should work and was a striking instance of how easily british cavalry can learn their work if instead of being scattered in regiments and squadirons over ireland and the manufacturing districts they are given fair play and are allowed at some central statibn to prepare themselves in peace for war colonel truman had a readymade machine put into his hand with its regular brigademajor and a battery commander who knew the ground from the enemys point of view as well as his ownin striking contrast was the constitution of the d brigade in forming it the military authorities vere no doubt hampered by financial considera tions and were compeiled to take the regiments nearest at hand whose march to and from aldershot would cost the least money when a scratch brigade is formed a solid nucleus for grafting on the weaker units is indispensable although on mobilization the cavalry of the household brigade would appear only as a combined regiment in peace the authorities very wvisely set aside recollections of mobiliza tions and utitize the individual regiments last year the d life guards and the blues were called up and this year the st life guards under col tle hon c byng formed the nucleus of the d brialade the field state of the st life guards shows  officers and  trop horses their value as a nucleus was well illustrated by a remark of one of their non commissioned officers to an outsider desirous of acquiring information  there isnt anything new to us in all this  our officers may be learn ing something butwe aint we are always doing it the other regiments were the lth lancers s officers and  troop horses from elouns low and the oth dragoons inniskillings from brighton  officers and  troop horses after  years good service in south africa hardly yet formed as a regimentthe d brigade thus constituted numbered only some c sabres against  of the st brigade so at the last momedt the th hussars  officers and  troop horses ivere hurriedly called up from norwich but the regiment was not available for the first four days of the maneouvres miajor hnnts g horse artillery battery was attached to the brigadetaking into consideration the compactness and experience of the st brigade and the scratch characterof thedcomparisons as to their working would be out of place and unfair to the latter the division was constituted on wvednesday july  and on the thursday and friday the st erigadeand its new commander made each oteers acquaintance in the long valley whilst tho regiments of the d brigade incomplete by the th hussars had the additional task of making each others acquiaintance also  but on saturday history repeatcd itself from last year and then came the old old story  his royal highness woud witness a manoeuvre by the cavalry division on the fox hills itwould be really interesting to knrowv who the culprits were wvho used  by order to pervert the concentra tion of cavalry for purposes of instruction into providing a pretty sight on the fox hills except so far as furnishing a skeleton enemy the st brigade was left intact but from the d brigade this scratch incomplete brigade the ist life guards its nucleus was wvithdrawn and to the commander of the brigade vere left some  sabres of the inniskillings and th lancers to work as a brigade a brigade of  men is surely a perversion of terms but a show was wanted and from pirbright were summned two squadrons of the d life guards and two of the blues going through a musketry course and combined with the st life guards they con stituted a d brigade under the command of colonel byng to this division was opposed under the command of capt burnmiurdoch a skeleton enemy improvised from two squadrons of the aldershot brigade it is popularly suip posed that much practice is necessary to work a skeleton cavalry force  the authorities do not think so anyhow credit is due to captain burnmurdoch for the stay in which his raw and inexderienced force was handled in accordancewith the provisions of the special idea the three brigades of the cavalry division under sir baxer russell had for some inscrutable reason taken up a position in the triangle between the main line of the southwestern railway and the aldershot branch how they got there or why they went there nobody knows the only issues south towards the enemy were hy a level crossing and under a bridge the division was ordered to advance south and drive the enemy from the fox hills at the moment fixed for the commence ment of operations the reconnoitring parties followed by the rmain bodies issued with com mendable celerity from the triangle and the former were already in contact with their opponents on the plateau and the main bodies were advancing up the slopes when umpires were seen suddenly flying in all directions send ing the troops back to their starting points because the comrannderinchief had not yet arrived this manceuvre was effected after a certain amount of shouting swearing and con fusion when the battle began again the re connoiting was necessarily a pretence only the charges resulting in driving back the skeleton foe south presented no special interest and at the southern end of the hills the pursuing division fell into a carefullyprepared aldershot trap and found themselves suddenly under a terrific fire from lord methuens brigade of foot guards sheltered by woods and intrenchments it is almost unnecessary to say that the commander of the division not having had time to shake off habits contracted in lower ranks was in the very front and led squadrons to the charge of the impregnable position just as in ashantee zululand and elsewhere he used to show the way to the men under his command the division now retired followed by the hostile cavalry and the poot guards and during the retreat the household cavalry turning about made a counterattack by successive squadrons on their foot comrades it was a grand sightthese waves of heavy splendidlymounted horsemen surging up against the infantry line and only a firm belief in the eflicacy of the modernrifle and in the strength of the infantry nerve would pronounce against the cavalry having got home n o critique of the operations has been issued this is unfortunate as the impres sion of some who heard the remarks of the com manderinchief was that obedience to specific orders and direction was to be regarded an open question in the cavalry as it is the fashion now to regard it in the infantry the impression was possibly incorrect as such teaching would be thoughly unsound on mfonday the th colonel wood received a reinforcement of two squadrons of the th hussars and the next day for the fist time his whole brigade of four regiments worked together deprived alas of his horse artillery battery required elsewhere the very next day wednesday the brigade moved to a new encampment  miles south at longmoor down ten miles from frenshamcommon their enemy the aldershot brigade were too polite to harass them on their march and on thursday also the commander was left unmolested so he had the opportunity of handling his brigade a second time and then after only two days of evolutionary work the newlyfledged brigade was called on to essay its first flight into the regions of tactical exercises this is  by orer  reducing the cavalry training to a farce
