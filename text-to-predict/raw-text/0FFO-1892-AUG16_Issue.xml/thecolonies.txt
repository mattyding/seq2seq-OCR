tiie coloniesthe stirring events of the past fortnight have not been without a special interest for those who watch tho course of home politics largely from what may be called the imperialcolonial stand point not so very many years agoindood politically speaking within the memory of  even the youngest of us the colonies were treated with but scanty respect by the majority of english statesmen and thero were not want ig influential voices that proclaimed the colonies a mere source of expense to the mother country and urged that the moment they were able to walk alone they should be left to their own devices now all this is changed and tho measure of that change may be found in tho fact that whatever other results may follow a change of mlinistry iu no quarter has any fear been expressed that mir gladstones accession to powver will be the signal for a break in the con tinuitv of our colonial policya policy which it may almost bo said is the growth of the last decade but which has taken firm hold of the mind and imagination of the electorate of this country few things indeed when one comes to think of it aro more remarkable than the rapidity with which the idea of the importance of main taining and strengthening the bonds of union between great britain and her great selfgovern in colonies has taken root and grown within the last fewv years here and there a belated radical may still cherish in secret the idea of a  com pact kingdom  and may profess to regard our colonies as a source of potential weakness rather than of strength in the event of our ever being enaged in a war with a firstclass european power but the desirability of maintaining the most cordial relations with the colonies has becomo such an axiom in downingstreet that there is some fear that from one extreme we may pass to tho other indifference has so rapidly given place to a genuine pride in the greatness prcsent and prospectiveof our colonial off spring that the statesmen of these young com munities may perhaps be pardoned if they are at times inclined to take too generous advantace of this newborn feeling of affection for our kibeyond the seas instances are not wanting and will occur to any one who is acquainted with the course of negotiations for the past few years between the colonial office and the gelfgovern ing colonies in which responsible colonial statesmen havo made use of arguments not directed to the merits of the matter under discussion but to the probablo effect of a refusal to entertain their claims on the relations between the colony and the mother country we do not for a moment wish to contend that colonial statesmen are not justified in using any fair means in their dower to obtain whatever they may desire but thero is little or nothing to be gained by disguising the fact that the too frequent use of the bogey of separation or of an agitation against great britain has recently led to much greater insistance on the part of the advocates nu this country of a federated empire upon the fact that the selfgoverning colonies derive at least as much material advantage from their connexion with the mother country as does great britain from her possession of so many lusty colonies a striking example of the truth of this is found at the present moment in the reductions which the australian colonies are able to make in their expenditure for military expenses as part of the general scheme of retrenchment which is being carried out to meet the financial crisis through which the colonies are passing in mlarch last the legislative assembly at sydney reduced the vote for military purposes by £ and it is a noteworthy fact that in the naval estimates for the present year there is a considerable increaso in the sum required for the additional naval service in australasian waters to be provided by the imperial government£ as agaius £asoo estimated it will scarcely be denied that were it not for tho existence of the imperial fleet tho expenditure for military purposes by the australian colonies would so far from suffering reduction havo to be enormously increased adversity has its uses as well for communities as for individuals and it may well be that the australian colonies will come out of their present struggle with trner ideas of the interdependence of the various parts of the empire than were entertained in the heyday of prosperity when under the beneficial influence of enormous loans on the london market trade advanced by leaps and bounds and publi works found employment for all who cared to have it meanwhile it is satisfactory to note that in all the australasian colonies the problem of making both ends meet is being seriously faced as is evidenced by the news telegraphed to us from victoria that the public service commissioners have suggested a radical scheme of retrenchment under which a large numbor of superfluous offices would be abolisheaan impoitant debate in the legislative assembly at melbourne was initiated last week by mr e j dixon who brought forward a resolution in favour of the appointment of aaent general being for the future left in the hands of parliament the motion was rejected after a protracted discussion in which reference was made to the position created by the unfortunate circumstance of the connexion of mir munro agentgeneral for victoria in london with the imelbourne real estate banknow in liquidation it would not of course be desirable to say any thing here on the personal aspect of the ques tion msir munro has in an interview published in the times a few days ago explained his position and has announced his intention of awaiting the views of his government before deciding on his course of action but the debate serves to call attention to the peculiar position which the agentsgeneral of the colonies have now come to occupyinrelationto tho homegovernment originally appointedtoact as commercial agents for their respective colonies they have partly in consequence of the change in public opinion in this country to which allusion has already been made partly because important questions of forein policy which vitally affected one or other othe colonies have of late years occupied the attention of the imperial government and partly because the post has generally been filled by men of ability arrived at a position in wvhich they have practically all the attributes of the ambassador of a foreign powerexcept his re sponsibilitios the hfstory of the rise of the agentsgeneral from the position of commercial agents to that of ambassadors of the great self govcrning colonies will form an interesting chapter in our colonial history when it comes to be written and will serve as another illustration of the marvellous way in which our constitution adapts itself to the evervarying demands of the time no less interesting will it be to watch the further development of the agentsgeneral who are probably destined to piay an important part in the working out of any scheme for a federated empire should such a scheme ever be adopteda further step in the direction of such a schemehas been taken by the imperial federationleague it will be remembered that in june of last year a deputation from the league waited on lord salis bury at the foreign office to invite the prime minister to summons another colonial conference for the purpose of discussing the relations between the colonies and the motecr country and of arriving at some decision as to how far and in what manner common action was possible in principle lord salisbury agreed with the object of tho deputation  i quite thinlk he said  that no grave decision in reference to the relations between the colonies and this country ought to be taken or could bo taken withouit personal communication with the statesmen who guide the colonies in those matters but i would venture to  avdown also as a maxim thatwe should not call themn from their momentous vocations to put thom to all the dihiculty and all the labonr and all the cost of cominto this end of the world unless we are preparecg to lay before them for discussion some definite scheme of our own i do not say sucli a scheme that we must adopt it wvith a resolttion not to recede from itit is not to ho an unalterable determination but i think it wonld be a frivolity almost amounting to aninsltrt to ask those tatesmen to come together lioro witlhout any definite idea of what ought to a dono umerely in the hope that some scheme would generat itxslf from coltact of so maydistinguished minds acting on the hint con veyedby the prime minister theleague appointed a special committee to submit to the council de finite proposals by which the object of imperial federation may be realized the committee con sisted of lord brassey chairman sir john colomb sir daniel cooper mr h  arnold forster mp lord lamington sir lyon playfair bp mr j rankin mp sir rawson rawson lord reay and sir charles tupper high commissioner for canada after many meetings and after gathering the opinions of many gentlemen specially qualified to assist them the committee have we under stand unanimously agreed upon a report which will be presented to the council in novemnber the recommendations of the committee are we believe mainly directed to the question of a joint scheme of imperial defencethe establishment of the kriegsverein of which lord salisbury spoke in his reply to the deputation should the report of the committee be adopted by the council it is extremely probable that the new prime minister will be approached with a request to summons a conference of colonial statesmen in london for the full discussion of the proposals framed by tho leagueit is satisfactory to know that the charges brought against mr eddy the chief com missioner of railways in new south wales by mr schey have been declared by the commission appointed to investigate them to be absolutely without foundation in fact it is not so satis factory to know that the commission have also found that mir schey made these false charges recklessly naturally the report of the com mission has excited considerable feeling in the colony and mr scheys reckless charges may do good in securing for some time to come at any rate the nonpolitical management of the state railways mr eddy went out from england as an expert to manage the railways of the colony on business principles were he to write a full and true account of the condition in which he found the management of the new south wales railways after their administration as part of the political machine of the difficulties he en countered in his gigantic task of reducing the staff to reasonable dimensions and of introduc ing order and economy in the management he would supply perhaps the most useful lesson which could be furnished to the advocates of state socialism of the consequences of their system all the more instructive because it would not be necessary for his purpose to bring charges of personal misconduct against any individual the system alone was sufficient to produce the results actually produced the responsible mfinister was bombarded with applications for posts on the railway from every part of the country each applicant was convincedas each applicant in such cases always is convinced that whoever else was refused his application must be granted and the inevitable result followed until at length the scandal became so great that a complete reform was forced on the government and mr eddy was appointed to inaugurate the system of nonpolitical manage ment it is easy to see that mr eddys task was no light one and that if he did his duty he must inevitably incur the hostility of many of those whose interests were bound up with the former system fortunately he has been able to withstand the attacks made upon him and the healthy public opinion of the colony has now apparently so stronaly expressed itself in favour of the new system that there is every prospect of the management of the state railways being placed on a permanently satisfactory footingin tasmania there is a alinisterial crisis in full swing consequent on the defeat of the government budget proposals tasmania is no exception to the rest of australasia in the matter of financial difficulties mr bird the colonial treasurer of the jministry which has just resigned stated frankly that there was no prospect of the colony being able to borrow in the london marketduring tho present year but the government pro posals for a reduction of expenditure were not considered sufficiently drastic by the opposition and on thursday last the house of assemby by a majority of four adopted a resolution proposed by wmr dobson the opposition leader asserting tho necessity for a drastic scheme of retrench ment mr dobson will it is understood himself hold the office of colonial treasurer in addition to that of premier in the new government and among his probablo colleagues mr adye douglas a former promier is well known in london where he has acted as agentgeneral for tasmaniato properly appreciate the significance of the vote of tho queensland le islative assembly in favour of subdiviling the colony into two rather than into three provinces it is necessary to bear in mind the climatological and geographical conditions of the colony to which allusion was made at some lenth in these columns a fortnight ago tho agitation for separation has always come from the sugarplanters of northern queens landwhile the thicklypopulated districts around the capital have furnished tho strongest opponents of the proposal a glance at any recent map of the colony will show that midway between brisbane in the south and townsville in the north lies rockhampton the coast terminus of the central queensland railway obviously if the colony is to be divided into two independent colonies rockhampton will have to choose with which of the two she will throw in her lot the proposal of the government bill that instead of complete separation there should be establishemd three provinces each autonomous as regards local affairs but with a central government having the control of matters affecting the entire colony was peculiarly acceptable in the rockhampton district which it was proposed to erect into the central province naturally therefore sir samuel griffiths announcement that if the majority of the legislative assembly favoured the division of the colony into two provinces rather than into three the government would give effect to the wishes of the majority was extremely distasteful to the representatives of the central district no particulars of the division are yet to hand but it is more than probable that the majority of  was composed of representatives of the northern and southern por tions of the colony while the minority of  represented the central constituencies it is easy to see why if the solution of provincial legislatures is accepted both the north and the south should object to see an additional province carved out of the centre of the colony at what they may regard as their expense nothing has probably been decided as to which half of the colony should include rockhampton and its line of railway stretching into the interior probably each hopes to secure this desirable section for itself but it is equally easy to see why the representatives of rockhampton should not wish to be absorbed either in the southern province with the seat of the provincial legislature at brisbane many hundreds of miles to the south and with no communication except by sea or in the essentially tropical province of northern queensland with which it would have no local interests in common sir samuel griffith has taken time to consider the intentions of thegovernment as to the future of the bill in view of the vote of the legislative assembly and it is sincereljv to be hoped from the point of view of imperial interests that nothing will be done to imperil a solution which leaves queens land with a central government the agita tion for separation were it eventually to be successful would certainly render more difficult the task of forming a federal government for australasia sir henry parkess recent speech in which he spoke of the kanaka labour traffic as involving semislavery and of the necessity of the relations of australia with the islands of the western pacific being regulated by a federal government would probablybe sufficient to pre vent an independent northern queensland from joining a federal scheme since rightly or wrongly the planters of that part of the colony are convinced that their continued prosperity depends on the supply of labour from the pacific islands  and they would not be likely to voluntarily submit to the imposition of further restrictions those recently imposed by the queensland legislature being in their opinion more than sufficient to protect the interests of the nativesit is sincerely to be hoped that the difficulty which has arisen in new zealand between the governorlord glasgowand the ministry may meet with a speedy solution lord glasgows refusal to nominate  additional members of the logslative council has been referred homeothis colonal secretary on tho constitutionalquestion as to the prerogative of the governor in such a case with the scanty materials at present available any expression of opinion could only be mischievous and for the present we must be content to await the result of the reference of the whole question to the home authoritiesthe importance attached to the announcement we were able to mako a fortnight ago that all the obstacles to the building of the first section of the beira railway had been removed can be esti mated by tho revived interest shown in the british south africa company of whose pro spects of developing the territories included in their charter most encouraging accounts have recently been telegraphed from south africa the sale of a number of town lots at salisbury and victoria for prices much higher than was antioi pated by the officials of the company was an encouraging piece of news and this was supple mented by reports of further discoveries of gold but the most important factor in the situation is undoubtedly the near prospect of railway com munication with mfashonaland through the por tuguese provinces of manica and sofala the entire length of the beira railway will be  miles and of this a section  miles in length through the tsetse fly country is expected to be ready for traffic by the th of november of this year the british south africa company will always retain a preponderating interest in the railway company and will offer to its share holders the opportunity of subscribing for the greater portion of the debenture issue which is to provide the necessary capital for constructing the line it is intended that the line shall at first be only a ft gauge at present the trans port of goods from tho cape to fort salisbury is estimated to cost an average of £ a ton and takes three monthls on the road when the rail way is opened it is anticipated that the cost will be reduced to a third of its present figure and the saving in time will of course be incalculablethe claims of the more outlying portions of the empire are sometimes apt to be overlooked here in england among the many and urgent demands on the attention of the colonial office hut on the same principle that induces a mother to cherish the interests of those members of her family who can least look after themselves we ought perhaps topay special heedtotheappealsof thelesser and weaker of our colonial offspring reference has recently been made to the desiro of british honduras to be brought into closer contact with the rest of the empire and thero can be little doubt that in the small community of our fellow subjects which represents great britain in cen tral america there is a strong almost a fierce conviction that tho future of the colony depends very largely upon advantage being taken of the present opportunity for bringing the colony into telegraphic communication with the rest of the world it is no doubt true that a subsidy would be required before the halifax and bermuda cable company would undertake to lay a cable for the  miles that separate british honduras from jamaica but the colony would willingly bear a modest share of the necessary expenditure and it may fairly ask the home government to consider whether the reasons which make it desirable that there should be cable connexion between the various points of the north american and west indian naval command and its head quarters at halifax do not apply to the case of british honduras which is within the area of that command no doubt it is purely a question of cost but in the colony at least it seems to be thought that they are entitled to special con sideration from the home government by reason of the recent withdrawal of troops and there is the further consideration that the colony labours under immense disadvantages as regards steam communication with the west indies british honduras is not much short of twice the size of jamaica and it is one of the most sparsely populated of all our colonies it is much in need of additional labourers whom it could obtain from jamaica or other west indian islands were theore direct communication intead of as now tho only route being by the extremely circuitous journey to new orleans as it is most of the trade is with the mother country and the con tention of the colonists is that tho laying of the cable would herald a development of the resources of the colony which would before long result in the establishment of direct steam com munication betwveen beliz and the west indies thero are over a million and a half acres of crown land still unappropriated ard the deadly isolation which has hitherto beei the lotof our only central american possession is not un reasonably blamed for the comparative slowness of its development by throwing out an electric feeler from the new cable honduras would be brought into the main current of the life of the empire as a matter of fact the admiralty did as far back as  have soundings made by one of her majestys ships between cuba and belize with a view to laying a cable it is of course most desirable that if there is to be telegraphic communication with belize the other end of the cable should be on british territory
