lord salisbijrys defeatberlin aug the development of the ministerial crisis in england is being watched with keen inte rest here and the report that lord rosebery has nottaken any part in the recent meetings of the liberal leader has concentrated still more attention upon the subject of the future foreign policy of england the national zeitung says  it is quite certain that lord roseberys refusal to undertake the leadershin of the foreign office can only have been occasioned by the de termination of mr gladstone to yield to his radical lords and masters to give up the former relations of england to the triploealianfcei and to court the favour of france by every kind of concession in egypt and elsewhere there is no mistaking in this the hand of miorley labou chere and company the english however know only too well that at last they will have to pay a dear price for this new experiment it may be in central asia or in africa and for this reason the absence of lord rosebery is almost suicidal for the new ministry it is not too much to say that tho services rendered by the late government in maintaining peace and in raising the prestige of england services gratefully acknowledged by the british people did not exer cise more influience on the result of the elections solely because it was taken for granted that lord rosebery would follow in lord salisburys stepsthe hamburger nachrichten publishes a lead ing article on the same subject in which both the lrish question and the foreign policy of the liberal ministry are discussed in the course of its remarks on the former point the article says that though from a legislative point of view the accomplishment of the plan is not impos sible yet the very character of the irish them selves which is passionate inconsistent and violent does not seem to be ripe for the reception of autonomyturning to the question of foreign policy the iamburger nacllrichten goes on to say difficulties are sure to arise relative to the forein policy of england which was always gladstones weakest and salisburys strongest point one has only to think of the evacuation of egypt of the relations wvith russia in the east and of the attitude towards the triple alliance to convince oneself thoroughly on this matter no one will deny that lord salisbury was much more acceptable to gerniany than his succossor can ever hope to be amongst other reasons because we always knew exactly how much or how little we had to expect from him our correspondentparis aug some of the papers are still speculating on the foreign policy of the gladstone ivlinistry the paris anticipates that though lord rosebery is no more inclined than iord salisbury to evacuate egypt his relations with france will be more cordial there will be no more flirtation with germany or virtual compacts with italy the newv cabinet is bound to diverge to a certain extent from its predecessors policy and though it cannot be expected to turn its back on the triple allianco it will endeavour to keep at an equal distance from france and germany it will not give italy any encouragement but will be really a neutral power the radical justice is waiting with curiosity to see who will take the foreign office for though mr gladstone is sincerely anxious to draw nearer to france a statesman is often foiled by his subordinates and lord rosebery is openly favoured by the conservatives the lpax exults over the change of ministry as a rebuff for the triple alliance and extols mr gladstone as friendly to nations based upon liberty the paix apparently thinks that russia possesses liberty and that italy does notour oum correspondentchicago auc the annual outing of the irish societies in this city to ogdengrove took place today and was attended by an
