the change of ministryin accordance with the arrangement made on saturday mr gladstone went to ostomrns yesterday for the purpose of kissing hands on his appointment as first lord of the treasury although before his audience of her majesty the right hon gentleman was not in a position to formally allocate the offices in the now ad ministration a sufficient interval was allowed him after the receipt of the royal intimation to conferwithhis leading political friends andto draw up a listof the noblemen and gentlemen uponwhose cooperation lie relied the finishing touches were put to this list on sunday afternoon when ifr gladstone had a long consultation with sir william harcourt mr john morley lord spencer lord kimberley mrhrnold morley and mfr zvarjoribanls and before leaving london yesterday for the isle of wight the right hon gentleman was in possession of information which left no doubt as to lord bosoberys willing ness to return to the foreign office in indicating yesterday that mr fowler was likely to become president of the local government board we stated that mr gladstones choice for the rome secretaryshiptlie post which many people supposed was destined for the member for east wolverhamptonhad fallen upon quite a different personage aos the nomination has probably by this time been approved by the queen concealment is no longer necessary and it may be assumed that mr asquith will become mr matthewss successor wvhen mr asquith was chosen to lead the attack upon the govern ment in connexion with the  ko confidence  debate it was generally felt that his political advancement was assured  nevertheless his success at the bar led many peoplo to believe that his promotion would take a different form and the appointment may fairly be classed as one of the surprises of the new administra tion another office that has been the subject of much speculation and respecting which the event will probably falsify all predictions is that of first lord of the admiralty in any government personality is an important matter so far as the control of the two great spending departments of the state is concerned  and since it leaked out thatmr campbellbannerman had agreed to return to the war ofllceconjecture has been busy with the possible successor to lord george hamilton the name of sir gdorge trevelyan being mentioned with especial fre quency it seems to have been overlooked how ever that lord spencer has claims upon the consideration of mr gladstone which cannot be ignored and bearing all the circumstances in mind it is extremely probable that his lordships welllnown administrative ability will be utilized for the benefit of the navy inasmuch as lord kimberley has already held higlh office inmder mr gladstone his inclusion in the cabinet would be certain even if lord granvilles mantle as leader of the gladstonian party in the house of loids had not fallen upon him it is inderstocd that he will go either to the india office or the colonial office probably the former as to the number of the new cabinet we have reason to believe that mr gladstone has found it necessary to make it larger than wvas at first intended the hiome rule cabinet of  as originally constituted consisted of  members but when sir george trevelyan resigned the scotch secretaryship the number fell to  lord dalhiousie his successor not being a member of the inner circle of the government lord salis burys cabinet formed in the same year started with  members but the total was subsequently increased to  by the inclusion of mr ritchie and to  when mr chaplin was appointed pre sident of the board of agriculture it is pro bable that the gladstonian cabinet of s will be equally largeit is understood that a full list of the appoint ments submitted by mr gladstone for her majestys approval yesterday will be published without delay  meanwhile the following list may be relied upon as fairly trustworthy as far as the more important offices are concerned first lord of the treasury mr gladstone chancellor of the e xchequer    sir w harcourt lord chancellor   lord herschell chief secretary for ireland mr j morley foreign secretary   lord rosebery hlome secretary  mr asquithsecretary for war  m  r campbellbannermanfirst lord of the admiralty lord spencer secretary for india orcolonial secretary  lord kcimberleymir arnold morley whose pending retirement from tho post of chief gladstonian whip we announced some weeks ago will not become first commissioner of works as has been freely pre dicted  his services will probably be required in an office of greater responsibilityafter mr gladstones return to carltongardens today he will confer with mir j morley sir wv harcourt and others of his leading supporters and the worlk of filling up the gaps in the new administration will then be proceedced with as rapidly as possiblemipr gladstones visit to osbornemr gladstone left carltongardens at  minutes to  yesterday morning for osborne the hour of the right hon gentlemans departure having become known a small number of the public collected in the vicinity about halfpast  and raised a cheer as mr gladstone acompanied by sir algernon west walked across the pavement to the carriage in waiting the right bon gentleman who looked exceedingly well acknowledged the greeting by raising his hat the carriage turned quickly into pallmall and pro ceeded to waterloo station there was a large num ber of ordinary passengers momentarily atriving at waterloo for holiday journeys by the southwestern but there were also many who came to the station to see the departure of mr gladstone who was to leave at  oclock a saloon was attached to the train and was drawn up immediately opposite the firstclass booking office but being on platform  the rails at platform  were crossed by a temporary bridge the whole length of the platform abutting on the hooking offices bad a line of spectators who awaited mir gladstones appearance at exactly ten minutes before  mr gladstone passed from the station entrance to the gangway hats were raised but beyond this there was no demonstration the right hen gentleman was accompanied by sir algernon west after entering the saloon he was joined by mr henry gladstone who however did not accompany the train the ten minutes wait was spent in general conversation hearing that the popular entertainer mrn corney grain was on the platform mr gladstone expressed a wish to be introduced and mr grain was agreeably to the right hon gentlemans desire con ducted to the saloon where mr gladstone gave a cordial greeting and handshake unctually at  oclock the signal for departure was given and as the train steamed off three hearty cheers were raised by the spectators these were mingled with a long and stentorian groan from one individual whose hostile demeanour was the cause of some amusement to the onlookers mr liladstone who had removed his hat rose from his seat and bowed as the parting cheers were given sir algernon west was the only other occupant of the saloonalthough the time of mr gladstones arrival at portsmouth was not generally known a crowd had assembled both inside and outside the harbour station when the train drew up a few minutes after  and as the right hon gentleman made his appearance a hearty cheer was rnised which he acknowledged by raising his hat and bowing a twohorse cabrriaco was inattendance and as soon as mr gladstone his secre tary and staffcaptain goldsmith of the royal yacht alberta by whonm the premier was met at the railway station bad taken their seats they drove between lines of interested sjpectators to the sheer jetty in the dockyard alongside of which the alberta was moored here also notwithstauding the regulations of the yard which prohibit the admission of strangers and demonstrationspolitical or otherwise a crowd tad gathered including several leading local liberals and it was furtively swollen by workmen as soon as the carriagc was seen to approach after repeatedly bowing in response to the cheering mr gladstone took a seat in the chart house on the bridgewhere he remained uncovered a parting cbeer was given him as the alberta moved off lrom the jetty at  niinutes past  and proceeded to trinity pier east cowes which was reached at halfpast  people had come from all parts of the island to be present at his arrival and be was heartily cheered directly he was recognized the right hon gentleman entered one of the queens carriages in waiting and drove to osborne liouse where he vwas received by the officials of the household subsequently mr gladstone had ani audience of her majesty and later on formed one of the royal dinner partymir gladstone will take leave of the queen at half past  this morning and will leave portsnouth for london by the noon train arriving at waterloo shortly before a correspondent telegraphing from cowes last night says the visit of mr gladstone to osborne has ereated quite a flutter of

had closed the queen went for a drive accompanied by the princess of ivales and princess beatree whilst mr glld stone accompanied by sir henry ponsonby and sir algernon west enjoyed a walk in the gardens of osborne house tonight the queen gave a dinner party in the indiad rloom among her majestys guests beiug the prince aud princess of wales prince add princess henry of battenberg earl of ducie and mr gladstonethe press association saysalthough no complete list of the new cabinet from official sources can be published until after mr glad stones return from osborne today some definite and reliable information can now be given withregard at least to several of the higher offices one fact beyond doubt is that mr gladstone as in the case of his last administration will himself become both first lord of the treasury an lord privy seal the duties of the latter office are nominal but it carries with it in court orders a dignity uot belonging to the post with which it is again being associated the british constitution does not formally recognize the office familiarly known as that of prime minister and if mr gladstone were simply first lord of the treasary he wouldon state occasions have to yield precedence to all the secretaries of state wvhereas the lord privy seal if held by a commoner gives in cere monial functions a place second only to the speaker and the president nf the privy council apart from this consideration mr gladstone is reluctant to make a separate appointment in the case of a sinecure office the hon spencer lytteltonand r g h murrayof the treasury will be private secretaries to mr glad stone as first lord of the treasury mr h g l shand of the inland revenue will be private secre tary to the right hon gentleman as lord privy seal sir
