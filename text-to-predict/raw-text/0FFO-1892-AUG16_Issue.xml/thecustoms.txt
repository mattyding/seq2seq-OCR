the culstomsthe th report of the commissioners of her majestys customs to the treasury states that the gross receipts of imperial customs revenue for the financialyear  ended on march  last including charges and the revenue of the isle of man amounted to £ showing an increase of £ in comparison with the gross receipts of the corresponding period of  the commissioners sayof this gross imperial receipt the inland revenue collected the sumof £ so that the amount of customs imperial revenue collected by our officers was £ but in addition to this latter amount our officers collected £ on bebalf of the ex cise revenue inclusive of the amount assigned by the inland revenue board to the local taxation account the sum of £ was also collected by our officers on behalf of the local taxatiou account created under the act  vic c  sec the total gross amount of revenue collected under our supervision came therefore to £ an amount exceeding the gross customs imperial revenue by £in addition to the sum of £ already stated to have been collected by the inland revenue de partment on behalf of the customs imperial revenue that department also collected the sum of £  on behalf of the local taxation account derived from customs duties on foreign spirits the inland re venue officers therefore collected a total sum of £ belonging to the gross customs revenue including the portion assigned to local taxation forruing  per cent of the whole the sum of £ collected by the customs officers on be half of the gross excise revenue from british spirits forms  per cent of the excise revenue derived from that sourceno alteration was made in the tariff duringthe year under review and in comparing the receipts under each head of revenue with those of the preceding year the commissioners find little to call for exceptional attention beyond the fact that  forthe first time in the history of our revenue the gross receipts from tobacco have reached a sum of over  millions or onehalf of the total im perial revenue derived from customs duties the gross revenue derived from coffee again shows a decrease having fallen from £ in  to £ in  but cocoa con tinues to grow in popularitythough it can hardly be classed as a rival to tea and coffee the consumption of cocoa has increased  per cent within the last five yearsforeign spirits show ap gross yield of £ against £ in  a decrease of £ including the amount collected on account of local taxation there is again a slight increasce in rum but the improvement now shown is less than  per cent this result is somewhat disappointing after the decided rise in revenue of the two preceding years brandy shows the considerable increase of £ net imperial revenue for  as compared with  or an increase at the rate of a per cent the heavy decrease in geneva and other sorts of foreign spirits is almost wholly due to the effect of the famine in russia in ordinary years large quantities of plain spirit are distilled by thi farmers in eastern europe from their spare graiiithe residue of the grain after distillationbeing used as fattening food for their cattle in the long winter there has of course been no spare grain in the past autumn and winter with the result that tlie diminished supply of this cheap foreign spirit has caused a considerable increase in its price and has thrown consumption upon the homemade articlewith regard to tea the commissioners saythe revenue from tea in  exceeded that of  by £ the gross amount having been £s against £ but the real ir crease in consumption is not truly marked by the small in creased revenue of £ wve pointed out in our annual report of last year that the revenue derived from tea in  was unduly swollen by about oolb of tea which had been held back from clearance in the early part of  in anticipation of a reduction of duty if we make due allowance for this fact tho true increased use of tea in the past year has been about sb after deducting the quantity which bad been held hack from clearance in the early part of a quantity vwhich was pretty accurately knowvnthe clearances of tea strictly belonging to the inancial year  amounted to b the ohief feature of the year is the fact tbat indian tea ic tea from the peninsula of hindostan has decreased somewhat in popularuse while that from ceylon has enormously increasedwith regard to tobacco it is renmarked thatthe gross revenue from tobacce in the year ended march   amounted to £ being the highest yield on record from this branch of revenue it exceeded the gross ravenue of  by £ and the revenue of the latter year was itself an advance of £ on that of  thus in two years tobacco bas yielded an increased return to the exchequer of £ or  per cent for the two yearsa table is given showing the progress in the past ten years of this great branch of imperial revenue the consumption of tobacco per head of population has risen to b against b in  and against b before sir stafford northcote imposed the extra duty of d per lb in  the trade consider moreover that the receipts would have been larger but for a check to consumption caused by the prevalence of in fluenza in the last months of the financial year as it is however tobacco alone now yields a full half of the customs duties of the united king dom this large increase in the tobacco revenue occurs chiefly in the use of dry western american tobaccowestern leaf stripped and unstripped which is of a very dry and nonabsorbent nature and will not hold much water without showing it in a manner that would interfere with its sale thus the public are using  a drier article which smokes more quickly  they consume more leaf and less water and the revenue and tobacco consumers are benefited but there are also other principal contributory causes amongst which may be enumerated the farly prosperous condition of the wageearning classes and the operation of the watering clause of the act of with regard to wine the commissioners say the chief item of interest with regard to this article has been the heavy fall of £ in the gross receipt derived from the additional duties im posed on sparkling wine a decrease of over  per cent the cause is mainly to be found in the con siderable rise which took place in the price of champagne in the early portion of last year in con sequence of the appearance of phylloxera in the district of the marneas regards smuggling it appears that during the past year there has been an actual decreaso in the number of seizures compared with the number made in the preceding year for the first time since  the commissioners remark that  it may perhaps be inferred that the increased vigilance exercised and the additional precau tions talen in dealing with detected offenders are beginning to discourage attempts to smuggle and thus to produce the effect which they were designed to bring about  but it is not possible to state this as an ascertained fact there being no means of arriving at the number of attempts which escape detectionthe report concludes with remarks on the re sults of recent changes in the manner in which nromotion is made to the rank of examining offlicer or the first and second classes under the con ditions prescribed in the treasury minute of march   resulting from an inquiry by the chancellor of the exchequer assisted by the financial secretary of the treasury into the out door branch of this department
