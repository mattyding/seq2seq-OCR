the inspectorgenerals private secretary the meu numbering altogether about  with  cavalry were drawn up in the square and the band played tre national anthem while his excellency was being conduicted to tho square by sir andrewv reed the evolutions although few were remark ably well executedaiddressing the inspectorgeneral his excellency said it ha given me great pleasure to take advantage of this opportunity for personally inspect ing a body of men of whom the nation may be justly proud i am aware that the majority of those whom i am addressing at this moment are men who have at a comnaratively speaking recent period joined this force but i wish to express to you and through you the roya irish constabulary throughout the country nmy very high appreciation of the admirable manner in which this force has invariably performcd its duties during the ime of my vicerovalty i feel that i would not have completed my duties in this country if i had perrmitted my offcial connexion with ireland to be severed without giving public expression to my very deep and sincere regard for a force which during the whole eveatful period of my viceroyalty has been brought face to face with the most difficult and most trying duties that aty police force has ever been called upon to perform lbelieve i may say that no previous lord lieutenant of irelsnd has travelled so extensively through different parts of ireland as i have done during the time that i have occupied the nosition of her mjestys representative in this country and i am glad to say not merely from knowledge acquired in the administration of irish affairs but from my own personal experience and observation during the many journeys i have taken throesch lifferent districts and more especially throuh the poorer districts that nothing could be more satisfactory than the relations existing between this constabulary force and all classes of society throuhout the country you have not only performed your duties in a satisfactory manner as police but in a time of exceptional distress yon have given practical proof of your deep sympathy with the suffering poor of our fellowcountrymen it will remain to the everlasting credit of the royal irish constabulary that when an appeal wvas mado to the public by imr balfour and myself to raise a fund to meet the distress which had occurred on account of the potato famine the iloyal irish constabulary not only with liberality supported us with so handsome a subscription as Â£ but you gave us substantial and material assistance in the administration of our seheme of relief i will go so far as to say that it was very largely due to your cooperation that we have been enabled to carry out a scheme of national relief with greater success and more efficiency than any relief scheme ever carried out on any previous occasion i feel that i cannot pay a higher compliment to sir andrew reed who has completedl  years service in the royal irish constabulary and for close on seven years has occupied the position of inspectorgencral than to say that this force was never in  more prosperous condition than at present the qualifica tions for this torce are higher than they have been at any previous period since its inception the standard has been raised from ft sin to ft in there are more competitors for entrance to the force and notwithstanding this circumstance we have abundance of recruits and there never was a period of greater pressure to obtain admission to the force i say i believe the force never before attained so high a state of efficiency as it has reached at the present moment in bidding you farewell deeply as i have been touched by the kind and courteots mnanner in which i have invariably been received by all classes of society in all parts of ireland i may say that i believe there is no body of men to whom the govern ment is more indebted than the body i am now addressing you have not only earned the tbanks of the government but you have won for yourselves the respect esteem and admiration of all those who fully realize the fact that law and order are the very first principles connected with a nations prosperity long may you continue to prosper and lonig may you continue to maintain that state of eficiency at which you have arrived i hope andl trust most sincerely that tho day may be very far distant that the time may never arrive when any circumstance may happen which could tend in any way to fundlamentally alter the contitution of that great body of whih you are members or detract from the efficiency of the force of which not only ireland but the united kingdom is proudhis excellency then inspected the dept and after wards returned to the viceregal lodgethis afternoon a
