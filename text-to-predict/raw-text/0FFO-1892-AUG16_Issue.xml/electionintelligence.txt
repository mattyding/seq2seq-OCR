election intelligelycenewcastlethe election campaign began in earnest at newcastle yesterday at midday several meetings in support of mr morley were held outside the elswick and other factories the attendance in each casc howcvcr was somcwhat smmll but clectioncerers on both sides expect to have larger attendances at the day meetings as the week advances those who spoke in advocacy of mr morleys reelection included mr c p trevelyan the son of sir george trevelyan the rev a t guttery of shields the rev walter walsh and kr l jones the liberal caudidate for westminster at the general election the keynote of the speeches was mr orleys pro minence on the home rule question wvhile emphasis was also laid upon the fact that mr mlorley has been longer before the constituiency than mr ipalli his unionist opponent the gladstonian organ in new castle bas thought it necessary to publish an article in refutation of a supposed allegation that mr mlorley has pecuniary ambitions to satisfy in obtain ing obice amongst other incidents that have attained some notoriety is an assertion that the publichouse interest was unfairly exercised in favour of alder man hamond at the general election and in con nexion with this point considerable illfeeling has been aroused satisfaction is expressed by the glad stouians that both wings of the local nationalists have agreed to cooperate with them in support of mr morley this will give the irish vote greater coherence than was the case at the general election mr ralli has addressed several semiprivate and day mecting while disclaiming personalities he asks for election for the special purpose of inflicting a blow upon home rule of which mr morley is felt to be the special champion the first really public meeting of the unionist party will be held tomorrow evening and on thursday night alderman hamondip will preside over a great meeting in the townhall anvassing is being actively pursued by both parties the importance of the contest in relation to home rule is becoming every day more clearly nnderstood in the constituency and it is felt that that will be the one elear issue there are so many elements of doubt however that it can at present only be said that the probable result is veiled in much uncertainty the socialists have not yet come to any decision regarding their action on tne polling daya meeting in support of mr morleys candidature was held in the townhall last night the building was filled in every part and many were unable to gain ad mission tho proceedings were very enthusi astic dr t spence watson president of the new castle liberal association and of the national lberal federation occupied the chair and was supported by mrr herbert gladstone mp mr t d sullivan by mr e blake mpr baxtcreilis cmayor alderman xv d stephens mr bernard aanulty mir p bradley one of the local par nellite leaders mr c p trevelyan the iev j thompson mr j c swan and mr robert cameronthe chairman said if the enthusiasm of that meeting would turn itself into work the election was won there was nothin that malignant enmity would not do to defeat air orley the majority of the local press was against them but they had a candidate who was no mere carpetbagger who as his critic said had taken to plitics as a profession after he had failed in literatur but who was a man known throughout the empire as the champion of liberty and freedom who had ever been powerful even when on the weaker side and to whom his bitterest enemies could not deny the attribates of fairness and honesty cheersnr herbert gladstone mp who ras received with great cheering said it seemed to him that the new castle liberals had not lost heart by any events that had occurred during the last few weeks this election was one of national importance and he differed from the iyesrcastle chronicle in describing it as a local matter in which outsiders had no busi ness to interfere he was a home ruler like many of their friends and he had to aeknowledge that his mind was influenced in that direction by mr joseph cowen who was now their critic they had to turn a minority of  into a majority the new govern ment wals practically formed that day and it had a majority of  the result of the neewcastle election could not materially affect that majority at the present time but did they wish to strengthen or weaken the government  he was not inclined to complain of the opposition to mr morley but if the tories thought they had a majoritv they would meet them and try to defeat them the double object of the liberal party now was to pass as much liberal legislation as was passible at present and in the second place to strengthen the hands of the democracy so that at the next genertl election they could mako a better show than last time they had to take up in parliament the work bess calculated to keep the majorsy of  together asking what was that work which t e liberal govern ment could perform in the next few years he referred to registration reform the abolition of plural voting the freeing candidates from election expenses the placing all elections upon one or two days the giving additional powers to the london county council and the authorizing of payment of members ias to the labour party the liberal governnment was pledged to deal with these very questions which a labour govem ment if one were formed would have first to deal with cheers the question of local option must also be dealt with let the local authorities and the people of cach locality deal with this question cheers care would be taken to avoid harassing legitimate interests or causing any unnecessary inter ference with the property and the legitimate interests of the piiblicaus and individuals who were interested in the drink trade they did not wish to tyrannize over any of these persons they would endeavour to deal fairly by them and depend upon it if they were anxious to do good service to the temperance cause they would consider and consider well the feelings and the interest of all who were concerned in the settlement of this great question however the irish question vas the one central and important question to which they had to give attention cheers mr balfours main objection to hiomc rule was that if it were granted the irish members would still be able to swamp british opinion in the house of commons irish members exercised an inauence of that sort however at the present time a liberal government was beinig put into office by the irish vote but when ireland had a parliament in dublin for the nmanage ment of her own affairs the irish members would come to westminstcr in a different spirit to discuss imperial questions upon their merits he did not believe the lrish memberswould needlessly interfere with english and scotch opinion but he was prepared to face the possibility give them a parliament and they would devote all their attention to the affairs of that parlia ment the liberal party had been returned by the constituencies of the utnited lzingdom to establish a hlome rule parliament in dublin and they were going to do it and nothing would stop them from doing it cheers the democracy was growing stronger and stronger and it was in favour of home rtule he was afraid the democracy in some parts of the country voted against the liberal party at the general elec tion but that was not on the ground of ireland but avovedly because of labour interests but every labour man that he ever heard of was in favour of granting home rule to ireland which was demanded alike by the interests and the honour of the country cheersmr e blare bip spoke at length cxplaining that this was the first towns meeting he had adcressed in england he warned them against men who did not hesitate to make promises they ought torejoice in the possession of men who thought out political questions and expressed their convictions whether they were popular or not he had never believed that the democracy of england would when it achieved power keep its foot on the neck of the irish democracy selfgovernment for ireland meant exteuded self government for england also the notion of homc rule was not disunion but union for the first time in anything that was worthy of the namemir t d sullivan imp also addressed the meeting ani a vote of thanks to the chairman and other speakers was carriedmr ralli the unionist candidate addressed two meetings of his supporters last night aud at each was very cordially receivedl he said the object of his can didature was to inflict a blow on home rule he was asked what home rule was but he could not say as mnr gladstone and mr morley had never divulged the secret if comnmon sense carried the day unionists would soon be in a majority again in the house of commons he believed liberal unionism was grow ing in strength in the north of england the endea our to carry home rule which was being made by the gladstonians meant the postponement of reforms wlhich were urcently needed and which the unionist party were willing to carry a third of the people of ireland protested against and repudiated home rule he aslked for support also on the ground that foreign affairs were better managed by the unionist government than they were likcfy to be by the glad stonians and upon good foreign management depended ninch of the trado of the country not only were the irish proposals objectionable in theiselves but theireltect wvonuld be to so occupy the attention of the house of commons as necessarily to exclude the consideration of many important questions such as the eiht hours day speaking of the latter subject he daid that apart from miners and those engaged in deleterious occnmations he thought an eieht hours bill would handi cap
