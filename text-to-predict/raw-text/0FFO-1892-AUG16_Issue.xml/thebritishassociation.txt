the british assocoatior arbetrospectsir archibald geikie is to be congratulated on having presided over one of the most successful meetings of the british association in recent years his gratification must be all the greater that the important episode in his career has occurred in his native city the edinburgh meeting has been in many ways a marked con trast to that which was held last year in cardiff there all was dulness and depression  in the  gray metropolis of the north  all has been brightness and exhilaration there has ony been one bad day  bright sunshine and a bracing air have prevailed throughout the week the arrangements made by the local committee for the comfort and enjoyment of theirvisitorshavebeen all that could be wished although the inevitable brown paper which comes in with august prevailed among the windows of the westend private hospitality has been exuberant and for the officials at least dissipa tion has been even more trying than work which has certainly been hard enough the lord provost and magistrates have exerted themselves heartily and successfully to render the fourth visit of the association memorable dinners receptions garden parties have succeeded each other inperplexing frequency the private citi zens who have remained in town for the purpose of receiving the association have heartily sup ported the efforts of the municipality and none more all will admit than mr cox of gorgio who has kept open house indrumsheughgardens the treatment of the sectional secretaries was everything that could be desired the magnificent suiteof rooms in the parliament house answered admirably all the purposes of reception rooms of the two conversaziones that of tuesday night was the more successful it inevitably developed into a dance on the polished floor of the fine assembly rooms attached to the musichall  here the social events of the week culminated appro priately in the wild shoutings and shriekings which accompanied the reel danced by per fervid young scotch men and maidens edin burgh isof courseunrivalled as a centre for excur sions and those arranged for the saturday were extremely popular it would be well in future to arrange that if thero is to be any speaking on these excursions it should be done by men who are representatives of the associa tion  in two cases at least the illiteracy and bad taste of the speakers who forced them selves to the front to propose votes of thanks shocked all who were present and brought ridicule on the association in the eyesof those who acted as entertainers and hosts it must be said that the rooms in which the sections met were not of the most convenient or comfortable character the classrooms of the univer sity are no doubt well adapted to the spartan habits of scotch students but to the ordinarybritishassociation audiencethe seats are much too precipitous and narrow to be comfortable and the difficulty of getting out and in and the continual clatter of feet on the bare boards of the steep gangways were a constant source of annoyance in some sections but this was unavoidable it was appropriate that the meetings should be held in the university and indeed it would havo been difficult to obtain suitable rooms anywhere else socially then it must be admitted the edinburgh meeting has been a marked success and the citizens of auld reekie  must have been gratified by the un bounded admiration expressed by their visitors for the situation and structure of their beautiful and imposing cityit is generally admitted that from the scien tific standpoint the edinburgh meeting has been considerably above the average as might have been expected under the auspices of sir archibald geikie geology and geologists were prominent throughoutthe meeting the presidents own address was picturesque and instructive he touched on some burning problems though only in the way of resuming opinions already broached the old feud between the phy sicists and geologists came once more to the front but bas been left where it was non possurs is the attitude on both sides the rigid physicist refuses to budge though his limit for the age of the earthsomewhere between ten million and  million yearsseems wide enough the geologist tells us that he finds readings on the rocks which cannot possibly be reconciled even with the extreme limit and insists that the mathematical mill has been supplied with inadequate data and therefore cannot possibly turn out acceptable results though sir archibald geikies address did not profess to deal with any original theories as to the age of the earth and as to the method of lkature still it is recognized that it was most appropriate to a british association audience much more appropriate than if it dealt with some problem of extrome technicality one note worthy feature was the admission that the doctrine of absolute uniformitarianism which so long prevailed among the advanced school of geologists cannot in the face of further re search be adhered to there seem to be evi dences among the rocks of what must for want of a better term be called cataclysms in the face of such phenomena as those of krakatoa and sangir island how can this be denied if such phenomena can take place in the com paratively quiescent stage of the earths history how much more violent and extensive must have been the outbursts of the earths energy when it was young and vigorous  but all this simply shows how much we have yet to learn as to the past history of the earth and how unscientific it is to assume an uncompromising position on the bases of incomplete datait is admitted that the address of professor lapworth to the geological section was the most suggestive and probably the most original of all the addresses given at the meeting professor lapworth is recognized by the younger school of geologists as a leading spirit on the basis of solidmivestigations ho builds what at first sight seem daring speculations but which when care fully followed will be seen to be carefully drawn inferences his address was a comprehensive survey of the vreat inequalitiesthe enormous bulges with their accompanying deep depressions which characterize the surface of the earth he himself admitted that his address was as much geographical as geological his striking descrip tion of the great folds of the earths surface and their relation to each other might have been given in section e  but he went deep down and far back in order that he might beable to account for the origin of these folds the subject chosen by professor lapworth for his address was one of the widest that could be dealt with by a geojogist and it is doubtful if it has ever been treated more philosophically or with a more thorough knowledgo of the various forces and materials with which the science has to deal no doubt some of the positions taken up by professor lapworth will be assailed both by the older geologists and byastronomical physicists  but whether he is right or wrong in all that he maintained and suggested his address will certainly inspire others to dive more and more deeply into the secrets of the earths crust one of professor lapworths concluding paragraphs isworth quotingwe seem to be dealing not with a globe but with a globular shell composed of many layers is it notjust possible that our earth is just such a hollow shell or series of concentric shells on the surface of which gravity is at a ziaus and in whose deepest interior gravity is practically nonexistent  may this not be so awlso in the case of the eun through wose spot eddies we possihly look into its hollow interior  if so perbaps our present nebuls may also be the hollow sels formed of meteorites  on the surface of these shells the fiery spirals we see would be the swirls whicb answer to the many twisting crustal septa of the earth our comets too in this case might be elongated ellipsoids whose visible parts would be merely sheets of differential move mentlthis is bold writing which may uot commenditself entirelyeither to the spectroscopist or the phyaicistthe somewhat adventurous speculations of mr gray and mr kendall in section c to account for an ice age and to provo its sudden collapso did not meet with much support the senso of the section seemed to be that the energies of young geologists should be directed to the collection of facts rather than to speculations miss ogilvies paper giving the results of her investigations into land slips in the tyrol met with wvelldeserved com mendation both from the president and from baron von rwichthofen the other papers in the section though important enough were generally on somewhat minute points of special interestthe geographical section had this year the distinction of being presided over by professor james geilde not less eminent as a geologist than his brother the president of the association professor geikies address was perhaps more geological than that of professor lapworth as it dealt with the history of coastlines which implies the history of the continents themselves it must at tha same time be recognized as distinctly geographical professor geikie did excellent service in drawing attention to and summariving the conclusions of one of the greatest of recent geologicogeographical wvorks suesss  das antlits der erde lie showed how difficult are the problems connected with the coastlines of the con tinents and the changes they have undergoneand seems inclined to accept the position that the lowering of the sealevel bas had something to do with the appearances which exist as well as the elevation and depression of the land the general work of section b was on the whole at a higher scientific level than usual nearly the whole of the fridaywas devoted to the increasingly interesting subject of oceanography which was introduced by an exceedingly valuable paper by the prince of monaco giving the results of his observations on the currents of the north atlantic followed by another paper advo cating the planting of meteorological observing stations at different points over the atlantic ocean this was followed by other papers by mr j y buchanan and dr h r mill  while on the tuesday this section combined with sec tion b in a seance of specialists in which various aspects of the subject were considered and dis cussed other papers in this section deserving notice as of scientific importance were those of mr j y buchanan on  the windings of rivers mr tohn thomson on the effectof rainfall on formosa dr schlichter on an ingenious and highly successful metbod of taking longitudes by photographing the moon and a star and by colonel tanner on photography as a means of surveying mr ravenstein expounded professor pencks scheme for an international map of the world which seemed to meet wvith general ap proval professor schoute described another fresh project for draining the zuyder zee which will take  years to execute the exploring papers were on the whole gooddr schusters address in section a was com paratively short but quite as suggestive as professor lapworths in c it is worthy of note that technical as much of dr schusters ad dress was he delivered it withoub referring to a single note wvhile reviewing briefly past pro gress he adopted the somewhat unique course of suggesting various highlyimportant subjects in the domain of physics for investiga tion on the part of students these suggestions aro very farreaching they go to the very founda tions in some cases of our conceptions of the physical universe is every large rotating mass a magnet  is there sufficient matter in inter planetary space to make it a conductor of electricity  what is a sunspot  have electric discharges anything to do with it  what causes the anomalous law of rotation of the solar photosphere p these are surely problems worthy of summoning men from the ends of the earth to investigate and discuss and it is to be hoped that dr schusters address like that of professor lapworth wvill stimulate increasingly keen research into problems of vast importance dr schuster is not one of those who believe the association has served its purpose the free dis cussions which take place in the sections and which are becoming more and more common every year if properly conducted and taken part in by those best qualified to do so will tend to give the association a fresh lease of life unfortunately it is not always practicable to get the right men together for such discussions  and the result this year has been that more than one discussion which we were able to announce as having been arranged for has fallen flat n other cases the discussions have been most interesting and pro fitable such was the discussion on electrical standards in connexion with the report on that subject in section a a discussion taken part in by such distinguished foreigners as professor von helmboltz dr lindeck and dr irable the high importance of the conclusions come to with reference to electrical standards has been already referred to in thc times but perhaps the discussion of most general import anice in the section was that on tho desira bility of creating a national physicallaboratory all the speakers were agreed on the subject though there wero differences on matters bf detail the discussion is highly suitable to a meeting of the association at present it seems almosthopeless to persuade the government to lavish money on this fresh enterprise  but if the association perseveres in conjunction with other scientific bodies the object aimed at may be accomplished then the chemical section rnay follow suit for a national chemical labora tory a paper of considerable general interest in this section was one by dr a buchan giving some of the leading results obtained from the data collected by the challenger expeditions and from other sources as to the currents and depths of the ocean and the winds which agitate its surface one notable feature in this section was the number of eminent foreigners who attended it and took part in its wvork indeed the edinburgh meeting has been exceptional in this respect  welllnown foreigners in all depart ments have been attracted to the cityin the chemical section professor mleods address dealing largely as it did with chemical symbols was necessarily extremely teclmical but no doubt appropriate and useful in this section professor roebeitsausten made a com munication on the influence of small quantities of impurities on masses of metal a subject to which he has devoted much attention a joint discussion was arranged with the miechanical section but it would have been better for it to have been discussed in section a as notwith standing the great importance of the subject to engineers the data are hardly sufficiently com plete as yet to enable them to appreciate their valuethe extreme importance of the address of pro fessor rutherford in sectiond biologyon colour sense was recognized speculative no doubt it was to some extent but like the addresses in a and c it was well calculated to stimulate further inquiry in directions likely to prove fruit ful id results so great was the number of papers in this section that it had to divide intoseveral subsections many of these papers were on subjects of comparatively narrow importance on minute matters of detail suited rather to a special society than to a body like the british association section d is apt to sin in this direction and its proceedings would be lightened and improved if the programme were weeded more rigidly the wellknown naturalist dr mcook of philadelphia gave a paper of much general interest on the habits of spiders pro fessor lloyd morgans paper on the methods of comparative psychology was on a subject quite deserving of discussion at such a meeting  the origin of sex  was introduced by dr mann thouah it is doubtful if anything he had to say sheda light on the great problem the great discussion in this section was on the important practical subject of sea fislheries a discussion taken part in by seoie of the most eminent biologists attending the meeting much that was instructive was elicited during the discussion but there was a singular absence of any precise practical conclusions as to what steps should be taken td improve our fisheries still the discussion will do good and might well be continued at f uture meetings there seemed to be a want of agreement at to the form which government action should take mr l o forbess papers in this section and insection e on the chatham islands and their extinct birds excited great interest and produced some discus «pion and criticism especially on mr forbessconclusions as to a vast antarctic continent uniting lands nowv far separatedasb usual the programme of section f was well considered and well arranged the burning subject of oldage pensions came up both in the presidents address and in the general proceed ings of the section as might havo been expected the opinions were nearly as varied as the speakers but the subject is one eminently suited for discussion at such a meeting it is likely enough to come up again in future years a the subjects introduced in this section were of wide interest one that attracted much atten tion was lr prices eulogy on adam smith this was followed by criticism on the part of some present who seem inclined to dethrone the  father of political economy  from his supreme pedestal it will have done good if it leads to the publication of a really critical edition of the great english classic of political economy in which it will be shown what were the varied sources to which the author was really indebtedoutside the presidents address whicl dealt with such great subjects as water supply and the utilization of waterfalls section g can hardly be said to have been marked by any paper of very wide interestin section b anthropology professot macalister dealt with a subject craniometry which bas not been investigated in this country nearly as much as it has been on the continent the great expectation in this section was mr garners paper on his inquiries into the language of monkieys lut the large audience which gathered on the monday to hear him twas disappointed all the more that mllr garner did not condescend to explain his nonappearance probably one of the most interesting eren amusing papers in this section was that of dr robinson on the prehensile power of infants the inference obviously intended to be drawn being that thenewvborn infantretainsthischaracteristic of its simian ancestors this section is an even greater favourite than e with ladies who gather in specially large numbers to listen to papers of morbid interest then the discussion on criminal anthropology attracted large numbers of the fair sex this paper and that by dr warner on the plhysical abnormalities of children are indicative of the practical direction which the work of this section is taking indeed the general character of the proceedings of this section has been improving in recent years there being fewer papers on matters of trivial importance and more time devoted to the con sideration of subjects of real scientific and practical interest
