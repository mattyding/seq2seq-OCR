orvat lire at haggerstona very destructive and alarming fire broke out at about  o clock yesterday morning amongst vast stores of timber on the banks of the regents canal at haggerston and was not completely extinguished at a late hour last night sawrmills and stacks of timber caught fire ani blazed for hours despite the efforts of a large body of firemen with numerous powerful steamers and but for lucky circumstances in regard to the direction of the wind and other matters ten times as much damage would have been done as it is damage to the extent of at least Â£ bas been caused and tons of valuable timber totally destroyed all day yesterday the firemen were steadily pouring water upon the ruins and at  last night fresh bodies of men were going on duty to relieve those who had been at worlc all daythe scene of the outbreak was the alexandra wharf wharfroad pritchardsroad hackney and the premises attaclked were owned and tenanted by mr l duke firewood manufacturer and dealer there are freat stacks of timber in the yard and on the wharfside shiploads of wood are stored in the different structures around and barges laden with wood and with coal to supply the steam sawmills lie by the side of the wharf in the canal the extent of the premises may be gathered from the fact that one of the structures used in the business is nearly ft long and there are others of less magnitudle close to the works are the haggerston gasworks and on another side the premises are bounded by rows of small houses th ilames suddenly burst out just before  oclock yesterday morning the sleepers in the adjacent cottages were awakened by the roar of the wind and the flames and the news spread rapidly the scene which ensued was one of in describablo panic and codfusion for many of the occupants recalled the terrible timber lire which occurred a few years since a little higher up tho canal when a wnole street was destroyed ihere was soon a tremendous mass of fire roaring and leaping high in the air and throwing out a terrific heat the flames had burst forth suddenly from the centre of the threefloored strnature used as saw mills stores engine and boiler house and stables and which runs for  odd yards one way and nearly as farbackwards before the firealarm post on cat and mutton bridge conld be reached the flanes were blazing through the windows on every side of the big structure the first engine soon arrived the news was telephoned to the district headquarters in the commercialroad east and soon afterwards a eecond message of an urgent character was sentas the engines and men began to nssemble from near and far the spectacle which the conflagration pre sented was an extraordinnaly one many tons of timber were buring on every side three barges in the canal were on fire stacks of timber on every side wero catching and the task of the firemen was a most arduous and hazardous one superintendent harman despatched nearly all the steamers fron the stations in the  c  or whitechapel district to the fire on the earlier messages and captain simonds aided his omffcer by ordering on steamers from each of the other districts as well as the coalvan headquarters steamer and watertower from southwark the last named appliance is a special invention of the chief officer of the brigade by which deliveries can be worked and directed into dangerous places from the top of an extension ladder there were soonsteamers from southwark paddington islington whitechapel ha ckney b ethnalgre en mle end  bow poplar shadwvell bishopsgate shoreditch deptford and waterlooroad all these were set to work as well as the hydrants which had been brought into play in the earlier moments of the fire and most of them pumped water from the canal a source of great anxiety was the proximity of the gasworks for the flames were at one time blazing within  feet of one of the gasholders the authorities of the brigade concentrated a portion of the force at this side ofthe fire and the steamers kept pouring so many hundreds of gallons of water on the flames that all dancer of the mischief spreading to the works was obviated the officials ofthe gas company too hurriedly took precautionary measures by emptying the gas into a distant holder and a further measure of safety was to keep a steamer ready in the yard of the gas company one of the most hazardous parts of the work which the brigade had to perform was to throw masses of the blazing timber into the caual from the tops of the stacks part of which had already been destroyed by great good fortune the wind was blowing across the canal or the very large structure already referred to as well as the houses would have taken fire at one time there was every prospect of their doing so but this the brigade by prompt action succeeded in preventing during the morning the stacks and the main building which had been attacked collapsed and one or two walls fell in several of the firemen bad narrow escapes but none of them were injured it was late in the day before superintendent harman was able to let a portion of the force of ensines and men engaged cease work and proceed to their respec tive stations and all day long several steamers con tinued pumping on the firecaptain simondss official report of the fire is as follows    am mondaycalled to alex andrawharf wharfroad pritchardsroad hackney e to the
