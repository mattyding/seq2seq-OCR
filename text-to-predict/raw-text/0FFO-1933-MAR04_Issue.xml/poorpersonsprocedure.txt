poor personsprocedurelaw societys reportfor the seventh annual report of the law society on the wvork of the poor persons procedure for  states that it was possible from a very early stage to encourage the hope of the ultimate complete and unqualified success of the undertaking each succeeding report has increased this hope and the conduct of the work in the past year leaves no room for doubt that the profession as a wvhole has realized its opportunity of rendering valuable legal aid to those who would have been unable otherwise to obtain it and has earned the gratitude of many deserving peopleit is of special interest it is stated to observe from the report of the london coninittee that although at first the view was expressed that when the aftermath of the war congestion had been overcome applications would tend to decrease this forecast has been consistently falsified the applications in london have increased regulatly and the past year has been no exceptionthe london committee under thc secretary ship of mr hassardshort whose valued assistance is once again acknowledged not onlv by his own but also by several of the provincial committees has not allowed its work to fall into arrear and this in spite of the increase referred to the london committee is divided into nine sections one of wnich has net oice in every week in the yearthe only mattcr of regret indeed the oniv blemish on the cntire scheme is that in london although there is a sufficient number of solicitors actually to do the conducting work only about  out of a total of  london solicitors bave sent in their names it is hoped that every london solicitor not assisting will considcr sympathetically the possibilitv of doing sosatisfactory progresswith regard to the provincial reports tiec most interesting feature is that practically withi out exception satisfactory progress is recordedlast years report recorded the establishment of  provincial committees these appear adequately to cover the entire area of england and wales attd it has not been found necessary during tile year under review to constitute any additional committee last year some of the committees were in arrear with their work but on this occasion apparently almost every com mittee is abreast of itseveral of the reports indicate once again that the committees are not limiting themselves strictly to cases within the rules but are giving advice and if need be assistance in deserving cases cither in the county court or in the police courtseveral committees urge oncc again the desir ability of conferring divorce jurisdiction on county courts pointing out that if such juris diction were granted the number of applications would be maierially redticed as many applicants unable to afford high court costs could easily afford to proceed in the county court travelling expenses consequent on attendance in london or at assizes would also be avoidedthe council have urged repeatedly that juris diction should be confcrrcd on county courts this however has not been conceded by the authorities it is believed on two grounds namely a the fear that with so large a number of judges discretion might be excrcised incon sistently and b the consequent largc incrcase of cases in the countv courts would result in serious delay and congestion of business in those courtsit is hoped that sooner or later these objec tions may be overcome as there can be no doubt if jurisdiction were confcrred on county courts at alt events in that great majority of cases in wlhich no question as to discretion arises the public would benefit and the duties of con ducting solicitors be rendered less arduousthe activities of ambulancechasing  rnners employed by socalled legal aid societies have been curbed to some extent by the existence of the poor persons committees hospital authori ties in thc past have found difficulty in protect ing their patients from the uncalledfor attentions of the individuals rcferred to a year or motc ago however a schemc was initiated at one of the larger provincial hospitals as a rcsult of whiich patients havc bcen persuaded to refuse interviews with unauthorized persons and have been assisted either to get into touch with the local poor persons committee or to instruct their own solicitors or practitioners whosc names have been included in a list prepared by the local law society this scheme has been adopted since in one or two additional centres and more recently a similar scheme has been formulated under the auspices of the central bureau of hospital information the general adoption of which would have farreaching effects in the desired directionthe same remarkable consistency of success in the causes tried which was recorded in previous reports is indicated by the reports for as a result of pressure from the law society and the provincial law societies it is possiblc now to issue process from a certain number of district registries and set down cases at some of the assize towns it is hoped at no distant date to extend thenm to every district regisrny and assize townreports of accidentsuntil recently it was possible at all cvents in some centres and included in thesc was the wide london arca to obtain from thc police cops of statements made at the moment of a street accident to the police by persons who witnessed it the icw rcgulations render this impossibic and the result has bcen that the committees have been deprivcd of material of shc utniost value is consideriig whether there is a primiia faicie case tic council realize that she police arc justified in witlilsolding information until it has been decidcd there is to be no prosecution they feel howevcr thiat in deciding to change thie practice the authorities have given barcly sufdicicnt con sideration to ithe value to those wilo have sus tamcd accidents or against whom claims have been made and their legal adviscrs of the material whicii is now being withheld repre sentations to this effect have been made to the home officeit is still not generally realized even after seven years that the assistance to poor persons is ten dered by tile legal profession under the scheme gratuitouslyit many areas it would seem that every solici tor is willing to take his share of the work one secretary mentions that he has never had a re fusal from a solicitor anotlser that lie has
