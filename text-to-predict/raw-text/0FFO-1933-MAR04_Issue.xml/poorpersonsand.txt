parliamentpoor persons andthe lawrights of appealhouse of commonsfriday march tlc speaker took the chair at ii oclockmr turton thirsk and matton u moved the second reading of the summary jurisdiction appeals bill hc said that under the existing law poor persons who were charged with offences in the police courts and who wished to appeal against a decision of the court had many diffi culties to surmount the average recognizance or deposit which was demanded was £ and that had to be found within  days of the con viction to a poor man that was insuperable but even if the man managed to get the sum required he was then faced with the difficulty that whatevcr his poverty he could not obtain legal aid in putting his case beforc quarter sessionsaccording to the criminal statistics for   persons were convicted at courts of assize and courts of quarter sessions and out of that number  appealed in the same year in the courts of summary jurisdiction there were  persons convicted and of that large numbcr only  persons appealed there were  appeals to the court of criminal appeal from quarter sessions and assizes in only  cases was the conviction quashed in  cases the sentence was modified and in  cases the appeal was dismissed of the  appeals from courts of summary jurisdiction in  cases the conviction was quashed in  cases the sentence was modified and in only  cases was the appeal dismissedthe bill repealed subsection  of section  of the summary jurisdiction act  which lays down that recognizances must always bc paid by the appellant the second clause of the bill provided that where a wouldbe appellant was in custody the court might if it thought fit release him on bail pending the appeal clause  gave an appellant without means the samc right as was at present enjoyed by the appellant without means to the cotirt of criminal appeal under the poor prisoners defence act the bill did not apply to scot land or northern irelandabsolutely indefensiblesir w greaveslord norwood u said that the position of appeals from courts of summary jurisdiction was absolutely indefen sible they were the courts in which there was thc greatest liability to error among lawyers there was a delinitc consensus of opinion that there should be no hindrance to the administra tion of justice to all classes in its fullest liberality it was amazing what things could hiappen in a court of summary jurisdiction laughter he was making no general attack on the lay magistrates of this country they performed a difficult duty with little or no training on the whole extremely well but he did not think that they were an ideal tribunal they might well be replaced by a tribunal which would deal with cases with less bias and prejudice it was not satisfactory that the rights or wrongs of a case should depend on the present haphazard system it was a blot on our ludicial system he agreed that thiey would have to consider in committee the possibility of the opening of the floodgates of trivolous appeals but he thought that possibility might be cxaggeratedmr r j davies westhoughton lab said that something must be done very soon to obliterate from the minds of the people the idea that they could still purchase justice provided they had the cash to do it with the intentions of this bill were to secure justice irrespective of cash and for tisat reason he supported itmr thorp nelson and colne u sup ported the bill ilc said it was not quite right to say that there was one law for the rich and another for the poor but in so far as procedure was concerned that statc of alfairs not infre quently camc about the law remained the same but having regard to procedure it was opcn to the rich pcrson to carry an appeal for ward whereas a poor person was not in a posi tion to do so he suggested that the bill should be amended so as to give to the courts of quarter sessions or some other court above the magistrates power to extend the time within which an appeal could be mademr lovatfraser lichfield nat lab and mr llewellynjones flintshire l supported the billtribute to magistratessir w sugden leyton w u support ing the bill hoped that the government would bear in nmind that it made no sort of reflection on the magnificent lay magistraltiure of the countrymr lyons leicester e u supported the bill and said that of all couirts where there should be free application of any right to appeal a court of summary jurisdiction most needed the freest right to a consideration of its judg mentswr janner whitechapel l said that there was no solicitor who did not realize that innumerable cases which could and should have becn subject to appeal were allowed to pass mcrely because of the difficulties of finding recognizances or sureties and other tcchnical difficulties if jiustice was to be done it mtust be that the poorest in the land had equal oppor tiunities with the richest hc would like to seesome provision made in the bill whereby the assize court could be made a court of appeal in certain cases or that a recorder or somebody versed in the law might sit in quarter sessions so that a higher legal authority might hear the appealmr goldie warrington u speaking as one who had had four years experience as a recorder for an industrial borough in the north of england said that his experience during that time was that while the indictable offences dealt with by the recorder had been reduced to vanishing point the number of indictable offences dealt with by the magistrates had in creased enormously in the whole of the four years he had never had to try an appeal against a conviction simply because of the bair vhich at present prevented the poor man from obtain ing the justice to which he was entitledsir r craddock english universitiesu said that he had had a great deal of experience of the work of magistrates paid and honorary in india and he was led by that experience to give his warm support to the billmr essenhigh newton u also sup ported the bill referring to the question of recognizances he asked how in the name of common sense an unemployed man or a man drawing transitional benefit could conjure up  pence let alone £the government viewmr hacking undersecretary to the home office cliorley u said that the labour govern ment had promised that a departmental com mittee should be set up to deal with the issues raised in the bill such a committee was set up by the national govemment in july  it was hoped that that committee would report about easter the government did not regard thle bill as an attack on the magisterial benches throughout the country it was impossible to estimate what the cost of the provisions of the bill would be if put into effect he hoped that the departmental committec would consider carefully the question of cost and try to form a fairly accurate estimate under the present system there had been only  appeals out of  cases although it was unlikely there would bc a large number of appeals under the bitt it was quite impossible to give an estimate only experience could really determine the costxvhile the govemnment fully sympathized with the objects of the promoters of the bill it would be clearly premature for ministers to come to any conclusion until they had received the re port of the departmental committee and had had time to consider that reportthe government would promise to lose no time in giving full consideration to the matter after the report of the departmental committee was forthcoming they had no objection to the bill receiving a second reading but they hoped that before it went to standing committee the report of the departmental committee would be available and that the government would have had time to consider it wvhen the bill was in standing committee oneof three things might happen it was possible that the bill might pass without amendment or that it might fit in with the governments proposals with fairly simple amendments the third alternative was that the governments decision might differ so widely as to make it necessary to start all over again he hoped the third eventuality would notarisemajor llewellin uxbridge u asked that the departmental committec should be urged to come to a conclusion as soon as pos sible because in the case of a private members bill timc was the essence of the problemmr hacking said it was not the intention of the government to play any tricks in order to prevent the bill reaching the statutebook he hoped the departmental committee would get on with their work as quickly as possible so that the report would be available before the bill went into committeemajor llewellin said he quite accepted that assurance  if provision were made to pre vent frivolous appeals the courts should be open to anyone who wished to appeal against convictionthe bill was read a second timewages in the coalminesmvr d grenfell gower lab moved the secondreading of the coal mines minimum wage act  amendment bill

the cost of living from  to  as ascertained and published by thie board of trade from timc to time it was sought to include surface workmen among those to whom the minimum wage sholild be paid it was pro vided also that the minimum wage should be the net minimum wage and not subject to deduction employers who evaded paying the minimum wage would be liable to a penaltyunder the act of   separate district boards were established since then a new coal tield had been started in kent and it was pro posed to adda new board for that county tihe bill was not intended to be a substitute for the miners demand for a national wages board but it would go part of the way in that direction it would also go part of the way to meet the objections of thc coalownersmlr price hemsworth lab secondeda

afford any thing like that he subscribed to the appeal that had been made for the owners and men to get together hear hear many coalowners agreed with him that there were great benefits in a longterm agreement with themen he believed there was in the coal industry capacity to give greater rewards to the workers but along with that there must be the cheapest production of coal prosperity to the
