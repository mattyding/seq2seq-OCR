socialist is today by externals entirely nazi and nationalist not only communism but also socialism and republicanism have been driven underground and exterminated in all save the minds of men in berlin almost the only sign of opposition electoral activity is an occasional centre party poster inviting a vote  against civil warmarked men in hidingwith the population so cowed it seems likely that many known socialists and communists will shun the polling stations the reasons for the fears which possess these people must be found between the lines ot such brief announcements as that which told yesterday of the discovery of a workman  murdered in his dwelling in the flight or sclfconcealment of pro minent socialists and communists and in the innumerable arreststhus  more people have been arrested  for political offences  in berlin the number of arrests throughout the country must now run into several thousands hardly anything is known of the identity of the prisoners but they seem to include many people who in england would be regarded as advanced liberals or moderate socialists they may expect no trial and the best they may look for is apparently to be held i until they
