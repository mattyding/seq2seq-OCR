herr hitler inhamburgbig nazi displaythe war guilt issuefrom our special correspondenthamburg march accompanying herr hitler the chan cellor and leader of the nazi movement on an election tour to hamburg is like entering a different world after following the opposition campaign even in a com paratively easygoing state like saxony or observing the general trend from the heart of prussia in berlinthe free city of hamburg in the eyes of herr hitler and his staff is a little island of communist and socialist resis tance in north germany only last night a sa man was shot dead while the nazis were making one of those provoca tive but in their conviction necessary marches through one of hamburgs  reddest quarters and there have been other disturbances the police have been regarded as too easy going and the large number of socialists and other weimar republican officials who have not as in prussia been replaced by men of the right as annoyingly obstructive but the last drastic presidential decree had already been paving the way to the establishment and consolidation of the nationalist hold over hamburg while the chancellor was on his way to the city the reich government had ordered the socialist volkabote to be suppressed a majority of the senate or state government was opposed to compliance but the socialist members resigned today to avert reich intervention and the newspaper has been suspended at the same time a new chief of police has been appointed and there was every sign at tonights great nazi gathering that the police are hastily becoming outwardly at any rate as enthusiastic converts as those of prussiathe fascist saluteafter driving rapidly for nearly a mile between lines of brownclad sa men holding torches herr hitler and his party walked through the several extensive halls in which the meeting was heldeach packed to suffocation and provided with loud speakers betwveen lines not only of uni formed nazis but of greenclad customs officials and blueclad police with their arms raised stiffly in the fascist salute below the platform was a group of police officers with drawn swords some wearing steel helmets guarding their coloursherr hitlers speech contrasted notably with that which i heard him deliver at the nazi youth rally at potsdam in the late autumn when the movement was visibly on the decline he has recovered the fire of last summers great advance and the consciousness of power has given him an easy confidence which finds expression in frequent jokes much appreciated by his adoring audiences that some of them such as those relating to the alleged corruption of the late socialistcentre government of prussia in the matter of m said to have been spent on party election propaganda might not stand very close analysis does not detract from their effectbut herr hitler admitted today that the attribution to germany of sole re sponsibility for the war was the real foundation of the revolution he is carry ing through and the real meaning of it it was to be gathered from his speech that the movement behind the present govern ment was a passionate revolt against this accusation against the exploitation of the countrys labour for the payment of mate rial reparations and against those who in the first years after the war with foreign troops in occupation of the rhineland and other difficulties fulfilled the terms of the treaty signed by germany though they obtained a remarkable amount of revision in a comparatively short period a son of the people the general tendency of the closing passages was not calculated to rc assure the class of landed aristocracy represcnted by the chancellors present partners in officc he sneered at differ ences of class and education proudly pro claimcd hinisclf a worker and a  son of the pcople and appealed for solidarity between workers and peasants in a country which should be neither exclu sively national nor exclusively socialistic but nationalsocialistthe drive back to the hotel through cheering crowds the organized choruses outside his window the smoothness of the arrangements in spite of a caution comprehensible in a city of which the nazis are not yet quite sure gave one the impression as it were of being among the people on the comfortable side of the parapet looking out upon the dark no mans land where it must be presumed at least half the population goes about its business uneasily sometimes in posi tive dread of what the morrow may bring forthon the platform with herr hitler one feels that one is in that new germany which herr seldte the labour minister and stahlhelm leader claimed the other day to be a country  again fit to live in for those who are setting about re making it with admitted ruthlessness
