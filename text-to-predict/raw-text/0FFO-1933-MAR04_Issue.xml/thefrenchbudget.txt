imperial and foreignthe frenchbudgetsenate andchamberfrom our paris correspondentlthe prolonged wrangle between the french senate and chamber on the vote on account for the month of march now happily settled has afforded a somewhat unedifying spectacle to france and the world in france the curious procedure of the  navette in which finance bills are shuttlecocked backwards and forwards between the two houses is well under stood as the timehonoured method of securing agreement on this occasion it was merely a question of a supply vote for a single monthfor the reason that they could not be balanced on the basis of the existing taxes the french parliament failed to pass the budget estimates for  before the beginning of the new financial year it thus became necessary to resort to the system of monthly votes on account in order to render legal the continued collec tion of taxes and the normal machinery of expenditure the first two votes on account those of january and february were what is called  nu that is to say they were based on the old rate of taxation and expenditure taking no account of the deficit the thirdthat just passed after the long struggleembodies the principles that are to be applied to the budget of  and it was thus of a highly contro versial characterfinancial confusionowing mainly to the economic crisis which has affected the budgets of the whole world the public accounts of france have been thrown into dire con fusion the temptation to play up to the electorate with expensive schemes of national development and the grant of further pensions on a vast scale to new large classes seemed irresist ibleat least it was not resisted the power of initiating recurrent expenditure without providing the corresponding revenue is one of the peculiarities of french parliamentary life and in the period from  to  full advantage was taken of it yet all the time as it now appears the prosperity was an illusion not since  has a french budget been properly balancedwhen the estimates for  were first presented to the chamber on july   by m germain martin minister of finance in m herriots cabinet the expenditure for the year was found to be f and the revenue f leaving a deficit of f the diminution of revenue represented f and the increase of expenditure f subsequent cuts in expenditure and  re organizationi of revenue reduced the deficit by f but a further fall in taxable values once more over threw all calculations and the last esti mate of the deficit was still in the neigh bourhood of f as the revised budget estimates have not been published the exact figure of the deficit is uncertain when they come befor the chamber they will embody the finan cial principles that have just been fought out between chamber and senate the extent to which the new votes are adequate to meet the deficit can only be tested by experience but it is freely predicted that in the end recourse must be had to a public loan but this would be a very unpopular solutionthe system of finance by votes on account is very costly and adds greatly to the difficulties of the finance minster besides hampering the treasury the conflict that has been in progress between the chamber and senate has had a certain aspect of unreality because it was obvious that france could not afford the dis organization of her cconomic life and the attendant social disorder that would have followed another cabinet crisis with the vnte on accounlt unpassed and the budget estimates unprepared but beneath the apparent triviality of the conflict there was also a conflict of principleselectoral considerationsthe chamber more exposcd than ever to the reproaches and reprisals of the elec torate did its utmost to thrust the bulk of the burden upon the taxpayer and to ex empt so far as possible the  little  man so beloved of the french radical politi cian the minor official the artisan the small shopkeeper the smallholder and so forth the clhamber is by its very composition and its closer relation to the electorate obliged to demonstrate in a way that the senate can readily avoid on the other hand it could carry measures of economy such as the reductions in the votes on account of the three fighting ser vices which the senate with its conserva tive views on national defence could only agree to under the most stringent guar antees that the security of france was not impairedwith budgets in deficit the choice is always between two lines of actioneco nomy and fresh taxationthough it is also possible to combine the two the senate laid the greater stress on economies on the ground that budgets have become in flated to a degree the country cannot afford and the state must reduce its style of living in the crisis just as drastically as the individual citizen it adopted three guiding principles i that no stepmust be taken that would injure the credit of the state  that economy must not be such as to prejudice the military security of the country and  that the aim of the budget must be to restore public con fidence in the process the scnate could oppose successfully the chambers pro ject for increasing the incometax by  per cent and could substitute its own jigure of  per catt it could also achieve in great measure its will that in the scheme for reducing the pay of state employees the lower as well as the middle and higher grades should be brought under contributionthe attempts of the federation of state employees unions to influ ence the decisions of parliament through the pressure of a strike came near to overthrowing the government in the chamber through the instrumentality of the socialist party their  direct action  had no effect upon the senate whatever and it was probably owing to the steady ing influence of that body that the vote was ultimately passed and the chaos of a ministerial crisis avoided
