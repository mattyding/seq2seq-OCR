a cold valvenew rectifier for use inwireless setsit has been the ambition of many inventors to evolve a  cold  valve rectifier suitable for use ol the highfrequency side of wireless receivers this has now been accomplished in the labora tories of the westinghouse brake and saxby signal company and is entirely a british inven tion during the past  months experinments have been made with the copperoxide rectifier and the  westector as the new valve is called is a modification of this type wvhich is in common use in the mains equipment of modem receivers in its present state it cannot successfully com pete with the threeelectrode valve as a rectifier it has however a definite usefulness in radioin performance it is comparable with the diode or twoelectrode valve which is a pure rectifier unlike the triode it is without amplification yet its efficiency and reliabiity it is claimed by the manufacturers are far greater than the crystal detector it also has advantages over the ther mionic valve inasmuch as it requires neither low nor high tension current to operate it the valve would appear to offer special advantages in the intermediate stage of superheterodyne re ceivers and for automatic volume controlthe westector is made in two types and will be available to the public about the middle of this month
