railway wagesdeadlockcompanies newproposalsletter to unionsfrom our labour correspondentthe railway companies have given the  months notice required by the rail ways act to terminate the obligation to refer all disputed questions relating to rates of pay hours of work or other con ditions of employment to the wages boards at the same time the companies invite the unions to consider with them the establishment of alternative machinery and they desire the cooperation and conciliation work of local i departmental committees and sectional councils to continue as usefully in the future as in the pastthis action is the deliberate outcome of the companies consideration of the recent failure of the national wages machinery to provide a settlement of the dispute between the companies and the unions the national wages board was hopelessly divided the companies representatives and two of the representa tives of railway users desired full approval of the companies claim while the two other representatives of railway users and the representatives of the unions disapproved of any reduction of wages sir harold morris the inde pendent chairman made proposals which stood alone for very modified alterations of rates which would have effected a saving of about Â£ to the companies when later the companies informed the unions that although the chairmans finding in their opinion fell far short of the merits of the case they were prepared to accept it ihe unions would not agree to a compromise on that basis there was therefore a complete deadlockthe main difficultyin the view of the companies the main difficulty arises from the constitution of the national board the parties to the dispute sit along with the users of rail ways and the chairman as judges and are therefore required to adjudicate and sign decisions on questions in regard to which they cannot be expected to hold an impar tial opinion and upon which definite views may have been expressed by them or by those whom they represent twelve years experience of the operation of the board has brought the companies to the opinion that this state of things is neither satis factory to the parties nor fair to the repre sentatives of the parties on the boardthe conciliation machinery will con tinue to function during the ensuing  months it will be available for use by either the companies or the unions and it may be pointed out that it is constantly in operation in cases not of sufficient moment to excite public interest although of importance to the railway service moreover should there be a material change in the circumstances of the com panies there is little doubt that the national machinery would again be called into service for major purposes between now and next year that however is not an expected contingencytext of the letteras the railways act does not state to whom notice to abandon the national wages machinery must be given the com panies have sent their notification to the ministry of transport and the ministry of labour as well as to the three railway trade unions the identical letter sent to the unions yesterday was as followsin accordance with the intimation contained in the letter from the secretary of the railways staff conference dated february  the four group railway companies have now given con sideration to the whole situation following upon thc issue of national wages board decision no  dated january  the companies have come to the conclusion that a tribunal which is constituted on the lines of the national wages board has inherent defects and therefore give the formal notice enclosed herewith in pursuance of section  of the railways act the companies recognize the mutual advan tages which accrue from discussions betweets their officers and the staff at meetings of local departmental committees and sectional councils and they do not desire to interfere with the useful work of these bodiesthey also wish to make it clear that they have no desire to depart from their established policy of discussing labour questions with the employees their representatives and the railway trade unions and following upon the notice now given the companies will be prepared to con sider with the unions the adoption of some more suitable form of procedure for the determination of questions relating to rates of pay hours of duty and other conditions of service

the companies decision said he had no doubt that the unions would meet the companies and discuss whatever proposal was madefrom time to time he added our own people had been dissatisfied with the

a year
