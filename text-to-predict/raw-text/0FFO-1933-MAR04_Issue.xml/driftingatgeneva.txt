drifting at genevanew hope from britishmovefrom our special correspondenitgeneva march the announcement reported on p  that mr macdonald and sir john simon are coming to geneva to do what they can to save the disarmament conference has been received here in a spirit of philosophic reliefit is confidently expected that the arrival of mr macdonald and sir john simon especially if their example is followed by others as there is reason to hope will pave the way at length for cleancut decisions there may not be very much to put into a disarmament convention but any convention will be better than noneit is fervently hoped that there are to be no circumscribed conversations after the arrival of the british ministers at this stage of the conference neither poland nor the little entente can be relegated to the antechambers of a fivepower con clave today m titulescu addressed the general committee for the first time as accredited spokesman of the little ententeherr nadolnys doubtsa speech by herr nadolny the german delegate in the general committee this afternoon taken in conjunction with an article by baron von neurath the german foreign minister which will appear to morrow in voilkerbuwd the organ of the german league of nations union suggests that the conference may be already dangerously near to the rocks herr nadolny received a courageous answer from mr henderson who spared himself no pains in counteracting defeat ism but it is unhappily significant that the german delegate and minister should both have timed their aspersions for the eve of tomorrows debate on the pact of mutual assistance which is regarded by france as the lynchpin of disarmamentherr nadolny had carefully chosen his cue the general committee was asked in the list of questions now before it to state in what proportion the reducible component of national effectives should be reduced m paulboncour said that he could not give an answer until he knew what degree of national security the future convention would provide he moved to leave the question unanswered and this was accepted by  votes to threeas soon as the vote had been taken herr nadolny expressed his keen disappointment that the committee had failed to take an opportunity to decide upon a real measure of disarmament after a years work he said the conference had not taken any steps which would reduce arma ments by a single soldier gun warship or aero plane it was increasingly tending to be turned aside from its real object and the success of its work was being more and more seriously com promisedmr hendersons replymr henderson in his reply said that he did not wish to pass over in silence the important and even brave statement made by herr nadolny but he was not going to give up in the despair which had characterized that statement all were working hard and working better in spite of the very troublesome task of answering a multi plicity of questions on effectives the sooner those questions were got away so the effectives committee the sooner they would reach the point which herr nadolny and others desired to reach namely a series of discussions on the reduction of war material as a german state ment would go out to the press he wished to put anotlter aspect of the case which would appeal to the general public and encourage it not to give up in despair but to support the conference as it had done from the irst he believed that before very long the conference would take practical decisions for that substantial and comprehensive reduction of armaments to which the delegates had au agreed ia the resolution of july mr henderson has sent a letter to the chairman  of the effectives committee expressing the hope that the committee will complete its work in  days because he hopes to settle all important questions of principle before the easter vacationin his article in volkerbiud baron von neurath after remarking upon germanys  terrible military insecurity insists that the conference has discussed too long and too ex clusively the french desire for security hit is true he adds  that germanys demand for security has been put forward in the form of our claim to cqual rights and to the disarmament of the most heavily armed states but we shall perhaps soon be obliged to express still more clearly the demand for security which every state possesses as its permanent right  for more than  years we have been waiting in vain for the heavily armed states to fulfil their solemn promise to disarm our patience is now exhausted
