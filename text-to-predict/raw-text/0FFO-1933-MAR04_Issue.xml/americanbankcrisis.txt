e american bankcrisiscongress to meetnext weekmr roosevelts plansfrom our own correspondentwashington march there is good reason to believe that the presidentelect mr roosevelt has decided to set aside the formality of a fortnights notice and to summon the new congress into special session on tuesday or wednesday of next weekan attempt was made after mr roosevelts arrival in washington last night to establish a basis of agreement between him and president hoover which would permit instant executive action in the matter of the banking crisis nothing had been decided by an early hour this morning and it did not appear likely that anything would be decided during this last day of mr hoovers active responsi bility for action some suggestion of a possible statement from the president to be made late this afternoon came from semiofficial circles but lacks confirma tion at the moment of writing the present expectation is that this admini stration and its congress will pass out of existence without a further attempt to meet the emergencyit must be assumed that this is what mr roosevelt desires and the air just now is full of discussion of his probable course of action he is understood to have refused to listen to the suggestion of a guarantee of national bank deposits by the federal government but this in any case could only be made with congres sional authority in some quarters the prediction is made that he will at once order an embargo on domestic gold with drawals and that using the power believed to be vested in him by statute he will place a prohibitive fee on the export of gold it is significant that a number of leading men in his own party are frankly of the belief that this drastic action should be taken withdrawal of paper currency from the banks and trans formation of this currency into gold is going on at central points with great rapidity and cannot be continued much longer without positive danger the disease is desperate and the remedy must be as immediate as it is potentthe  new dealit is right to say that whatever his private thoughts may be nothinghas dis turbed mr roosevelts air of serene self confidence his courage is unquestioned his willingness to make quick decisions has often enough been noted and he will have instant need of both his inaugural address tomorrow if it is to do what it should do must revive the droopipg faith of the american people must be as full of determination as it is empty of facile optimism there should be as little doubt of the response to such an appeal as there is of he eagerness with which the country awaits the accents of a new voice a sense of relief that the era of  years of republican rule has ended is part of the atmosphere and if nobody quite knows what mr roosevelts promised  new deal will be the vast majority are thankful that it will at least ba something newhe will come into officc with tre mendous power power derived from the sheer immensity of his victory and forti fied by the fact that he owes it not to one or more sections of the united states but to the country as a whole he must use the power already his to secure still more authority to reorganize the machinery of government and to ordain economies authority over congress without which no programme of action can escape abor tion this he must secure at once while the hand of depression is heavy on the country and he must use it without fear of the personal consequenceswithout too much thought that is to say to his own renomination and reelection in  if he  plays politics  he will be losttoday mr roosevelt paid a visit of condolence to the widow of the late senator walsh and exchanged courtesy calls with president hoover he denied himself to the press but since his arrival he has conferred with the leaders of his own party and other advisers at every moment not formally occupied thousands met him last night and cheered him from the railway station to the hotel and tens of thousands more are coming in by every train for tomorrows cere mony and parade and for the great in augural ball which will close the day faces rarely seen since the democratic exodus of  are visible everywhere wearing that air of expectancy which is natural when so rich a repast of patronage is to be enjoyed when an american administration changes it changes horse foot and artillery and new troops of all arms are assemblingrepublicans leavingsimultaneously the defeated republi cans are in retreat most of the  members of the scnate and house whose terms expire at noon tomorrow are of that party and the number who must re linquish executive positions great and small is much larger the time of their ascendancy is over an ascendancv which was now bright with prosperity now tainted by scandal and which ended so gloomily they talk bravely of return in four years but the wise ones among them do not believe this is possible if the new administration is a disappointment it will not be to anything like the republican party of today that the country will turn the movement will be either to the left and away from both great organizations or so far to the right as equally to leave them behind the historic pendulum whiph swings between freedom and authority is slowly but heavily moving and its direction is toward authority the united states has been condemned by its own system to two years of negation but the sign of today is juabeo and not veto
