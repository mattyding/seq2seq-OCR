oxford in parsonskinnersholidaythie laboratory at christ churchfrom  to  the rev john skinner was rector of camerton near bath like other country parsons unconscious benefactors of the future he was pleased to set down the daily cur rent of his existence with some of his comings and goings two years ago canon a n bax and mr h coombs edited and john mlurray published undcr the title of the journal of a somerset rector the record by mr skinner of ten consecutive years  of camer tons parochial affairs but a good deal of material was left over and among that which has an interest at once wide and local is the account of a visit to oxford in one of the charms of oxford for old oxford men is that go when they will there is always something new to see it was so in the days of the rev john skinner who being luckier than some of a later generation appears to have seen nothing too new when he laments it is over undisciplined man a gasometer moves him to curiosity not to tears for he entertained no un easy premonitions on the industrial march of science indeed he sought the company of scientific men and it is remarkable consider ing how small a part their teaching played in the oxford of  that he should have had so much to say of them he met dr buckland professor of mineralogy rigaud an old school fellow who lectured on natural philosophv and others but the journal benefited more from its owners acquaintance with dr kidd who showed him the laboratory and anatomical room at christ church as oxford had taken early advantage of the new lighting however the gasometer first demands attention wne come upon the reference midway through a long entry for december  accompanied by mr buckland visited the gasometer an apparatus for ligliting the university i lind they con sume on an average six tons of coat a night which would be good custom for our pits if they were in our neighbourhood on inquiring what was done with the tar wlhen extracted from the coal which at bath is sold as paint for outdoor work i founid that not being able to procure a proper sale for it in the neighbourhood dr kidd who is a great chemist at oxford has put them in the way of extracting still more gas from the tar which will be as profitable as though they got is a pound for the remainder the coal is supplied from bitton between bath and bristol and delivered at a guinea a ton when examining the apparatus i was introduced to dr kidd who invited mc to attend his lecture room tomorrow i understand he is a very in telligent man and a good scholar our timc had been so much occupied at the gasometer we were obliged to hurry back to dress for dinnera man in a spencerdr kidd proved  very clear in his explana tions of the several subjects he submitted  to mr skinners noticethe doctor also showed me some chcmnial experi ments in the laboratory in melting some small grains a preparation i believe of lead it produced a most beautiful vapour of a violet colour not being at all a chemist i could not cnter into thc process he next showed mc of extracting different fluids from coal the anatomical room contains human skeletons also those of animals and a numerous collection of different parts of human bodies preserved in spiritswhen was the laboratory opened at christ church  was it coeval with the anatomical room built in   if so the teaching of chemistry at christ church is much older than is generally supposed dr kidd then the professor of chemistry  had appointed  the ratcliff library  for this meet ing with mr skinner the reason being that he occupied rooms in the basement of the ashmolean museum in a letter to the ice chancellor dated june   he had thanked the university for fitting the laboratory as a temporary residence and expressed his willing ness to put it back in statu quo he succeeded in  to the lees readership in anatomy founded at christ church in  kidd has been described as a little man trottittg about the street in a spencer a tailless great coat then becoming obsolete in  dr carus a dis tinguished german chemist said that all around the theatre everything was in the antique style and that professor kidd was a goodnatured old gentleman who quite corresponded with these ancient treasureson the first day of his holiday novcmber  mr skinner had walked  up heddington hill to joe pullens tree returning  by a new walk made from thence along the fields later on traversing the avenue towards magdaleni was sorry to notice some of the finc elm trecs are beginning to show the effect of old age and in the course of a few years i should apprehend the beauties of this noble walk will be defaced having made a circuit of magdalen walks we returned up high strect to exetcr stopping by the way to look at the building going on at hart hall which when complete will be called magdalen hall hertford collegel as the society will be removed to this placciffley snipe shootingon december  after examining a manu script copy of tacitus in the bodleian mr skinner saw a little more of this newer oxfordi took a walk along the parks beyond wadhani college which i perceivc has becn much improved in appearance since i was last in oxford by taking in a small couts in front the walks from the parks have also bcen extended along the common fields to a considerable distance this work was performed a few years ago t understand when the poor wanted employmcnt and must be of considerable advantage to the gownsmen as a gymnasium after the hours of studymr skinner was a man of taste he enjoyed two concerts at which  miss stephens from town having been invited as a performer at Â£ an evening was the principal attraction she was  very powerful in several songs especially that of the horse and his rider shall be both thrown into the sea at chapel an undergraduates reading of the first lesson moves mr skinner to think how advis able it would be to have a professor  for elocution for reading as he perceived this necessary attainment was as little attended to as ever to st marys church he went twice find ing it very cold though well attended at the morning service a most excellent discourse was delivered by a fellow of magdalen on the text  grieve ye not the holy spirit   the  oclock sermon by another gentleman of magdalen was trite in argument and inferior in style the weather was not kind to m r skinner but on december  as it improved he set out with a friend to walk to iffleva little beyond magdalen bridge we passed a culious little church called st clements standing between the two london roads the turnpike house built so closc to it as to have the appearance of being part of the edifice itself i could diot help recalling tie scenes of past times when some  years ago i walked slowly along this same road after having lost part of onc of my fingers by the bursting of a gun whilst snipe shooting at ifiley my companion stackhousc having gone forwards to tell the surgeon grosvenor to attend my arrival in my rooms how different arc my pursuits now to what they were then an old church or a roman pavement have more charms than any shooting or boating of which i used to be so fond i am vcry thankful i stiu have sufficient health and activity to follow my other pursuits without inconvenience the church at ifflicy certainly surpassed my expectations and i do not hesitate in giving it the preference to any building of the kind i have seenit will be gathered that mr skinner had many hobbies they ranged from ecclesiastical architecture to coal deposits from chemistrv to roman history and left him only too little leisure for sketching what took his fancy inoxford though he added  drawings to his pprtfolio during his stay nor was he lackingcin conviviality evenif a gaudy at new college tested his capacities severelyat five i walked again to new collegc being engaged to dine there with earter the subnvnrdenion thcgaudy or founders day whlichl i asgladofhaifigan opportunity of witnessing as no gqwnsman who is not a wicamnist is permitted to partake of but a eneral invitation is sent to them throughout the universiy on going into the hau i was much struck with the improvement it has under gone within these few years in the fitting up the interior barter having introduced nme to she wardendr gauntlett i was placed near him at tllc head of the high table accommodating i should suppose upwards of forty members and thcir guests with a profusion of good things on the surface    after dinner the grace was sung in the hall by the choristers and musical nien attached to thecollege and was very fine we afterwards adjourned to the comnmon room where a table was covered witli an cxcllent dessert which extended the whole length of the room a most comfortable apartment lighted by a chandelier containing four large globular limps the warden and stubwarden as at dinner sat side by side at the top of the table and i was placed near barter i found the even ing very pleasant as i was left fuli liberty to do as i cliose as to wine and the catches andglees were sung by members of the college and mr johnson fellow of magdalen and were per formed in the highest style amongst them as a matter of course there was dulce domum and omnibus wickamisis at halfpast  nine the company separated and i returned to exeter and accompanied mr johnson to the common room where the feast of the gaudy was concluded by a plate of oystersthis sumptuous living mr skinner remarks  is very well for a few days but would not exactly suit me for a con stancy it was past  when he got to bed after another party of the heads of the university and mr michael angelo taylor who was very amusing and occupied most of the conversationi remember this gentleman at the installation of the duke of portland on account of the splendid diamond button he sported on the occa sipn hc was at one time a great favourite with the king when prince of wales but is not so just at present and opposes most strenuously the whole of the measurcs against the queen town and gownjthe trial of queen caroline had ended on november  on his way to oxford changing horses at faringdonmrskinner hkd heard the church bells ringing very merrily  preparatory to christmas stid the people but mr skinner suspected that  the queens triumph as it is styled had somc share in it and the little  q  with which he spells the word is a delicate hint of his own views on reaching oxfordsorry was i to find the spirit of insubordina tion had not subsided and a grand riot was at that time going on in the streetsthe towns peoplc having openly insulted the gownsmen and pelted them with stonesinsomuch that the vice chancellor was obliged to be summoned to read the riot act i understand that one of the proctors before this had bcen struck by a radical and had his gown torn and the clergy insulted by name these are sad times  in the evening lof the next day we were summoned into the town the gownsmen being assembled in great iiumbers to avenge the attack made on then by the radicals nve saw a crowd of gownsimen chiefly undergraduates passing in a compact body along broad street into the corn market severalmasters of arts and thd proctors were endeavouring to disperse them and send them back totheir different colleges which they did not scem muchto ielish therewas also a party of constibles withthick bludgeons to act i caseof necessrty there did not appear a large body of towvnspeople assembled but i heard occasional hissing and cries of  caroline also  now go to it alt authority of the proctors these radicals set at nought one of them not only collared a proctor last night but kicked his shins at the same time the whole subject vexed mr skinner he would not discuss it he wished it were entirely washed by the waters of lethe from recollection it was the only bad blot on his holiday
