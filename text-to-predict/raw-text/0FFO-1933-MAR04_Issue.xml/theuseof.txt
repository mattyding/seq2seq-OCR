the use of powerwrong roads to successfronm a correspondentthe description of our lords battle with temptation in the wilderness read as he gospel of the first sunday in lent is not merely an introduction to the record of his ministry but an interpretation of it as the experience it relates was met by christ in solitude the account of it must have come from his own lips he gave it a vivid and pictorial form that would appeal to his disciples yet one we may say with confidence which neither they nor the evangelists would have been capable of inventing in later days the story was often read with a literalism which obscured its meaning perhaps indeed centuries had to pass and various types of leadership to succeed or fail before the true significance of our lords temptations could be discernedfor this is no oriental tale of conflict with abnormal and supernatural perils rather it is the picture of the supreme leader resisting insidious suggestions for the misuse of his powers choosing as every leader must choose the path he would follow deciding between the long road of patient constructive effort and the shortcut of popular appeal all those later pages of the gospels which record christs work among men are elucidated by this story of the temptations met and mastered at the outset of his ministry to read those later pages alone might be to fancy that his serene and unswerving rejection of unworthy methods was effort less but the battle with the temptation to use them had been fought and won tomorrows gospel remindsus at the cost of what tremendous effort and agony the victory had been gainedat his baptism if not earlier our lord became fully conscious of his messiah ship henceforth he knew that he had a unique task to establish the kingdom of god among men and unique powers how should he employ the powers to accomplish the task plausible ideas suggested themselves of methods which as it seemed might lead to rapid success but were they right were they in accord with the will of his heavenly father  that question he must decide in solitude alone in the desert  with the wild beasts that vivid detail he himself must have given to the discipleshe would ponder how best a hearing might be gained for the message he had come to deliverone expedient was suggested by the con dition of the people among whom he lived they were crushed by a dual system of taxation religious and civil their economic position was thoroughly bad large numbers were unemployed perforce standing idle because no man had hired themand not a few were near starvation it was symptomatic of their plight that heaven was increasingly thought of as a vast banquet where the true bliss would be an abundance of food what then if christ used the super natural powers which he felt himself to possess for multiplying food  waging war by this means on poverty and hunger he could be sure of immediate popularity that idea was amply justified when for an exceptional reason he did feed a multi tude at once the people wished to make him their king atid popularity would gain a ready hearing for his spiritual teaching how easy and how sure seemed this short cut to success  yet there could be no escape from the know ledge that instead of aiding it would stultify his message it would place material prosperity in the forefront while he had come to insist that the material things were relatively the least important and to prove that man does not live by bread aloneanother easy road to apparent success suggested itself he might use his powers in some sensational fashionas by float ing down from a pinnacle of the temple to the crowd in the forecourt below which must amaze the populace and com pel its attention surely that would cause the multitude to hang upon his words to listen eagerly to whatever teaching he de sired to give  yet it would not change their hearts for that purpose not sudden and dramatic display but quiet teaching and persuasion and rebuke were needed or what if he should head a political movement such as many patriots eagerly expected  true it would require some compromise with evil some concession to hate and violence yet practical wisdom might consider some such compromise in evitable none the less there persisted the fathers claim to undivided allegiance and it prevailedto read this page of the new testament is to feel how often the temptations faced by christ recur in our own age their appeal is not to the base but to those most eager to serve their fellowmen too easily for example an admirable zeal over such matters as employment and housing may lead us to speak as though material things were allimportant and to spread the view that if only our citizens can be made comfortable it is relatively un important whether or not they are made christian how tempting too in moments of impatience at the slow pro gress of constructive effort is the idea of some more spectacular and dramatic line of action v how easy once more to acquiesce in a lowered standard to effect some compromise with evil on the plea that only in this way can we hope for suc cess v feeling ourselves drawn in such directions it is good for us to remember that most impressive struggle in the wilder ness by disclosing the story of his temptation christ not only made plain the inevitability of conflict but revealed the secret of victory
