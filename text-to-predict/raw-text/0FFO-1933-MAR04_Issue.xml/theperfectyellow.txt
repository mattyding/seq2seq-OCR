the perfect yellowirisa ceaseless questfrom l correspondentnot so long ago the quest of the perfect juneflowering bearded border iris with yellow blooms seemed the quest of the un attainable at any rate for about  years gardeners had to be content with the iris called mrs neubronner a variety that leaves little to be desired in colour but is too dwarf in habit and rather late in opening its bloomsthe want of the ideal yellow iris was the more remarkable as the native yellow flag iris pseudacorus lay ready for the plant improvers hand this beardless beauty which is common enough and old enough to have a place among fossil plants seems to possess all the virtues of a good parent but as they say in the horsebreeding world it has not been successful at the stud so the seekers after a fine tall yellow rhizomatousrooted iris sought to attain their end in other directions and the extent of their success may be judged by the recognition of the frenchraised iris called chasseur as the best hybrid yellow iris at the iris conference of  in some ways it was an advance on the much older iris mrs neubronner but next year it had to yield pride of place to the american skekinah and that in turn gave way to its child called amber one of the late w r dykess early attempts at the production of a fine yellow flowered varietya later attempt by the same hand yielded the fine iris which was thought worthy to be called after its raiser it has not however quite fulfilled the hopes of those who saw it in its initial stages for it cannot apparently rid itself of a smudge of purple that haunts the petals of some of the blooms and is thereforenot that desir able flowera true self this is probably due to the chilly weather of the late springs of the last few years for irises are plants of the sun but the standard is now so high that the slight blemish in a plant that in other ways comes near perfection lowers its worth for experts the de fection of this iris however can cause but temporary disappointment for rivals are coming fast the french eclador and pluie dor of last year are rungs on the ladder to perfection and the iris called after mr g p baker who has done so much for the genus is in the right direc tion so is britoness if it can add to its stature when shown two years ago the iris called golden hind should be another step but though it is much nearer than it was  years ago we shall probably have to exercise our patience while the yellow iris is evolved that shall make the same appeal and prove as useful as one of another colour like the old pallida dalmnaticaour iris raisers are often advised to take a hint from their american rivals but except in the californian hybrids of iris mesopotamnicaand these are halfhardy we have nothing to learn from the new world the climatic conditions here are probably unlike those in other countries where the june bearded irises are planted and are more difficult for the cultivator last year and the year before the after math of winter was prolonged into early summer and the wonder is that garden irises came out of the harsh trial so wellit is probable that in damp dull weather such as prevailed in the home counties in april may and june and up to about the end of july of last year the rotting of the fleshy rhizomes of irises is unavoidable however good the cultiva tion but some hybrids seem more prone to the disease than others just as the madonna lily seems more prone than other lilies to leaf spot diseasc botryiis and this may be due to some inherent weakness in one of the parents of the hybrid much the same weakness is noticeable in hybrids of the austrian briar rose and however lovely the offspring may be of parents that are known to be constitutionaily defective an embargo should be placed on their use as progenitors of hybrids
