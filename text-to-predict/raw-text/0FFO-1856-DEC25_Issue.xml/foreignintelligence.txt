prussian army to be put in movement it is said on the d of january consists of  men andthe swiss cannotbut feel hiphly flatteredl at being thus treated as a great power  men are i believe about half the regular army of prussia perhaps the kiing is about to take the advice of the asnemblnfaftonaze and issue forth to put down democracy in the other cantons as well sa neuchatel notwithstanding these great pre parations against so small a state it is not con sidered liely that blows wrill be struck the powers ill no doubt step in and devise some mode of effecting an arsangement it is nei ther for the interest of prussia nor indeed of germany in general that anything like a battle for  nationalities should begin just at this moment negotiations are not yet entirely over and all hope hasnot vanished of bringing them to a favourable conclusion notwithstanding the irritation felt by the swiss against prussia and theemperornapoleon they had confidence in him but the feeling is much weakened they say that he had many ways of paying court to the king of prussia without wound ng the ariotrpropre of the swiss and it is doubt fu whether even a visit from rederick william to the tuileries is sufficient compensation for the aliena tion of switzerland how the solution is to be effected i cannot say perhaps by lettinge out all the prisoners on bail as has been done with a few this would not decide the question of right on either side but it might answer a temporary purposethe powers that signed the protocol of  can hardly allow matters to proceed to an extremity the rights shadowy as they are of the king of iprussia were admitted by that instrumnent bat eis miajesty engageed not to employ other measures to enforce them the annex ato the mmoire of the swissgoverunment gives the

defined by the treaty of vienna of the th of june  atnd which while sanctioning the reunion of that territory to the helvetic confederation as a canton recognized in favour of his ajesty the king of prussia anterior rights of sovereignty the exercise of which remains now sus pendedl the minister of prussia while claiming the coopera tion of the other four great powers for the amicable settle ment of this question declared that if a protocol were signed in which the rights of his sovereign should be solemnly specified and which should admit the principle of the overtures to be made ia common to the helvetic confederation the existence of such an instrument should dispense his majesty the king of prussia from obtaining those rights by the employment of other means the four plenipotentiaries consulted hastened to render homage to the sentiments of moderation which inclined his majesty to choose in these circumstances the medium of diplomatic intervention to attain the object he proposes and have unanimously recognized the rights which belong to him in theprincipalityof neuchiteland county of valanginlaccording to the tenour of the d and th articles of the treaty of vienna and which have coexisted from  to  with those which the th article of the same instru ment confers on switzerland they have in consequence expressed in the names of their governments the desire of responding to the appeal which his majesty the king of prussia has made to them agreeing that the four powers come to an understanding as soon as possible to accomplish the measures most proper to induce the
