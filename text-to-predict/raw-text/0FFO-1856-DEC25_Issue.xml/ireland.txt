hardly anything more thanj momentary and while it exsisted it was ascertained that the stockof bullion available was nearly treble what was necessary to meet the required demand a letter dated yesterday from clonmel saysthe wild monetary panic as destructive in its effects on a healthy spirit of enterprise as the fatal famine which forced so many to the verge of ruin while to others it left neither heritage nor home has completely ceased and after a reck less rush for gold which was very easilv met leaving a large and overwhelming surplus on hand at the bank confidence in our chief banking establishments has been restored it is worthy of remark that in tipperary in which the run first began it died out on friday morning and about  in gold remained as a surplus to the credit of the branch at the close of the panic in this town during three days about  in gold was paid out and the large sum of  in sovereigns arrived on saturday mnorning from dublinthe limerick reporter is at a loss for any conjec ture which might explain the origin of the panic and remarks it spread au over the county of tipperary into ilitchelstown in the county of cork and into limerick and notvwithstanding the immediate pressure thus thrown upon the bank it is pleasant to observe that in every instance the demands of depositors and of noteholders were promptly met and those who sought for gold had no difficulty whatever in obtaining it we hear that some of those who obtained gold for their deposit receipts and notes took a speedy and dangerous course in the way of melting the precious metal in mountain dew and in showing their devotion to bacchus by which they at once came under the surveillance of the lightfingered gentry who soon eased them of their precious burden in tipperary we have heard that a countryman whohad just got  sovereigns on his deposit receipt changed one of them and began to drink and when he awoke fom the stupor of whiskey he found to his inexpressible dismay that not one of the sovereigns had been left him so it has been we learn in several other instances yesterday in cashel thurles tipperary c the demand was exceedingly small and the panic may now be said to have blown over and mens minds to be at restfrom the kilkennsy moderator of yesterday it appears that the panic which spread from tippe rary had not subsided throughout the county of kilkenny as speedily as was thought on saturday an absurd fantasy of the kind usually spreads among the ignorant peasantry with the rapidity of the  blessed turf and continues to go on till reason begins again to assert its sway during saturday there was a smart rui confined entirely to the lower classes on the three banks of our city the greatest pressure naturauy being on the nkational as it was with the branch of that bank in tipperary that the movement commenced however it caused no inconvenience anywhere as all demands for gold were readily and cheerfully met and at the bank of ireland and provincial offices full confidence in the sta bility of the national was shown by the payment of goldfor any notes of the latter bank offered there this bad a very excellent effect and tended much to put an end to the panic which however had not quite disappeared on monday as some persons at the fair of bennettsbridge refused to re ceive notes and gold had to be sent for into town but yes terday the business at the banks was restored to its ordinary character and the run seemed to have altogether subsided among us we could not but admire the cheerfulness with which all demands for gold made by the illadvised people vwere met by the officers in each of the banks and when the pressure was greatest at the natsonal it was particularly remarkable and most admirable but owing to the preparations made for the occasion no inonvenience was felt the manager was most efficiently aided when the call was greatest by alderman e smithwick local director who by paying outside the counter and having a joke for every one despatched the applicants in his usual pleasant manner and ptevented delay occurrinp to any clainant depositors were all regularly paid their in terest without the usual ten days notice being requlired on sunday mr costellcoe of the national brought down from dublin  in sovereignsthe weight of which broke down the jaunting car which he took from the railway to the bankoffice on monday a large quantity of gold ar rived at the provincialoffice here and the bank of ireland took similar precautions against any necessity which might arise bat w e believe all this specie may be sent back to haaduarters at once as there appears to be no further occasion for it herethei broadstone uystimyas every sane person might have surmised with out any sulspicion of sorcery the arrest of the person accused of the broadstone murder was a mistake mr michael george harrington has been turned out of the dock there not being a particle of evi dence to warrant the magistrates in sending the case before a commission grand jtury and the only effect of the whole proceeding may be set down as a loss of so many days to the police in their chase after the real culprit for while the inquiry into this palpable sham was pending the hands of the au thorities were in a measure tied up and as another consequenceof no importance howeverthere has not been the shadow of a rumour since saturday last of any fresh evidence tending to fix the guilt upon the party or parties o long under the surveillance of the police the latter re sumed operations yesterday and the investigation at the broadstone terminus is said to be proceeding with its wonted though silent activity the attor neygeneral is constant in his attendance by the way it has been stated that this functionary has had but little experience in criminal cases and that in this respect mr fitzgerald is not the right man for the matter in hand the allegation is not well founded indeed it is quite contrary to the actual fact for years back and long before he had at tained a firstrate position at the irislh bar there was no criminalhtial of consequence on the tiun ster circuitof wllich subsequently he became the leaderin which his services were not eagerly secured by the crown his tact and judgment in the most intricate cases of this kind often leading to con victions where the evidences of guilt to a more superficial mind seemed incomplete and inconclu sivein the afternoon of yesterday it was reportedwith even more than the usual amount of confidence that many hours would not elapse before al arrest of a longsuspected person would be effected but up to this morning everything remains in stcdu quo and there is no allusion whatever in the papers to war rant the belief that any sulch step is in present con templation it is understood that the railway com pany have offered a sum of  to the mnother and sister of the murdered mar by way of full and satisfactory
