considerable period even in the history of a nationwas the gentleman to whose memory we would fain offer a slight tribute of respect actually en gaged in the alleviation of suffering and in the relief of afflicted humanity to dr paris as is well known in th profeswion andto all persons more intimately acquainted with his career the office of pphysician was no hirelings work to be hurried through for the purpose of accumulat ing a fortune or earning distinction it was the business and glory of his life when but  years of age he com menced his studies for the ardlxons profession on which he was about to enter and followed them up with a zeal in credible in so young a person when he had attained the ripe age of threescore years and ten the old man true to the resolution of the boy voluntarily took upon himself the ardnous duties of president of the medical council of the board of health and withhis own hand wrote the intro ductory report on the cholera of s his personal history may be dismissed in a few brief sentences born at cam bridge as we have said in  he became a member of calus college ia that university and graduated when very young in medicine among his contemporaries he was dis tinguished for the extent and elegance of his classical at tainments the classical tripos was not then in existence and so independently of the exigencies of his medical de gree he had not at the university any opportunity for displaying that fine and intimate knowledge of the writers of antiquity for which he was afterwards so distinguished both in private life and as president of the college of physicians from cambridge he went to edinburb then remarkable as a school of medicine and was the friend and intimate companion of the many celebrated men who in the first years of the

it was his wish to establish himself in the town of penzance in cornwallduring his residence at penzance dr paris distinguished himself as the founder of the royal geological society of corwall this we believe was the first geological society in enlgland when at peniance too he gave to the miners the great boon of the tampingbar tho instrament by which they are enabled to pursue their business amid in flammable gases without the fear of striking fire from the rock by this simple but ndmirable invention dr paris no doubt saved more lives than many heroes have de stroyed in the year  he returned to london and here for  or  years he was actively occupied as a prac tising physician re was elected president of the college of physicians in the year  and this office he held until the hour of his death dr paris was not only known as a physician of the highest eminencehe was as remarkable for his literary ability the life of sir huazphry davy will ever remain one of the classical biographies of the english language in conjunction with ar fonblanque he also wrote the jfcdircaz jurisprudence which has remained a text book with lawvers until our own day his works of a more professional character were his treatise on dict which first brought him into notice and which was pub lished at a very early age his phaionacologia which has raun through more editions than most books and his work on medical chymistry besides these and many other acknowledged publications his philosophy in sport has at tained an enormous popularity and wvith his life the motive for an incognzito which was never really maintained has altogether terminated in so brief a notice as the one to which we are necessarily limited by considerations of space we can add but little more the last ten days of dr pariss life were spent in the midst of excruciating sufferings which were borne with the most remarkable fortitude his chief concere appeared to be to console and comfort those around him who could ill disguise their grief at the impending and irreparable loss hlis intellect remained to the last as clear as at any time of his life and while power of speech remained nobody who listened to him could believe that the end was so near at hand the public and the medical profession have suf fered a great loss in the death of john ayrton paris one of the most disinterested honourable and able men who have ever practised the profession of medicine the grief of his own family and of those whom he honoured with his friendship is not matter of public concern save in so far as it may showv ho this wise and good man was honoured and beloved by those who knew him best
