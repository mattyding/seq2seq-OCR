jessie cameromat this particular season a pretty and pleasing story obtains a sort of immemorial welcome and accordingly lady rachel butler taking advantage of the occasion has just published a little highland tale bearing the name of its heroine ycsse cameron the scene of its plot is one of the glens in invernessshire where the widow cameron with her daughter jessie and her two sons john and donald are living as cottiers in a style of humble comfort john is working at the trade of a mason and jessie tends the house the kailyard and the cows while donald the younger son has a thoughtless predilec tion for the company of poachers and illicit distillers which causes jessie and her mother considerable anxiety jessie is the model of a  leal scotch lassie industrious and cheery with a large provision of songs and ballads and a great capacity for reel steps and flings she is the good angel of the cameron household but at the same time is half engaged to cherish on her own account one allister stuart brother to the bailiff of the neighbouring laird of flunerdie and like his brother in the lairds ser vicethe story opens with a wedding between two of their neighbours who are about to set out with a party of friends for australia at this weddino the camerons are present with allister also and donald cameron there again meets with the companions who had previously enticed him on their poaching expedi tions the wedding festivities help to confirm the attachment of allister and jessie but unfortunately afford donald an excuse for slipping away with thle campbells into the lairds deer forest with the object of getting a shot at a stag the stag is just dead and gralloched when the lairds head keeper lauirie and his men are discovered to be after them in their flight they have to cross a deep and rapid stream where one of the party is mvith difficulty rescued bv donald and through the delay thus occasioned the keepers comeup with them donald is discovered and excited by his rage at iauries taunts he discharges his gun at him and leaves him for dead ee is thereupon carried off and concealed by his companions in a re tired whisky bothy in the hils where he has an op portunity of seeing a gauger adroitly trapped by the gil who is left in charge of the materials this episode has not however any influence on his for tunes for the pursuit after him continues so keen that his friends are compelled to help him out of the country by substituting him for one of the propos ing emigrants to australia his parting from his mother and sister who visit him in his retreat is told simply and pathetically and after this he is of little consequence in the storyin the meantime allister makes definite proposals to jessie and john cameron becomes interested in the village beauty bell milherson who as he wasnot already on ner staff of admirers resolves to make a conquest of him to prove her power but proves instead her own susceptibility the follow mng is the old story in its process of develop mentone night when aunt eppy had gone out and the farmer was asleep in his armchair bell sat looking at the glowing peats with her hands folded and such a thoughtful expression on her face that john cameron could not help stopping on his way through the kitchen to ask her if any thing had happened to vex her maybe the halloween ploy is no settled as ye like or maybe aunt eppy hasna got ye the braw goon she promised but something fashes you ril wager said john in rather a joking tone the pretty face looked more serious at every word he spoke and it was with an impatient shrug of her shoulders that bell answered  and is it no eneuch to fash me when everybody treats me like a silly bairn thats fit for naething but to get sweeties an

treat me like a bairn if ye will but a bairnie that wad wfillingly be better an wiser pd thank ye to mny deein day and the tears rolled down her cheeks for bell was in earnest comparisons and reflections which had come to her mind as she mused alone had really and sincerely brought on one of her rare fits of humility at that moment nobody would have imagined she was usnauy so very different but would have felt quite sorry forthe little penitentface which looked up at john so piteously i i wad nae mair tell ye a hard thing or makse ye greet than id loup ower rhynie linn said

until a general embroilment takes place through the visit of a captain gordon the brother of the laird of dunerdie captain gordon is a lively and attractive personage who soon steals  the hearts of the maids in thim parts and makes john cameron jealous by his attentions to bell at the same time he spoils allister stuart by taking too much notice of him and his accom plishments and as he suggests at the same time that he allister ought to look higher than jessie cameron a coolness gradually arises which aided by thecounterattractionsof adaznseifrom theowlsflads brings their engagement to a close to the great dis credit of allister the bearing of jessie under his heartless treatment is justly conceived and described feelingly bultwithout exaggeration though she remains unchanged and unconsoled she thus resents in a proper womanly spirit the attempt of allister after hias marriage to renew n his acquaintance with her she was in her garden one sunny afternoon training her favourite
