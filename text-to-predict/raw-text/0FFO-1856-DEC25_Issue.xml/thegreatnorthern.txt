from mr mortimer or xrz redpatb i cannot say i cannot tell whether it wasto be to ne or to mir mortimer i cannot tell whether the stock came from redpath to mr mortimer or to me alt that i know is that rcdpath did transfer  fourand ahalf per cent stock to mr blakeway that gentleman advanced  upon that stock and it went to the credit of the prisoner redpath it was transferred on a s stamp i saw it transferred into blakeways name i do not find a transfer conveying qol to my name i have no doubt that there was such a transfer when a ur chaser was found for that stock  was transferred by blakseway to the purchaser to whom mr mortimer sold it and the other o was delivered hy blakeway to mor tinier according to the instructions received from redpath we sold the stock to messrs iullens

of  throgmortonstreet i have transfer  before me i saw that executed by mr thomas bennett spence and i attested itmtr ciffard said that was all he intended to offer on that case and he should ask for a committal notwithstanding the absence of a witness named boon who would merely prove the attestation to the transfers  and w that witnes he should produceat the trial that was the whole of the cases against redpath and kentmr hawkins said if that was the case he should ask before the committal to have a day set apart to look at tho particular transfers of sidney and hammond at first there was no objection made on the part of the prosecu tion but when mr wontner and himself asked to see them mr giffard started up and said that he would not produce themmir giffard said he must object to such a course being pursued it was quite clear that if there was a further adjournment now although the case was ripe for trial it could not be got ready for trial at the next sessions the prosecution were quite ready to show everything that was proved or that had been adduced in the course of the bearing but a general rummage through the books he would not allow every adjounment of the case incurred a great deal of expensemlr hawkins said he thanked the prosecution for nothing there could be no doubt that a great deal of time had been frittered away by the prosecution and therefore they could not complain of the delay what he wanted was to inspect the several signatures of hammond and sidney which he was of opinion had been most un warrantably refused by the great northern railway and had only been done so for the purpose of frustrating the fair defence of the prisoners hie did not wish for an ad jounmment nor to put the prosecution to any expense he could state that the gentlemen who instructed him would not take any unfair advantage of their inspectionmr tyrw v said he thought he had no power to grant the application and in such a case he ought not to throw out any suggestions for either sidemr hawyins then said he meant to apply that the risoner kent might be admitted to bail whenheapplied oefore he was refused but of that he did not complain because the whole of the evidence was not before the court he was certain that if bail was granted his client would submit to take his trial he was prepared to offer bail to any amount and the gentlemen who would come forward as his securities were men of substance and integrity who felt certain that the prisoner was not guilty of the charges imputed td himiffr tyrwmtt said this was one of the most painful duties a magistrate had to perform when he remembered however that the judges sat overy day in chancerylane he thought he ought not to take the power into his own hands and he must therefore refuso the application he could not say that the case aganst kent had at all improved by the evidence that had been lately brought forwvardmr mould the chief clerk having read over the evidence taken against hogbenmr atterbury was called and examined by hr giffard he saidi produce the stock register no  at page  i find the account of mr hammond and it is credited with the transfers  and  ialso produce the stock register  folio  i find there the account of philip edward blakeway i find that account debited with the same transferscrossexamined by mr sleighthere are several other transfers in the name of mr hammond in the books of the great northern railway i do not think there are so many as  or  but there are a great number to the best of my belief in  and  there are several and some in which mr hammond is the transferrer there are speaking from memory more out of his name than in itmr sleighwere those books acted upon by the com pany mr giffardobectedto this question the books were mr redpaths and he was in the dockcrossexamination continuedthere are five transfers in the name of mr hamnmond in the courtmr wontner said for the information of his learned friend he might say that there were  transfers in and  transfers out of mr hammonds namea long conversation ensued as to the right of mr sleigh to examine five transfers and after mr giffard had ob jected and mr trwmrtt had decided that they could not be produced it was found that they had already been given in evidence and upon mr giffard saying that mr sleigh could see them mr sleigh said he did not want thosehe wanted the others not in courtmr stephen george hammondi have the two transfers last mentioned and they are dated december  the signature of  elammon is not in my handwriting and i never gave any one

redzatbmr giffard said that was the case for the prosecutionmr sleigh then addressed the magistrate for the prisoner hogben and said he was surprisedthat with such materials materials not elicited by evidence but given in the most free and unqualified manner by the defendant himselfhe should have been brought to this court and subjected to all the indignities and an incarceration in a felons cell for the whole night when asked by mr mowatt if the signature to the transfer was his he in the most free and voluntary manner said it was when if he was gnilty the easiest thing for him would have been to throw the burden of proof on the prosecution if ever he felt inclined to go beyond the rules of his profession it was now and to say that the respectable young man at the bar was as innocent of the charge brought against him as the worthy magistrate himself bselieviq implicitly in the word of redpath whose word was aen to be as goodi as his bond and whose transactions in mines and railways amounted to thousands of mounds per month his client had been guiltyof what  iwy only of indiscretion he would ask where was the guilty motive of mr hogben notwithstanding the in fluence of the great northern railway they had not been able to produce one tittle of evidence to show that red path and his client had any connexion together re was not afraid of the case going before a jury but magistrates were not in the habit of sending cases for tri ons specua tionmr tysrvrrt said he was of opinion that the case un fortunately lay within a very small compass but it would be a very pretty thing for a msgistrate to saf that in such a serious case asthat of a transferbeing advisedly done he was not to let the case go before a jury if such  course was adopted it would be most dangerous in a commaercia country suchb as this he would aecept the same bailas before but it was right to state that mr mowatt had on the former occasion nuggested that bail should be takenthe
