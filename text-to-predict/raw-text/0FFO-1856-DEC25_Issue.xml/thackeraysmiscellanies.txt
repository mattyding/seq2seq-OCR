teac oerays misellaxiesin the list of new books of one of our best known circulating libraries and in which all the most popular works are printed in italics we perceive clearly after sundry rubbings of the eyes to make certain that we are not under an optical illusion that  miscellanies by w m thackeray ap pear in unconspicuous roman between the titles of two other works distinguished by the pre ferential type and which by the way we may as well mention aremodern society in bomie and millicent or the trials of life by the author of the curate of overton it has not been our fortune to read either of the works thus empha tically distinguished and they may for all that we know exhibit merits which warrant their place in popular favour but we are strangely at issne with that portion of the pensive pubec which deter mines the verdict of circulating libraries if mr thackerays performances are to be reckoned at their estimate as comparatively trifling achieve ments and are to hold a secondary place in the repertory of british wit and invention in this criti cal phase of the th century we are not going to make a very solemn protest on a point which is too ridiculous to be argued seriously though we shall state our reasons for regarding the trumpet of fame as really to some degree imperfectly tuned in sounding forth the value of ir thackerays pro ductionson more than one occasion we have already dis cussed his characteristics and in reviewing the nev comes we paid him the tribute due to his distin guished genius of trying him bythe highest standards of creative art we are not now concerned with eitner of the greater works by which he is conceived to have determined his position and which the world has generally acknowledged to be vanity fair and the newvcomes but we have here a republication of the sketches ballads and burlesqiues which he has written anonymously many of which came before the eyes of the public while their author was yet an unknown man and which like the sketches of a painter as compared with his finished pictures show the bias of his cha racter and talents in their freshness and untram melled freedom the miscellanies give us thackeray in the rough thackeray in deshabille thackeray in masquerade thackerayin the guise of an anonymous contributor which is nearly equivalent to thackeray in coat armour and they carry us through the entire gamut of his exerciseslight or sober cynical or cheery with increasing light as to his merits and deficiencies it is here that his purpose is most clearly written and here that his outlines are most freely laid here we have him learning labouring striving testing his pinions rising on them some times to heights he has never since surpassed sometimes flagging and falling short of his mark but rarely very rarely failing to interest us unless we fatigue ourselves w ith his occasional repetitions in short if we would study thackeray in all his moodsat all the stages of his literary careerin his various phasesas artist or moralist as man or as workman the best means are these very mis cellaniesyet the conclusions to be drawn from these are at best supplemental to much which has been already said either by ourselves or others wve premise of course that general society or the people who come much in contact with each other and that chiefly in metropolitan circles are the staple subjects of mir thackerays fictions and we have elsewhere remarked the comprehensiveness of this sphere with out importations from outlying districts and that mr thackeray spreads his canvass to represent it as a whole the panoramic plan of mir thackerays workmanship is his primary distinction from other novelists who adhere more closely to the dramatic element of actors and a background a hero and a story in some of mr thackersys novels vanity fair for example it would bhdifficult to say that he had either hero or heroine in all of them these personages are of less importance to us than they are elsewhere they are less in our sight they leave us for longer intervals get out of the way of characters more worthy or more interesting than themselves and afford the barest possible threadfor a story to hang upon if a certain recent theoryof novels be correct that  the first requisite of a novel is that it should be a biography an account of the life or part of tbe life of a person then mr thackerays possessing this requisite in the least degree have less of the essential characteristics of novels than any others which we can call to our recollection perhaps the fact is rather that the novel itself is stretching the bounds of its rigorous definition and in its admitted capacity of the modern epic is ac commodating itself to the growth and variety of modern circumstances the plot in which the hero and heroine are chiefly interested is by their com parative retirement made subsidiary and is sub ordinated as we see to the exigencies of a wider function hence the comparative absence of con tinuity even in mr thackerays most ela borated fictions and hence the fact that his miseellaneous sketches approach so near to them both in their showy and substantial qualities we are looking at so many strips of mr thackerays panoramna and though they are detached though many of them are rough and ragged though they lack the completeness of a sustained exhibition the same qualifications are as liberally displayed as in his more prolonged and ambitious representations the novelist of a grander scale is before us with all his faults and imperfections on his head but with all his merits equally apparent in his fragmentary studies and his finished productions in the segments of his composition equally with its completed spherewhat then is the impression which we conceive indifferently of either and which we submit to the consideration of the gentle readers of the circulating libraries  in the first place that if their grandchildren or remote posterity should desire to see a faithful picture of their age in its external aspects they must seek it in these pages it would he vain to expect that these or any other forms of fictitious narrative should contain a suffi cent record of the serious business of our lives our political literary professional and other labours can only be represented by their actual results while their various processes are quite incapable of being set before us in imaginary descriptions who can paint for who can discern the secreb cares the silent studies the vigils and the toils the sweat and agony of life  these and they are the larger part of the existence of most of us lie altogether out of the novelists domain while their products can be only specified by the bio grapher or the historian if the novelist is restricted to that side of our existence which is patent and social and which lies in the sunlight we have no right to complain that his omission of our se rious business amounts to the offence of a iisuppressio veni he is no more a suppressor of truth in neglecting what does not concern him than the painter or sculptor the musician or actor try him by his metier as a describer of character and man ners with all the license which his fictitious lati tude allows him and accept his contributions of truth quantum valeat try thackeray by this standard and who is more true to the appropriatemanners and characters of his century to whom if he were silent could we look for an equivalenthis nearest competitor mir charles diclens has other gifts and qualifications which it would be out of place to mention here it is not in the least degree necessary to sacrifice one reputation to the other in order to give each of them his due but we may claim for thackerays less extended ob servation juister hues and proportions in the objects it comprises we obtain so to speakl a truer samplea more average sdecimen of the world as it is on the other hand there is no denying the flaws in his workmanship or that it does in some respects exhibit great deficiencies he so rarely sounds the heights and depths of human passion that we may fairly infer its extremes are beyond his grasp we have formerly noted his indifference to the supersensual sphere which is filled with airy conceptions by our dreams and our terrors but we observe that even on the solid earth he shrinks from all excessesall departures from the mean and customary social tendencies of mor tality colonel newcome on the one hand and becky sharpe on the other are the two limits of his scale and it is remarkable how very seldom he ventures to touch even these he has no ideal on which he might lavish his illusions if he had any and no revelations of the vision splendid to faecinate the glowing aspirations of our youth hle is either unable or unwilling to approach the more expansive motions of our nature and if by chance he firnds himself in their vicinity he rides away on his convenient pegasus the best brokenand also the most surefooted quadruped that a nmiddleaged gentleman could desiderate in rotten row account as we may for this literary abstinence there remains the achievement which will carry his name to another age that he has justly estimated the commoner types of his ownand by no mean exertion of invention and wit has invested its ordinary attri butes with pretensions to immortality next to the genius which fashions worlds out of vacuum and which in virtue of its divine likeness peoples them with its creations its tears and hamlets its ariels and its calabans we know of no harder requirement than thisto paint ones own age and to amuse it vastly while painting it so truly as to provide instruction for posterityif therefore thesubscriberstothe circulatinglibra

and see more even in their own hoiiseholds than was previously dreamt of in their gentle philosophy their meannesses and petty vanities are his per petual mark and he would save them from the self

brown jones and robinson degrees be low their true level he will place their follies and fatuities before them in a concrete form which is the only true way of arresting their attention and where the ancient fabulist put saws and maxius into the mouths of the brute creation where the popular preacher and sententious essayist utter their harmless injunctions against abstract failings to a set of

around him whether he has not had considerable amusement and enjoyment in obtaining this knowledge and lastly whether the exposure of the trumpery tricks and vanities resorted to incessantly by himself and others has not induced him to take a higher measure of his dignity as a man at all events our absurdi ties have been skilfully portrayed and the mirror has been fairly held up to the affectations which con tinue even in our day to take the place of nature and if the gentle reader has obtained neither fun nor profit he may rest assured that it is his fault and not mr thackeraysthe world which is thus submitted to a photogra phic process not over favourable is as we have in timated not so narrow as it seems and thus far there is every reason to assign a comprehensive function to mr thackeray as an artist he has himself contended that the materials it affords for satiric observations are absolutely limitless  what is the use of lord rosses telescope i my friend panwiski exclaimed the other day it only enables you to see a few hundred thousands of miles further what were thought to be mere nebulze turn out to be most perceivable starry systems and beyond these you see

inability to look infinity in the face sank back resigned and swauowed a large bumper of clareti who like other great men have but one idea thought to myself that as the stars are so are the snobs the more you gaze upon those luminaries the more you beholdnow nebalouisly congregated now faintly distin guishable now brightly defineduntil they twinkle off in endless blazes and fade into the immeasurable darknes i am but as a child playing on the sea shore some tele scopic philosopheriwill arise one day some great snobonomer to fid the laws of the great science which we are now merely playing with and to define and settle and classify that which is at present but vague theory and loose though elegant assertionin these miscellanies we shall find that at least several series of these social nebulhe are resolved into their true elements  the book of snobs mrs perkinss ball the little dinner at timminss the maemoirs of mr yellowplush and the  diary of jeames accomplish sufficient in this way to make an ample reputation the  letters of mir brown to his nephew on the other hand contain the social arrenge ments which mr thackeray would substitute for those to which he so strongly objects and are in fact the positive pole of his mundane phi losophy here good practical sense assumes the guise of benevolence or it may be that in reality the cynical mask is dropped which was but a badge of the satirists profession at all evens we see a large qualihication in these letters to the cynical aspect of mr thackerays humour and we decline on this occasion to give judgment against him on this point we think we can almost perceive a change in his humour corresponding with different phases of his career and that as he advances he becomes more humane and tolerant one consideration on which we linger for a moment not having quite made up our minds as to its bearing is his thorough appreciation of the manners and customs of children hisgenial interestinthe pro ceedings of the infantine world such as that evinced for example in  the curates walk and his hearty tolerance of the atrocities of small boys in statt pitpialsi are worthy of serious mention by mr thackerays witnesses to character who does not remember that charming little beggar girl in the rose and the ring drawn dancing in jubilation at the princesss present and singing in irresisti ble glee the most appropriate song that ever was put into the mouth of a little childoh what funnico plua bun howm s viit never was donethis child may almost vie with the tear wnich blotted out uncle tobys imprecation in effacing the recollection of some seemingly illnatured passages from the memory of mr thackerays sterner critics a trcop of such children sketched lovingly and ap provingly seem to testify to the latent gentleness of the fogey nature which he himself insisting on the pleasures of fogeydom has described in a spirit worthy of addison and the spectatorif then we here abstain from repeating that mir thackeray is a harsh commentator on human nature we are sure that he has endeavoured to paint it correctly as in his various moods it appeared to him with this object his invention has been called into play and he has designed an infinitenumber of characters of which the remarkable at tribute is this that theyare simultaneouslvtypes and persons here is the marvel on which we formerly remarked and which none of his rivals have come near to imitate so much individuality infused into the representatives of cdass follies vir tues or vices is a proof of ingenuity almost without a parallel we should call it by the higher title of creative power if that phrase were not oidinarily and properly reserved for those works of which mir thackeray has given us but half examples we should remember that he paints the realities of his day more closely and literally than any other novel ist and that as these realities are matters of obser vation for one half his work invention is super fluous he has no need to delve into the depths of his nature or to range abroad in the dim and in definite half his work is done to his hand his subject is before his eyes and he daguerreotypes and then colours and transforms it to his fancy as even among daguerreotypers there is but one fen ton to take the suns affidavit with discrimination and but one lock to colour it when so taken eo here the artists work is even more unique and per sonal heposes his subjects with taste and discern ment in the most characteristic aspects or attitudes he can devise and then by an artful and delicate manipulation he makes a perfect pic ture out of the object presented to him stiu the object was there the materials were under his nose they had the form and pressure with which his representations accorded and he had only the art to render things he could see and by heightening their effect to bring out their signifi cancethis is no doubt tantamount to denying thatmr thackerayhas manifestedinventionof thepurest description and thus much we have already asserted indirectly but assisted by a considerable basis of facts mr thackerays invention is both ready and abundant his imaginative roamings date from may fair and his pegasus goes nimbly in double or single harness we are not forgetting the extraordi nary series of burlesques contained in these volumes and to which bythe way we doubt if english prose can furnish an equivalent in this series of produc tions novels by eminent hands a legend of the rhine rebecca and rowena and the tremendous adventures of major gahagaf there is a strange fertility and splendour of ex aggeration which vie with the imaginative pro ductions they burlesque at the same time alone they are not to be regarded as proofs of imaginative powers for they are imitative and ironical they are simply reared upon another mans foundation and follow its faults and develope its frailties till the edifice topples over by the weight of itsabsurdity thismay be doubtless excellent fun but alone it is no evidence of a creative mind on the contrary it shows a predominance of the critical faculty which has the art of detecting the weak points of an esteemed model and of denoting its weakness by fitting exemplifications a cool and discriminative judgment is at the bottom of this a judgment which may as some rare examples have shown coexist with a plenitude of other capaci ties but which ordinarily keeps a tight curb upon the imagination the possessor of this faculty will be more solicitous to reclaim others to the standard of truth than to soar himself in defiance of its canons he will note the violations of truth in others he will be freely moved by their shams and pretences and he may cap their follies by vagaries more eccentric but we repeat these vagaries are but shadows distorted semblances and mnsubstantial of less account as proofs of an exu berant fancy then as imitative pleas for a return to simple natureaccept them in this light and yet what a talent what a profuse ingenuity and humour they dis play we cannot forego the pleasure of quoting two or three which illustrate as we conceive the critical spirit in which they originate we have had for example in a series of wellknown novels some overlaid pictures of chivalric accoutrements and the following is the style of mr thaclkerays protestthe warrior who bestrode the noble beast was in sooth worthy of the steed which bore him both were capari soned in the fullest trappings of feudal war the arblast themnangonel the denculverin and the cuissart of the

descriptions of military manceuvres and dashing exploits by irish men and horses but what are these to the experience of phil fogarty of the fighting onetyoneth at the great french review in the

man whose very soul was dross and who never had a feeling for the truthful and the beautiful i these and a number of other examples occur in which hlr thackeray seems to show his invention but in which we can only recognize his irony mocking at our departures from artistic truth and proprietyin his more elaborate memoirs of barry lyndonwe have on the other hand some proofs of his creative powers which we do not usually find in these volumes barry lyndon is not a personage of this age he is not underthe influence of modern or customary ideas and though ferdinand count fathom may have helped to form his character he is nevertheless of an original type it was judi ciously conceived to mark the progress of a scamp through his various stages of corruption from boy hood to old age and to make the scamp his own consistent biographer and apologist this is nature in an aspect witlh which we were not familiar or a scamp much more white than he is ordinarily painted on air thackerays showing his hero is set up as a foil to those impossible monsters of perfection whom other writers delight in de scribing and his fate is a setoff to the luck of prince prettyman who is endowed with every mental and bqdily excellence to acquire at the close of his adventures every worldly prosperity barry lyndon like the prince is an adventurer and courageous but he becomes by degrees a gamester and blackleg a bully a duellist a systematic fortunehunter a selfish and shameless rascal whoabuses everybody and ultimately comes to be used up in his turn his own account of his conduct is perfectly natural and almost bespeaks our com miseration for his final ruin it is here that mr thackeray has shown his power in conceiving such a character out of materials which he could have found only in his reading and reflections this is almost pure art without the help of photography or art only assisted by study and learningwe must not quit tho miscellanies without men tioning the songs and ballads which would have made the reputation of aniy other poet by profes sion who can be insensible to the merits of  ithem icdlcuanics prose and verse by w m  thakeraybradbury and evans age of wisdom of the chronicle of the drum i of  bouillabaisse and  the mahogany tree ofpeg of iimavaddy distinguished by the only bit of landscape painting which a far as we re member thackeray has attempted successfuuy and lastly of  the bttle of iimerick the most hromeric performance since homer whenthey smashed the lovely windieshung with muslin from the indiespurahuing of their shindies upon shannon shorethat

lady and how i love her no one knowsher name is nora and the goddess flora presints her with this blooming rosesuch flowers as these are not the produce of a paltry culture or the growth of an arid and ungenerous soilin parting from these miscellranies we are con scious that our comments have been of a nature almost as miscellaneous but they have inadequately conveyed our meaning if they leave the impression that we think otherwise of mir thlackeray than as a great original writer his prominent characteristic we conceive to be truthfulnesstruth to ordinary nature or an art as like nature as the obligations of art will permit the nature he paints is no doubt limited but there is scarcely a limit to his faithful reproductions he combines with a varied power of conception a larger share of the criticalfaculty than we remark in any living novelist and this faculty of judgment saves min from extrava gance and utilizes his powers without overflow or waste so cool and just and temperate a guide is a rare coadjutor to inventive faculties it makes them comformable to the average tastesto the com mon standard of the world and of society and it stamps their coinage with a sterling value which should rightly give it universal currency
