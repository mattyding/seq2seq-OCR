was instituted in the year  against david murray late treasurer of the corporation of berwick and his three sureties for an account of the moneys received by david murray during his tenure of office and for payment of the sums unaccounted for by him it appeared that the surety bond in question was executed in january  and by it the defendants w murray j c renton and j j oswald bound themselves to make good any deficiency in david murrays accounts to the extent of  during his continuance in the said office in consequence of his election or under any annual or other election to the said office at the time of david murrays election to the office of treasurer in  the corporation under the municipal corporations act  could only elect a treasurer for one year but by a statute passed in the year  the corporation were empowered to elect one during pleasure davidmurraywasreelectedia that year and aiscnarged in the year  when it was found that he was a defaulter to the extent of  upon the sureties beinz pressed to make good that amount theyinsisted that the actof  altered the nature of the office of treasurer and consequently released them from their suretyship some time previous to his loss of office david murray deposited in the hands of his surety w murray a sum of  and in the year  a supplemental bill was iied by the corporation claiming that suum as forming part of their moneys received by david murray this claim was resisted on the ground that the   was david murrays own money and had been placed by him in w murrays hands to cover his liability as suretv after various proceedings in the vicechancellors courts  the lords justices in a  directed the question of the sureties liability to ho tried at law and in the meantime the  to be brought into court by w murray three actions were accordingly brought one of which was tried twice over and they resulted in favour of the corporation the matter was ten carried to the court of error the echequer chamber and afterwards to the house of lords and in both appeals the corporation were successfal in the meantime w murray and j c penton have died and the suits now came on for the decision of this court as to the ownership of the ot and for determining the important question of who is to pay the enormous costs in curred both at law and in equity a point was also raised on behalf of the defendants that the suits were defective by reason of there being no representative of renton before the courtthe lord cmancellor first went through the facts roved in the original suit and stated his impression from them to be that the plaintiffs were entitled to a declaration that there was due to them from david murray the sum of  is d which he would be ordered to pay together with the costs of that suit as to the sureties who were parties tothe bill there would be uoorder for them to pay either the costs of the original hearing or the rehearing in  he next came to the supplemental suit and after analyzing the et idence very fully stated his conviction to be that the inference was irresistibly in favour of the  being the money of the corporation which had come to the hands of david murray in his character of treasarer he had come to the conclusion that the money was earmarked from the fact that the first accounts opened at the bank by david mlurray were confessedly opened with the money of the corporation and the last account formed of the  was nothing snore than a continuance of the former accounts moreover that view of the case was strengthened by considering the circum stances of david mfurray at the time and his conduct since when he wzas guilty of ranning away the first point therefore vwoud be decided in favour of the plaintifs and the only other question to be considered was whether william murray at the time he took the deposit note for  was aware that it fozmed part of the corporation funds his lordship referred to the answer of william murray denying all knowledge of the fact and after alludini to the circumstance that david murray had de posited the money in his daughters name instead of his own which was ixown to william hmurray said such a proceeding alone was sufficient to arouse suspicion in an honest mans mind and to suggest an inquiry wil liam murray took no step whatever to satisfy himself as to the real ownership of the  and he must therefore be treated as if he had received notice that it belonged to the corporation the decree in the supplemental suit would be against dobree and carstairs the executors of william murray with costs with directions to the master in taxing the cost to look carefullv to the plead dings as it ha boen alleged that they were unnecessarily prolix the whole decree would be as followsdeclare thatdavid

the time when it was paid into court and the plaintiffs are to he at liberty to take out execution on their judgments at law to satisfy the balance due from david mirray and the cos at law let so much

the supplemental suit be paid bv tho miaintift o bo bopmia to them by the executors of wnvuam murray and direct the taxing master in taxing the costs of all parties to disallow whatever parts of the pleadings and evidence he may consider to be unnecessary mis lordship was also of opinion that there should be a personal representative of renton before the court and the case was directed to he in the paper on the first day of heiary term to supply such deficiencysalssox v snnsasonthis was an appeal from a decree of vicechancellor stuart the testator in the cause left the whole of his real and personal estate to his widow whom he also appointed executrix of his will the property bequeathed both real and personal was of considerable value and the widow only srvived her husband two days it appeared that the testator had mortgaged his real estate and the question raised by the pre t suit was whether such mortgage was to be paid out o the personal estate of the testator or to con tinue a charge upon the realty in other words whether the heir of the testatrix took the estates cum oazere or was entitled to have the mortgage debt paid out of the per sonalty  the point cannot arise again as the legislature last session enacted that the debts of a testator are to be borne rateably by his real and personal estates unless a contrary opinion appear by his will the vicechancellor following a long current of authorities beginning with  scott v beecher  mad held that the real estate was bound to bear its own burden from this decision the defendant the heiratlaw appealedthe lord chacnlior reiterated what he stated on the hearing of the appeal that he was not at all inclined to disturb the law as laid down by sir john leach  years ago and followed by various learned judges including lord lyndhurst that mortgages under such circumstances as existeed in the present case were primarily a charge upon real estate the appeal must be dismisind with costswebb v kirbythis was an appeal frorm a decree of vicechancellor stuart ordering specific performance of a contract for sale the facts were that john holloway deceased by his will dated in december  directed that at the decease of his wife and brother all his ro rty including certain lease holds at tottenham shoud re sold by his executors and an equal division of the proceeds made among his eight children the will also provided that the receipts of his said executors should be full and sufflcient discharges to anypurchaser or purchasers whatever the testator died in march  and in the june following the wil was proved by his widow and her coexecutors in july  the widow having survived the testators bro ther and also her coexecators died whereupon the direction for sale of the testators property came into operation under the provisions of his will the sole next o kin as well to the testator as to his wife at her death was their only survivin son alfred holloway then and still residing in canada west in october  letters of administration de bonis non with the said will annexed were granted by the prerogative court of canterbury to jamnes alden webb to whom they were addressed as  the lawful attorney of alfred holloway the son and one of the resduary legatees named in the will of john holloway and constituting him the administrator  of the goods chattels and effects of the said deceased left unadminis tered for the use and benefit of the said alfred hollo wy now esiding in canada west and uiitil he shall day apply for and obtain letters of administration of theainadministered goods of the said deceased to be granted to him  such letters being in the usual form of letters ofadnminitration de bonis nons cure testamneto amnneodurante absentid j a webb in september  put up the leaseholds at tottenham for sale by public auction subject to certaix conditions whereby the sale was stated to be  by order of the executors the defendant havivg become the purchaser refusea to complete his purchase on the ground that webb as administrator durantc atsentilcolda not mlake a good title and thereupon wyebb instituted the present stut for specific performance of the contract for sale the vicechancellor made a decree in conformity with the prayer of the bill and condemned the defendantthe lorn cnawteaor said the first question to be determined was whether an administrator dcurante absentid had power to sell leaseholds and make out a good title upon that point he was of opinion that such an adminis trator could make out a good title orovided that at the time he sold the leasehold the person forwhons he was acting was alive such an authority was within the scope of the grant which recited that it was for the use and behoof of he absent party until he should apply for administration although however a good title might he made out hethe lord chancellor thought thabt it was not such a title as a purchaser could be compelled to accept lvion cstat that at the time o the sale the grant of administration was of any effect for if the absent party happened at that time to be dead the authority of the admnimstrator durantc absentid would also be dead this appeared to him an insuperable obection tothe title but evei if it were not so the plaintiffhadnot madeout any case for specific performance inasmuch as the cestuiqe trusts were no parties to thesale the conditions stae that the sale was by the executors of johnholloway snd if it had been so there would have beennoneces for the concurrence of the ceztuiquu trusts th� fact how ever was that it was not the executors
