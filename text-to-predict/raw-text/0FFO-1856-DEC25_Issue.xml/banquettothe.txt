and in doing so paid a high tribute to the zeal and assiduity of his colleague cheva lier pappalardo lie said from the lengthened period that he bad bad the honour of being american consul at south ampton and places adjacent he had had an opportunity of fonning an opinion of the english character and therefore he was not at all surprised at the manner in which they had received the pledge of affection on the part of the govern ment and people of the united states cheers although it had fallen to the happy lot of america to in augurate this auspicious event in the annals of na tions he bad no doubt that had the relative positions of the two countries been changed erg land would have done just as they the ailuericeans bad done loud cheers  and she had no greater wish than for some

rejoiced when she heard of the increase of british prosperity and the extension of the british empire in legitimate directions the world was large enough for both nationsto fulfil their respective destinies without coming into conflict with each other prolonged cheering the east seemed peculiarly englands sphere of action while the west would appear to be the sphere in wbich america rather than england should exercise the influence which the anglosaxon race had never failed to exercise among a semnibarbarous people or over un developed countries at all events it was their duty to cherish the present kindly feelings existing between them to avoid all talk of war and to be chary of each others honour and feelings as they would of their own for hard words too often led to hard blows cheers when he heard the possibility of a war between the two countries the idea appeared to him to he so unnatural that he found himself repeating with the transposition of a few words an old nursery rhyme as familiar on their side of the atlantic as on this and it might not be inappropriate on the present coccasion to repeat themlet dogs delight to bark and bite ym rodhathrmade them solet turks and russians growvl and fight for tis their nature tobut anglosaxons should never lettheir angry pasaions risetheir great big hands were never made  to tear each others eyescheers and laughter he mr croaslkey recom mineded both english and american mothers to adopt this version in teaching their children as a war between eng land and america would be so dire a catastrophe that it would be
