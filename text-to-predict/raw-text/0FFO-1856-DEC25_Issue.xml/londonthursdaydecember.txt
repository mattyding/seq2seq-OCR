london thursday decembr  it seems that at last the visit of the emperor of austraia is about to produce some favourable effect on the minds of the italians the last news from venice represents the great body of the people as every day more inclined to receive the emperor and exrress with respect and loyalty the eiprror has been during his visit busily engaged in official business and his activity his personal inspections of the various departments and his expressed wish to advance the interests of the city have made a deep impression on the venetians who were accustomed to a very different estimate of imperial personages it appears also that neither the municipality nor the people have forgotten to avail themselves of such an opportunity as the presence of an emperor venice has long considered its interests sacrificed to the advance nrment of trieste a city of austrian sympathies and in close connexion with provinces firmly attached to the empire how far the ancient mistress of the adriatic may have ground for complaint it is difficult to say probably the increased size of modern ships and the consequent insufliciency of the water at venice may have as much to do with the decay of trade as any antipathies on the part of the ruling powers however the civic authorities are asking favours and concessions and as for the people there is said to be no end to the petitions on all sorts of subjects which are daily sent to the impe rial residence or forced on the elnvrprop on his visits to public places though the bigher classes are less demonstrative there is not so much of that determined withdrawal from the imperial circle aswas expected the venetian aristocracy have at length begun to find their way to court and it is said that a far better ieeling pre vails now than some three weeks since in the approaclung visit to lombardy report says that a similar success is expected the reception may be at first cold but it is thought that after a short sojourn of the court the milanese people will take some steps to meet the conciliatory attitude which the feeling or policy of their sovereign has prompted him to assunmewe need not say how heartily we welcome any thing which seems like a promise of tranquillity and goodwill in this unhappy country for years europe has been divided into two hostile camps gathered under the banners of absolutism and liberty england has been neutral in act for that is her policy but a strong partisan in sympathy for a love of liberty always and everywhere is her most fixed principle yet what has been the result liberty has fallen wherever it has struggled with despotic power there is the fact we may explain it how we can constitutional government was the prize of much popular toil and heroism where is it now  not to speak of the great empires with theircentralizedmili tary monarchies let uscome to smallerstates and we shall find the reaction in favour of absolute govern ment going on unchecked wlhen even suchi countries as hanover and wurtemberg are now again subjected to the almost uncontrolled will of the sovereign who can wonder that the queen of spant and the king of naples should be able to bid defiance to the liberals of their dominions  similar is the fate of the struggles between race and race englishmen have been profuse of symu pathy for the nationalities but vith little result the word is now almost obliterated fiom the voca bulary of the continent there are no longer nations there are only states both the inde pendence of the man and the independence of the race are broken down from one end of europe to the other in fact scientific warfare and the vast centralization military and civil of the continent have choked liberty the people of the continen t acquiesce and their rulers reward acquiescence with reasonable care for the material pro gress of their respective dominions the mlinister of works and his subordinates find the people roads and railways bridges and steamboats and the people eat and drink buy and sell marry and are given in marriage with every day less care for the political concerns of europe in spite of the speeches of refugees we may see clearly what is before our eyes over the continent a tranquillity prevails which may be content or may be torpor but which in any case forbids expectation of political change n ever was there a time when a movement against the great established governments would meet with so few supporters never as we see from passing events did the military powers deem them selves so secure and so able to threaten with im punity the two or three narrow districts which still dare to harbour liberty let us then recognize our illsuccess and learn to moderate our wishes those who dream of regenerated nationalities must wait perhaps for ever certainly for the presentit is with the present that we wish now to concern ourselves and reflecting on the state of the italian people we cannot but hail with joy the prospect of improvement though it be the gift of an absolute sovereign and carried out by the old apparatus of the bureau supported by the bayonet if the hatreds of so many years can be removed let no one quarrel with the means if the austrian can attach these provinces by the bonds of goodwill no stranger has a right to demand more nor do we look upon the gift of material prosperity as an unworthy bribe from a sovereign to his subjects if lom bardy and venice under the influence of in creasing trade and enlarged conununications forget the bitterness of late years there will be enough gained to be thankful forenough to make a bright contrast with the dark and unset tled presentwve may therefore duly acknowledge the sound policy shown by the emperor of austrna during his stay in venice to attach the italians to the throne must be the chief object of a viennese statesmans policy the discontent of italy alienates the sympa thies of england and has before now excited the ambition of france to speak of our owrn country it is undoubtedlthat thestate of italy has been the chief cause of the illfeeling with which the austrian government has been regarded by the great body of the people england has politically every reason to desire that austrian power should be strong and stable the two nations have no rivalries no point on which they could come into hostile contact on the other hand it requires no deep diplomacy to perceive hlow valuable to england is the alliance of a great state in central europe military anid yet not aggressive admirably placed as a barrier to invasion on either side the natural protector of divided germany italy and turkey english politicians can have no objectionto see austria a great vleliterranean or a great danubian powerv but as long as the voice of italy is heard in sullenness or lamentation all good feeling between the two states is impossible ry redressing the wrongs of lombardy and venice by having regard to the feelings of a quickwitted and sensitive people by re forming administrations which are notori ously corrupt and tyrannical by restoring the trade of decaying towns relaxing passport restrictions facilitating communication lightening an inordinate taxation putting a check on official insolencein short by taiing away legitimate causes of discontent austria may hope to make the body of the people contented and per haps the next generation loyal if the emperor franicis josjpn has visited italv with a steadfast purpose of conciliation we wishi hima success in the present difficulties of europ e it caunot be denied that the austrian governmenahas stoodl by our own with a firmness on which we had little reason to count to the united action of the two powers it is due that thle treaty of peace is likely to be fully executed and a scandalous volation of good faith exposed and reprobated nothing would tend more to the consolidation of this iuion so adlvan tageous to europe than the prospect that at last the italian people should be contented or at least should have no just cause of discontent
