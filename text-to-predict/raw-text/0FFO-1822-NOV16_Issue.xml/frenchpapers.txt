french paperslfrom the jourrnal des delats of wednesdav irhe grand question of war with spain still remains undecided it must remain so during some time from its own nature and cir cumstances which have come to our lnowledgeour private letters from verona dated the th inst and none of a more recent date have been received affirm that up to that dsy nothing had been decided at conzress relatively to spain no decla ration had been resolved upon  no ltinmatum sent to madridneither was there the slightest appeatance of the dissolution of the congressagvices from madrid of the th inst which we hare this dav re ceived are of a less alarming character ae regards the princes of spain lhe supreme tribunal charged to examine the preliminary proceedings respecting the movements of the th of julv has de clared that the fiscal in demanding the impeachment before the military tribunal of the late mlinisters and of other distinguished personagep carried his zeal too far and that only  officers of the guard who were taken with arms in their hands are to he tried before the said tribunal the same letters announce that efforts are suc cessfully making to approximate the three parties into which the cortes are divided vizthat of the present ainistry or the fixulladvs of the th ofjuty that of arguelles and other members of the cortes of cadiz and that of the peraons who with forillo andl martinez de la rosa believe some modifications of the constitu tion possible at a future period when they might not appear to be provoked by foreign menaces in general there were symptoms of a retum not certainly towards moderation but towards lets exaggeration wve have said that the violence alone of the preponderating party in the cortes could force france to a war againms spain the revolutionary axe raised over the head of a bourbonwould not allow a royalist mllinistry to calculate either the interests or even the chances of success honour that supreme arbiter would impe riously require a sudden effort which would at least testify our firm disposition to oppose eurselves to the crime even though we could not successfully accomplish the object u ho on seeing a bro thier thus surrounded by assassins on the point of perishing by their poniards would not fly to iiis aid wihhout catlculating whether the proceeding might not accelerate the fatal blowbut exclutively of this extreme case wtich now seems to be re moving who can doubt tiat france ought to make everv effort toavoid and to prevent a war against spain  we wiil not here re i peat the irrefragable arguments by which we have showr tiat between two independent nations the right of arrned intervention can i not be founded upon the circumstance that one cf them should have adopted a bad constitution so lon as she dots not atternit to impoce it upon other nations we will only obseive that the danger resulting to france from the existence of the detests ble constitution of the cortes is nothing in comparison to the danger which would rcsult from the admission of a right with which any congress might be vested of supreme control over existing constitutions legally and dipiomatically recog nized for in orter to make us comlbat the pernicious principles of the spanieh constitution our love for our legitimate kings our at tachment to the charter the tranquil enjoyment of all our liberties under an able government under the guarantee of a national representation and under that of the liberty of the press are quite suflicient nvith these elements of order peace and stability france has notbing to tenr fromi the example of a constitution whicll hitherto has produced no fruit calculated to seduce even the most ardent minds nothing on the contrary ca guarantee the tranquillity of france and of all western europeif the powers of eastern europe so different from us in laws manners and institutions possessed a recognized right to interfere in our internal constitutional regime this confusion of the riglhts of sovereignty would be an inexhaus tible source of disquietude agitations and even of wars we believe that france as well for her interest as for herx honour cannot too firmly oppose a system of interference jounded upon this false basishlhere is another special interest for france which is the preser vation of the sceptre of spain in the hands of a dynasty allied to the blood of our kinggs and naturally disposedl to cultivate those relations of friendship between spaniards and frenchmen wbich their reciprocal situation renders so beneticial statesmen will un derstand us when wc say that the armed intervention of the powers of the north and of the centre ot earope in the affairs of the peninsula might perhaps lead to chances still less favourable to the maintenance of the bourbont on the throne than the present state of things fears may be entertained of combinations of events whicli would induce a spanish party to call in a foreign dynasty whose establishment at aladridt would change the equilibrium of the south of europe to the particular detriment of france if we were to speak unreservedly of the past this observation would appear more important  but we wish to avoid every thing which may tend to wound the feelings of respectable governments another fatal chance and to which we can allude without circumlocution would be to throw spain into the arms of the new hispanoamerican republics which would give birth to an immense federation to a new political world and to subversions of interets ard connexions which no human reason cin calculatehfere then are additional reasons for lesiring that this incalcu able war may not break out but of what weight are reasons  all that we can promise our rcaders is that they shall be in possession of events as they arisefrom thc constintionnelbetween two and three oclock on tuesday afternoon the syndie of the exchangeagents appeared on the exchangeand declared that the news from spain was more favourable that it was ascertained that the infants of spain would not be put on titeir trial for the affair of july  and that even an amnesty was granted to all those who bad been accused in consequence of the events of that laylightning is not more rapid than was the effct of this semiofficial communication the funds immediately rose to  and after the exclange they were in demand at  sucl is the most striking answer to all the adtventurers of counterrevolution who for eight days hatl been utteting crics for war and who rejected all peace with spain as a concession to liberal principlesbut this was not enough  the ftoilc of tuesday evening obliged to beat a retreatinstead of secretly devouring the humiliation to which its retrograde march reduced it still ventures to insult the constitu tionalists who have always considered war as a scourge fur france and who have dared even under the harassing firc of daily prosecu tions to maintain that peace was a blessingwe have receiyed today by express news from madrid up to the th at noon and the amnesty spoken of is not then announced all that we learn from them after asi attentive reading of the most ardent speeches in the cortes is that the names of the king and of the princes were never once mentioned in these political discussions it is only from certain french journals such as the eboilc that we learn that there was ever any question of implicating them in any legal proceedingwe are farhowevor from wishing to rejcct any news announcing a sincere reconciliation among the spanish patriots the constitu tionalists at all times bave been equally opposed to ministerial despot ism absoiute power or the inquikition they are therefore all equally odious to the ranatical advocates of counterrevolution and tlte very dlviviong which have broken out in spain are perhaps the work of mnn who can no more pardon the friends of the constitu tion of  than the framers of it in  for the rest the etoilc which two daya ago was boasting that the rebels of utrgel were figuring in its ranks annotnces today as a verv fortunate event that the judicial prosecutions in spain would be directed againit none but the il military taken with grrns in iheir handswhat appears to us equaly probable with the news from spain is that thc asews from verona of the th of novernber does not confirm all those hostile symptoms that were believed to exist or that were wishedto exist in the private letters of october mxoreover we had asserted that the rumour of rar had depressed public creditthat a single pacific word would promptly recver it our adversaries on the contrary maintained that war would raie the funds they have called for war with tll their heart we have protested against it with all our strengthlet the world now

pronouncing on the merits or al garellvt here the contsfiuinned gives a brief but accurate abstractof the report which wii be found more fally in our article under the head of  spainive see with pleasure that cur adversaries hitherto so bard to be pleased and in a piece of this hind a motive for concord betvreen the two countries the very idea of which a few days ago was criminal in their eyes we are not accustomed to see their humour so easy and accommodating and we sincerely congratulate them on a conversion which we were far from expecting to conclude a private letter which has just been communicated to us and which comes from good autbority would lead us to presume that certain preten sions on alajorca sufficiently disagreeable to a great maritime power have no less contributed to these pacific news than the disgrace of the fiscal of miadridwe are asscured that explanations have been demnanded od the subject of the expression ncgency of spain used in speaking of th ouvrard loan now the rougemont loan seeing that the french government hitherto has recognized but one government in spain the royal government at madridconxtsitutiou nclfrom the journsr de patisian official

the loan was  millions of hard piastrs the pi aqter of sf c it migrht at first be supposed that the nens of the eonclusion of such a lon was well calculated to give consistency to the reports which have been circulated for many days but hitherto nothing ltas occurred to prove that the loan has been completed it is only certain that an appeal has been made zo the canitalists and it mav be supposed that ther taking a lesson from the account of the changes will demand guarantees of repayment more certain tlarn the triumpbant bulletins of the regency of urgel which represent ed castelfolit to be an impregnable position as lone as it was not attacked and who now that it has been tamen by the troops of the king of spain dedare it to be an unimportant placewe are fully persuaded that the proposed loan is not fupported by any official guarantee because in fact no pledge of that nture could be given by asy constitutional government before the cham bers had assembled atd the budget had beeni voted and on the other hand there is not the same security in the guarantee of an absolute government therefore lhe prospectus of m ouvrard appears to us liliely to experience

the dupes whom they have made may thank them for the loss of their monev the vic lence of the journal de debat is abated and the constitutional writers who never ceased to rely upon the wisdom of the
