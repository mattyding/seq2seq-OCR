questions was the inost important andi on ti only did he mlr coleridge propose to occupy the time of the jurt thiere were two modern decisions whiich it would be proper to mention thoughi not exactly in point the king v the justices of stuffordshire i chiittys reportgand  the kiny v borron  barnewall and alderson  in the first of thlese where a party was cliarged with an offence against the game laws an attorney appeared for hiim and was ordered to retire by the magistrates and thie court refused to grant a criminal itutorina tien againsit them in the second the court also rejected a si milar application agalinst magisirates whio hiad refused to permit an attorney to be present and comment on thie evidence to be given on a chiarge of felonv theme were indeed cases of criminal infotmation where tbe legal right was not strictly in issue but still the opinion of the court was evidently that thie at torney in each instance had no right to interfere but if all cases were put of the quesition anid the point were rewarded in reference to principle alone it would be clemrly found that neither the situation in which thie prisoner stood nor the cluty whichi the magistrates had to perform admitted of thie doctrine that he hiad a right to demand of them liberty for his attorney to assist him h e was not on trial buit examination and they were bound to comrmithim not only if they were perfectly satisfied of htis guilt hut unless they were assuredl thlat the accusation was groundless the ancient authorities indeed carried this dioctrinie further for it was laid down bv dalton

mr coleridge is not thant an authiority which proves too much mlr coleridge replied that his argument did not reqir that this doctrine should be sustskined to is full extent in another pas sage tite

had he acqairetil it since there was ito statute giving thie right or recognizung it althiough the attention of the legislat ure was called to the tuhject on several occasions as wlten it was enacted that witnesses shoua be sworn on behalf of the prisoner and whien rorvision was made for the examination of witnessesi in scotland in all thec comineni tariea upon tltese statuites there was no word
