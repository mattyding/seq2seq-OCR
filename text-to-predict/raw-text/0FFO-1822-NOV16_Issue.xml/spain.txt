 spaim  i wve have received by expieib fh dpei tothey are chiefly filled with the btipteqn hpbtw lately propased for punishing conspirabyia dinsurrectidn and otla remonstrance made by garelli one of fhteinrst ltie the judicial proceedings instituted ngainst a hint aridhie colleagues we shall in the first place describe what has passed on the latter subjecton the st instant as soon as the routine business which takes place at the opening of the sittings of the cortes had been gone through a letter from the m inister of grace and justice was read statink that don nicolas jarellilate secretary of state had address ed a memorial to the king playing that his majesty would be pleased to refer the same to an extraordinary cortes in this memorial says tbe spanish papers senor garelli tates that he has learned as a public and notorious fact that it has been resolved to imprison him and the other secretaries of state who were in office withj him in the latter end of june and the ist of julyin vir tue of the precautions considered necessary by the fiscal who directs tite investigation into the affair of the rebel guards who left their quarters and entered hostilely into the capital on the morning of the th of july and that the pretence for this intended imprisonment is founded on the conduct observed by the said late secretaries of state on those occasions he also observes that far from fearing the re sult of any process be is most desirous that his guilt or innocence should be clearly and distinctly manifested but the constitution has pointed out how and when prosecutions are to be carried on against secretaries of state before the supreme tribunal of justice which are duly to take place when the cortes declare that there is ground as in other criminal causes for instituting a processthe which explanation is presented to the cortes in order that they may be pleased to take into their consideration this important point and decide a to them shall seem good his mlajesty has thought fit to submit the above memorial to the deliberation of the cortes extraordinary who are expressly authorized to take the same into considerationthe secretary having asked whether it was intended that the me morial should be referred to a committeesenor sanches thought it unnecessary to appoint a particular com mittee as the memorial might with propriety be referred to the com mittee already specially appointed on the uffair of the th of julysenor adan was of opinion that no commnittee was necessary it was necessary for the cortes in the first place to determine whether there was ground for proceeding he did not think they were yet in a situation to take cognizance of the business it was true that senor tarelli had held the situation of secretary of stae but lie was also to be considered in that of a private individualsenor canga observedthat for that very reason the matter ought to be referred to a committee it was said that the memorialist was now in the character of a private individual  but that was what hap pened to every mininster on his resigningthe president stated his opinion to be that the memorial might be referred to the committee of legislationsenor arguelles supported the opinion of senor canga he con cluded by saying that the only security which now existed in spain for a deputy a aminister or any public officeris that the nation will not abandon any man who may have the misfortune to be placed in such a situation as senor garelliafter some farther debate it was ordered that the memorial and the letter of the minister of justice should be referred to a special committee the following deputies were chosen for the committee senores santafe tejeiro baiges calderon salva villanueva and garezon the d a document in justification of senor garelli presented to the cortes by his wife was referred to the above committeein the sitting of the th the committee made their report which is of great length but the following is its substance  after recapitulating the grounds of senor garellis complaint and the particulars of the proceedings for constituting himn prisoner thecommitteestatethe principles of the law respecting infractions of the constitution to be that the secretaries of state shall be ac countable to the supreme tribunal of justice but that it is neces sary that the cortes should previously declare that there is reason for instituting a process it is now asked whether when a person who has been a secre tary of state is put upon his responsibiiity for acts donc in shis li nistry the same rules are to be observed as if he wcre still in office  tlis admits of no doubt rhe accused under such circumstances must be proceeded againgt as if he were actually a minister in the same manner as the cortes acted in  when a deputy had failed in his duty of representative of thetiation the supreme tfribunal of justice ought now to act in taking cognizance of a charge against a late minister for transactions connected with his rflicial duties trie case would be very different did the question relate to any common crime committed by a minister while in office the present chiarge is not like that of assassination rape or any injury which might be committed by a public man without any reference to hisoflicial situa tion the criminal code enacts various penalties against public oih cers for neglecting or wilfully delaying the execution of the laws and also the redress which the public interest requires articles m and  in various other articles penalties are inflicted for not prosecuting delinquents and against those who prejudice the public causeagainst those who assemble to concert the means of opposing the laws or who resist their execution or take measures to frustrate them rite alinister who may have conspired against the sc curity of the state or the political constitution of the monarchy how ever slight and however confined to himself the designsmust be guilty of all the above enumerated offences and manyothers besides from these premises the committee deduce several axioms  that to require the responsibility ofa minister or of a person who has been a minister it is necessary that the cortes before any proceeding whatever should declare that there ate motives for instituting a process  that the supreme tribunal of justice ought to take cogni zance of the charge  that the same tribunal hals to take cognizanceofall criminal causes relative to persons exercising the duties of secretaries of state  that the crime of conspiracy in a public functionary atid more purticularly in a mvinister never can be regarded as common and private or considered separate from the questions which his offi cial situation involvesi with regard to the complaint against the fiscal parecs on the grond of incompetency and violation of the constitution and tilc law tbe committee conceive that there is no reason to enter into the consideration of these questions as they are points on which the com petent tribumsalt can decide finally the committee confiue them selves to suggesting for the deliberation of the cortes aa thie ulti mate result of their opinion rhat the documents be referred back to the government in order that the doubt which it is expected the cortes shoull remove may be more regularly stated and more explicitly expressed  or that if the papers be not referred back according to the nature of the case that the fiscal shall conform strictly to the constitution and the laws from which it is clearly to be dleducedl that a former se cretary of state ought in the case of ltis being put on his responsi bility to be tried in the samc manner as it he were exercising his office  that a public functionary can never be proceesled against for the offence of conspiracy committec during the period of his holding office except in the quality of a functionary tlie cortes will be pleased thus to resolve or in such other manner as to them may appear most properdlasfrid nov on the motion of senor galiano thc report was ordered to be printedthe law projects respecting the disposal of insurgents or conspi rators who may bc apprehended was still under
