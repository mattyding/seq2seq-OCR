ratingiiicasting theburdenthe new financeby our special correspondentthe financial provisions of the governments rating schemo are necessarily somewhat com plicated seeing that they involve a complete revision of the relations between the exchequer and the local authorities this complication is increased by the fact that the transition from the old to the new system of finance wvill be made gradually and the full effects of the pro posed changes will only be felt after the lapse of some  yearsfrom the point of view of the local authorities the first and most immediate result of the reforms will be to deprive them of a consider able portion of their resources through the derating of agricultural industrial and freight transport hereditaments had the scheme been in operation in  it is estimated that the loss of assessable value for england and wales would have been about £ had this loss simply been reimbursed to local authorities by the exchequer the transaction would have left them no better off than they are at present and the wide and growing inequalities in the financial resources of local authorities would have continued unchangedthe government propose however to seize this opportunity to bring about a substantial measure of equalization of rate burdens this is to be effected in two vaysfirst by widening the areas of administration and charge for poor law and highways and secondly by a redistri bution with the aid of a substantial sum of new money from the exchequer of the revenue which local authorities have hitherto received from the derated properties and from the grants now to be discontinued both these revenues are to be replaced by a new block grant which as time goes on is to be distributed more and more on a basis of need the importance of the change in local government finance will be appreciated when it is stated that whereas in the year  total expenditure of local authorities in england and wales amounted approximately to £ of which £ was met from governrnent grants and £ from the proceeds of rates had the proposed scheme then been in full operation the division would have been grants e  rates £the block grantthe new block grant is intended to take thie place not only of the rates remitted on the derated properties but also of  the grants from assigned revenues  the grants under the agricultural rates acts of  and   the percentage grants in aid of health services for tuberculosis maternity and child welfare welfare of the blind venereal disease and mental degeneracy  the classification gants for class i and ii roads in london and county boroughs  percentage grants for the main tenance of scheduled roads in country districts it will also include the £ no w money for england and wales the principle of lord goschens finance that local expenditure should be met as far as possible from local revenues which had long become unworkable is thus finally abandoned the only remaining vestige being the local taxation licence duties amount ing to about £ whiclh will still be levied  and appropriated by local authoritiesone of the consequences of this change wiu be a great simplification in accounting whereby the absurdly clumsy machinery of tlhe old local taxation account will be abolished but the substitution of a block grant for these nmiscella neous revenues is more than a mere matter of bookkeeping both the agricultural rate grants and the percentage health grants suffered from one radical defect they were related not to the needs but to the expendit ure of thle various local authorities the block grant principle possesses several advantages if it is wisely administered it leaves raxter freedom of local administration and irnitiative and at the same time ensures a greater degree of local responsibility because the bmirderts of extravagance fall directly upon the ratepayer the objections which have been raised to it in the past by local authorities have largely proceeded from the fear that it would tend to become stereotyped and therefore be too rigid to meet expanding needs and obligations but this reason for apprehension has iost its cogency seeing that the basis upon which the new grant will be calculated is designed to ensure sufficient elasticity to meet the demands of the futureruling factorsthe formula upon which the block grant will be distributed looks sufficiently formidable when expressed in abstract algebraic symbols but the principles upon which it is constructed are really comparatively simnple the grant will be calculated orn a capitation basis ie at so much per head of population but if popula tion were the onily factor taken into account the grant would be only very imperfectly adapted to the real needs of the various areas there are therefore a number of other factors by which it must be varied so as to iuake it larger for the poorer and the more distressed areas vhose expendituire is necessarily heavy the first of these is naturally the rateable value per head of population which indicates the wealth or poverty of the area but this gives no accurate indication of the expenses wlhich it will bave to meet allowance must therefore be made for other factors these are three in number  the number of children under five years of age per  of population this varies very consider ably in different parts of the country and is apt to be greatest in certain of the poorer industrial districts especially mining areas such as durhamn and south wales it is therefore a practicable index of expendi ture eg on health education and poor law services percentage of population unemployed this is obviously a most important element in the expeudi ture of any area much weight has been given to it in the formula population per mile of public road this is a factor which is of great significance in rural arars where highway services account for a large proportion of the expenditure it also is a measure of the sparsity of population in thinly populated areas westmorland and certain parts of northumberlahd for examplethe administrative expenses per head of population for certain services such as health and education and highways are very much higher than in more populous areas and the rateable value is correspondingly lowall these three factors are combined in the formula in such a way as to widen the capitation basis upon which the giant is calculated where any of these condi tions exceed a certain limit whiclh is taken as a datum figure the final result then is expressed as a  weighted  population thus to give an illustration the actual population of the county of durham is  its rateable value per head is only £ per head or  per cent below the datum figure of £ its unemployment percentage is high andl the number of children under five per  popu lation is more than double the minimum of  consequently for puroses of calculating the grantthe weighted populatibn is taken as  eventually ie at the end of  years tlhe total sums contributed by the exchequer in aid of the local government services will be divided among eounty and county borough councils in proportion to this weighted popuation thegrants being subject to revision every five years during the first quinquen mnum ie  the government grant will eonsist of two partsa grant equiva lent to  per cent of the revenues withdrawn estimated on the standard year  and a formula grant calculated on the basis of  pence per head of  weighted  population this is approximately equivalent to the remaining  per centof the lost revenues plus the £ of new money to be added from the exchequer all counties and county boroughs are guaranteed a minlmumgainof is per head of ordinary population at the end offive years the total grant will be revised the non formula part will be reduced by onethird and the formula part will be increased at the end of the second and third quin quennial periods the nonformula part will again be reduced so that beginniing with the fourth period the whole of the grant will be distributed according to the formula the government has also undertaken at these revisions to keep the ratio between total grants in aid and total rateborne expenditure of local authorities approximately constant this means that if unemployment for ex ample largely diminished the exchequer as well as the local authorities would gain if on the other hand it increased local authorities would obtain increased aid the purpose of this elaborate system of distribution is to get rid of one of the chief defects of the old methods of allocation which made no allowances either for general changes in economic conditions or for the special needs of the various areas the use of the formula which will be revised every five years should enable the grants in aid to be kept permanently adapted to the real needs of local authorities without either starving them or encouraging extravagant expenditureso much for what may be called the primary distribution of the government grant within the county itself the distribution among the smaller authori ties municipal borough urban and rural district councils will be based upon a much simpler plan owing to the transfer of poor law and highway services to the county thechief factors making for inequality have been eliminated lt will therefore be possible to allot grants to these authorities out of the county grant at a uniform figure per head of population the grant paid to rural districts nwiu be onefifth the figure per head paid to urban districts and boroughs on account of the less onerous services for which they are responsiblea special grantthis scheme of secondary  dis tribution will be put into force on april   but special provision of a tempo rary nature will be made to prevent any immediate increase in rates in any boroughs or districts resulting from the reform in any case in which such an increase would be necessary a special grant will be payable of which half will be found by the exchequer and the other half deducted from the grants payable to those areas in the county which stand to gain under the scheme this special grant will be re duced by th each year thus per initting the readjustment to take place graduallythe white paper issued by the govern iment crud  gives some interesting figures showing the net effect on the finances of local authorities had thereforms become operative in  for the first quinquemial period the increase in the government grants to county and county borough councils in the necessitous areas would have been considerable amounting in the case ofgateshead to s d of merthyr tydfil to s d and in that of wigan to s id per head of population in the i counties the total increases being  averaged over the whole county in each i case are of course smaller varying fromr is d per head in the county of lan caster to s d in the county of durham and s d in monmouthshire but the effect in relieving the rates in particular districts is often considerable in many urban districts in the county of durham for instance nwhere rates ran well aboves in the pound reductions of s to i s would have been obtained it is clear therefore that the reforms will  afford a substantial increase of relief to  the distressed areas but that is not their only or indeed their chief merit by definitely removing from industry the burden of an unsound form of taxation they should also help to fore stall the necessity of reliefconcludedprevious articles appeared in the times of july  and in the second article of this series which was
