yugoslav crisisreassembly ofparliamentfrom ourb correspondentb bblghade aug the skupshtina assembled today for the first time since the tragedy of june  the sitting was brief and was marked by complete tranquillity in strong contrast to the custornary noisy proceedings in the house during the last few months the house was but half filled as not only were the croats absent but also the serb agrarians the latter subsequently issued a statement in which tihey declared that they have assembled in belgrade and will continue the struggle in the skupshtina but abstained from todays sitting as a sign of sympathy with the croats and as a protest against the cabinet and the speaker whom they hold mainly respon sible for the shooting incidentthus all the left benches were empty the clericals occupied the croats seats and the sitting was held without a single opposition deputy being present the absence of dr marinkovitch the minister for foreign affairs whose duties are being performed by m shumenkovitch while dr marinkovitch is on holiday was especi ally remarked since it was mainly dr iarinkovitch who had insisted on sum moning the skupshtinaafter reading the minutes of the last sitting the speaker m peritch made a speech condemning the crime and paying a tribute to the deputies killedm bassaritchek and m paul raditchand laying emphasis on their devotion to yugoslav national unity thereafter the house as a sign of mourning adjourned unltil tomorrowlatertodays hurried and uneasy sitting of the skupshtina was held in an atmo sphere of deep depression in expectation of news from zagreb when it came the general feeling here was indignation all serbs without exception particularly re sent thte reference to montenegro in the zagreb declaration and the call of the croats to other provinces of yugoslavia to join them h their struggle against serb supremacythe croat demandsfrom our balkans correspondentzagreb aug the answer of the peasant democrat coalition to the reopening of the  blood stained  skupshtina in belgrade was the meeting which it held here today this was timed so as to synchronize with the sitting of the skupshtina and it was held in the building which was used under the hapsburgs for the sittings of the sabor or provincial parliament of croatia both these details conveyed the impres sion that the opposition was setting up a rival parliament of its own the population of zagreb certainly had no doubts on this point the streets were all beflagged and if one asked why one was told that it was because the sabor was sittingall this array however proved to be what is vulgarly known as  eyewash intended perhaps to suggest to belgrade what might happen if the worst came to the worst the meeting was strictly a party meeting of the peasant democrat coalition br trumbitch and dr pavselitch the two federalist deputies for zagreb did not attend thus it was not fully representative of croatia on the other hand as m pribitchevitch pointed out it represented a good deal more than croatia as the  members of the coalition included deputies from dalmnatia slovenia the herzegovina the voivoidina and even monltenegroin the absence of m raditch whose condition is still critical m pribitche vitch presided his speech and the resolution which was voted by the congress were distinctly moderate in toae and were evidently designed to counteract the effect of the statements made by m raditch which were recently published by a german news agency in which m raditch is reported as having said that a complete admini strative separation of serbia and c roatia with only the crown remaining as a connecting link is the essential con dition of further relations between the two parts of yugoslavia owing to mvf raditchs condition it has been im possible to check the authenticity of these statements but they are questioned to say the least of it by many of his supportersm pribitchevitch laid stress on the fact that their campaign was not one of croats against serbs but of a coalition of serbs croats and slovenes against a corrupt and effete administration and he reminded the croats that they andl the serbs of the former hapsburg provinces must stick together at all costs if they wished to get the better of the regime which they were trying to destroy belgrade he said wvas doing all it could to separate them he emphatically repudiated a suggestion that the provinces which they represented wished to break away from the rest of yugoslavia all they wanted was fair treatmentthe resolution which was subsequently passed by thecongress contains a number of interesting points which go beyond the sense of m pribitchevitchs speech it denies that measures passed by the skupshtina in its present form are bind ing for the whole of the country and in particular repudiates the principle of any new measures of taxation in so far as they apply to the former hapsburg provinces this amounts to a threat that the regions represented by the coalition may refuse to pay taxes it declares that the kingdoms of croatia and montenegro in merging themselves in the kingdom of serbs croats and slovenes did not reckon to lose their national individuality but that the kingdom of serbia has abused the act of union and the constitution of  in order to establish a hegemony over the rest the gist of this passage is the demand for a new constitution which would allow the provinces possessing a distinct national individuality to retain it the resolution concludes with anappeal to all parties of the former haps burg provinces and to all serbs par ticularly those of the serb peasant party who disapprove of the present regmne to join in the fight for these principles which it says can alone save the unity of the stateit is understood that this resolution has the approval of m raditch it contains a nmote that all further resolu tions of the coalition will be postponed until he is well enough to preside over its meetingsits import may be summed up as fol lows no action is decreed against bel grade although certain threats are held out the demand for separation is re pudiated and there is no suggestion even of a change to a federal system but the revision of the constitution appears as an essential condition the sense in which it is to be revised is only vaguely indi cated this is a course to which the serbian parties are not much inclined but it cannot be said that the resolution does not furnish a basis for discussionflyingoffced murdoch of the south aficanair force who is attempting to fivy fom
