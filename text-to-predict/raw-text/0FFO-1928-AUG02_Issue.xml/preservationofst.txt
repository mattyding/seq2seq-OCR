preservation ofst paulsthe steel chain forthe domeone of the reconimendations of the committee of experts which reported on the steps to be taken for the preservation of st pauls cathedral was that the drums of the dome should be encircled with metal hooping and the stage has now been reached when effect is being given to this recommendation a chain of stainless steel manufactured by brown bayleys steel works limited at sheffield has been completed during the last few days and brought by road to st pauls where it will shortly be placed in position the total length of the chain is approximately ft each bar being approximatelv ft long while the total weight is just under  tonsin a description of the work the manu facturers of the chain observe that the dome which is the portion of the fabric causing the greatest anxiety consists essentially of a triple dome supported by a double drum of asonry surrounded by an open colonnade visible from the street the whole being finally supported from the foundations by eight massive piers these piers are eccentrically loaded and were constructed of very poor mnaterial the defective material has been reinforced by pumping concrete into the interior of the piers and by other means but the eccentric loading of the piers has a tendency to push them out of vertical and allow the drum to spread in diameter this tendency is accentuated by seasonal variations in temperature the drum expands in hot weather but being constructed in masonry and having no strength in tension does not contract by an equal amount in cold weather it is to stop this progressive spreading of the drum with the attendant evils in the support ig piers that the stainless steel chain has been designed to encircle the drum at a point just below the whispering galleryby means of wedges a stress of  tons approximately will be imposed on this chain and it is expected that this tension will be sutlrcient to prevent any further increase in drum diameter the material chosen is  twoscore  stainless steel and the physical properties specified are ultimate tensile  tens per square inch with a proof yield of not less than  tons per square inch working on this proof yield a minimum cross section of the chain of  square inches was called forto facilitate erection the chain is designed like a bicycle chain with standardized links and pins there are in all  articulations  consisting of four barse two bars sin square and two bars lhfin by in in cros section and  articulations consisting of three bars sin snuare all the bars  in number are swelled up at their ends to form eyes and drilled to very fine limits of accuracy for a tin diameter pin the  articulations are assembled on  skin dia meter pins held in place by suitable cotter pins
