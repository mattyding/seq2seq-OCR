a oieleggedclimberascent of theiiatterhornmr yountgs storyby geoffrey winthrop youngzermattan athlete wvho loses the ivhole of one leg loses more than half his activity because he loses also the rhythm balance pace and anticipation in movement sup plied by the team play of two legs the legless man knows that his artificial limb whatever its cozening appearance has only one use that of a rigid plop under one corner of his framework to hold him up for a second while the other leg gets on wvith the work on rough or steep ground therefore every alternate  step  is an unbalancing interruption which the dynamic leg must recover in addition to doing its double workfor a number of years after the war i was engaged in subduing the counter wvorkings of this propfor actively help ful it can never beand experimenting with it upon british hills by  i had produced a version moderately tame and sufficiently strong and light and in that year a kindly conspiracy of younger mountaineers took me out again to the alps after  years absence on train ing expeditions of increasing length i dis covered that the fatigues or exhaustion vhich i had thought to have felt physically after a few hours climbing were no more than the suggestions of that mental or nervous boredom with arrhythniio movement which is the worst enemy of the limbless finally mr claude a elliott with the great guide franz lochinatter and a magnificent second in hans brant schen took me up monte rosa in nono too easy snow conditions the descent of the thighdeep snow plateaux was only made possible for me by the use of a skitip on which i was towed down the rough snowrapids a few hours tramiip across the glaciers to the riffelalp ended an jhours day of continuous goingthe wellenkuppeearly in july this year we began witl some clirnbs in the dolomites the extra ordinary beauty of the flowercarpets alnmost consoling iis for the arid monotony of the rocks then we drove to the zerrnatt valley for the first attempt we chose the wellenkuppe on the qabel horn range and trudged up two hot hours to the little trift refuge at nmidnight we started again with an inexperienced but willing pair of young gulides the steep loose footing up the edge of the interiminable rothhorn moraines took me  hours the sun was already on the trift glacier above and even with a ski stick ring tied on under my peg thc ascent on to the wellenkuppe ridge proved laborious the ridge of fine abrupt rock for the hands went better and we were up under the white  wave crest  of the summit in about  hours to avoid the softening white levels of the trift glacier we preferred on the descent the old route down on to the cabolhorn glacier this route proved exciting with rriuch traversing upon sllow and icesteps and some threat of falling stones the lowver moraines and the trudge doun to zermatt had to be faced doggedly but this clay of somne  hours had shown me finally that the attacks of  tiredness  were almost entirely nervous  a bigger effort could safely be undertaken wvithout fear of becoming  overtired with rafael lochmatter of the great guiding family and two others mr elliott and i climnbed the toilsome clifftrack up to the weisshorn hut in something over five hours after two hours rest we started at  pm up the moraine glacier and rubblecovered precipices leading to the east ridge reaching the great tower in  hours the ridge of turret and wall and sharp snowcrest took time and at midday the glaring snow up the final peak was waistsoft and all but impos sible mechanically for me mr elliott made a cast ahead but pronounced the slushy snow on steep ice too dangerous to attempt shortly after a huge snow avalanche from the summit just above us confirmed his judgment we turned down satisfiedfor i had already been eight times on that summitreached the hut at   hours slept a short space and tramped down to randathe matterhorna day later a bathe in the findelen lake determined me to finish the season with the matterhorn mr elliott had gone off to do the viereselsgrat of the dent blanche in record time so i engaged an oldfriend brantsohen and another the mule ride up to the little belvedere refuge was exceeding perilous after a rest we started at  pm  as i had determined to use the moon and climb all night the shimmer of starlight on the eirele of snowy peaks during all those long quiet hours of dark ascent by the rocks was exquisite we dispensed with a lantern hans helping me admirably with knee and shouider and guiding my metal peg to its footholds with the precision of a chessplayer moving a pawn presently the lights of following parties showed in the darkness far below by the shoulderthis year a rubble and not a snow slopemost of them had caught us up we wrestled up the precipiees of the great read battling with a fierce north wind and arrived all but the last upon the summt at  amn to escape the wind and lot the others have all the stones that were going we turned over on to the southern precipices and rested there for an hour of the matter horns incomparable view and then came the long terrors of the grim deseent always worse than the ascent for the leg less man the vast east face looked this snowless year peculiarly ruinous grey and forbidding but with the help of hans patience and a new technique laboriously mastered it was over at last by  we were at the belvedere and by  pm had trudged down to the schvarzsee there a mule mxlet me and i wandered off on a sunset and moonlight ride round the north face of the peak and down to zermatt at lols absorb ling ii its
