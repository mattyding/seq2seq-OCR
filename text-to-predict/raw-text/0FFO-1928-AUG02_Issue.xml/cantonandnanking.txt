imperial and foreignnewscanton andnankingriiecovery in thesouthfrom our rongikong correspondenttrade is imnproving steadily in hong kong and anglochinese relations are cordial serious efforts are being made in the province to improve public utilities and local administrations there is a spirit of enterprise in the air mfuch of it it is true has not yet got beyond the proposal stage but if the province is allowed to retain in peace what revenue itcan collect wonderful developments are likely canton is not likely to be affected by the nationalist occupation of peking except of course that the south will gladly accept any general blessings which the new central government may be able to obtain from the powers the earnest wish in hongkong has been that canton night remain only a spectator of hostilitieswhat may be accomplished if peace can be maintained by the nanking government is evident from the development of the southern capital now being resumed after three years of stagnation new streets are planned and honam island across the river is to have its first nzaloos horse roads  a new road has been begun from macao to shekki and around the heungshan peninsula back to the starting point otlher roads in different parts of the province are projected with some unexplained purpose a chinese syndicate said to have japanese capital has leased the small island of sai sha to not far from hongkong and a wireless station is spoken of in addition to a purchase of ten morris sixwheeled omnibuses by the cantonese government recently the municipality of canton is buying a fleet of  omnibuses to imnprove urban com munications four gunboats built and armed in hongkong are being launched for antipiracy patrol and more are plannedmoreover the cantonese govern ment has announced a plan to establish a naval training station in bias bay which has recently again been the haunt of pirates the repair of railways is at long last being undertaken and for this purpose a quantity of steel sleepers has been purchased from a german firm another german firm is selling electric light plants in the smaller provincial cities the famous dutch folly island in canton river is to be converted into a park and connected with the bund by a bridge canton is moreover enthu siastic about the proposed air service and unprovement of wireless communication an unspecified number of new aeroplanes has arrived from francefear of warthere has been anxiety in hongkong lest canton should become involved in distant warsa luxury it could illafford at the moment when li chaisum was expected to declare his complete independence he astonished all beholders by casually accepting an invitation to meet chiang kaishek at nanking last march aand to accept from him again the secondary offlce of chief of staff which he held three years ago much speculation arose as to the reasons for this move it was thought  that general chen mingshu from swatow a follower of chiang kaishek with whom li chaisum became associated in win ning canton back from the reds had bullied or persuaded li into going to nan king   that his allies at hankow had gone over to chiang kaishek and left li isolated and with no choice   that the acceptance of the invitation was  eye wash an inexpensive move to keep chiiang kaishek quiet and allow li chai sutl to govern canton in peacereports that when he went to nanking li chaisum was practically a prisoner there were denied both in shanghai and in canton but the denial was not con vincing it was said probably accurately that chiang kaishek suspecting that li cliaisurn had made a secret agreement with sir miles lampson and the governor of hongkong challenged him to go north and deny it li knowing that he would be denounced as being in foreign pay if he refused accepted the challenge when he appeared in nanking chiang tried to keep him there only to find that li was backed by a strong body of nationalist opinion fearing that his own position would be jeopardized in turn chiang was comnpelled tb let his old colleague return to canton first exacting a halfpromise of aid towards the northern expeditionthere were feverish military movements in and around canton during li chai sums absence the officill explanation was precautions against reds but the initiated khew better chiang kaisheks agents were active and if li chaisum had not returned when he did canton would again have been the centre of a little war li chaisum is at present attending the kuomintang meeting in nanking reds  melt awaycanton has not yet recovered from the red coup of december the central bank notes of which chang fatkwai took away the reserve and the unissued portion have gradually been called in the ingenious and inexpensive method of redeeming them has been to increase the taxes and accept a percentage of the pay ments in central bank notes the rest in silver in this fashion the value of the notes has been restored to some  per cent of their face value  but their posi tion is by no means firmly reestablishedmeanwhile the pay of troops and police is in arrears and the damage caused by the reds has still to be repaired in all  houses were destroyed and hitherto onlv  have been wholly or partially re buiit the troops sent against the reds in the coastal regions of the province have been only partially successful com munists melt away when troops arrive they become ordinary peasants resuming their activities when the troops return to basethe cantonese government has muchto attend to and needs plenty of money it proposes with the formal blessing of nanking to impose a customs surtax of  per cent per cent instead of  per cent for reconstructive purposes it is believedthat no difflculties will be made by the powers if the surtax is imposed regularly and with approval but it is feared that nanking will encourage canton to ignore thepoweis and claim iinmediate autonomy the cantonese government is also endeavouring to xe tain inthe province  the incidental customns revenue such as fines and ship registry fees war would have postponedthese issues but canton badly needs money the old oil tax a relic of soviet days still
