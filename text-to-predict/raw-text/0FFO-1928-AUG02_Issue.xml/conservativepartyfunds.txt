conservative partyfundshome secretary and cost of educational camipaignsir william joynsonhicks the liome secretary has sent another letter to some of his constituents in the tivickenham division replying to those who have criticized him for endeavouring to raise money for the general election campaign by writing personally to the electors sir william joynsonhicks says  i am afraid there has been some mis understanding as some of my friends seem to have thought that i was reducing my own subscriptiorns but there is of course not the slightest truth in this all i felt was that the cost of running the central organization of the division being paid so largely by the member is a bad arrangement for the constituency and i want everybody to realize that thev are working not merely for the present member but to make the seat safe for a con servative member for many years to come but quite apart from this we are faced with the necessity for raising a fund to meet the cost of the vigorous educational campaign which must be carried out in the coming months our opponentsthe socialists and to some extent the communistsare working their very hardest i do not blame them but i should like to feel that our own party is keenly alive to the responsibility of citizen ship and that a seat which has been so long conservative should be kept tree to those principles if possible by even a larger majority than beforein the original letter sir william joynson hicks after urging the necessity for efficient propaganda said we require other help in money and in service from a large number of conservatives for at present i regret to say that only a fraction of our unionist strength contributes between the elections any material assistance in the fight which is being waged day by day against the socialist and reactionary forces in this division if all unionists who can do so would subscribe Â£ s and those who are unable to afferd that sum would send me what they can then our plans could be carried out in their entirety
