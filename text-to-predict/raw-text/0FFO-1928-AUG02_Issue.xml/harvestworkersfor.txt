except clause  restric l tions on offering of shares for subscription or sale should not come into operation until a resolution in that behalf had been passed by both hotuses of parliamentthe lord chaincellor said there wvas no precedent for a bill being brought into operation in the way suggested and the pro cedure would not give opportunities for re vision ile thought however he could do something to meet the difficulty which the noble lord felt the government believed they had been able to meet and safeguard the main points raised by the many associations and professional bodies who had been consultedthey recognized that it was eminently desir i able that those who had to deal with company matters should have a full opportunity of con sidering the changes which the bill in corporated before it became law they had always intended that the bill should be con solidated with the existing company legisla tion he was prepared on behalf of the govern ment to assure their lordships that apart from the one section which was being brought into operation immediately thesection with re gard to share pushing there should be no order in council bringing the bill into operationuntil consolidating legislation had been passeathat certainly would not take place this year and they could not hope that it should take place before amay next year there must be months of delay before this bill as a whole became operative and there would be ample oppor tunity for everybody affected to consider the provisions of the bill and make any suggestions which were required if as the result of repre sentations it should appear to the government that there were zacunae or inconsistencies which should be put right it would be neces sary to introduce amending legislationlord parmoor expressed agreement with the lord chancellors suggestionin reply to earl russell the lord chancellor said that the consolidation bill when it was introduced would be a con solidation measure and nothing else but the preparation of it would bring to light amend ments if required and inconsistencies if they existed between now and may next there would be ample time for representations to be mnade and if amendments were found to be necessary the government would consider the matter and would no doubt be prepared to make the amendments requiredthe amendment was withdrawnthe committee stage

linethrowing appliance bill passed through committee and were read the third time and passedmarriages bill rejectedprimates appeallord wraxall moved the third read ing of the mlarriages prohibited degrees of relationship billthe archbishop of canterbury moved the rejection of the bill he said that of al things legislation of this kind should not bedone in a hurry and passedwithout ade quate discussion outside as well as inside pajzliament if done at all it should be based on a perfectly clear and general demand fo it outside it concerned the social and domesticlife of the country from one end to the other he did not wish to treat the proposal dis respectfully he did not wish to oppose it as clearly and definitely mischievousinitself by evidence adequately before them but he de mandedfor it very fullt consideration in par liamentnid very ample opportunity ifqr discussion outside this it had not at present had lord arnold had said that it had been fuly discussed in the house of coimmons last year he the arch bishop had since then read everything that had deen said about it in the house of commons in the last two years he could find no evidence of the general demand which seemed to him essential in such a case a few letters had been produced which showed that certain people had married illegally and were very anxious to get out of trouble the debate to which lord arnold had referred occupied less than an hour on a friday afternoon largely taken up by protests against hurry the theory oi the measure itself was based on the nlecessity or supposed necessity of logical sequence to the deceased wife s sister bill of  that measure was passed into law he thought unfortunately but in response to a perfectly clear demand and after more than ample discussion in both houses alarm was expressed by the opponents of that measure as to the risk of extension beyond what was then done the lord chancellor however said that they did not propose to go farther than that measure went therefore he was justified in saying that tho house now had before it a new departure not contemplated in  and not really demanded in the country now the change that would be effected by the bill was not he thought in the least realized either inside or outside the house it would be disastrous that it should be made in the conditions in which it was being attempted the question of affinity had been a part of the cbristian law of marriage from the beginning this measure would sweep that affinity almost wholly aside not quite a man might not marry his stepmother or his stepdaughter but he did not know how long they would have to wait before the next step was taken there were social objections to this measure and there were also ho was told technical hygienic matters about which high medical authorities wished to raise questions at au events an opportunity ought to be given of going farther into the matter if it was to be pressed he had been  years a member of the house during that time he had given all the attention that his powers admitted to questions of social life intercourse and morality in the homes of england this was pre sumably the last time he would have the opportunity of standing there as the repre sentative spokesman of those whose life had been spent in dealing on moral considerations with social and domestic questions of this kind he wanted therefore to make an appeal as strongly as he could against hasty legislation in this matter he made that appeal and if he failed he wouid at least have tried to prevent what he would regard as an infinitely rash and most inconsiderate actlord wraxall said that this bill had been introduced into the house of commons no fewer than flve times it merely followed up the deceased wifes sister act of lord merrivales protestlord merrivale who is president of the probate divorce and admiralty division of the high court supported the motion for rejection he said that the bill was practic ally unknown in the country they were told that perhaps there were a few hundreds of people who had contracted marriage within the prohibited degrees in defiance of the law and some of them had gone across the water to give a spurious pretence of legality to the marriages that they had contracted it was in the interest of that srmall body of persistent people who wished their breaches of the law to be sanctioned by an amendment of the law i that their lordships were askedwvithout a public demand without any discussion in the house of commons which had attracted public attention and after a few days mention ing of the matter in the house of lordsto introduce changes which would practicallv destroy the law of affinity they were asked to legalize marriage in respect of eight classes of people numbering probably hundreds of thousands although the experience of ages had shown that the sanctity of family life and the protection of family life required that re striction should be put upon marriages within certain degrees they might look at all the political institutions of the country and contemplate changes in them but no i erious man could contemplate a revolution in l she family life of the country without the  rravest anxiety what was now proposed was i lhat where there were legal sanctions that i required that a selfrespecting man should not  look upon certain relatives of his witb a view lo marriage those sanctions were to be withirawn he hoped that the speech for which i many of them were personally very gratefuli lto the archbishop would have its effect and i that if the mjost rev primate were not to sit in their lordships house againwhich he trusted wg not the casehe would at any rate go away with the satisfaction of knowing that the weighty protest which he lodged in that house as head of the church was not disregarded hear hearearl russell supporting the bill saidit was by no choice of its promoters that the i discussion took place so late though of course the primate was perfectly within his rights in putting down his rejection motion at that stage and in whipping up his ecclesiastical reserves as he seemed to havedonelord cushendun chancellor of the duchy of lancaster said they were told that the ill had passed through the commons five times until last autumn he was a member oi the house of commons and he never heard of this bill until it was read a second time in their lordships house the other day and he could not find any of his friends in the hlouse of commons who had heard of it his view was that after what had occurred especially after the weighty utterance of the primate the passage of the bill now before the house would be taken throughout the country as an instance of the frivolity with wvhich great changes might be made by the legislature without due consideration so far fronu the passage of the measure being merely a following out of the deceased wifes sister bill it would amount almost to a breach of faith if after the assurances that had been given this legislation were carried without the fullest notice to the country at the time of the agitation that preceded the deceased wifes sister bill assurances were given that that exception would not be followed up it was then urged that the sisterinlaw was the natural guardian of a mans children if a nieceinlaw were to become eligible for marriage with a deceased aunts husband the objections would be very much greater he was speaking of matters that he knew because these matters touched him personallv widowers might find it impossible to ask their nieces to come to stay with them as they did now without the slightest reserve poison would be introduced into a great many households before that was done the country ought to have an opportunity of really con sidering the matteron a division the motion for the third reading was rejected by  votes to  ihajority the criminal law amendment bill passed the report stage and was read the third time and passedtheir lordships rose at two minutes past  oclock
