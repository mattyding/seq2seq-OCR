railway wagesmr thomass defence ofthe agreementmr j h thomas mp addressed at derby last night about  members of the three railwsvay trade unions on the recent agreemnent between the railway companies and the unionshe said that although the agreement meant asking the men to make some sacrifice he had never been prouder of anv agreement made on behalf of the railwavmen his answer to those who shouted the old parrot cry  thomas has sold you again was  it is the wise leader and not tlle fool who knows how to retreat his army properly those who denounced him and cried never surrender should go to the railwaymen and tell them what was their alternative then only could the full triumph of this agreement be judgedthe proposals which the railwvay companies with their falling revenue made to the unions were that the guaranteed week the guaranteed day night work time and a quarter fop over time sunday duty and all war bonuses should go without hesitation the union leaders rejected the proposals which apart from their drastic character were monstrously unfair new ground had been broken in securing that the general managers and all must share in the economies it was the genuine test of how far the talk of the new spirit of cooperation could be applied another fundamental was that the shopmen should no longer be the cinderellas of the railway worldif the agreement with its minimum of  hoursmore than a fivedays weekhad not been made the alternative of  hours would have meant dismissals of at least  to  men in derby alone and approximately  to  on the whole of the four railways those huge dismissals had been alreadv budgeted in case the agree ment was not made with  unem ployed in the country with a black winter ahead no man ought to talk glibly of dis missals the consequences to the poor devils who would have to go were too horrid to think of could he be condemned for sa ing  that is hell to those people and i am not going to be a partv to it when mr thomas referred to the  per cent reduction all round a woman cried  shame mr thomas said i have not bound you to accept the agreement the delegate meeting can turn the whole thing dowvn next thursday but before they turn it down and before anvone in this audience shouts shhame let them face the alternative the members might reject the agreement and go on strike but anyone who dared to give that advice to the railwaymen would regret the consequences in the circumstances the i per cent cut was inflitely better than a strike it was at least i per cent all roundthe nonunionistshe had told the comipanies that there would be critics but he also told them that those loudest in condemnation were those who were too meau to belong to the trade unions hitherto those men had sheltered themselves behind the protection of the general manager and the oflfcials he wanted to make it clear that the road to promotion was not open to those who refrained from being trade unionists in order to get the officials blessing mr thomas added  we want you to say to day that thls machinery which is now set up between the railway companies and organized labour and this machinery alone is to be used in future you will be well advised to accept the agreement if it is the first step to a bigger and broader realization of the problems between capital and labour so much the better i hope that after the  months of this temporary agreement is over you will be able to meet the companies and say the tide has turned there is a new era of prosperity and i believe the companies will be as big in meeting us as we were in meeting them cheers
