black reichsweitrtialfoiur death sentencesfrom u ownc coo berlin march the biggest of the  black reichswehr murder trials which has occupied a berlin court for a fortnight ended yester day with the pronouncement of four death seatences lieutenant fbhrmann sergeantmajor kiapproth and sergeant ijmhofer were found guilty of the murder of sergeantmajor wilms on july   and lieutenant schulz of instiga tion and all were sentenced to death lieutenants von poser budzinsky and stantien were acquittedthe finding of the court shows that at last sufficient evidence has been heard by a court to convince it that these  executions  of suspected traitors in the secret reichswehr reserve were not the result of spontaneous indignation among the men but were ordered by a fehme organization a secret tribunal on the medieval pattern of which schulz was the head schulz has been under detention for over two years he has been among the accused in three or four trials but always escaped conviction because the evidence was technically insufficient in the opinion of the courts although the landsberg court last autumn laid the moral responsibility  on him in onecasethe court heard a number of official reichswehr witnesses and in its findings feels able to present a clear historical account in  and  it finds germany was so seriously threatened by france this refers to the ruhr occupa tion and alleged french intrigues on the eastern frontier that the regular reichs wehr felt unable to cope with the situa tion the  labour companies to which collectively the name  black reichs wehr  has been popularly applied were therefore formed their nominal task was to clear up scattered arms and munitions their real purpose as official reichswehr witnesses admitted was to form the nucleus of a reserve for the support of the reichswehr in case of polish incursions they were cadres of officers and noncornnissioned officers whose business was to train menthe evidence also threw fresh light on the development later in  of the dictatorship conspiracy which ended ignominiously with the kiistrin putch and the disbanding of the  black reichswehr schulz formed the first  labour company  at kustrin after wards companies were formed at spandau rathenau doberitz and potsdam major buchdriucker who later launched the kiistrin putsch had charge of the organization at the army headquarters of the third district in berlin and schulz became his righthand man owing to the irregularity of the whole proceedings the members of the  labour companies  were nominally civilian labourers in the employ of the reichs wehr this status has been insisted on by all official witnesses nevertheless they wore uniform bore arms had reichswehr passes and on occasion even performed guard duties at the presidents palace in berlin it is clear from the evidence that the rank and file at any rate did not understand the complexities of the situation but not unreasonably regarded themselves as soldiersit was essential for the sake of the government says the court that their activities should not become public therefore  secrecy was the alpha and omega of the whole business and it was enforced by the worst terrorism those concerned did not even hesitate to take life here it may be remarked that an official reichswehr witness ingenuously expressed the opinion that  any means  would have been justified in preventing betrayalstory of the crimethe court goes on to reconstruct the crirne which was the subject of this trial wilms fell under suspicion of being in relations with the communists and the allied control commission and of other offences fhe was removed from his com pany to the rathenau company com manded by von poser and closely watched a few days later came a curious telephonic order from the third district headquarters to attach wilms and nobody else to a party which was coming from berlin in a car to clear up a com munist store of arms at leipzig this would normally have been the task of the local company only the party arrived and took wilms made him drunk at a caje in rathenau conveyed him to a spot where the road ran alongside the river havel shot him through the back of the head and flung the body weighted with iron bars into the water certain of them returned early in the morning and said they had had a skirmish with the com munists and had lost sight of wilmsthe court is satisfied that fuhrmann umhofer and klapproth were in the car and that the communist story was invented for the occasion fuhrmann aftervards admitted to friends who gave evidence that he had taken part in the expedition the defence tried vainly to place all the blame on the notorious sergeantsmajor biusching and fahlbusch who fled from germany long ago schulz also asserted that if anybody gave a telephonic order from headquarters it was his deputy gutknecht who is now in southwest africa the defence even proposed to obtain gramophone records to prove the similarity between schulzs and gutknechts voices but von poser in sisted that he recognized schulzs voice and office records proved that gutknecht had telephoned to rathenau on another day altogetherthe court points out that several people from different places were assembled on the night of the crime they could not have decided independently to kill wilms the decision must have been reached by a central authority schulz was responsible for the whole work of the labour companies and all the local commanders regarded him as their superior officer there was no evidence to show that a regular reichswehr officer had given the order therefore the order to send wilms with the party must have come from schulzthe court decided on a recommenda tion to mercy the condemned men pro pose to appeal
