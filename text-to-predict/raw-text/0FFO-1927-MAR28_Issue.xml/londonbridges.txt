tomorrow recommending that subject to a govermneut contribution of  pet cent of the cost o a bridge at ohating cress and an early decision as to its character the royal commissions ptrowaterloo bridge be accepted provided so ztvharta  per cent gran is made to this latterit will be recalled that the lcc on the publication of the report of the royal com mission on cross river traffic in london approached the prime minister with a request for a statement of certain fundamental points arising out of the report and the prime inister made that statement inthe house of commons on march  endorsing generally thefinancial proposals of the commission that s per cent of the cost of bridge and road improvements should be borne by state grants but rejecting the recommendation  for the appointment of a special traffic authority for london the improvements committee note with satisfaction the latter point and examin ing the other proposals including the offer of a grant of  per cent towards the victoria dockroad remark that most of the schemes have been before the council for many years but that financial questions prevented their being taken uppubie attention had however been concen trated mpainly on waterloo aad charing cross brfdges and the commission in their recom mendation for a reconstructed waterloo bridge recognized that it would not provide ade quately for central london traffic unless another bridge is erected at charing cross they recommended merely that the footways of waterloo bridge should be moved thus pro viding room for four lines of vehicles instead of three as at present or of the six secured by the council s proposal to reconstruct the bridge in making that proposal the com misgion remarked that  if waterloo bridge were widened to take four lines of traffic and if a new bridgehvere provided at charing cross in addition to that proposed at st pauls the traflic difficulties in this central area would be solved for a period of  yearstwo pprojecr linbthe improtvements conmmittee state that this indicates that the commission regard a restricted wnig oft waterloo  bridge as practicable only if a road bridge is built at charing cross at a much earlier date than hitherto contemplated by the council and they also note with satisfattion that theprime minlister in his statement linked the two pro jects and that the government were prepared to contribute  per cent of the cost of a waterloo bridge widened as recommended by the commissionthe committee further state that the con dition of waterloo bridge is such that it is essential to settle without delay the natbre and extent of the permanent works at this point but before any decision is arrived at they consider the committee of engieers re ferred to by the prime minister ihould meet and examine the charing cross bridge scheme as it would be contrary to public policy to decide upon the form which waterloo bridge ahould take until it is known definitely whether a bridge will be erected pt charing cross stress is laid upon the need for asrer taininig the gross as well as the let cost ot the property and works involved in a bridge at charing cross and the need for securing that estimate in a reasonable timetiie recosimennatrozsfinally the improvements committee recommend to the councnil as follows  that the council will give effect to the recommendations of the royal commission on crossriver tramffic in london asto waterloo bridge on the basis of a contributionby hm government of  per cent of the actual ascer tained expenditure thereon from time to time provided that the necessary steps be taken to construct a bridge and approaches at charing cross in accordance with a scheme to be approved by the government and the council to the cost of which the government will con tribute  per cent of the actual ascertained expenditure from time to timethat in view of the urgency of the situa tion hm government be asked to take such action as will ensure an early decision on the question of the construction of a bridge and approaches at charing crossthat hm government be informed that the council is prepared to enter forthwith into negotiations with the minister of transport in regard to the recommenidations of the royal commission on crossriver traffic in london concerning the proposed victoria dockroad and the other schemes dealt with by themthe finance committee state that if the above recommendations are approved the council is contingently committed to both works the approximate cost of the charing cross bridge proposal as stated in the roval commissions report is £ to which isadded  per cent for contingencies making a total of £ this they add only represents the net cost of ute works and judging from experience sevetal million pounds would have to be addedto that figure to arrive at the gross cost in any event it appeared from the information at present available that the councils net liability would be about £lady st
