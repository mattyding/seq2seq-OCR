been main tained up to the end and the enthusiasm of his workers shows that he has made an execdleat fight though there has been nothing spectacular in his campaign it has beeu one of remarkable thoroughness and efficienev more steady work has been done behind the scenes by xr guest and his helpers than by either of the other groups most of his successes too have not beed such as could be announced from the housetopshie has been assured for example by many trade unionists that they are going to vote for him but that they think it wise not to make the fact known to their mates many of the moderate people in the labour party have wished him well and a few have openly given him their help a particularly interesting extract from a letter sent to him by mr bernard shaw before he had broken with the labour party was issued on saturday this was written after he had supported the government on the labour partys amend ment to the speech fromthe throne mr shav wrote  you were entirely right on the china amendment and if baldwin had had the gumption to go to the country he would have been safe for another five yearsit has proved true in north southwark that the people are keenly interested in ohina respect for mr guests honesty has also growni during these latter days and neither of the other parties knew at the end how deeply he had bitten intotheir lists ihis final

not be declared until about i anm tomorrowmr guest concluded his last meeting on saturday night with the following appeias an englishman representing this con stituency i am appealin to you an engilsh constituency on an englhsh issue and i con hldently expect to get an english verdict the audience rose and cheered himthe publicans of north southwark have unanimously decided to support mr strauss thiy say that whatever may be the result of the election it will not affect the policy of the government in china and they support mr strauss because he is in favour of removing the present anomalies
