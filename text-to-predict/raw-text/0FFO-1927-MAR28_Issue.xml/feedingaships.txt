cooking he was ahainateur with no knowledge of preparing food with the con sequence that meals were monotonous and often uhpalatable the method more over was extremely wvasteful bread of which looolb is baked daily on board to satisfy the needs of our own men and b if a destroyer flotilla has also to be supplied is still served out together with grocerios such as tea and sugar direct to the messes  meat vegetables and flour however are issued in bulk direct to the shipi cookindhisassistants from the refrigerating chambers or store rooms and under the  general mess system by which the paymastercom mander is allowed is d a day for every man on boatd the main items of food are cooked together and the bill of fare for all except offcers who still make their own messing arrangements is
