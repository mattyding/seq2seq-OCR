conferences and con versations ending with a luncheon party at m zaleskis private residenceat which m voikoff the soviet minister an m iflolowko the new head of the eastern department of the foreign ministry were presentand a discussion of three hours duration at the belvedere between marshal pilsudski m zaleski and m patek m voikoff was informed at the luncheon of certain lines which polish policy would pursuethe task which was allotted to m patek when he took up his appointment early this yearthat of exploring the grounds for a nonaggressive treaty was considered to be fulfilled and it is understsod that he left again for moscow with instructions to negotiate the agree maent the initialling of the soviet latvian pact in riga had dissipated the slender hopes that remained of keaing poland latvia estonia snd finland mreet the soviets in a roundtable con ference and establish an eastern locarno  jacta est akea one newspaper says  we are to negotiate a treaty with the sovietsit may be opportune in view of these developments to recall the phase of the negotiations which began after the berlin treaty of reinsurance between germany and russia and the pilsudski coup dcetat in warsaw april and may  and which ended m august with a soviet draft for a proposed pact with poland this draft provided four articles only the first bound each of the parties to abstain from aggression and observe neutrality in the event of aggression by third parties  the second bound each party to abstain from political or economic agreements directed against the other the third referred all disputes which could not be settled through normal diplomatic channels to a miixed concilia tion committee of which the membership rights and procedure were to be deter mined in a separate treaty the fourth declared the treaty subject to ratification and valid for three years which could be prolonged for another year when the signatories gave notice to prolong six mnonths before the expiration of the treatythe points for criticism noted in this draft were that article i did not define aggression and that article iii did not necessarily or expressly cover disputes arising previously to the date of signa turethat is to say out of the riga treaty establishing the present eastern frontier there was no provision for arbitration and the conciliation pro cedure would be of limited value if there was merely a reversion to diplomatic negotiations when it failedleague obligationsin a polish miemorandum of septem ber  it was declared that the draft was a step forward in the negotiations and might lead to the conclusion of a pact if due regard was paid to the interests of both countries the polish govemment desired to stabilize its relations with russia on the basis of the riga treaty its aim was to ensure the peace of eastem europe of which good relations between poland and russia were the keystone poland would agree to the neutrality clause in case of unprovoked attack and agree not to be a party to any international pact directed against the othler signatory on the strict iiiderstanding that obligations incurred by her as a member of the tleague of nations were inviolable article it in the soviet draft had there fore to be mado clearer more precise definition was also required of the term  aggression of the case in wlhich neutralitv had to be observed and of tho whole conciliation procedure the memorandum ended with an expression of readiness to enter into formal negotia tions on receipt of a satisfactory replysuch was the state of pourparlerm at which the last deadlock arose and from which m patek in resuming negotiations has been instructed to make a fresh begiwning in poland as in the baltic states and in germany geographical proximity is considered to necessitate political arrangements with russia because of what russia permanently is with less regard to her present form of government if poland feels that the time has now come when her own arrangements must be made it is for several very deeply felt reasons russia and germany have their treaty and the growing fear that germany may not abandon her claim for the recovery of danzig the corridor and upper silesia makes her desire to have a counterweight treaty and more settled relations in the east the revo lutionary movements among the eastern minorities the white ruthenians and ukrainians of whom the majority live in soviet russia are fed by the expecta tion of war and a revision of the polish russian frontier an improvement of russianpolish relations coupled with administrative reforms might remedy this thorn in the fieshthe russian miarketit is also recalled that after the war polish industries served the whole russian market and a revival of the former eastern trade before opportunities have been lost is regarded in the light of a necessity m patek was in conference before he left with m andrzej wierzbicki president of the economic council under the polish federation of industriesthere are grounds for believing that m pateks report was to the effect that better terms than before could now be obtained from the soviets the polish government probably intends to secure reaffirmation of the treaty of riga and of the financial obligations therein con tracted by the soviets which are not yet fulfilled and also the appointment of a neutral chairman to arbitrate in the con ciliation committee it may be assumed wvith the utmost confidence that nothing whatever will be undertaken on the polish side to weaken the authority of the league or modify the friendly relations which have been built up between poland and great britain
