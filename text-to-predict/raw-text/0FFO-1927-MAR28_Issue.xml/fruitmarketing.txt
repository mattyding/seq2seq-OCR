fret a rkv tngbhones grower  suar of traimintrys reportfliruit marketing in england and wales is the subject of a report issuaed by the ministry of agriculture as no  of theirecononoic series it runs to  pages is fully illustrated the frntispiece beinga reproduction of a fine plate show ig coventgarden about  and the priceis d it maybe purchased fror the stationery office the report has been preparedbythe ministry with the object of providing home growers with a comprehensive view of the methods of market ing fruit and enabling them more easily to consider what further steps can be taken by them to naintain their present position in the home market and also if possible to increase their share of the total trade the matter is the more important because the consumption of fruit in this country has grown rapidly in recent years and is still capable of expansionthe conclusion to be drawn from the report i seems to be that the fruit industry generally has much to gain by adopting methods of marketing which will enable produce to be put on the market in a manner more in accordance with the requirements of wholesalers and re tailers agreement on standard grades and packages is one method which can hardly fail to be beneficial to the industry in this con nexion collecting centres where the produce of many growers can be brought together graded packed and sold under one manage ment appear to offer advantages another suggestion is the more extensive use of methods of storage and preservation it is for the in dustry to consider what is possible and prac ticable in these and other directions the report also contains much information of general interest relating to supplies and sources home and foreign and distributiontau torta acreaogthe total acreage of orchards and fruit gardens in england and wales for the year  was as followsrchards  acres strawberries  raspberries  cur rants and gooseberries  these figures show that there has been no great change since  fruit production may be either general or specaized the proportions of total bome production are estimated to be  per cent general and  per cent specialized dealing with general produotion the report saysnorth of a line drawn from the wash to the dee the quantity of fruit produced is comparatively small in the industrial parts of this area atmospherio conditions labour supply and in many places soil conditions restrict the development of fruit production in the rural parts much of the soil is unsuited to fruit culture and it is only here and there notably in the east and south of yorkshire that any extensive area exists where conditions are generally favourable south of this line the mountainous parts of wales the moors of devonshire the sterile parts of cornwall and thechalk areas of dorset and wiltshire are in the main unsuitable for fruit in practically au other parts bowever general production appears to have developed normally to meet demands and accounts for a considerable pro portion of the local supply of homegrown fruits during the normal season ofdthe crops in some instances the quautity of fruit pro duced is in excess of local needs and a surplus is avrailable for dispatch to other consumingspixcraizzr paonucwroxwith regard to specialized production it is stated that some areas of specialized produc tion are clearly defined and have little culti vation other than fruit in others fruit plantations are scattered amongst general farms their locatiou has been mainly deter mined by natural conditions of soil and climate together with accessibility to markets their growth has been stimulated by the incmasing concentration of demand in the industrial areas among the areas mentioned areent middle sex buckinghamshire essex west sussex and surrey

part of the report dealing with the various marketing services involved in the distribution of fruit to the consumer states that fruit may reach the retail distributor in two ways either by directpurchase from pro ducers or through the wecialist activities of brokers commission salesmen commission buyers and wholesale merchants the strategic points inthe wholesaling of fruit in consuming centres are the port auctions and the large wholesale markets the distribution of fruit to the ultimate consumer is mainly effected through the medium of the retail trade conducted by shops and street hawkers but there is a small amnount of direct marketing between producer and consumersale by grower to retailer is of considerable importance and probably accounts for from  to  per cent of homegrown fruit to a small extent retailers make their purchases on growers premises but the usual procedure in local trade is for the grower to cart his produce into neighbouring towns aud to hawk it to a selected round of retailers or to dispose of it in the marketplace hawking is far from casual as the grower may take orders and fx prices for subsequent delivery but it is diffieult for the grower to balance supply and demand and he is often left with a surplus on his hands to be jobbed off at an unecononic price or taken home retailers are fuly aware of this and naturaly exploit it to their ad vantage in towns where there is no market centre agreement on prces is always a matter of difficultyin many smau country and seaside towns and in the suburbs of large towns there are growers who market smau quantities ofa large variety of crops generaluy including fruit who have found it advantageous to sell from a shop ontheir premsm provided the distance is not too great consumers are attracted by the possibility of getting produce first hand lack of continuity of supply is the common diffi culty and the grower usualy needs to suppie ment his own produce by thepurchase of in
