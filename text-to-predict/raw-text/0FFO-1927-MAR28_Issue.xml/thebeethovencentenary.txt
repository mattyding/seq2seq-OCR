tee berth oth eejovyencentenarycommejmoration inviennafroy our speci corupondentvienna mancx the beethoven centenary festival began here yesterday morning with an opening ceremony which was partly musical but was mnore particularly an occasion for speechmaking after boethovens earlier cantata on the death of the elmperor joseph il had been per formed dr guido adler as chairman of the festival called on the presidont of the austrian reprublic to welcome the guests altogether  speeches were de livered by represenitatives of the govern ment and of the city and the official re presentatives of various countries all emphasizing the wide cosmic influence which the art of beethoven has exerted in the century which has passed since his death the ceremony concluded fitly with a performance of the choral fantasia a work in which the several forces of pianoforte solo voices and orchestra are united in praise of the power of musicso much must be said by way of a pre liminary record of events my own participation in the festival began this morning when large numbers of people assembled at beethovens tomb in the central friedhof at  and it was co tinued at midday when i heard the mag nificent perfdrnance of the missa solennis which was directed by herr franz schalk ili the great concert hall i came straight from the royal philhar monic societys comtnemoration of beethoven in london on thursday to join in that of vielna today and the ekperi ence of hearing the mass in the very different conditions which the two cities afford has been an extraordinarily interest ing and enlightening oneat the cemeteryquite apart from this it has seemed aliost worth while to miss the operning ceremony in order to begin with the very simple and beautiful commemoration of the man himself which took place in the cemetery beethovens tomb with that of schubert beside it and the monument of mozart just in front of it stands in the centre of the cemeteky the graves of gthers of viennas great artists notably brahms and johann strauss are close at hand those who qame there this morning in taxicabs in tramcars or on foot had a sense of  pilgrimage to musics holy ground and of companionship with the mighty dead there was no display of officialdom or elaboration of cdrermony members of the singing societies of vienna canie bearing their banners and wearing their badges representatives of various bodies carried wreaths a large choir of mens voices and eight trombohe players stood facing the tomb a mixed crowd in thich famous artists could be seen among the rest of us nobodies stood silently and the men uncovered as the first notes of beethovens equali were sounded by the trotbone players only no i of the equali was played and it was immediately followed by the choir singing beethovens  die ehre gottes in der natur with the trombones accom panying afterwards the crowd filed quietly past the tomb and then dispersed that was all thus the sundays celebra tion was begun with two of beethovens noblest melodies in the open air and in the presence of all who cared to comc without distinction of caste or creed or countrythe massthe later events of today have been three the missd solennis at middayegntont with beethovens music at the oera house in the evening and the triple programme of historical opera purcell pergolesi and rameaugiven simultaneously with the bgmoht perform ance in the redoutensaal the evening events must be left for later discussion comiflg straight from the fine albert hall performance of the mia solennis one was struck first by the very different pro portions between the numbers of choir and orchestra and next by the different ideas of tempo which herr schalk and sir hugh allen have herr schalk took the whole of the kyrie very much more slowly than any conductor i have ever heard in england and yet though he em phasized changes of time making the principal theme of the  gloria electric in its energy and on the other hand dwelling on the reflective episodes in a way which sorlietiriies seemed excessive one had at the end a sense that the essen tial repose of the mass had been realized in a wonderful waythe choir cannot have numbered more than  and the orchestra was not much less the two forces were very niearly matched in volume in england we always tend to over ieight the instruments  with the voices here the eloquence of beethbvens instrumental ideas had full importance the phrases of clarinet and oboe almost seeming to sinig the word  kyrie  before the voices had entered was some thing never to be forgotten all through the work one had the feeling thlt this was a mass for orchestra with voices not as we so constanltly think of all choral work in england one for voices with an instrumental background the vienese voices had an almost instrumental quality in their individual energy of attaok and their penetrating tone one mit some of the soft diapason quality to which our choral bodies accustom us but in the great climaxes theie was none of the thinness which we are inclined to think of as inevitable wheni numbers are restricted the solo quartet had mine eliabeth schurtani for soprano and herr richard mayr for bass two singers whose musician ship needs no commendation it was coin pleted by mme rosette anday contralto and herr georg maikl tenor both earnest and able rtistsin speaking of this as a magnificent per formanoe i do nbt suggest that every detail either of conception or of execution was beyond criticism but it was otitstanding in the devotion of all theparticipants to the interpretative ideal of the coriduetor it also made one realize in high degree the cumulative power of beethqvens music one has heard peiformances in which the climaxes of  gloiia  and  credo  are so tremendois that what follows seems less siganiflcant on this occasion there was an interval after the  credo so that the second part began with the wonderful restraint of the  sanctisand was cariied to a conclusion of ihtense spiritual fervour in that sprayer for inivard and outward peace iwth which it the agnus dei beethoven surpassed a h estruggles  ll hig previous
