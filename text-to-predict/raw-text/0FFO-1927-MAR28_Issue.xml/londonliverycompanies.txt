london liverycompaniesgoldsmiths andgtirdlersafter  yearsthte goldemnitls company begin today the celebration of its  anniversary with a banque the ¢ annivesary of the girdler company utas commemorated on march when city companies like the goldsmiths and the girdlers talk of their th anniversary they are not really dating from their birthday they were born as guilds and fraternities in the misty ages before the normaan conquest and the grant of a royal charter might be regarded as thleir comning of age in those adolescent years the principles of association were firmly founded in religion common hell and protection goodfellowship a craft aimed at safeguarding its corporate and inlivitidual interests under a patron saint whaose inspiration was not incompatible with the display of a good fighting spirit on reasonable cause today the same saints rule the same companies but in peace and quietness the girdlers own allegiance to st lawrence and the goldsmiths to st dunstan to whom they dedicated a ehapel in old st pauls and whom they acknowledge in the present cathedral by a mosaic lecoration if anybody is disposedl to let ancient traditions die he is unlikely to belong to a city companybut such traditions have a tendency to make mystery wliere none exists that very word mystery as applied tc the companies reason for being is now held by many coin mentators to have siznified nothing but art or craft so that the mvsterv of the girllers means simply the girdlers art or craft this agaui was not esoteric or symbolical as out siders are apt to presume but the art or craft of making girdles edward iii in an age when every man and woman wore a girdle spoke of  les ceinturiers de nostre citse de loundres  a case of tbe freneh tongue removing all doubt from the english even livery  means what it says for it refers to a time when a craftsman wore the livery the umiform appertaining to his craft and when a goldsmith could be distinguished from a girdler or anybody else by his ceremonial clothesanother mystery or misconeeption whieh used to be rife hardly survives in these days having been cleared awav by various mquiries notably that of the royal commission of  we mean the ilea that the companies inherited fabulous riches from guilds which outlived their original purpose and that the money raised for strict business was squandered in ilxurious entertainment the property of the companies was revealed by investigation but the very obvious modern activities of the wealthier among them have possibly done more for their living reputation such acom pany as the goldsmiths which stands fifth in order of civic precedence in the list of the  great london companies employs its funds in a wide range of educational social and charitable objects it runs technical schools endows teaching posts at universities and colleges founds scholarships carries on almshouses and is in fact a general benefactorgood times and badsecure as is now the public realization of these things there is no general knowledge of the hard times the city companies have passedl through the great fire of london crippled many of them it burnt their halls and destroyed other valuable property belongitig to them for years afterwards they had to struggle to rebuild and replace where they could without sacrificing the interests of their dependent poor the goldsmiths themselves have by no means spent a long life free from want not only were they not rich but they were often in debt during the first few centuries of their existence the prospect was not over bright at the dawn of the th century thon about  fortune tookamore prosperous turn this was two years after the selling of the irish estate which had been part of that glamorous scheme for the plantation of ireland presented to the city of london in  and which proved to some of the companies what a eastle in spain has often proved to other folkmore substantial than any castle in spain are the companies halls while the buildings themselves have been subject to the assaults of time and accident the sites are perennial possessions four halls have been erected by the goldsmiths on the land in fosterlane which was bought by them about  and the girdlers have had three homes in basing hallstreet on the land left them by andrew hunt in  one of the conditions oft the be quest beingthat the said companye

fairly he counted their association with great figures and events in english history but in spite of losses much of more material value is preserved thle goldsmiths possess a giuliano romano and a holbein their plate which as might be expected is repre sentative of many english periods includes the seymour salt mentioned by samuel pepys and the bowes cup out of which queen eliza beth drank at her coronation banquet the  magic carpet of the girdlers has an even more romantic record for over  years its colours blushed unseen or at least disregarded in the hall after being rescued from the great fire it fell upon oblivion at long last the happy thought occurred to members of the court among whom wvas the mfaster sir alfred newton sometime lord mayor of london that the carpet might be worth inquiry fortune favoured their researches which revealed that this very faire long turkey carpitt with the companys arms thereon wds presented in  by robert bell then master and that it was made

elizabeths reign if not earlier the jury has been formed wholly of members of the goldsmiths company before  this jury was charged by the lord chancellor  now the kings remem brancer swears it in and

pretoria separate verdicts are de livered for each branch mintan artistic missionthe goldsmiths have  lately under taken a mission peculiarly appropriate to them for improving design in silver work the chief object they have in view is to encourage the production of plate characteristic of presentday taste as in several directions of artistic en deavour this generation is developing a typical expression there seems no reason why it should continue to depend on the past for a conception of beauty materialized in gold and silverthe company is pursuing its aim by means of competitions and public oppor tunity has already been given to judge the chances of progress prizewinning designs for racing cups and trophies attracted favourable attention at the british industries fair the other day last autumn three cups commissioned by the empire marketing board to be given as prizes in a windowdressing competition for empire fruit were shown for a lay at the royal academy a further competition has the purpose of securing by selection good examples of modern silverwork with a view to subsequent exhibition the success of such efforts depends very largely on the recognition by the trade of the import ance of forming at the moment and representative of the moment a style not unworthy of the finest traditions of english silvercraft a west end firm by an offer of £ for silverwork with the qualiti the goldbmiths company has partic larly in mind has given evidence of the trades readiness to help and this lead has only to be followed to make the goldsmiths th anniversary a year of solid achievement in a beautiful art and craftel
