         w l the progress of iscienceloss of memorysalamanders andearthworsisi oro ouri scielinto cobspondentat a recent meeting of the zoological society major stanley flower described some remarkable observations lie had made on salamanders his experiences were confirmed for some other amphibians by those who had kept them one of miajor plowers spotted salamanders vividly coloured black and yellow iittle newtsgavebirth to abrood of  to  young he picked out three of them and kept them under observation on his studytable they were fed when very small on water fleas and as they grew and prospered oa earthworms  oft in creasing size for some time like most natives of shallow water they were excessively shy the slightest movement the shadow of a hand sent them dashing to the cover of the weeds in their bowls of water and they had to be fed almost by stealth then they became tame talkng earthworms greedily from their owners fingers showing no fear of him and even he thought seeking to attract his attention when they were hungry by violently exhaling bubbles of air through the water but at least showing greedy excitement in his presencein due course the time for meta morphosis approaehed the fringe of exterbal waterbreathing gills became smaller the creatures grew duu and ceased feedinguntilin the course of afewdays the change was complete the brighter colours wof the adult appeared aerial respiration became a necessity and from time to time they crept out of the water tothe rocks and moss of their lttle aquarium then they took to feeding again but there was a difference they were in the same bowls and were offered the same kinds of earthworms by the same hand  now they showed the fear of untamed creatures they dashed to cover as soon as they were approached and once more their food had to be slipped gently into their bowls and was eaten only in stealth when they were left undisturbed the process of taming had to be undertaken once more and it took several months of patience to accomplish during the process of metamorphosis they had forgotten what they had learntto speak of  memory and of  forgetting in the case of animals remote from us is i a sense metaphoricalin our case these terms connote some degree of consciousness it would be safer to say no more than that the behaviour of major mlowers salamanders was such as in our case would be described as the forgetting of a mental acquisition but behaviour must have a physical seat and there is good evidence that the brain is its principal seat in vertebrate animals the change from the strictly aquatic to the partly terrestrial phase of an amphibian brings with it aÂ¢change in habits and instincts to suit the new surroundings the difference is probably less in the case of a salamander than when a tadpole changes into a toad there would be amazing confusion in the behaviour of a toad if once on land having to see insects with its eye and harpoon them with its tongue it were baffled by  remembering  the instincts and reactions of its tadpole stage or if it tried to swim when its business was to crawl some time perhaps the visible changes in the brain which represent such changes in reaction will be worked outothz erxperbrmtsanother speaker at the same meeting recalled experiments upon earthworms first made in this country and repeated on a large scale in austria in which there was a different relation between  brain  and body earthworms lured by some combination of touch and smell were trained to move rapidly along a preparpd course as it were a racecourse thgy were taught to distinguish between right and left turns or to use more careful terms to behave so that at certain arranged points they turned to the right at others to the left in earthworms asin many other elongated jointed creatures the main mass of the nervous system consists of a paired thickening in the upper part of the front of the body a collar round the neck and a chain along the ventral side of the body with paired thickenings in every joint the front ends of the trained earthworms were snipped off so removing the anterior mass of the nervous system after the operation it was stated the worms had not forgotten their acquisition they still raced along the track taking the right and left turnings according to plan so far the interpretation would seem simple there is no magical virtue in eoncentration of the nervous system in a brain in vertebrates there is such a con centration increasingly greater as the scale of life is ascended from the lower fishes up through amphibians and reptiles to mammals and man in the earthworm the concentration is less and the seat of  memory  might well be extended along the ventral cord with its ganglionicthickeningsbut according to the reported experi ments the storv goes farther and into more obscure regions earthworms again like many of the lower segmented animals have a power of regenerating lost parts in due course the anterior ends of the experimental worms regenerated and presumably the new beads  con tained new brains when this bad taken place the worms were found to have lost their accomplishment they no longer followed the cotuse no longer turned right or left at the appointed places what is to be made of it  there are analogies tobe found in the domination of lower brain centres by higher centres in the phenomena of accelerations and in hibitions there may be a  diffused memory in the nervous system of the earthworm which is yet to some extent under the control of the anterior mass and the anterior mass regrown from a primitive bud mav reacquire its old domination although it does not possess the memories  which its predecessor had acquired very few persons really believe if they have considered the evidence that characters impressed on the brain of an adult reproduce them selves in any way on the brains of the children of that adult the reported experiments on earthworms may support that view of heredity as the growth of a new brain from some rudiment in the tissues is comparable with the growth of anew brain from the fertilized eggeell
