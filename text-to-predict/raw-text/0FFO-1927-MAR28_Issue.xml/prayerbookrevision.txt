says that if the new prayer book is rejected all hope of restoring order im the church will have come to an cnd h e adds the majority of churchpeople the great rnajority of angocatehllcs as wedl as evangelicals realize that the irregularities within the chureb are disturbing its spiritual life and threatening its unity no bisbop can enforce the prayerbeok as it now stands but if the composite book is accepted by con vocation by the church assembly and by parliament it will have behind it such tre niendous moral force that a bishop vill be ableto insist that either the prayerbook as we now have it or the composite book should be used in public prayer and in the admini stration of the sacraments the moral pressure he will be able to exercise usually reinforced by his synod will be almost irresistible if the composite book is rejected i see nothing before our church but long and weary years of disorder controversy and weakness the defeat of the proposals for revision will render the work of maintaining order far harder than it is at presenton the question of deferring the con troversial changes he writes i can imagine no policy more weak and fatal txhe difficulties wvhich have confronted the church during the last  or  years havo chiefly concerned the communion service and reservation to refvse to deal with these problems would show both cowardice and lack of
