dairy farmers association  russell square wcl price s contains a uaumber of interesting articles bearing ondairying and much other matter of importance to owners of dairy herds many points relating to thegreat and growing business of milk production and utilization are discussed including features of the popular autumn show at islington mr s i whitley in an exhaustive account of the show and the difficulties of the manage ment of such a comprehensive exhibition refers to the thrice milking of cows he is mistaken however in stating that objection is taken to threetimes milking daily beeause it is bad for the constitution of the animal it is not thrice milking that is held to be pre judicisi to the constitution of the animals but the deep milking that induces it the opposi tion to ming threetimes is purely economic his reference to the habits of the calf in its natural state is not very convincing the calf certainly  milks many times in hours but it would have little leisure if it were to cope unaided with a dam giving six galons or more in that time it is irrelevant to adduce natural habits in circumstances so far re moved from those of a natural order the cow that was to rear her calf could never have been intended to give the  or  gallons in the lactation that is being encouraged con trary to the reasonedconvictions of experienced dairy farmers of this and other countries we have departed far from the natural level with the lo gallon cows and farmers feel that this standard imposes as great a strain upon the constitution of the steady breeder and milker as it is safe

distinguishing merits of  the true hardy strain of montgomeryshire lateflowering red clover which will enable farmers to make a suitable choice where this variety is favoured mr miln detects something akin between the montgomeryshire red and the kentish wild white clover in the manner of their introduc tion into commerce and claims that their merits have been established beyond possible doubtmixed
