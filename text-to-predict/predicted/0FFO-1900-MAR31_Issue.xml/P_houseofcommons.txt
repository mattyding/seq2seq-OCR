rlier in view o the correspondent with the united states in which it was stated that the united states would not commit itself to the recognition of exclevsive rights in any power in any portion of the cinesse empire he would be glad to know whether the govern mently were going to proceed further in the policy of sheres of interest and influence it did not seem to be a line of policy in which they were likely to have the cooperation of the united states or of jan after the action of the united states it was about time the government should reconsider the generals liness of their policy with regard to chanian inform the house of their intention hear hearine the return of the pracex after the usual intercalitation sinclair forfrasher said there was readiness to blame the government for a hesitation and vacillating policy in china but they would be more fair to them if they recognize the development of which the frutis were now being sense in china the great advance russia had made there ought to be adted not five years but years back we had lost ground and russia had a position of far greater influence in china than she had years ago during that time we bad been busy developing enterprise in canada africa egypt and other parts of the world other irons in the fire had prevented us from having a single eye and aim in the development of our policy in china if this debate did nothing snore than clear our minds as to the possibility of the future with regard to china it would have done a great deal of good the bluebook showed that while there was tounch of china for the chinese in the future there were many concession for concessional in the present there were three conflicting policies in regard to our position in china the policy of the open door the treaty of linentian and the principle of sheres of interest or influence it was very desirable they should know how far and in what respect the three policies ovelfuled and con ficted some of the privileges to be conterler upon us we had had for all practical purposse in the pasterver the privileges with regard to the angtcs valley really strong valid and potent for the purpless which to hon member for barnsley sought the undersecretary for foreign alfais would and it diffic cult to answer the questions of his hon friend butwhen his hen friend suggeseed sweeping refroms iu i china by this country in concert with other plowers t at meating the international control of a foultainto of u millions of people which would read to difficultice in the future as the jaurificuon national control of south africa and egypt might toour trade with china was per cent of our w hole trade and he hope it might he extended and develoder he agreed that the chinese had probably no better friends than the british people but his sympathite wnerve with a policy of caution and concentration in china and elsewver because a policy expansion multilided to points at which we were vulnerabled brodicately the hon inember who moved this motion which is a severe condemnation of the policy of the government or of the conduct of the government during the past year although i must say that he introduced his motion with great command of his subject and with a conmanly of thc chinese noneluca ture which we might envy and although the house has listened to him with great pleasure i cannot help feeling that the condition oi the house during a cou sidebable part of the liscussion is perhaps the nest answer to the motion which he put down on the paper because those of us who recollect the character of the discussions on china two years ago and the full louse which was attracted when we discussed this question months ago must feel that there is something besides the absorbing interest wc feel in the military operation in south africa to account for the compara tive slackness of the discussion tonight i do not say that in order to diminish the importauce of the subject or to indieat e that it is the feeling ot the house that it is not the occasion for a vigorous ensuer of the government or for giving the acute stimulus to their exertions which the hon member for barnsley believes is necessary the members who followed the hon nember for barnsley have to a large extent devoted themselves to answering him and in some cases to answering each other mi noble friend the member for the chrolegro division who i venture to say is hear too infrequently iu this honse hear hear deliderade an admirable and interesting discourse to night although he agreed with the conclusious of the ho gentlenina opposite he disgagered in toto with most of is premissed and his particular statement of policy with winch he conclude his speech bas also attracted the censure of the hon member to has just seat down and therefore i may stand upon thisthat the govern ment although no member has spoken imprediate in defence of it has not been without defenderss be other point which has struck me very much during this discussion is that we were discussing the bluebook which deals with the affair of last year document which i regret could not be pilt in the hands of hon menmerse emarried because the discussion caine on rather unexpectedly and in addition to that the dessotaces come up to the end of last year and it is never possible to br ng out a chinese blenemook except after a con sidebable interval althoagh we have been deal ing with the affair of last year ractically hardly any of the criticistim which have been pre sented against the government had to do nith their colduct during the past year we have had a strong impeachment of the original character of our negotiation with regard to port antrah and with regard to the talkang of weihabia a great dacl has been said about the advantage ganied by other antion in regard to concession an the comparative in efficiency of the efforts of our government in the same direction wove have also hear good deal about the state of affair in manchuria but nearly all of these points refer to matter which were antecedent to the period which we arc now discussing and i think you will search the bluebook in vain bulky as it is for any clue to those diplomatic and commercial defeats which the hon member for barnsley declarss had illustrate the whole of the efforts of her manest government during the past year i will take one point alone the hon member points out how little we have ganied during the past year but he does not think suppose for a moment that we can deal witheste matter precisely as we please his complaint is that we have too little influence with the any that the yan keep us at arms length that what we might achieve in a better governed country we ought to achieve in china if only we had not lost the whole of our prestige have foreign powers met with no diffic cultiese from the and is there not evidence even in that bluebook that every foreign power which has been dealing with the anm has found sometimes an obstructive spirit and in almost every case a difliculty in its dealings which it has not overcome i do not wish to emphasize this too strongly i do not wish to put my finger on every case because possibly it might produce a certain amount of feeling in other quarter but in all the more important cases the hon gentleman will funid either that there has been a direct refusal by the aman as is shown in the case of that railway to peking on which ho said a few words or that there has been a refusal based on an objection taken by this government i saw it stated the other day that the organiza tion of the french concession at shanich had been entirely stopped and declined by the anm because her miastes minister would not assent to it that is only one illustration and i am quite certain of this that for every illustration which he gaue us of the impotence of sir claude macdonald in these negotial toins he would find that we were able to give him similar instances affection other powers i should like to say that i do not propose this evening to trouble the house with any detailed argument with regard to manchuria i know perfectly well that it is easily possible to mount up the large number of troops and the freat works which are being carried out by the russian sovernment in manchuria but when i hear these argument i am very much inclined to wonder at the temerity of the hen gentleman opposite knowing that we are a maritime power and that russia has a iand frontier of some or miles with china i am somewhat surprised at the spirit with which the hon gentleman the member for brankess attacks the question as if her manest government shouldhear challenger tbe government of russia for possession of a province which we do not desire to possess outselves and which china unfortunately is not able to keep without the vigorous sapport of her manest government or of some other power but leaving that the hon member refreder to other matter as having been grave failures on our part he specially alluded to the ranglun extension the hon gentleman has been to aulugn and i have not and he has hear there opinosion which no dobnt he has repeated in this house as to the large extent of territory which it was desirable to take in order to seeure what he consider an effective boundary pultet us look into the question a little more cisely what is it we masked for and obtinabed we obtinabed square miles addition to theo colony of hongkong that in itself is a not inconsiderable accession hear hear in taki possession of that it is quite true that we wero forced owing to the opposition which was threateneal to us by disorganizy chinese troops to take this territory of san chun which the hon member seem to regret so much that we have given upmare j wathornape hermar brodireny but when the cause of offecen ban gone i ask the house whether the punishment which we were forced to inflict for that cause of offecen should not be withdraw too hear hear it really smouat to thisthat according to the hon gentleman we were to do an act not justified at all events by any legal con wention or agreement we were to take a considerable further tract of country because we were tem sorely obstructed in taknif the extension at hongkong to which we were enttiled j waltonic said we ought to have tabk a further tract of country in the first instance and thus have secured an effective boundary brodicring quite grant that but i would ask the hon gentleman wither he and his friends ever onsideer in their desire have this extended boundary the probable unmertorion which would be required to maintain that boundary bul hear hear let me say noa word about concession i do not think it bas been seriously advanced by anybody except the hon member that her manest government
