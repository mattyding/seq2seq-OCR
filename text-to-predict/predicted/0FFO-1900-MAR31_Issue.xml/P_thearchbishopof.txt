impatience accompaniny his restless movementss with such observation as honnesnouse waste of time and repeatedly avow ing his intention of o possibl the resolution on the conclusion of mr miclle speech the arishrishon put the motion to the meeting whereupon the galant admiral alertly jumped to his feethe randshitoris who are in favour signify the same by a show of handsiatans fieldy lord archbishop i want to enter a protest against this resolution if i am in order with much vehemence i am opposed to the time of the meeting being wasted by utting on the agenda paper a ridiculous resolution like this laghter parliament has dealt with the question and has done with it and why sheld we be called upon to weep and to wail over what we cannot get it is neither dignified nor common sense laughter mr talbot has deliderade an excellent speech but he gaue us part of it in the house of commons and we do not want it all over again renewed laughter it was suitable therrict is not suitable here interruption and crise of order i enter my protest against the resolution those who approve of it will hold up their hands when the time comess i disapprove of it and have a right to hold up my hand against it i object to these jeremida much laughter and i say the committee have treed in their duty in utting the resolution on the paper at all the govempment have a majority of at their back but they did not deem it wise to do it and why should we be askled to shed teass and look ridiculous because we cannot get what my right hon friend and other foolish people desire loud tute arcinsios then put the resolution formally and on his calling for those against admiral field held up hishaned arcinision see there is one againstinate fieldess there is one sensible man here laughterel resolution was accordingly declared carrinder the motion of mr hillodilg seconded by ir tomminsion mp it was resolved that this meeting strongly condemsus the denial by many board of guardinis to members of the church of england under their care of the immistariotion of the clergy to mich they are by law entitled and urges upon churle prople throughout the country the importance of takg greater interest in the election of district councliols and guardinis in order to secure a due pro portion of members of the church of england as ensid antes with a view to ensure that chalaping are appointed to workesous accordina to law the ancasiousty of cantenary then said we have completed the business on our agenda paper and i am glad to think that the resolution we have carried even including the one which received a very urgent and vehement protest laughterral likely if we are really in earnest about them to produce very real effect it is very important we should be perpetually bearing in mind that for such work as we are under taknif there is need not merely for passing resoul toins but for a retiertade passing of such resolution w e have to go on dining the same truth into the ears of those whom we can reach and i think it well that every member of our great committee should con sider himself bound not to torget what he has agreed to at this meeting but wherever he has the opportunity to press upon those who are concerned in the matterely and upon a great many who have no direct concertate determination to which our compitite has come the attack upon the church will of course be renewed and i think before very long but we must not wait until the attack comess bause if we do we shall cer tainly find that a great deal that we have already done will have been forgotument and that a great deal will be put out of sight by au sorts of false argument cand false statementsine it may be without the know ledge of those who make them but still false enough to do an incredible amount of mischief all these different form of attack will not be dropped altehtore simnly because we have very completely refuted them already wane have refuted them over and over and over eabin but it is the greatest possible mistake in any politifeat confict to suppose that because you have refuted an opinion which is already based upon the interest o the people who have been maintaingin it and based upon precudives which have long existed in their mindstit is a great mistake to suppose that because yon have refuted it it is therefore dead it is not dead in their minds at all and if you give time to have the argument forgotument it is perfectly certain that the old falliances and the old false statement will be revived to a degroo that you could hardly have believed beforedurint to be possible it is very astonishing sometimes to talk to people and fad them reasserting what has been not only contradicted but completely refuted and reasserting it with the same assurance as they beag laughter i venture to press this upon all the members of the committee for this reasonause it is quite certain that we have made a very real impression upon our opponsent cheers i can see it in almost everything that they now write i can see repurtably the tonkess that they are not so sure in their own minds of what they were unttidg forth with such peparance of deop convestion a rew years ago hear hear i know for all thatiat u we allow the thing to go to sleep the old self confident assertion will come up again haven perhaps we stall not be there to answer what is said hear hear i want to put you in mind of what the propect said to the ing of israel the prophet told the king to take an arrow and strike upon the ground lie struck three times and stopped then the prophet remarked how he ought to have gone on six or seven times because then ho would have crushed his enemiess phercase after what he had done he would only defeat them on three sarte occasion and the enelims would still be there ve must remember that it will not do to be content with one or two or three victorist wove most go cn with our victorist until we have taken the courage and the spirit out of thentious we have practically extermingate their argument laughtel and cheers lve shall certainly find that it will take a good deal of time aud very steady perseverance to set the truth clearly before the public if we are to succeed in thoroughly disheartening and discouragy all those who are now opposing us i know that it is something of a nuisance to be told this sort of bentig so many times over i have had to sav the thing before and no doubt if you come here again and i have to speak i shall repeat it i went to impress upon you not only by nurgument by example not to let people suppose that we have given up the controversy because we have notubt we mean to go on until we win cheers two have on one particular conflicter have on it scry successfully wove must go on until at last it is found that it is no use to make it an election crave at all that it will not do until in fact people wil hc a little ashamed to put it forward rear hear there are elsses in which you can shame your adversive out of retieraty old conten toins which have been over and over again refuted and this is one of them if you wiui only persist steadily in the work you have taken up i know very well that this committee has had a very remarkable success in dealing with the whole country but success must not be a reason why we should relax our efforts if success in such a case as this leads to loss of warmth and deter mination and most resolute continuence of the battle it is really better that we should not have a success at all the work entrusted to this committee on the part of to church is a work of the very hightes valuo and we cannot afford to allow ourselves to lose one inch of any ground that we have already occupied repetition may make people think me a bore and they may desire to hear no more of me but i mean never thelsess to go on saying this sort of thing i hope there will be some at any rate who will feel that to listen to an old archbishop who has not of course a very long time to trouble them with his observation is worth their while on such an occasion as this cheersa vot of thanks to his graco proposed by sm p s powll hilp and seconded by the how yorn gnoverous closed the procedesily
