a tremendous fire from every imaginable direction formar miles of rifle its along the river and on three ridges behind enternementer and keat up a continuous fire fromn guns planted everywhere right in the middle of a plain and on every ledge and hillock commanding every approache keat our guns going on any un position that offered and oa the trenches general quller being with us and directing the fire for an hour or so i think we silenced a few guns and am told the ludiet did tree mendous execution in the trenches that we could get atterihe heavisted groun and one that did tremendous damage to our troops in both direction was placed very cunningly behind the three hill upon which their principal position were commanding a broad valley on enact side of them running down tow adross

time were driveni from their guns taknif retuge in a donga i hey lost s guns and most of their officess and many menaay on our left the field artillery with hat brigade were so roughly handled that they also were driven back leaving gnasm which were afterwast recoverabled mildads brigade pushed or doggedly and got into cloness and i was ordered to keep up as hot a fire as possible on the rile its to enable him to carry out the withdrawal which was subsequently ordered the withdrawal appeard to be as hot a business as the attack and took a good long tamebious noon i was ordered to ithard the two in guns and aa soon as the retreating brigade were abreast of sucrey one else having gone bakkthe reamiarade of the guns wnerve ordered to be withdraw and we arrived at the jope we occupied the day before about o the enemy did not devote much attention to us being i suppose too busy with the troops only two guns that i could discover were firning at us and nonre of their shell did us any damage we silenced bothit was extremely diflicult to discover where the guns were fired from the guns were beautifully concealed and were mostly firning someless powder we fired at rangess from to yards the firning vas good and the ludiet shell burst wellit was blazing hot and all hands wowked werl have the honour to be sir your obedient servant p jois captain commandung naval brigade rearadmiral sir robert h harrie mockgoningary lachie chielege catmp december siir have the honour to submit the following account of the part taken by the pr uns forming the battery under my command during the astion i front of cloness acting on orders received from captain jones rn i reporter myself to colonel long car who directed me to attach myself ton uti the guns lad been placed in a suitanble position i therefore directed lieut james of tartar to lead the battery behiud the royal artillery field guns and told him that we were to form up on the left of the royal artery guns when they came into astion about sa the gans behin in column of route march with naval gesm in the rear i was riding in front beside colonel long about adross from cloness station wenk he directed colonel nut to bring his guns into action just in front of a deep donga running across our front at right aes to the railway lhe then told me to come into action on the left and proceeded to arrange our different coness of fire while the royal artillery guns were getting into position ia front of as was a line of tress up to which our slimstress had advanced also a few artillery outpost just as i was about to direct yax gnasm where to go and as the royal artillery were tulmingerine the outpost tt red sharply and a murderous fire both rifle and shell was opened on the guns and amaunition column i immediately galloder back to my guns and found that the fire had caught them just as the two centre guns were going through a drift across another donga parallel to the beforemention one but about yards when the rear men i arrived i found that all the native drivers with the exception of those for lieut james long teasm bead boltte these guns had just crossed the drift so i directed him to take up a position on the left and opened fire i on fort wille from which the majority of the shell fire appeard to corale about this time my horse was shot through the shoulder by a rifle bullet the two rear guns under linent deas of mis philomer not haikn crossed the drift i directed him to take ground to the left and open re also on fort lyvlling the two centre guns undet mr right gunner of his terrible were unfortunately amoumed with their ammunition alons in the drift the wheel of the alons being loaked and the one turned round in their yoke i managed by the aid of scame artillery horse td extitate these guns from tbe drill and to bring tbem into action on each side of the drift to the rear of the donga oe of the horse being shot whistle doing this i could not manage to move the ampunin tion alons as the rifle and shell fire was too severe at the tine a pr maimorinemintly being particu larly attentive and sending tree shell into the drift at every disebrage iteepated messages for more men came back from the royal artirely batterise and these were sent to the front by a royal artillery sergeant in charge of the ammunition column after about half anours fingran as i should judge tbe royal artillery guns were silenced nearly all the men being appranemyly londle or wounded soon after this the fire from fort wille slackeen considerably the comranderin chief now rode up and directed me to move our guns and ammunition as soon as i could the guns were got away each by a team of artillery horse who galloder them up the hill to the rear the alons were fur more discalt owing to their weight the large circle they required to turn in and to the fact that they had to be got out from the drift and turned round by the guns crews before the horse could be put on about this time most brillist feat was performed by two teasm of artillery who galloder to the front against a most mundreous fire lin ered upand rescued two guns a siraligal attempt by one other team at leastrested in the entire tean as far s i roul se being destrode the advance of the infantry on an open plain with little or no cover against a most heavy rifle fire from intercedent position was also a magnificent sight the conduct of our monen without exception was particularly fine the day being a very hot one and tbe work harthel way lens and guns crews of the terrible got their alons out of the drift under ehy fire from shell and rife was quite up to the standard ex pected of all seamen i canto conclude without mentioning the way lieut janses of the tartar selected the i beat stable mosition ad opened fire with reat effect lineus deas the philomer unprofturnty bad a carcaside ... they were moving of to the leet to comer into catition but managed to mount it quickly and brought both guns
