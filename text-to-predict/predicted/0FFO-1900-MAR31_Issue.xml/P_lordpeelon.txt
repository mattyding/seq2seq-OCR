of the minority report there was a good attendance of leadist and gentlemen and among the speares were mr t p vithaber lp to rev b pilionship mr f earedy livloum mr h leawerane mr b winfer and canon clayton a letter was read from e bishop of pectorously stating that he was particularly anxious to obtain legislation cn the liness of the imarity report lord pm who was received with cheer said that he wished to put before the meeting some salient factss regarding the report of the licensiry commissione there were many points in which the majority and manority reports agreed but there were many points also on which they difleder and on many important points the differences were essential first of all there as the evidence on which the reports were founded the witnessed were examined and there was not a state ment in the minority report which was not founded on the evidence to the best of human power cheers their friends who drew up the majority report said that the evidence was of so difficult a character that they would not give ally referencest to it at all on the other hand chapter and verse were given however for every assertion in the minority report of course it was impossible for any toe to rea i through this amrss of evidence he recauded a story of a gentleman who read through johnsons dictionary and when masked how he liked it said it was very interesting but a thlot desultory laughter there was however one admission iu the report of the majority among whom there were members of the trade which ought to be written over every temperance hall as a basis for further legislation the admission was this it is undeniable that a gaintic evil remains to be remeded and hardly any searice would be too great whieh would result in a marked dininution of this national degrada tion he was quite willing to accept that as the basis of future legislation herse as to the immornit report a change had come over the publie mind and it was in a fair way to become adoped by a majority of the nation sir henry campebleblicar man had declared that this report which sounded so impracticable last year contained a series of effective and egutiale suggession cheers was not tht sometiong ganied he wished that all section of tem perauce reformer would agree upon some such basis of regisstatic action as this there were some present who advoncted total stunday closing cheers as chair man of the commission he came to the conclusion that it was wiser at first to try a reduction of hours on sun day why should not those who advoncted sunday closing accept the report which said not only will we limit the number of hours during which licensed house shall be open on sunday but we will give dis crestion to the licensiry authority in au parts of the country to curtail those hours still further or if they please to adopt sunday closing altogether myth then should not subeachlosy go with the immornit report and say do not let us rush ahead of public oimion but let us try what can be done in this direc tion and leave it to the responsible men in the locality to test the feeling of the loality as to what shall be done p there were those who advoncted the elimani trou of the publich by allowing the municipality to take over a house and put in manager of their own who would have no interest in pushing the trade why should they not accept the immurioty report p and why again should not the adto of lockl option mid me pm hiblitionit the minority report included a plan which to his mind was the most farreaching of all the proposition they had madenamely that there should le on the licensiry authority both in the couri of first instance and in the court of appeal represent tives of the people cheers further than that the court that first decided to abolish the licence would be allowed to sit on the court of appeal so that au the reasons which mulenced them might ba fuuiy stated after refrenirn with satisfaction to the bill for includ ing lounthouser in avaless for sunday closing and the bill dealing with the cestion of serving intoxicating licour to persons under both of which had passe their second reading he said that he was often masked why do you insist upon havin alu your minorist report or nothing lie did not do so he wantel as much as he could get naturally but all that was good lie would take if he were masked would he take hat he could get he violul ansure yes but they would never have any great and wideragencas and desecution reform on this linensirg question unless they altered the authority which amdisinedter the law before they could get real reform thoy must introduce the element of popular feeling sentiment and opinion into that authority as far back as the reign of edward vi an act had been passed giving the jubtice power to reduce what were called ale and tippingly house and it might be said by probicationssion what was the good of restriction w en all the actss that had passed since then had failed he could only leadivally you give us one more trial wive you doft a change of system such as i have endevature to point out the licensiry authority must be as pure as they could make it the court o appeal must be as pure as they could make it unless they had a radical chance in the administration of the law all the refroms avaceted would be comparatively valueless because they were not amdisinedter with the singlemingarily which ought especially to prevail in such a matter loud cheerons the motion of mr t p hairren lp the following resolution was adoped that this smeeting notes with satisfaction that both reports of the royal commission on the licensiry laws recognize the necessity for very cousidearble restrictious of the drink traffic and expressed the opinion that the recommendation of lord peel minority report provide a practical basis for immediate and fefecivite lettlesion
