could be broken down and the peopless could be brought really to know each other there would be few occasion for war or even rumous cf war the press universally was engaged in the great mission of bringnif about understanding between the peopless of the world the british press in his opinion stood on the hightes peak of the world journalism in australia the press had endevature to follow the high example set by the british press in his capacity as a minister in australia it had been his duty to impose restric toins on the press hie had never been able to con vince the press of the neeessity of those restrictious laughter and indeed in his own most positive moment he had doubt about them himself cheers and laughter through him then the australian press censor had his being laughter but ho had never been able to understand the working of the cansormind cheers perhaps when posterity came impartially to record the history of these advass it would furnish reasons why the censor of the press acked as he had done for his part he would welcome the day when th need for the censor no longer existed genooan riddle who responded to the toast raid that he had spent the last four years among the censor he had endevature to find out the censors mind and all he could say was that a get doubt stuin existed among british journalistin as to whether the censor had any nend at all laughter nol roo could suggest that the british newspapser had given away one whit of their independence during the war the british press admittde the necessity of a censor but it would regard the declara tion of peace as its independence day when its judgment and criticism as they existed before the war would be restored heresporpytion the toast of the dominion press lobd builir said that he was very proud to entertain such a company he doubted whether since a more representative assengily of our froze commonwealth of antion was ever brought together though he had in his recollection the rst of a wonderful series of galtering nine years ago when his father received at his home in what disreal called beechy buck the inpermalil press conferneac which did noro than was ever known to solidify public opinion throughout the empire before this deathuritt of a lew world there was one eloquent voice they had wished to hear more in these days and that was the voice of lord rosebery for he had been the prophet of the hush before the storm in those days they turned over the lease of the sibline books together and were some what wiser than traunic they paid some heed to the warning word they hear though perhaps not as much as they should have had they been taken into the confledence of government as they were to day he woed this chance of foougniog his fathers footsteps to the grasp of the things that matter and count shown by the minister of information in fol lowingl the great precedent set by the press in bring ing them here to see things at home and abroad as they really are lord bearerofro was one of them nend saw us from tbe standpoint of reatter britain ln the name of the british press he the chairman thanked the prime minister for what he had done to enable the press throughout the empire to do the ful measure of its duty to the public which it served echersemation oncroasc newspaper men felt honoured that their dominious visitor were the guest of the british nation it was the flact time that the newspaper press had been thus received in a representative character and capacity they were here as the observation officess of the british dominious overseas and upon their birdseye view much of our future would depend they would see things in a truer light and a fairer proportion than we could with eyes that were dimmed by the smoke and burred by the heat of the fiery furnace we were too close to the hissing and roaring of the forchingtos of fate until this war was conclude by a just and decisive pleace they could not see things whole but they would at least see them more clearly than we could and they would not he ventured to thinkl find that the old country had aged much in these years of war it might be that thengassited used would be for the first time of britishifior the fourth year of this bloody war britain was pulsating with an energy and enthusiasm to which she had long been a strangerching struck us as astounding new instead ef the old pose of self questionioy doubt about everything including our own right to exist there was a living faith in the righteousness of this high cause while made all things possible the most striking of all changes was the extent to which women had claimed and had obtinabed an equal share with the men in war work and var dutised to the eternal glory of british woman hood cheers wove seemed to have shed for gooddng all that obvious and traditional defect of our qualities which the foreigner behemen to be an in readicable quistinct of the rachete snobbishness as thackeray sad of thinking meanly of mean things we thought less of mean things now perhaps we had as got rid of what our fast friends and valiant alliss the french called senbobis which meating the pretence and assumption of a supelfioly a pride of life over other antion even of our own household that had no justification in aftutut there was a pride that was justified like wisdom of its children and that was the pride we took in the shining achievment of the sister states of the imperial commonwealth cheers when all had on such imperishable fame it was invidious amost impossible distinguish on all the fronts of war the dominion forces had shared renown that could never be reased from human neavor he hear it suggeseed by one of their guest that the part taken by the dominion services in the war had been exaggerated by the dominion press such was not our view the home press did not yield a jot to the dominion press in its genuine and unstined adtritionar for the spirit which had impledel the dominious to send us one in and one in nine of their communitite on the greatest of all crusades during the war the news paper press of all the commentally which make up the empire had formed up on the same alinement and there never was a time when the understanding was better with the vastand various organicion of the empires press the old spirit of downing street which was not confined to the colonial office or to any government office and which even penel tatted to flesterter had been finally excrosied by the compelling necessitity of aprawiss and government newspapser were in the mood for yet closer intimacy and cooperation it was only through the newspaver press that the ninmosd of men could be shape and moulded from dave to day almost from hour to hour to the comminn ideas and purposse of patriotism and union to those who wnerve comping on to the generation of our young and rising hope it was both teacher and preacher the power of the press was bound to grow with the growth of popular government nobody in their sense could allege that the press of the empire was badly informed or weakly constructer but this war had taught them that there whas a need for further understanding and mutual service among themselves the groat divi sions of the newspapser of the empire represented there thangting had many sides and many features they had grown to their full strength and stature on the footing of independence and selfrespect in that way they had become necessary to the machinery of government and were so to an everincreasing degree bult they were not part of the government machine and he hope they never would be cheers criticism was the selection of the best and to give the people the best they could in the way of men and measure they must ever be criticism and even severe criticism and sometimes advascett and even enthusiastic advascett but not the actors and agent of any government no matter what its colour or combination of colurs if they wished the press to be the mouthpiece of the public the british press welcomed its visitors back to their spiritual home by the banks of the river fleet the inky river which all pressman crossed some
