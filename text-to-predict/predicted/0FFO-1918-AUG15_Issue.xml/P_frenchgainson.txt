french agains ontless oigesien humber ... aigssmangir our spead ... army abous magkerel hurmbeter army made another ad vavel last evening north of the boise de theis court not a very big one but one of great value the frene are once more in the park of plessiver lerony which was carried so brilliantly during the march offensive at the same time that the french foiled a german attack on mont pomnt the park and viguage stand in a plain close to the northern edge of the mauif lassigny also in the plain is less than a mile away and mont polon a sort of cornerstone of the tassif from which you look down on both village imost with the feeling that you could throw a stone into either is about the same distance as general humberst centre has at the same time ganied a footing in belaval a short mile mouthwhate of pelsseriawly and close under the southern slopes of moont polon that famous little heighthirg both in march and in the june offensive when it was lost in spite of the heroic fighting of the dismounted curiars sires by whom it was then defended has already coverde the french with glory vill probably soon again fall into their hands this may happen either as a result of a direct attack or in keeping with the atcaist that have governed the rest of the fighting in the district of the turning movement following on an advance on both sidestarked to the east on the other side of ecoubilul general humberst right advanced rather more than a mile to the north of cam bronne and is now only a little way from the cave of which i worte yesterday and from the spur whence one look out eastwards over the valelengerina french bombing squadrons are making the life of the geramist behind their liness distinctly unpleasant on monday night terginer ham nessles st quentin and non all of them concentration station of vital iin portance to the enemy whatever they intend to do were bomed to the tune of touns of ex plisive their liness of communictionar with the rear both by day and night have been con stantly harsased in this w ay by our airmen and they must be finding it extremely difficult and costly either to bring men and ammunition up to the front or to carry on the business of the retreat away from it on the other hand and en revanche they are on some parts of this sector making great use of perite gas as part of their programme of dealing atcesciontinati linedsmary south of lassigny the front ex tend from near courclessly in a northeasterly direction to the south corner of the boise des lossagc close to frenscious and from there with several sharp twiss owing to the lie of the land turn southeast to a point on the lose between ribecour and cambonenter right half of the line has been striking in two direction converging on lassigny the left half cannot i suppose move forward to wheel in the same direction till the army on its left is in position to execute the same movement the operation of the right half may therefore now be regarded as finished for the present theyare frobtive intertus immediate object finished in a very de finite sense the possibility of german counter attack from the fasturess of the make of theis court is practically now ... operation cleared the plateau of the farn of st claude northeast of marelic and establish our position firmly at ecoubilul which we had reachehed the night before parther to the north canny is still in the enemys hands it is com manded on the french side by two farms situated right and left the farm of larco and the farm of canny before the village can be taken the attacker ought to be in possession of both but canny can watith real key to the masif as important to an army advancing from the west as pelmon is to one coming in the opposite direction is the st claude plateau and that we have and also ecoubilul from which the french begin to look down on to the valley of the divetted in the upper part of its course the result therefore of thursdays advance which put the fininsith touches to whath gone on since the attack on the mawil beag is that though the french are not yet quite up to the valley of the divetted the enemy can attempt no effective action on this side of it from or in the musi its beyond the divetted there is a further system of height in the angle between the roads from non to ham and non to channy which formidable position the enemy will probably set themselves to fight another dealing action but that is a separate operation for which and the counter move on our part we shall have to wation this side general humberite men have practically finsted the work which they had to do and have done in most brilliant fashion the front which they now occupy passe just behind the two franstes of canny beyond which it crosses the lassigny road about two miles west of the village and skirts the edge of the park of plessiver recedes slightly for about a miue and immediately pushes out a sharp little salient which takes in belaval from which it strikess down on the farther side of ecoubilul straight to the oisemenes in old french linessa regards the pace at which they have ad vanced it must be remember that it is no longer on this particular sector of the front a war of movement because the enemy hold the old french liness with all their trenches abrian and wire complete from these they can only in all probability be dislodged without serious difficulty by a heavy bombardment hort or long dus the case may be but at all events of considerable force the position at present is that the french have to get up their guns and ammunition and repair the roads and at the same time give their infantr a rest whereas the germans though still more tired haveto advantage that as they have retreated they have stage by stage come bak to their guns in their field position and to all the stores they neededing front of canny where the open ground north of the massive begins the germans have made a particularly determined resistance in view of the danger which threatens them if our advance continuse on tiis side in all to fight ing they have made great use of perite and other gas shell and to french infantry
