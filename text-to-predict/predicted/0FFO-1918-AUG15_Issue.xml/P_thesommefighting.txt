the some i i fighting a battermolto illagelet of a tanfromg our speclal correspondenty correspondent heaicauree aw quiet continuse on the british sector of the battle front last night on the north side of the some our troops had ome fighting on a aracal scale and pushed the line there for adr slightly our front now running from east of and including eithenme to a point about a mile west of bray and thence notwerthesman to the cancer east of dernnactnor it is hardly necessary to repeat the evident determination of the germans to hold the high ground south and southeast of malituae if they can in the recent battle we have not attacked it apparently the th wirtbberen division which was brought in for the attack made by the enemy on august in the area north of the smmoume has suffered so meuh that it has had to be withdrawn i believe there remain in the line here the other three wintbreaked division which have been brought in since our advancteve th the th and the restout of the some the night passed quietly except for artillery fire and aeroplane activity which was intense the germans especially have been shelling the faremilial and vaul villers area heavily at intervals as well as the region by parvilled and enemy aleponage were aevite in the darkness both immediately along the liness and over the back areas no infantry movement of importance however has taken placeat chipilly have this morning been in chiplily and from the high ground east of it looked down on eithenme which the germans at to time were shelling with some industry using chiefly shrapnel i approached the village by the south through cerisy and over the germanulity wooden bridge which spans the river here and passe over the alogoon of the valley bottom the former iron bridge lise with one end in mid stream in a former message i spoke of the extraordinary strength of the village for defence against attack from the north and west lyning as it does below the level of the surrounding country on the valley bottom to which the plain breaks down in sudden jagged alnsus which are everythere honeycombed like old liffelering habitation with dugutso gun position and machinegun posts even to one who len it before the formidable charateer of the position in the right of the last few days fighting was particularly impressive as the tunnelled banks and rugged hill facess lay naked and exposed to one approaching from the southlfistly is but the ghost of a village now the last time i visited it a brigade of gallant canal dian cavalry were there i looked for the buid ing where i was present when officess assembled for a brigade conference i found it would be a poor affair for any headquarters now witn walls pierced with ragged holes and the road though fairly intact all tilted askew like a hat on a tipsy headlal the village is similarly runided and a pathetic sight is the old chure a mere husk with the space inside the broken walls heaped with piless of spilinterily masonry but amid all the ruin on either side of the shattered altar two large lifesize statuse of our saviour and the blessed virgin still stand intact on pesseal against walls and gaze at each other across the wreckage even as i stood there the bullet of a rifle or machinegun from somewhere east ward or overhead by entince whipes wickedly against the fragmentary walls and splinter of stone were flung inside the chure no house remains intact and fet are anything more than heaps of rubble and skeleton basm the chief sign of life in the village was the swallow which have chose this dreadful spot as a gathering place for their journey south and streamiled among the urinclassina out of the vilage to the eastward one could get a noble view of the lovely wind nighst of the rever and of the village of eithenme over w hich shell burst constantly hivel now and again great cloudse of smoke went up from the rumis as a heavy shell ploughed its way through great ... north along the plateau we had spread before us as the germans saw it the ground over which our men had to come to attack the woudsardsh wood and celestist wood on the left and gressarave wood on the right they are not wrecked as many wood are now days but still are fairly leafy the northern edge of the high ground is one wide clover field which in the sunshine today was fut of butter filess but from it one looked across the deep hollow which runs to the bare face of the opposing slope down which our men lad tp advance and at one feet amid the clover were the trenches and machinegun posts from which the enemy commanded that open slope i think it is necessary that one should stand there with the wreckage of the recent battle round one to understand how great an achievement it iras when first our troops pushed across that deadly glacis and by sheer indominatily courage cleared the dark mass of gressarave woodthordero the country is enormously interest ing but the sights are such as i have already describe in telling both of this and other battle fields it was wonderful today to see bunches of our men with naked bocidic gleaming white in the sun bathing in peaceful reaches of the some where doubtless the germans bathed a few days aga one went by the shellof roads through the litter of the battlefield everywhere were singn of the rapidity of the german flight and along the radsside ready to be moved were gathered piless or parks of all manner of booty including sometimes batterise of guns and in one place a whole family of trenthmorrate from great big grandstaph throwing b shell over yards to the latest little in twin instredencavel one village hear today a nice story from australian offercs concerning the capture of raceleaue village on the first day of the battle marechlear was difficult of attack in front in face of its machinegun defencess so two connipase of aus tralians with one tank came down on it from behind on to north the tank went first and was so efficient that after it had preamblite the village thro whas nothing left for the infantry to do then the tank formally handed over the village to the australisa and the corn mandin oifcers of the two companies concerned gaue the tanl commander a full receipt therefonmreit item teceived on august from commlneri tank no one village of macroclica in indifferent repair and softor that receipt is a pleasant souvenir for the tank commander to keep hereftathental also were very valuable in the more recent capturo f molanculor where light tanks or whi est were used as well as the heavy types of mae runces as i told at to time the germans made no serious resistance but our infantry saw the panicstricken enemy running as fast as they could with rippest in pursuit and plougnigh first into one party of fugitive then into another but for the horror of it it was ludicrous and thermang losse apart from prisoners wers heavy the weather is still superb
