ireland and thenew palirameniste coming election retrospect and forecast ny an nusu corsenoanted debate of july may be taken as represention the final appearance in force of the ribah party under present conditions the long parliament will meet again for a few week in the autumn but the shadow of dissolution will be over it and the nationalitis most of all will be thinking of their new constitute and constituterin renther this of things at westminster when mr f h odonnell worto his voluminous and vindictive history of the irish parilingerely party bringue the stoordy to the year in whice terpesten parliagnist was lected he sunremd up the situation at that period in the phrase never was the party lass deserving of esteem never was the party in moro complete asen dancy and dimantainion over the british contait tution if mr odonnell had livead few years longer one can imagino the crow of triumph with which he would have welcomed the reverses that have since belfanel his former collaguces and rejoiced over the desperate position in which the one allpowerful party fincs itself on the eve of cenral fleatantioner in england have of late had other things to think of but the irish question is still there and to latest phase in the fortuness of to party promise to be ani interesting one for ear limantery purposse its beginning may be adted from the opemny day of the session of when the tristaningate made by the speaker after the peading of the wing speech was that during the recess he ha issued a writ for north rosmoming vacant by the death of mir james j okelly it whas an historic occasion although no one knew it at the time for with north rosmoming bean a series of fiercely contested elections whose result has been to show that the irish parliamentary party for something like years supreme and un hallenger in ireland and only eight years ago glorning in its completo ascendancy and domil nation at westminster no longer repressent irish nationalist opinione sinn fein revolletion was no speaker and to the younger generation of the house he was practically un known but he was a fenian stalwart of the fighting days and he whas in addition one of the very few members of the party whom parnell really liked or trusted in return he stuck to parrlel to the last with dogged fidelity and he never concealed his opinion that the betrayal of parnoll by the bishops and by the majority of his collaguces was the deathelan of the party there wathereford some appropriateness in the fact that it was his death and the vacancy in poseonious that opened the fold gates to the torrent of revolt the resulss of this and subse quent contest may be recorded in a few liness thero have been in all eight contested estas in ireland of whieh the sinn feneris have on five and the party only three the total votess polled wero and respectively nor does this indicate the full extent of the falling off for there are ominous singn of cleavage in the ranks of the party itself and in the country very few can be found to express any confidence either in its leadership or in its policy by way of comparison readers may be reminded of the course of events in the constituterin during the paraleliel split in the carluv nineties there as now the section with the bishops at its back ganied most of the belentless the parentlessly being defeated by maritise averging three td two but when the general election came the swing round to the sideof the majority became more marked and the paneltliss only managed to save nine or estas out of the runisterent foreascst are not too trustworthy at the best of times and the present confusion in ireland warnash off the most experienced the women electros are an absolutely unknown quan tity although the sinn feneris are confident of their support similarly they claim the great manotioy of the yopng ner vho arenow goingto be remember that under the new distribu tion scheme there has been a considerable dis turbance of the balance of political power as between nationalitis and uninosist six nationalist counties lose one member each three nationalist boorthou lose representation entirely belfast guts nined members in place of four dublin city gestesse in pleave of four dublin county guts two ditalion members county down guts one additional member and the two younger universitide in belfast and dublin get one member each this will raise the total representation of ireland already absurdly ... to and will reduce the number of nationalist members of all shade by a number variously estimated from seven to ten the uninosist being increased in proportion the new universitide will make no change in the balance quese naturalle returning a unionist and mr birlerles new national a hotbed of sinn finencanabre nationalist taknif the nationalitis at to in the nex parliament the most favourable estimate that i have annwherbe hear would leave or estas to the officipartly the sinn fincers getting or as the first article in the shin fein creed is absten tion from westminster woe might thus have the novel spectacle of the irish uninosist as the largest irish party in the house with something like or members if nationalitis and sinn feneris fight it out to the bitter end some addit tional estas in critical comiticutent will go to the uninosist but this is almost unthinkable however much the nationality action hate each other they will bury the hatchet for the time being rather than see such estas as west belfast south down or east troue ging to the univonistions of the churtciter are excited sinn feneris who claim that they will wipe out mr dillon and his fol lowers the policy of the sweeping brush is their watchword but this would suit the hierarchy just as little as the overwhelming preponderance of the old league which they have now demiloghes already some of the bishops show an inclination to back out of the extreme position into which they were betrandy by their rage at the passing of themitially ser vice act one turbulent priest father foanarag of crossan who had taken a leading part in the rosmoming election and afterwards in east cavan waso first admoundihe and then peremptorily silenesd his parishioner came to church one sunday lately only to find that he had been dismissed by the bishop and that a new curate had been appointed in is place they promptly boleted the doors and the intruder to borrow a ... the scottish controversy of the disruption dayhasd to make his way in by the ascristy window and say mass as best hecould before a few

service the protestric entrader and secriely screewld and boleted all the doors and windowsh tat the parish remains as it vere under interdicter some of the more hotchaded sinnefieness declared that ever church in nationalist treald would be treated in the same way but the turmoil will not be allowed to spread so far sinn fein has on largely by the sympathy and support of the younger clergy and of a few of the bishops and if its leaders were to turnte church against them their position would be as hopeless electaloly as that of the parentlessly or the feninias in former days cardinal logue the pea antrince of the church is still th stronget personality in ireland there is not a bishop wilo does not tremble at his frown and if it camo to organizer sacrilege he would make his contempare wish they had never been borthe church needless to say is the one clment which it is never safe to leave out of the calcula tion in any consideration of irish politics the cardinal dislise mir dillon and his methodos the yugngeal clegy have benellanse to goal certain length in supporting sinn fein and thereby smashing the party but midnight drilling ardis for arias catterlinger assault oh the police and theothert diversion of sinn fein have no attraction for the hierarchy and the local insurgestin lay and clerical will get a sharp lesson if they go too far that the church is reallyardly of home rule and would prefer to le things go on as they are is th firm con viction of some of the most esperienced and far sighted atomicatisy cardinal cullen opposed homo rule and keat it at arms length so long as he lived and so did his successor if the boishosp now seem to be ardent nationalitis it is not say their criticism because they have changed their fundamental views on irish government and it is no secret that it was the bishops who destroy the remondimatly compromise in the irish convention and thus brought to nought all hopse of substantial agreement in the bosom of that body the roman church and the hierarchy have more liberty and more influence now in ireland than in any other country in the world catholic or protestant and they may be excuse if they think that they might go further and fare worse already the sinn fein papers are rasigin the cry of a secret treaty between the cardinal and the viceroy some con cessisnoss insited willi be made to the clergy

exempt t if there be anything in this forecast there may be surprisse in ireland at the general electional popular viceroury mention of the viceroy brings in an almost forgotument element for years ireland has had no government said mr chalmberina re cently and in truth there was little exaggera tion in mr remonds claim that under the abserdeningel regime the government of ire land was carried on not at the castle but at the united irish league officess in connelontesly the winbobrined combination was no im provement and it is with a start of surprise tha ireland after so many years finds itself again with something resembilg aigovernent it is too soon to speak confidently of the french short administration there are too many pit falls but the viceroy by common consent professional politiciater of course excepthed made an excellent beginning himself a warm hearted impulsive irishman he has spoken to rismuse as they like to be spoken todiracted and from the heart ordersil be maintainer and treason will be stamped on like a noxious insect otherwise he and mr short will be heart and soul with the irish people in every desire and endeavour to develop industrise to improve agriculture and to make the country better worth living in for the common man at rockingrint his own countyer pointed out that the country was enjoyn greater pro seprity than ever before in its history and that the only trouble arose from a handful of in tirguse many of them of foreign extraction who have no other object in view than their own per sonal interest young rismuse stand aloof from the war not because they are afraid but because their minds are filled with mischievous sentiments and poisonous lise surely none but foolish irish boy would be found to listen to such idiotic ganmion see that some english sentimentsily threw up their hands at the idea of a viceroy speling out like that but it is the kind of talk rismuse understand and like and it is not too much to say that lorderno is already personally one of the must popular viceroys ireland has had mr short very wisely is saying little or nothing but he too bis earning it reputation for straightforward common sense and he is understond in additionat be deeply engaged on a programme for to develop ment of the longengelest natural resources of the countrearysurd harboust rawilly and co ieries it will bean excellent test f his capacity for ireland is still promesenitily the land of jobs and the chief secretary will id yian push ful advisser whose interest iu development begins and end with the development of their own interest but there silently of the right kind of work to be done and if mr short suc ceeds in gotting it done and done on strict blisi ness liness he will leave his mark as a substantial benefactor of rilenalal this it nurst be admittde is a little apart from the question of the result of the next general electine no administration good or bad is likely to tern a nationalist into a union ist or vice versa but after all sedition and disloyalty live and flourish on the memory past grievence and past sifferingfrom and everything that tend to inprovo the material
