of questions to selected persons and boyise of persons competent to assist them these included persons conversant with banking commerce lav shipping accountancy and the stock exchange evidence was also given before them orally by witnesseas question of hign polictte question which lav in the forefront of their investisity and to which they attritube prime importance was that of the employent of foreign capital in british industrise in their report the committee statete prelimanry question whether it is desirable that foregigy capitalossiple be freely attracted to this country is one upon which there was little if any difference of opinion the maintenance of london as the financial centre of the world is of the first importance for the wellbeing of the empire any thing which would impede or restrict the free flow of capital to the united kingdom would in itself be prejudicial to imperial interest and anv legislation which would tend to impede or restrctie the free flow of capital here by impossing restrictious or creating impediment ought to be jealously watched lest in the endeavour to prevent what has come to be caued peaceful penetration the normal course of commercial development should be arrested it is to be bornee in mind that at the conclusion of the warif it should be conclude upon such terns as we hope and anticipateltice is no probability that the countries which are now to enemiess of the alliss wil bo those which will be in possession of capital looking for external employent outside the coun trise of the alliss it anmy be said speaking generally and subject to exception of no great moment that europe will have little surplus capital to invest the foreign capital which we have to contemplity be catal flowing not from the central emides of europe but from other parts of the world of which america may be the chief to impose restrictious upon the influx of capital aimed at our present enermise with the result of deterrain the fow of capital from say america would be a policy highly injurious to to economic recovery and renewed prosperity of this country after the war for these reasons we are of opinion that in all amendment of the law falling within the scope of our reference the expediency of the attraction of foreign capital should be steadily bornee in mind and anything which would have a restrictive or deterrent effect should as far as possible be avodideat the root of the whole matter the committee point out lise a question which is not one of company law amendment at all but one of high political and economic policy they observite does not fall within our province to inquire whether the traditional policy of this country to admit and welcome all who seek our shores and submit themselves loyally to our laws ought in the case of some and what alines to be revised whether any and what restrictious ought to be imposed upon the alien who ip any one of these three character seeks to come here or whether discrimination ought to be made between an alien of one nationality and an alien of another that is a question of high political and encoon mic policy which it is not for us to determine the ques tion of naturalized british subject as distinguished from british subject britishborn is again beyond ouri sphere we mav probably assume that as regards alines generally there is no intention to change the traditional policy of the country and that we have to inquire whethertat being soany amendment of the law of joint stock companies is expedient having regard to circumstance arising out of the war but as regards alines who are now our enemiess it may be that the british empire may adopt the policy that a special stigma ought to be attached to the german and that neither as an individual nor as a firm nor as a corporation ought he for a time at any rate to be admittde to commercial fellowship or to any fellowship with the civilized antion of the world the existence of these questions has greatly increased the difficulty of our stafk until the policy is kindow it is not possible to say how the companies actss should be amended to give effect to it it has thus become necessary for us to indicate our conclusious n alternative form according as the policy adoped in these respect is one or anotherival barshelownoly committee recall that in april the com mitite appointed by the board of trade to investis gate the general question of trade relation after the war reporter against impossing restrictious upon alines becoming shareholders in british corporation but in favour of definite information as to the nationality of the shareholders in every british company on the other hand lord balfour of burlegist committee in december dis couraged any attempt to secure this informationg of those who have made written replise to the questions put by lord renburby committee or who gaue evidence before them expressed opinosion in favour of disclosure of nationality by all share holder and in some cases of limitation of the pro portion which alines may hold of the share capital of a company others on the contrary are im pressed with the mischief which may result from restrictious whose tendency will be to deter the influx of foreign capitately report gloes on to state that if foreign capital is to be attracted here it followis that so far as such capital is invested in or utilided for the industrise of joint stock companies it must be represented either by share in suesh companies or by debenture represention indebtedness by them and that its employment must be controlly by board of direc tors appointed from time to time by the onerss of the invested capital the question therefore is whether restrictious ought to be imposed upon the extent to which the control of the company shall be alloved to reside in alines either by reason of their holding a majority of the share or of the debenture or by reason of their obtating a majority upon the board fistroetird and if so her thed closure of their alien character is to be enforced before dealing with this question the committee point out difficietus which present themselves in the way of securing disclosure of nationality and ensurging that alines sh not command the control assuming that it is desirable to prevent their doing so the law of trust is firmly establish in this country if a be the registered holder of a share he is not necessarily the beneficial owner he may be a trustee for b to cinct that the registered holder must be a british subject effects nothing for b may be an alien and an enemy suppose however that you enact that a when his share is allotted or transfreer to him shail make a declaration that he hold in his own rightor that heold in trust for b and that both a and b are british subject there is nothing to prevent the crea tion of a new trust the next day under which c an alien enemy will be the person beneficially entitled the only effectual way of dealing with the matter would be by a provision that the share might be forefieted or might be sold and the proceed paid to the owner if an alien should be or become beneflically entitled to or interested in the share such a provi sion does not in the general case commerid itself to us as practical or ... to be de creadingf pointed out these difirculitel the committee approach next the question of policy bearing in mind the sources from which as indicated above foreign capital may after the war be expected to come they then enumerate the questions which must be decided i is it desirable to legislate in the direction of forbiding the employment of foreign capital here in joint stock companies unless some such pro visinoss as the following are satisfied that there shall be disclosure of the aleircanater of the foreign owner that not more than a certain proportion ofthe compansy share shall be held by alines that the board or a certain proportion ofthe board shall not be alien andia is it desirable to discriminate between one alexand another and to legislate in that direction in the case of certain alines and not of others n our answer to these questions we find it necessary to discriminate between different classes of com raise and we divide them intoscast accompanish general not being companishites classes b and class romanicas wonning british shipping and class compansive engaged in key industrise the remainder of the report it is officially nonncued will be published next week m i
