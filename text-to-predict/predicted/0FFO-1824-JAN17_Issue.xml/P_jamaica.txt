passide in the white island with one voice exclaimed against it it was a most expensive obnoxious and oppressive measure without being of the slightse utility the hon member who at the time opposed it proweside what would be the result and which vas now come to pass the house had been sedicted into the measure by the hypocritical pro mises from home that no further interference was contemplate by government in our local condition and he would show that go vernment did give such a pledge by stating that a registration not emancipation of slave awas their only object and the island there fore passed the bill as apachereation butthulatedly not been keat and thereforemer assembly would be fully justified in repeal ing this bill thc hon member then read frinm the message of his grace the

any intention on the part of his alares tus government thereby to propose their emancipation this ex plantation has become the more necessary as great industry beserive exertedent which could only have proceeded from ignore or mis chiovesous ... to blend these object together and it is fit that the pleasure of the prince regent acting in the name and on the behalf of his malesty should not be misundersualy on so es sentail a pointon aix speaker that was the soletnan pledge that was given that no other measure regarding our slave population sbould be agitated in the imperial parliament by the discussions which have creany taken place iii parliament they have forefieted that pledge and we are aboles frammnaly continuing this bonk obious and useless bilthel hon cnimber then adverted to the hypocritical mensnas re sorted to by mr wilberforce to get the measure cartide in the co lonels by making the slave trade the cloak to cover his real in tendos but he had now shown his cloven foot and it therefore be hoved the house to defeat if possible his iniquitous designs and the first step should be to getrid of this troablesslom bill which cost the country every third year and was utterly useless for there never had been a single negro imported ito the island since the abolition he hope the house would remistate against the proceeding at home with spirit and finnrense he hope indeed that though the island was a small body it would show on this oc casion that it possesseat a great soul crise of hear him hear himmer bluth made some comments on the biu which was sent from england and said that the registry bil was the most obnoxious act that ever had passed that house and he hope it would be repealedry whitfield hope the proposed bill would pass the house pan iniousionsly had had now years experience of it and had found it a most oppressive act it would never have been carried in that house but for the pledge given by his malestys minithest that they would not in future interfere in our internal concernas that pledge they had broken and the house was no longer bound to continue the registry bil the honebural member said it would be tune cessary for him to take up the time of the house on a measure the policy of which was so very obvious it could no longer be ques tonied from the conduct pursued by the fanatical party at home that they meditated the destruction of these islans shall we then assist in such destruction by adoting measure attempted to be forced upon us through their instrumentality hie hope not and should toe for the billmr hysolp followend the same side and observed that the registry bill was forced on the island under the idea that the slave trade was stuin carried on after urging other topics in sup port of the bill he

journal of the th of novembere hermly congratulate the country on the change in our pro spect in respect not only to this offensive law but to the general system of our politics the repeal of the registry act or which anumate to the same thing the refusal of the house to pay its at tendant expenses wit convince muinstiver if they are to be con inced by human agency that although we may bend a little yet there is a spirst a heart in jamaica that not only dares to stop whentis enemy foolishly imaginess that he has vanquished resistance but that can also rally and become the assailant and will back the ground it had lost the registry act was a concession to the british parliament granted upon certain conditions those con ditinose have been violated and pharimanest wil now be tangt that good faith must be keat with us as well as with other contraction parties and that we are not quite silly enough to be their dupese although we may not be strong enough to resist their banytoness wiully before our readers in a few words the circumstance under which the registry act was passed the abolition of the slave trade after a long struggle was made the law of the empire the colonial legitasuler consented to pass actss inflicention the penal tise of fandoy on traders in slarse but the abloitionation had been too long accustomed to a single topic to change it readily for another and indeed they liad a natural affection for that line of action and thought which had ganied their celebrity and away from which they were extremely ignorant and totaly insignificant ino wonder that they continue to harp on the same string and that their ... only in poisonous wedseas a slave ship in every vessel that stiaded the ocean and a receptale for slave in every creek and inlet in the west indies our labour said they is incouplisetery there remains the mantremet possibility of the planter hiding among their old agands new importatiot of slave once put on shore there are no means of detecting the crime or of bringnif to punishment these menstelear nengrose are or may be landed in a corner hurried up the country divided amongst the estates and thus the slave trade be keat alive in spite of the prohibition of parliament it was in vain that the colonial laws in aid of the abolition law were refreder to they were denide to be efficient and their framers were insulted by the insolent denial of the integrity in which they had freamide them in reply to the fears irepress by the west insins that emancipation was tied ultimate object of the friends of africa it was repeatedly and confidently asserted that complete abolition was their sole end and aim that they conceived all the evils in the islans to be caused and pereptucater biertiodly importatiot of nengrose and that should such fresh importatiot be effectually stopped all the restugrish safely be left to the colonial authoristic and to the slow but sure march of civilization the british parliament had passed the abolition law almost unanimously the excitement was still alive and it was to be feared that the parliament in the feruor of their philanthropy would not refuse to overstep the con stitution

effect our assembly prefreder to yield to alr stephens reasons for a registry of slave rather than to the authority of the imperial government ourasmessly found less degradation in submition to the dictation of a igaresslable pleeter tran in waintine interposition of parliament which per haps never would have been attempted that mr wilberforce and mir macaulay and mr butaon and mr stephen and the noble earl bathurt will rage and storm when they hear of our legisla tive proceeding that they will call us all the bad names the abo liton lexicon can supply tenm with we think we have good reasons for expection but that they will enlist the commons and the loress of great britain in their preposterous quarrelur have no fear and even if they do our rights are so fenced round by immemorial custom and positive lawand above all by the plainest policy that not a breach nor an unguarded posture fadll be found whereby to intor dulec their eureds lensenst of confusion so long as
