ceclfisticaw commission letter to tee bloo of exterm with consideration on the litter of the bishop of lincoln and the chargos of the bishop of london lincoln and glosester and bristlous by a dignitary of tihe churchet above is the title of a pamphlet beyond all doubt and all shadow of comparison the ablest that has yet appeard on either side respection the opera toins of the celebrate ecclesiastical commission indeed if we were totaly ignorant of the real author and his work were not addressed to the bishop of exeter we should on a guess have been disposed to ascribe it to the keen sagacious and eloquent prelate himself at present the reasons we have ascride refute that supposition we still think there are errors occeasionally committed in the reasoning and false views often entertained on the state of public feeling by the dignitary of the church both of which we shalu endeavour to point out neither are we disposed to give up wholly the ecclesiastical commitsionery to his ascrass or their labour to his reprobation we still think that they have done some good and at the time when the body was first formed by sir robert peel stayed and prevented much mischief the truth is with respect to those eminent persons the archbishop and the bishops of london and lincoln that on the opening of the comen mission they were bornee on the full tide of public opinion both within and without the church there was a loud and general cry for reform and under that feeling they were more reaporacy for the little they did or recommended to be done than for the expobiation of their changes since that time the general ardour has cooled the tide has set in a contrary direction and the commissioner have in consequence been partially left aground various have been the oopermation causess of this refultte chief probably the awaekend zeal and industry of the church itselfust indigation its exclevsive capacity to take the lead as the great public instructor but one wc have no question has been that assigned by the bishop of lincoln in his letter which we reviewed on its appearancetic reformation really introduced by the commissionet dignitary is peculiarly acute in pointing out certain differences existing between the several publication of the three bishops who have written or deliderade charges in defence of the reports of the commissioner let the following be taken as an example but there were parties within the church also her advo catse and defenderss who were as it is new declared equally the object of suspicion to the commissioner from the very entrance into their office bishop laked inform us i knew that the commissioner could not stir a step in the ex ecution of the duty imposed upon thome without disturbing iu a greater or les degree longestablished relation and thus arousing the oppositive of all whese feelings or whose interest rendered them desirous to maintain things in their present state on all these accoust i expected that our pre ceedings would be acrutidely with an unfriendly eye and be criticiest with unsparing severity the event has fully realized my expoctation the attacls upon us have not been confined to our measure they have extended to our motives aud intention and in some cases have even assumed a per sonal character i do not it is true find this prophetic spirit in prejudice of many persons avowed by the other episcopal commis sioners bishop bloifiel seem expressly to contradict these unfavourable anticipation in the following words no want of confidence in the commissioner so appointed was eveniced at the trom on the contrary some of those who have beon the least sparing ir their attacks both upon the appoint ment of that body and its recommendation did not hesitate to furnish them with suggession some of which if publicly known and compared with the objection would ex cite no little surprise due consideration of the above will easily renocn cilc the apparent difference many were ready to offer their suggession to the commissioner on their en trance upon their labour that was the proof of confidence and as was then foreseep the same per son abused them afterwards for not adoting the suggession of even greater changes which had been tender to themthe following deserves attention the refection however cast upon the interested clergy on the part of the commissioner are accompanish with others upon the circuh herself the alleged motive of their whole undertaking is a suc cession ef gross abusess glaring ineluatibly lonegits ing anomaless in the church of anomaless truly i may ask what can be so great as that of the comnisionis itself i but what abusess or rather what do the clamborer against the church in open hostility against her mean by abusesian what do the commissederile themselves mean by abusess if things totally different are meating by the two par tise then the same term should never have been used by our own head in point of fact the commissioner properly characterize their own use of the term the bishop of lon don prescrist strong and vigorous measure for the correct tine of abusess and removal of anomaless while bishdor monk severely stigamints such usage of terms when he says the enomise of the establishment clambored about such ineluaively which they tremed church abusess abusess are one thing defectss are quite another the latter may with out strong or vigorous measure sine sleript be gently and wisely removed bishop kaye addus his quota of condemnation against the mischievous effects preduced by statement industrish ously propagated respection the inordinate wealth of the establish church these statement the report of the commissioner that more large one for inquiry into ecclesiastical revenue says his lorssial appears effece tually to have answered while doubtless the sum and sub stance of the bishop of londos correction of abusess meating only the redistribution of what moderate revenest were new proved to remain to to church and the ono great motive which his lordship expressly statessa the paramount object of the commission sweeping down it seem every argument of prescription of right or even sacred obliga tion before it was thismones we want for these pur passe all that we can obtain from whatever sources derived rentin fact unlimited equalization and conficestion for pastoral purposse how greatly conducive the orderfo nebri lity and gentry of this land might be thus made to the general interest of society if threefourths of the nobility were sweat off the stage of the constitution and their estates con fiscated to build courthousle and endow judgession for dis pensing cheap justice through the land well might such an interpretation of the increased efficiency of cathedral and collegiate boyise taken to mean the efficiency of their money otherwise disposed ef have aroused on the sudden all the alarmas and outterice which the sagacity of the commis sioners had foreseep unless perhaps their forcosat had otherwise calculate that a transfer of efficiency as well as of money was to take place on the evacuation of the chapter and thus solitude in the caterdarg to introduce not only peace but plenty and prosperity into the curstchily in relation to the above we must dwell upon the change produced in the public opinion any man who at the time when the expression just quoted were used by bishops bloifiel and kaye had de unied there were abusess to be reformed or defectss to be supplide in the church for we do not allow any such great difference in the import of the words as the dignitary would intimate would have been thought out of his sense that the public mind has been dissuabed with respect to many of the imputed abusess more especially with regard to the revenest of the church s again assert bas been owing in part to the publication of the first report of the com missionery then it was that the change first begem to take placen shau continue our
