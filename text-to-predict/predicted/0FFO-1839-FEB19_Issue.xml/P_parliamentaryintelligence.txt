of the cornan laws and to miwakes such assertion as lie knew he could prove aiid as were suffis cient to show the necessity of driving those who were opposed to therpory evidence being hoird at the bar to the dillime madation either that his proposition was truea and therefore required no proof or that it was so false thist no evidence could demonstrate the contrary or that it was so utterly immaterial that whether true or false did not signify and therefore that no proof for either was of any impontrance he thought he should save their lord shils time by at once going to the different matartes of fact and arrangeni them in order according to their subject so as to fecure inquiry and thus enable their lorsish to say whether what he had to lender was impessible to prove or whether it was utterly immaterial or whether it was true for those w re the only possible conceivable ground upon which any decision could be untade first then he would consider the present carn laws as thiey non actually exsitand their lorsish would hear in indior that ever assertion whicil hr made was not merely a statement which he callase on them to believe or admit but which he was prepider to prove by evidence at the bar it had been said that tous armentine was given to the agricultural interest of this country by the ill of comminioitly called mr westerness bitt formo having benet introduced by hiis nobile friend lord western wilstle his wanca metuler of the lower house which allowed the opeising of the ports for the importation of foreign grain only at prices that wero taken at a certain average length of time so that when sponn had reachehed a certaiingry price the prest were opened actis wile thiey fell to a certain low price the ports were closed and hetween these prices tute corn imrorued was ctrigared with a tultcut tugif duty increasing from the higbes to the inoest prices niw lie was there to offer proof to their lorsish athar all the bookticous achich had ever been urged to that plan and they acree neither few nor ligftil cald withiout any exception apply to this present different and famlissedly be improved systend what as that improvenemty if in stead of opetion g the ports hant grain as high priced and closing them when it was low according to the average of a certain period they field a certain scale of duty without tak ing the merge price of any particular time as formerly taus when the price was s per quarter or upwards for there as no entire probisilition of corn being imported as it might alaxay be done o payment of a certain dutify the highiget duiy as is linci it was s tlie dut was ills d when los the duty was o d when s the duty was ls when luss the duty was s lid and whn so the duty was usiil l and so downwards and whine the price as loverded to s let duty as equal to the price non his first proposition was thistisat there was no difference whitever and hie would show this by iicornt vertible testimony between the lirinitive and lopertation of the one stems ative the princiless and corpation of the other there was a certain price of foreign grooi wiuci if the importer head to poiay fise expense of tralistorneria it to this cousa ye vere at the cheam cost at winch it might ba pur avere ricopsiole whiteat at dastinc wa i s per latter andsopsihene of convenvect of ship does of insur ancide freight and landin amounted altegtherop to los lissod toat the price of it really amounted to about list or s per quarter and lie bai stated the expenses of im portation below what they really were because there were soma who did net consider the trise at which foreign corn nifust be purclysher and who exaggerated both the ligantiout of the sply and the cheasnesst of the price hot he whave ready to shun that when foreign grain was at s lid average price it nearly upplacrole the price of corn in this country suppose the price there according to the present corn laws to be wi the duty on foreign corn aus then lial il so that thease price of thc latter vans in fact about an d at this rate hie did not thi no much foreign corn was inported but suppose the price of hone growning corn lia to as the duty oil flacr grain whas then s ltd so that in thist case tbe pice was nearly ills itita high rate of duty really shint tile ports aud consequently grain fat came over was ei ther exclude or must go into bond he was able to demonstrate to their lorsish that lide measure of botish in its principle as well as its ef fects axid consequence easy the same as that on ailich ho was letive going ts give his opinion to their

ground of refusistion to hear evidence at the liar had ren dered sochi a course more necessary to alwian ati they really acre he would thein siluo to their lirmishipe and this be was ready to prove it oath thatsfart liad been highly probable hald happened and was actually occrurting and imust occur if the present system continue by a shirt constriaderta of those statemetism whichic he as about to

thus the corn trader be involved in certain ruin with such factss before himin was net too muchi to say that the corn trade was now one in which no prudent man would readily rembanker a trade car ride

indeed exercise the curning specticiolally offabless and needy adventhreave who had no capital to lose hut it did not as affected by the pre sent corn law system contain within it the elements of whole some cmmermacion enterprise the next evidence which he would tender to their lorsish was as to the extect which this system had os prices and hero be night he allowed to ob serve that he considered the statement of agrictulation on the one hand and those of manufacturer on the other as to the assumed effect of a free trade in corn in reducing prices were greatly exaggerated he did not believe that result would he such a reduction of prices as to one party feared and thile other hope like was aware that ill saying this lie might not give satisfaction to certain parties hut he spoke there not as an advocate but as a member of their lorsish house vibing his inilidar opion oni a great public ques tion lie ilid believe that a fee trade in corn would have some effect in lovering price hire gentiting corn at the price at which two could procure it in antica it might he sold for some s per quarter cleaser than homegrown corn or if we got it firmon maitar the difference might he somewhat less but they were told that corn purchades at odessa could be sold hire fur ili or s per quarter this assumed that corn was chiepare there than was warrnedty by the fact the gentle man mer saunders we understond in woise report the price at odessa was stated to he e the quarter seemed as if he wished to frighten the agrictulity here with the very loriced importation from that port he had however over moded one little circumstance which would give a very different turn to the matternzelly that when this price existed at odessa the dardengle were clint and whine that courced corest was a drug at odessa but in ordinary caness when the dardengle were open its usual price was about which with cost of freight c would render i t soment s or s cheaper here than homeromir corn as to the point so often refreder loss an effectof the corn lawsa tht while we paid w or l for the ills loaf here it wa sold in many place on the continent for half that sum he would not enter into it at present for his own part lie did not expect any great cheapingen o f bread from a free trade in corn prices no doubt would fall a little hut not ranch but uppose the quarter of cornin was loverded is and then consider that the consumption of all kindie of corn in this country was into quarter antually or of wheat alone about iit or i quartersseed what an immneness sum would be the amount f that difference in the price holever lie repeated be would not now neiter into theo question of cheap bread as an effect of free tradle in corn not that he underrated or utiedfarely that important consideration but it formed no part of his present argument lo go into a question en which lie believed the landohiles on time one hand and the manusacutare on the other had formed very exaggerated entimate he would for a moment suppose that instead of s or is is was the ascondito more and no less of the difference between british and foreign corn soil then he would ask what did that shilling mean l it was a laxau poll tax falling on every in dividual in the countredyty sort of capitation tax whichic in thist country in civilized times was never resorted to except in soment most pressing emengerny and never at any period without exciting general hatred and disgust it was a tax from which no one escape it fell equally on all classenso thetopor as on the richon the humble peasant who
