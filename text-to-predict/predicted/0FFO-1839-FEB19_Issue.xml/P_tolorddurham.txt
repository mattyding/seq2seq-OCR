o lonr deraphfulest imimy lorsesm of the changes recommended in your lorrsshes report are to be found in the commit incaition of the constitutional society of q eubec and aloneral of a date long anterior to your a point ment and your lordssivas omission of this fact is en ittled to great credit as your lordskin was doubtless aware that if they wnerve generally known to have emnanated fron so recepcabled and loval a body of men their popularity would have been greatly endangered among a certain class of politiciater in the country for this considerate act of aindness thev ought to bee and i have no doubt they are deeply grateful it is undoubtedly a hazardous admission to make but is rendered necessary lest the british paliragemen might suppose from your ascribing all the system to the leaders of the rebellion whom vou have so charitably and so condescendingly termned the dis contented party that these tratilow were after all not very unreasonable people but nine whose im peutous temper head hurried theni into the little im prudence but manly error of resorting to arn but winho notwithstanding this venial offecen were really desirous of promoting some beneficial changesitus such parts of the report as are to be found in these doumenist i have nothing to do but to express my regret that all vour information had out been drawn from a source equally unexcextionally is that part which is peculiawor vour own or was sugested bv those able and intelligent men tendisucatent part to which i ochet your lord ship reconneduen a legislative union of the colonise or a conssress for the whole coexistent with but su peiror to tile provincial legitasuler this prescrip tion you are pleased to think will by its strong drastic powers purge the body politic of au impul ritise and not only effect a cure of all existing evils however ruinous but however dissimilar they may be the search after such a medicine like that after the philosopherp stone has long since been discone tinued bv enlightened men but empricy still an nounce occasionally that they have succeeded by accident or inspiration where science has previously failed so prone indeed are mankind to indulge in the marvellous that these nostruss are always fa vourably received bv the multitude and their popu larity is generally proportionel to their extravagant absuritu this legislative assembly which vour lordship recommnnd is to be constructer after the model of the congress ot the united states had your lordship visited that country of which vou have undertan en to draw so flattering an account from the reports of the able intelligent and im partial men of the discontented party who have mightared thither you night possible have hear of collisions between the genera government and the state government of disputes about sovereignty and jurisdiction and of a term peculiar to america tonticularivell you might have hear of deter minded threst on one side and fierce defiance on the other of undefined rights of constructive powers and of unfortunate omissione you would have learnde that though the people may petition the congress the congress may not deliberate that there may he rights unaccompanied by powers and that written constitution may be more vague and more uncertain than unwritten one you would have sense a legislative union of separate states where the supreme legislature possesseat too little power to answer the purposse of national government and where the individual states had partle with too much to retain any separate influence or individual authom rity in short you would have everywhere behed the melancholy spectacle of a govermment unable to enforce obedience to its own laws or respect for those of its neighbour to protect its own armouriev against its own people or to restrain its own population from piratical incoussion into advoniing countries with which it had entered into solementruply ef peace but supposing that vour lordship had passed trouch that country you unfortangly did through canaal without hearing or sering what other people had hear or sense and had not learnde that such was its condition you would doubtless have inquired into the powers of the congress the imitation of which you so strongly recommend aid you instituted such an inquiry you would have found it had little or nothing to do that though the separate states had conceded all the authority that could be safely intrusted to it it did not amount to enough for vigorous action and that although they had ren dered themselves powerwless thev had not made the ceatra legislation strong by their several contribus toins you would have tearned among other things that its chief duty was to deliberate upon all external matter also to regulate the arminy and navy the postoffice the coinage the judiciary the com merce with foreign antion and the wild lands not of the several states but the domains belongin to the united states having acquired this information you would naturally have naked yourself howl similar powers could be committed to a congress of the bir thish provincest your lorishap has been more fortunate than most travelless and has discovered many things of deep interest and great importance that nobody ever hear of before so many indeed that i fear your account accurate as it no doubt is wit share the fate of others of equal value and have to await the confirmation of succeeding expedition buttowingh standing your lorsish powers of observation i doubt if you could find a provincial army and navy for an object of legislation or a coinage which they have not got and cannot have or a post office as a distinct and independent department this latter you must be well aware is a part of the great general imperial postoffice is connecested wilt snalis that traverse foreign countries and packets that cross the seas and officess residing out of their limitim and beyond their control and in which the parent state has at least an equal interest with the colonise the supreme judicial establish ment does not existis not required and what mill doubtless have great weight with vour lordship would not be popular their foreign trade they cannot regulate so long as thev are colonise and ought not it they could the wild lands are the appretancenes of each separate colony and there arc no extra provincial domains that can be placed under its control where then are the powers of this legislature to be derived from and what is it to do is it likely congress to be converted into a deating society for wordy ortarous and vain bostanicy patirost or a canvass for the election of theorengrow general or a hail of pensiones where edgaggous are to receive eight dollars aday as the reward of successful intrigue where is it to meet are the french canadians the papinase and the vinger to put on their snow shoes and travel through several hundred nimless of trackless forest to halifax or are the able intelligent and respectable projector of nova scotia to concede the post of honour to quebec to harness up their moose and rein deer and speed over the unterdend snow tothe capital i it is true there are no hotels on the road but there would be not a few ins in the lake and such would be the harmony ef these travelizel legitaslos that the outs would not quarrel for their place snug berths and warn berths are the obejest of patriotic desire and not cold one if sectional jealousise and local im pediemint create a difficulty as to the seat of govern ment as they did in the united states where is it to be placed will you decide as those enlightened men did and choose the geographical centre if so shall it be the small island in the matawask lake in the heart of the forest between the lower and upper pronusees or shau a more enlarged v sew pre vaii shall we regard the convenience of succeeding generation and place it in the desert midway be tween the pacific and atlantic but i forget that your lorsina has solved the
