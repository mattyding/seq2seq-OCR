reat deal of what courred in the farmer cause but the follosing outline will be sufficient to make the pre sent proceedingty intelliggle w hile the oringal suit suas pending in the court of exchequer mr attwood flied a biril fer a specific performance of the contracts the plintifis in that suit had entered into with him but the day after the decree of lord lunghest was nroscend declaring the

attwood then stood in this singully position that his bilt for a specific performance of the agresented stood dismissed for want of prosecution on his own application and nor at tempt had ever been mad to get ri of that dismisisal uidier these circumstance it became necessary after mr at wood to eek redress in this mout not by a bill for a sperific perefrinctian but by a declaration that upois the true on strancion of the agresented the defendants or sonie sf them are personally liable to him under the contracts for payment of the remainidg of the prucharestion the bilf for this purpose set out the three agresented by the fisstral i shears and taylor the managing directorof of the conninay agreed to purcase to miness of mr attowir for wi tf this surn all was to be despoited in

and payment of the uub small shears and taylor stould be let into possession in as ample a manner as if tlie tale had been accepted without such possession being denenide an acceptance o the title or abandonment of their right to have all reasonable objection to the title removed at mr attowdist expense who wars on or before tele lat of april is whether the title nas then completed or liseo to

ithead of that in stallent beining then paid it should be left for years as a security by way of mortgage of the estates at per cent and if on the th of october zi va there should be ny cledi objection remaining to the title then small shacrs and taylor were to be at liberty to remove such objection at the ex pense of attewon but such objection if it should not be ia the power of attwood to remote should be waved by the compann and attwood was to execute a bond of ideigume against any remaining defectss in the title and the warm to continue during the years upon trust for the like indemnity and the whole if necessary or a proper part was to be detained at the ent of toe years in the names of the trustes for time same purpose by the third agreepient executed in november which was the most material as to the personal tespontlybill of some of the de denfant it was agreed that small shears and taylor should be exonersted and discharged from all personal lia bigity to the payment of any sum of money by reason of their having been parties to or having singed the former agree ment or from any act nasteouser in anywise relatily thereto or consequent thereon except that they should re tannia liable for the payment ot the intlertse on thi remaining instanmlent of the pruchasery but that attwood should be content as his security for the principal with the security of the estates to be convenedy to trustes in the manner ex pressed in the agresented with powers of sale to craible the trustes to raise and pay such of the instanmlent as shourd fall due from time to time witb the interest it being nevertheless understond that no sale should be made or proceeding taken for that purpose until attwood sbould have given six months notice previous to sueb sale nor until the time mentioned in the notice had expired after detail ing thest agresented the bill set forth the proceeding in the original suit in the court of exchequer and then weat on to state that no trustes had ever been appointed nor any con venyces executed to the company but that the compinay had entered into possessive of the miness and wrec still in pess sion by their agent and in addition to hing worked the old miness had opend new its and extracted great natitentis of coal and ironstent it further stated that attowdor he been diduced to forego the personal responsibility of the three managing directorof who had singed the contracts en be half of the composy on the fauth end cenfideseed that they would honestly discharge the debt and without any apprehension they would hare involved him in a suit of such enormous magnitude as he lied been subject to in the court of exchequer the bil further alleged that when the last arrementer was entered into only a emall part ef the o pita had been paid ad that a sumar of ... still remaindent to him which the cempany demolared their intention not to paix thecculful helipt while they were working the miness for their own besift it therefore prayed all sueb deleration might be made by the court as were jast andesseray ith regard to the rights nd interest of t lain guif and in resdra to the perional libisition of small shears and taylor the contacity distorome and as to the libabite the other directres id as to the ilaibitation of therthestip and also as to the liability of the company in respect of the several members thereof and as to the liability of the estates of the company and the estates of the de ceased directorof and members to pay the plaitive tbe sum of rool together nith such interest on as should he owing when the oi was paid thant ac count should be taken and any deficiency raised by sale or mortgage of the estates of the company and that all direc toins should be given that were necessary to make the in deminity or equitable chargo available for to purpose of the plaintiff being paid the money due to him the main points rontended for by the defendants in suppert of the demurrer were that this whas not a bill on which the court could grout a specific performance of the contracts for it prayed some hin else while that asi its secret soject that the contract as with three individual v h wrure the original contractor for the company and that no subsequent contract could extend their laishilagy to otherles that possession w as given nat the miness might he w worked adr therefore mr attowird was not entitled to anly bygone account that the indemnity wenti for notling and that he had no title to malination the presentit suit because he have nut given the notice the morgtaroo awas entitled to hut bad only the ordinary remedy of a morgtaroo in support of the bill it awas argued the semsureres had only heen put in for the purpose of dealing a settlement the defendants must one day conie to for event if this w as not technically the car rect mode of prosesding the rigist one was still openly to ur attowfro and he would pursue it the company had got the plaintisf property they had taken away the inheritance and v ere bundle in conscience to pay for it i ho present course was the only one left open to bismid tol obtain the relief he as justly entitled to for it would have been a mockery to at tenmpt to enforce the performinate of the contracts when the company weare struggloin to get rid of them altogether and there was no other mode of compelling thens to appointment k bruce mr jacob mr wigar and mr sharpe verree the counsel for the several defendants mr w akeefilg and mir salt supported the lithe vice cii ancelloul sasiad there w ere many important points involve in the argument he should read the pleading attentively and give judgment en a future adtimolic v tosslissat sty state that an order had been made in this case upon a petition to appoint a guardian in the
