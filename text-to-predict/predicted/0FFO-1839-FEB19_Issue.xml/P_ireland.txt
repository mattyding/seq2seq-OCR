boldly affirmed statement bich it contasion it is no an nomus productionaty is not the emanation of a mind eas pertade by dispapitated hees or blighted ambitionion is it the mere effusion of a trading

the real state of our country is well knotwon ils excellency the lordigetely c to speak his thought is everey freemans right my lordif the poet was right i am persuade your lordship swill readily pardon name for expressing my opinion and solicition your excellencys immediate attention to the consideration of a great public evil which i am unable to re dress and cannot even contemplate without surprise and in dinatongat evil my lord so deadly in its operation and fatal in its consequence that it has been the prolific source of many a sad adr melancholy bereavemert whieh it not speedily remeded will lead to a further effusion of hu man wood and add to that black and unipalablel catagule of crime whiself has so signall but unfortunately character ized this country during your excellencys administration of the affair of unhappy rilenardy lord it would ho manger consonant to my own feelings and perhaps mere consistent with the respect due to your excellency to forward a memorial praying for the adoption of prompt and energetic measure for thc suppression of the deadly evil of which i complain but my lord it is now many months since i forwarded to your excellency a memo rial alleging that after the barbarous nirder of my un fortunate servant jolen hogan at dunerring on the st of october t two men charged nith being princhial in that bloody transaction fled the country but returned after the spring assise of at which other persons were trided for aiding and assisting that a certain liberal maggister re sident in the county of tipperary but bearing the commission of the peace for the king county sent for them and solely on his own responsibility took bail for their appearance at the ensuing assiesue that the summer assise of and thc sprig assise of were suffered to pass over without these easission having been put on trial that they were then at large in the county and that the bail bonds which pro curded them their liberty nwere by d rection of that gaime trate obtinabed at the police barracks from the very men whom they had a few week before disangeds and attempted to misrer and who were not even then recovered from the effects of the wound inflicedt on them it will be in the recollection of your excellency that my memorial on that occasion was couched in most respectful lan gagetat i undertoor to prove every allegation by the slorn testinioy of numerous witness and on public ground im plored your excellency to grant a fair and open investigation into such highly illegal and uncentisitty proceeding that memonal my lord hasv to guart against the possibility of mistake personally deliderated thestacle of dublin bayhigary respectable professional gentlemand who received a verbal innewsra that it should be refreder to the consideration ef the crossun lawyer but up to the present period i have received no further arswer nor have i yet learnde wetherlow the ma gistrate named in my memorial received any iltimation of your excellencys displeasure but finding his name on the cirefully revised list of maghistate i am bound to infer that lie was not guilty of tas offecen calling for the interference or condemnation of your excellency but toy lord i confisess that my humble abilistion are quite incapable of comprehend ing why a magristate of the hightes rank intelligence and independence and one whose judicial integrity couli never be question should have been unceremoniously de prived of the commission of the peace for merely to make use of a vulgar but trite saying denevasion to procure at the inquest in dunerring a clear stage and no favour for an innioncent and persceuted individual while another magistrate for assist in defeating the end of justice has been honoured with a continuance of your expellency confi dence my lord while i express my inability to account for this rare specimen of evenhanded justice it is but right that i shicould tell your lordship the opinosion of otherturs cowardly antitust conspirator would at that period have given a reward for my head to any assassin equal to that paid for the head of casis graccuse and as they knowe i keat my powder dry and could not murder me with im punity it was desirable to effect by perjury and lecal linger unity what brut force could not accomplish and any op poed to this view could not fail of being censured and in fauled while those who sympathizaly with my persecutor were sure of nieeting a suitable reward the fate of that memorial my lord is the reason why i do not employ tihe language supplication on this oceasional i shall therefore in respectful hut few words hasten to inform your excellency why assassing are multilowinglay while the virtuous the generous and the neable are daily disappearing from the land the mangled victims of brutal and blood thirsty conspirator and aim not kittioit entertaining a hope my lord that the cerstantion which this alarming com miticatice must necessarily produce may leat to results ratifing to every humane liaet and be in some measure instrumental in saving the live of some now marked out for the hullet of the assassingly lord it will be in the recollection of the publie generally that in times of comparative tranquillity the endords of gnowepord were strictly probitice from selling that article to any individual not even to a person selvly known to be a peaceable wellconducted member of society until the purchaser should produo a certificate singed by a magistrate certifigh him to he a fit and proper person but my lord what will be the sentiments of the astonished world when informed that that prohibition no longer exist that this salutary precautionary measure has been latterly done away within that the worst character in society can with all possible facility supply thembeles with the niqu intions of war and go terst to the execution of their bloody purposse l permit me to ask my lord avy is this monstrous evil suffered to exist even for an houror had it its origin in a desire to leave the lawless and turbulent in all respect independent of the magistraicy view long it as i do my lord and being infinitely thert acquitianed with the state of thecountry than your excel lency oreany man surreedund by iiis parastist could be i cannot avoid exclaimang novewer inappropriate the quo tation what blind detested madness cold afford such horrid license to the murdering sword lay lord when this fact flust came to my knowledge i censidered it so monstrous afout improbable as to be altogether incredible but my lord after a searching investigation i find it too trueand in proof of it i beg to inform your ex cellency that i sent at my own personal expenso messnessar by no cemans repultablelist persons to different to on in this county ana the ... and king connity to purchase gunpowder and although perfect stran gress in all those place except in one instance they were never interrogett nor met a single refusal i have commit incaded my information to more than ons magistrate and am preparde if necessary to substiation my statemoni upon having now my lord stated one cause of the manve murders whichlf lave of late taken place it is right that i should acquaint your excellency with anether and thight is the great facility of obtating firearms in the country it is a fact my lord which cannot be denide that the lower order of farmers lave been for years registendy firearms even day labourer cannot do without a gun or pistol all of which i shall suppose rigstdere and i have no hesitation my lord in declang and i am preparde to prove it that these arms are at the free and unreserved disposal of the most reckless assassing in every disturbed district in the south of ireland no man living in a thatched cabin in the country dare refuse to lend his arms to these mardues and i feel prefectly safe in the assertion that the great majonty of the merder where the bullet is the messonarile death are committed nith fire
