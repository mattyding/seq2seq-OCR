interesting lecture at the royal in sittiousite on the subject of a new lamp invented or rather bruith to perfection for the invention is not it appears al toother new by mir unrewythion air faraday proposed to call the oxy lamp for sant of a time better describion its nature not having as ho stated been at present inmore whit name the inventor intended to give it the new lamp most nearly resemblesh the common ardang lamp with this difference that its bunrerness may bo amo to equal at tho lowest two and a half and at the lights number of the common bunrerness mad into to fanme of nihho a stream of oxygen gas is introdicted by which operation the character of the flame is changed froma dark smoky light tothe bright and indeed brilliant light of the hydoriongy lights now used for

of the oxygen has the effect of decreasing the length of the flame swalich is tisius botter advatden for the marine purpose to which it is destined and it has the greatest of all recommend toins namely economy in its favour this is not however apparent at first view for the gas costs double the amount of the oil but the introduction of the former effects suctle a diminution in the consumption
