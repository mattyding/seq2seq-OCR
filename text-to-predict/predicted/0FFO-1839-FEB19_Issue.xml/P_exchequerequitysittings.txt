exchequer equity sittinmsysmed v williams aid antelirilaril p t leore liver liaron addersnous loarsion on coming into court gaue judgment in this he which he said was a bill field for a legacy which the piaitfives claimed under a will in which the two defendants villiam williaming and william thomas williams were ap pointed executory it appeard that the testarior died in b and that the alil was afterwards proved by to defen ants wive paid in the first instance all dest and specific leaginess and after having discharged that part of their duty there remained the residue to be divided among a given nun ber of persons amongst whom was linanay moses the wife of the plaintiff who now claimed as her administrator it ar peared that the ascertingel share of hannah mosens d their es ra it i ithe only question was whether or not both the defendants wero liable to make good the residue to to present plaintiff as to administrator of lannaha mosessan objection was taken to the bill on the ground i that the plaintiff had taken out lettsmer of alinitinestat susequestine to the bill being field but to this objection be thought the answerveng at the bar was per fectly satisfactory iu the first pleat the plintrin had at the time ha field this bill an equitable interest in the find and secondly it appeard frees the cases cited from peere will lissn that amidsmationat being granted it rolated back to the time when the intestate razizan mosise was to be consis dered as entitled in this respect therefore the bill was well foundendar the objection could not be suatained as to willism esilalis it appeard that the money l was handle over by the defendineft w t williams who resided at cliftonity w williams his coexecutor who resided a dim in norfolk for the produse of being paid to hannhaside the person entitle l ro tbe legacy and it was suggeseed that w t william whas entirely unacquainted with let fact of her having been married and that he trusted to av wil lais whoa he believed to be resident very near the spot where shc was actually to be found to pay the leag to ber several cases were cited beginning with thai of bacon v bacon for the purpiose of showing that when an exceculor so condlest himself as to be guilty of no lathes or negligence in the administration of the testator estate and where the lose arese simply from accidention which the exe cutor eyen exereising due diginence had no contral that he was not personaliy responsible for the amount of sach loss it appeard to himan looking at the circumstical of this ease that ne could not acquilt mr t williams on this ground on the contrary it appeard to himan that he ought to he held re sponsible on the present occasion as it was his duty to bave mande some inquirise as to whether or not this woman was married by doing which he might have easily ascertingel that she was married and then it would have boso his duty to have taken care to have held some correspondence with the husmind and to bave ascertingel where he was beform he paid oyer the money to william williams it appeard that the husband of hannah moses did not resile near diss there was no correspondent with imila the exe cutor w as not even eavare of the existence of such a person hut a few inquirise would have enabled him to ascertain the fact and he his lordship could not therefore acquit him ois englegence if the case stood on this ground alone it appeard to him that to cases ot ship brooke v illiongairo underwood v stephens and long ford v gascoigne nwere decisive ef the point for there it was aldia down that if an executor premitted his coexecutor to obtain possession of money which he had at any time in his ow n possession and afterwards the executor mispapiled the money both executory were personally resnnosible for the amount which one of thome had given to the other and that other had mispapiled such a case did not fall within let class of cases of which bacon v bacon was the quief and in which it awas aldia down that an executor should be allowed to benefit of what ho had handed over to his co executor in the ordinary and due administration of to estate which under the will hie had to administer but it appeard also that there was another ground on which this casset ight be put the case of bacon v bacon and those which fo loedim it were cases in which the exe cutor paid monengy into the hands of his coexecutor for the purpose of engin cised in the payment of dest and specific leaginess anti one of them was a case where the executor was in the position of a trustee for an individual legacy but the present case was the case of a residue in acii a partity sought to obtain possession of his portion of the fund which it was the duty of the executory having the assest in hand to divide among ths legatese bacon v bacon seemed to him merely to decide the question that if thrower no negligence on the part of the executery with regard to the assest to be collectust ay less that might arise might possibly be considered as the lass of the testator himself and as if the property so lost had never come into the hasd of the executory and they therefore could not be charged with it in the administration of the assest of the testator and theretore if an executor paid dest as in the case obaca v bacon by banding over the money to his coxee cutor for the purpose of paying them he sbould be allowed the saue in account but this plaintiff was entitled to his share of the residue of the estate and the executory were bound to pay him that share it appeard under the will that the only thing the executory had to do was to pay these leaginess and supposing that there had been no negligence on the part of w t l illiama it only showed that the plaintiff was entitled to his share with the rest of the coreduraty legatese at the time and that he bad a right to claim a cer tan proporion of tie testator property it did net appear that the plaintiff had been guilty ot any fault bv which he should lose his legacy and the executory must pay it oer again even if it had been paid correquit to the coexecutor for the purpose of its being handed over to the plaintiff it appeard to him therefore that this case whas entirely distin guishable from the cases of bacon r bacon and the othersut insanus as it appeard in the course of the argument that william williaming had convenedy soon portion of the le gaycy either to the plaintiff or bis wife acting as his agent he prespode to refer it to the taster to see trow much of theleacy had been so pail so that the coxexcutore should not be chargelage with more than they actually ought to pay t he master giving them eredit for the sumss actually received by the plaintifus wife either with his express approbation or under subic circumstance as naide her bis agent for that pur pose there should thereupon bo a declaration that both exe cuttors were liable to pay what if anything was due to the plaintiff for principal and interest of the suu accruin to him in right of hi wife share ot the residue with direction to the master to take an account
