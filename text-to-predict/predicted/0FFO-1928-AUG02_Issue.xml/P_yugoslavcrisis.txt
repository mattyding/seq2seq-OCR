yugoslav crissndsseatel afparmanitery courb correspondent blugade aug the squpstian assembled today for the first time since the tragedy of june the sitting was brief and was marked by complete tranquillity in strong contrast to the custorinary noisy proceeding in the house during the last few months the house was but half filled as not only were the crast absent but also the serb agrarian the latter subsequently issued a statement in which they declared that they have assembled in belgrade and will continue the struggle in the squpstian but astindane from toways sitting as a sign of sympathy with the crast and as a protest against the cabinet and the speaker whom they hold mainly respon sible for the shooting incidentity all the left benechus were empty the clearial occupied the crast estas and the sitting was held without a single opposition deputy being present the absence of dr marinition the minister for foreign affair whose dutised are being performed by m shumentich while dr marinition is on holiday was especi ally remarked since it was mainly dr airingtion who had insisted on sum morning the susheptainglan reading the minutes of the last sitting the speaker m peritch made a speech condeming the crime and paying a tribute to the depituse killemm basshratchet and m paul raditcard laing emphasis on their devotion to yugoslav national unity thereafter the house as a sign of mourning adourden untill ... hurried and uneasy sitting of the squpstian was held in an atom sphere of deep depression in expectation of news from garge when it came the general feeling here was indignation all serbs without exception particularly re sent the reference to montenwer in the garge declaration and the call of the crast to other provincest of yugoslavia to join them h their struggle against serb supremacy croat demandsmor our balkans ... aug the answer of the peasant democrat coalition to the reopening of the blood stained squpstian in belgrade was the meeting which it held here today this was timed so as to synchronize with the sitting of the squpstian and it was held in the building which was used under the haspburg for the sitingss of the sabor or provincial parliament of croatia both these details convenedy the impress sion that the opposition was setting up a rival parliament of its own the population of garge certainly had no doubt on this point the street were all felgagafd and if one masked why one was told that it was because the sabor was stigitally this array however proved to be what is vulgarly known as eyewash intended perhaps to suggest to belgrade what might happen if the worst came to the worst the meeting was strictly a party meeting of the peasant democrat coalition br trumbtich and dr pavelist the two federalist depituse for garge did not attend thus it was not fully representative of croatia on the other hand as m priditicue pointed out it represented a good deal more than croatia as the members of the coalition included depituse from dalantati slovenia the hersonicer the vovidion and even montenlestian the absence of m raditch whose condition is still critical m pribtich vitch presided his speech and the resolution which was voted by the congress were distinctly moderate in toue and were evidently designed to counteract the effect of the statement made by m raditch which were recently published by a german news agency in which m raditch is reporter as having said that a complete admini strative separation of serbia and c rotait with only the crown remaining as a condenction link is the essential con dition of further relation between the two parts of yugoslavia owing to lf radist condition it has been im possible to check the authenticity of these statement but they are question to say the least of it by many of his supportersty priditicue aldia stress on the fact that their campaign was not one of crast against serbs but of a coalition of serbs crast and sloveness against a corrupt and feefte administration and he reminded the crast that they and the serbs of the former hapsburg provincest must stick together at all costs if they wished to get the better of the regime which they were trying to destroy belgrade he said whas doing all it could to separate them he emphatically repuditated a suggestion that the provincest which they represented wished to break away from the rest of yugoslavia all they wanted was fair treatmentthip resolution which was subsequently passed by thencouser contasion a number of interesting points which go beyond the sense of m priditive speech it denise that measure passed by the squpstian in its present form are bind ing for the whole of the country and in particular repuditate the principle of any new measure of taxation in so far as they apply to the former hapsburg provincest this amounts to a threat that the regions represented by the coalition may refuse to pay tase it declarss that the kingmods of croatia and montenwer in merging themselves in the kingdom of serbs crast and sloveness did not reckon to lose their national individuality but that the kingdom of serbia has abused the act of union and the constitution of in order to establish a hegemony over the rest the gist of this passage is the demand for a new constitution which would allow the provincest possession a distinct national individuality to retain it the resolution concludes with napapel to all parties of the former haps burg provincest and to all serbs par ticularly those of the serb peasant party who disapprove of the present remen to join in the fight for these princiless which it says can alone save the unity of the stateat is understond that this resolution has the approval of m raditch it contasion a notive that all further resoul toins of the coalition will be postoned until he is well enough to preside over its mentinistis import may be summed up as fol lous no action is decreed against bel grade although certain threst are held out the demand for separation is re puditated and there is no suggestion even of a change to a federal system but the revision of the constitution appears as an essential condition the sense in which it is to be revised is only vaguely indi cated this is a course to which the serbian parties are not much inclined but it cannot be said that the resolution does
