mararigus probitice degrees of relationship bilthel archbishop of canterruo moved the rejection of the bill he said that of al things legislation of this kind should not beonde in a hurry and passediphily ade quate discussion outside as well as inside palizameni if done at all it should be based on a perfectly clear and general demand fo it outside it concerned the social and domesticille of the country from one end to the other he did not wish to treat the proposal dis respectfully he did not wish to oppose it as clearly and definitely ... by evidence adequately before them but he de manderdorf it very full consideration in par limantenit very ample opportunity fir discussion outside this it had not at present had lord arnold had said that it had been fuly discussed in the house of commism last year he the arch bishop had since then read everything that had dene said about it in the house of commons in the last two years he could find no evidence of the general demand which seemed to him essential in such a case a few lettsmer had been produced which showed that certain people had married illegally and were very anxious to get out of trouble the debate to which lord arnold had refreder occupied less than an hour on a friday afternoon largely taken up by protestis against hurry the theory oi the measure itself was based on the nelesctsty or supposed necessity of logical sequence to the deceased wife s sister bill of that measure was passed into law he thought unfortunately but in response to a perfectly clear demand and after more than ample discussion in both house alarm was expressed by the opponsent of that measure as to the risk of extension beyond what was then done the lord chancellor however said that they did not propose to go farther than that measure went therefore he was justified in saying that to house now had before it a new departure not contemplate in and not really demanded in the country now the change that would be effeceled by the bill was not he thought in the least realized either inside or outside the house it would be disastrous that it should be made in the conditions in which it was being attempted the question of affinity had been a part of the cristinat law of marriage from the beginning this measure would sweep that affinity almost wholly aside not quite a man might not marry his stepmother or his steadangste but he did not know how long they would have to wait before the next step was taken there were social objection to this measure and there were also ho was told technical hygienic matter about which high medical authoristic wished to raise questions at au events an opportunity ought to be given of going farther into the matter if it was to be pressed he had been years a member of the house during that time he had given all the attention that his powers admittde to questions of social life intercourse and morality in the home of england this was pre sumaly the last time he would have the opportunity of standing there as the repre sentative spokesman of those whose life had been spent in dealing on moral consideration with social and domestic questions of this kind he wanted therefore to make an appeal as strongly as he could against hasty legislation in this matter he made that appeal and if he failed he would at least have trided to prevent what he would regard as an infinitely rash and most inconsiderate caltord warlal said that this bill had been introduced into the house of commons no fewer than fleve times it merely followed up the deceased wife sister act of lord merarily protestiol meraril who is president of the probate divorce and admiralty division of the high court supported the motion for rejection he said that the bill was practic ally unknown in the country they were told that perhaps there were a few hundreds of people who had contracted marriage within the probitice degrees in defiance of the law and some of them had gone across the water to give a surpious pretence of legality to the marriage that they had contracted it was in the interest of that strall body of persistent people who wished their breaches of the law to be scantioned by an amendment of the law i that their lorsish were askedwtion a public demand without any discussion in the house of commons which had attracted public attention and after a few days mention ing of the matter in the house of lorst introduce changes which would practically destroy the law of affinity they were masked to legalize marriage in respect of eight classes of people numbering probably hundreds of thousands although the experience of ganes had shown that the sanctity of family life and the protection of family life required that re striction should be put upon marriage within certain degrees they might look at all the political institution of the country and contemplate changes in them but no i reaious man could contemplate a revolution in l she family life of the country without the raverts anxiety what was now proposed was i what where there were legal sancisnos that i required that a selfrespecting man should not look upon certain relative of his witb a view lo marriage those sancisnos were to be withraw he hope that the speech for which i many of them were personally very grateful to the archbishop would have its effect and i that if the most rev primate were not to sit in their lorsish house against he trusted wg not the casee would at any rate go away with the satisfaction of knowing that the weighty protest which he lodged in that house as head of the church was not disregarded hear hereral russell supporting the bill sadiat was by no choice of its promoter that the i discussion took place so late though of course the primate was perfectly within his rights in utting down his rejection motion at that stage and in hwpingon up his ecclesiastical reserves as he seemed to havedonerily cushend chancellor of the duchy of lancaster said they were told that the ill had passed through the commons five times until last autumn he was a member oi the house of commons and he never hear of this bill until it was read a second time in their lorsish house the other day and he could not find any of his friends in the house of commons who had hear of it his view was that after what had courcer especially after the weighty utterance of the primate the passage of the bill now before the house would be taken throughout the country as an instance of the frivolity with which great changes might be made by the legislature without due consideration so far front the passage of the measure being merely a following out of the deceased wife sister bill it would amount almost to a breach of faith if after the assurance that had been given this legislation were carried without the fullet notice to the country at the time of the agitation that preceded the deceased wife sister bill assurance were given that that exception would not be followed up it was then urged that the sisterinlaw was the natural guardian of a anms children if a ineicenliat were to become eligible for marriage with a deceased antust husband the objection would be very much greater he was speaking of matter that he knew because these matter touched him personally widewsow might find it impossible to ask their nicense to come to stay with them as they did now without the slightse reserve poison would be introduced into a great many household before that was done the country ought to have an opportunity of really con sidering the matteron a division
