country he thanked the government for their relief policy based on the report of the transference board if it could not do as much as the situation demanded it was at least an honest attempt to do something and went further than anything the labour party had attempted when they were in power it was a great tragedy that decent respectable people should have been brought to such a state of poverty if a young man who was unemployed fell out of unemployment benefit he was refused relief by the guardinis and there was nothing for him to do but to go on the roads and if he did so he was treated worse in the casual awras than crimilina were treated in prison two thirds of the men on the roads were genuinely secking work but they were made to walk anything from to miles a day which meating that they had no time to look for work and the starvation diet which they received exhausted their vitality this system was not reformative and it was not deterrent the number of vagrants on the roads showed an alarming increase and in some cases board of guardinis were at their its end to know what to do with the casual the whole system of treatment of the ablebodied and particularly of

relief for the respectable married men when they ex hasted their benefit and for a more humane system for the unmarried men when young people went from one district to another in search of work why
