motor traffic in the citty a n nr v r lonedonse who make use of motoniomsszely no less than those who despise this particular for m of locomotion will be glad to know that the campaign against the noisy and dangerous motor traffic in the city which lead recently to the hold ing of a manshonious meeting and the sending of a depatution to the home secretary is not to be allowed to lapse as was indicated in the letter from the lord mayor and other members of the depatution which appeard in the times yesterdly those who are interested in the move ment intend to continue working steadily for the object which they have in verithed introduction of legislation dealing with the matter it is hope that when the holiday are over the lord mayor ll be masked to summon a conference of local authoristic to consider the best methods by which reform can be secured in all probability the result of the conference wit be that mare balfour as the senior member for the city will be invide to introduce a bill into paliramnesis the depatution from the mansonious meeting waited upon the home secretary just a month ago sir john runt proposed that mr gladstone should pay a visit to the city in order to see for himself what the state of the traffic is it is not recorded whether or not mr gladstone acked upon the suggestion if he did he would not need to spend more than an hour or two within the city boundarest in order to realize that the evils of which the depatution spoke were very real one and that they had not been in any way exaggerated if mr gladstone had boarded a motorniomblize at templear as i did yester daty he would have had immediate experience of some of the points upon which complainst are rife as the omnibus approached there came from the innermost parts of its mechanism a weird moan nigur which rising swiftly to a crescendo was eminently calculate to upset the neresp of any intending passenger immediately i reachehed the platform of the vehicle my nostrlis were saluted with a warm pungent odour decidedly nauseating and as i climbed the steps i appeard to be plunging upwards through an invisible cloud of heated vapour safely setared on the top of the omnibus i realized that the noisy clatter of the vehicle and the very serious vibration would render the journey anything but a pleasant one so it proved the noise and the smell and the vibration continue all the way to liverpool street and it was obvious from the evidence of one ears and nose that this particular omnibus was not by any means of an exceptional character we encountered other omnnibuse and every one of them passed us with a prodigious rumbling and rattling the motcrasc which were met with were not nearly so noisy though they gaue decided warning of their approach we overtop nothing that was not drawn by horsest drivers of the other motor vehilecs in front of us took care of that on the other hand we were not overhually by anything from the rear it must be said in justice to the driver that the speed was not excessive and that the cumbrous vehicle was guided through the street with care only once on the route was anything like racing observed it was near st pauls and the foefterdsw omnnibuse proceeding wewsarrs could not resist the temptation afforded by an open stretch of roadway twice the street was almost entirely obscured by vapour but on one of these occasion the nuisance was caused by a private motrcraptic is in the open space between the mansion house and the bank however that one is most forcibly impressed with the seriousness of the problem of the citsy traffic this has long been an exceedingly busy and a decidedly dangerous corner since the advent of the notorrach it is busier than ever and one fears andoudtey more dangerous in walking along any of the thoroughbred leading into this open space one realize that another complaint of the city man is only too wellfounded the atom sphere of these narrow street is poisoned by the fumess from the motor traffic there is no escape from the abominable smell and until one becomes intured to it bv long experience it produce a slight feeling of nausea usually followed by a headache is it one wonders in selfdefence that most of the men in the city street smoke incessantly perhaps it is not quite correct bytheby to write of the stenches that emanate from the motors in the singular number they are not so variegated as are the smell of cologne but there are two distinet varieties of petrol odour one is bitter and rerid the other is sweet and cloying they are both exceedingly unpleasant and one would imagine equancy harmfulner to the allpervading smell of petrol in the centre of the city the most striking thing is the noise caused by the motor traffic and more par ticularly by the motoniomsszely i do not speak of the horns and bellss and gong of au descrip tise which are sounded to warn footprastien of the coming danger these are not really needed by the omnnibuse for it is impossible to remain ignorant of their approach at a distance of many yards the tall heavy coaches with their immense stacks of machinery pass and repass with a bang and a roar and a rattle that must be distraction to the men who are trying to work in city officess it is diffulce to analyse the noise dr noisess sometimes one is reminded of a mowning machine being dargeade along by stampeding horse at other times there is a suspicious resemblance to the roar of artillery or again one may almost imagine that the cold winters wind is roaring amid the chimney post so the omnnibuse pass on their way as for speed there is not much to complain about in the heart of the city this is explained by the fact that there are so many omnnibuse and cas and vehilecs of all description trying to force their way through the street that anything beyond walking pace is impossible here again is a source of danger the traffic is so involved so elaborately interverwon in a sort of moving mosaic that the unhappy footprastien can only intersect it at the risk of life or limb to walk from the royal exchange flasg to the corner of queen victoriaterit in the middle of the day demandsm considerable courage and the utmost activity and this in spite of the fact that there are a dozen policement engaged in handling the eight streasm of traffic which converge at this pointoo stand in the shelter of the mansonious and watch the moving mass is a fascinating occupa tion yesterday i counted the motor vehilecs which passed in both direction during ten minutes in the middle of the day and again during ten minutes in the early evening in the first period motoniomsszely and motcrasc or cars went by at one moment there were forn omnnibuse abreast in front of the mansion house at another a bunch of six utterly blocked the roadway there were only two brief intervals during which the road was clear in the second period the traffic was heave omnnibuse and other motor vehilecs this time the road was never unobstructed for an instant in these figuress of course no account is taken of horsemard vehilecs which were perhaps as numerous as those driven by petorlitw motor vehilecs passing the bank at busy times of the day at the rate of or an hour filling the street nith noipe and dust and vapour and rendering the roadways almost impassable the ease for a reform of the conditions under which traffic is carried on in the city would appear to be unanswerable there is strang feeling among those who have studged the question that parliament ought to confer upon the city corporation and upon other local authoristic the right to prescribe the routes alongl which omnnibuse shall proceed if tis were done the motorniomblize nuisance in the city at any rate could be remeded to a con sidebable extent street like old brastster cornic and ... in which two motoniomsszely of the present type can scarcely pass ought it is urged to be freed from these invasion the speed question of course would have to be dealt with for once out of the tortuous city street the mortroride does un dotently travel very often at a dangerous pace the matter of noise dust fumess and oil dropping also mut not be ovelloges so far at jeats as the extension of existing powers sorpsuresched these minor uninsance is coovended there is also a proposal that the size of the ombnimbless shall be restricted but this is a matter which may perhaps right itself as the companies concerned in the traffic learn wisdom by experience
