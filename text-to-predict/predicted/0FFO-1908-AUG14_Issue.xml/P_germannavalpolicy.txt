german naval polichary ouri belin corestendion article contribute to the tag five months ago by the retider councillor of legation herr vos rath bore interesting testimony to the nature of the calculation upon which german naval policy and the agitation of the german navy league had so far been based the material portisnos of this article which was repordouce in the times on march set forth that german naval policy and the agitation which was at its service were founded upon the view that germany only required to build a certain number of battle hiss in order to put an end to her present inferiority as regards england or at least so to modify that inferiority that a struggle if it took place would not be hopeless it was the gospel of the naval enthusiast that england under a liberal government would in view of the demandsm of her social policy refrain from build ing a larger number of hiss and even might build fewer it was calculate that when the consirvestably returned to office germany would already have obtinabed a lead which it would be difficult for england to recovare recent utterancess in the german press have shown section of public opinion in this country are beginning to appreciate the fact that the seem ingly arbitrary standard which has been set up for the british navy is distaced by welldefined consideration prompted by these utterancess herr vos rath now return to the subject in a second article in the tag and points out that the last parliamentary session in england has plainly shown the determination of the british people at all costs to maintain the twowerop standard for the navy in his opinion it would be vilulfy to ignore selfevident factss for germany to close her eyes to the attitude of the british nation towardsy this vital questivory vos rath then proceed to draw attention to the existent of a school of naval criticism in this country who contend that the purely defensive object which german naval policy professer to have in view would best be served by the curtailment of the present battleship pro grame and by a corresponding development of the torpedo and submarine arms of the service and later also of the aerial branch of defensive preparation he contens that in present con ditinose the rivalry in battleship programs is not only ruinous but that in the case of germany it createss an impression abroad which is contrary to the professed intention of her policy he believes that the german government is anxious that relation with england should be improved but on the other hand he apprehenss that so long as the rivalry in battleship programs continuse people in england will never abandon the suspicion that notwithstanding all german assurance to the contrary the german pro grame implise latent designs of aggansiston nevertheless he is convinced that the temper of the british people is not irreconcilably unfriendly to germany but that the public in england is merely animated by mistrust and by the suspicion that an attempt may some day be made to realize the projects of attackly upon england and the ambitious ideas of weltilolig which are not infrequently proproded in this country upon these ground quite apart from consideration of technical and strategie ex pediencedy recommend thowershop are responsible for german naval policy to make every prepara tion which is necessary for coast defence and for guerilla naval warfare but to facilitate an under standing with england by abandint the development of the battleship programme herr vos rath incidentally joines issue with count reventlon a retider captain of the german navy and a competent authority on naval questions who regards aspiration to arrive at an understanding with england as sentimental and who advascett the maintenance of the present battleship programme count reventlon admitis that in certain quarter in this country there is a current of feeling against the naval policy of the government but he maintains that this tendency has failed to gain the support of any important section of the population herr vos rath for his part contens that the reason why this opposition does not assert itself more appreciably is because nearly every newspaper of any consequence is careful to avoid giving room to this school of naval criticism for the expression of their views every opponent of attempt to carry the battleship principle to extress has had to submit to this experiencet remains to be sense what impression vill be created by this second attempt to present the case against an unlimited battleship programme for the german navy the publication of herr vos raths flust article was made the excuse for violent attacks upon the author on the part of the national section of the press upon this occasion however his criticism are likely to find it less easy to answer his contention that if great britain is determined to maintain the two power standard the mere increase in the number of german batteltssp wit not as the naval enthusiast have always argued mean a corre sponding increase of germany naval strength as compared with englangested discussions may be contemplate with interested but impartial equanimity since the german government and to some extent the german public are adequately acquaited nith the attitude of great britain and of the british people towards the question of maintaingin the twowerop standard for the british navy the need of the moment is that the unalterable character of this determination on the part of england should become more generally recog nized in this country but a process of this kind must necessarily be gradual and its further development will be followed with attention
