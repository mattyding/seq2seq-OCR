agence are to be abolished and to men occupiyny position in them will have to be taken into to officess agen assuming they will not be dischard and this will defer the promotion of these maned keep down others beneath them the younger men are naturally apprehensive both on this point and as to whethor discagres wi bo made we aro not supposing that the companies will discharge the senior men who are lifide in all kind of rayhair business ourmember feeliat grionace that any ono should bo discharged last year a grit deal was made during the crisis about the permanent character of the worki mr wallendinged out that the combination of the caledantion and north british rawilly early in the year resultom at once in the discharge of several carllus in glasgow and pro ceeded no feel that if companies a long to reduce their staffs it should be done by not filling up vacancess the outlook however does not seem promising the milldan and great northern have discharged some jumior clers already and the lancashire and yorkshire several more the cheshire liness committee a joint undertaking of the great northern lildand and great central have discharged nearly a score if this happens

recive to rogen of the amalgamated soitev of railway servants in an article on the working agresented arrived at between the midland and london and northwestern railway con paisom and the great central great northern and greattver lawilary comarasisted is idle to overlook the fact that these combination arrangement agree ment whatever they may bo allead constitute a tremendous change in to policy which has hitherto been adoped by the railway companies of these islans the most serious part of this business however is the assumption thist amalragention and combination of this kind can bo carried out without parliamentary sanction or revision it may be a good thing or it may he a bad thing for these agrescement to take place but we arc convinced that they ought not to be alidowed to be cemented until parlirnere luss had an opportunity of veiging and reviewing to whole of the arrangement which may be contemplate and of pronugnion a judgrent thereon this sunplisemes is all the more difficult to understand when it is remember that a committee of inquiry is in existence which is spopess to be dealing with the whole question of railway policy as between the companies and the general public all these fitercanher and agreenisent prove the absolute need not only for a parliamentary inquiry into the working of our present railway systems but of a practical public policy by which the interest of the public may be safeguadgrad at tho pleently moment in spite of the protestation of the railay companies there is no guarantes of any safeguard of the rights and privileges of the general public nor any guarantee with regard to the stafd who are emploie as a matter of public importance we consider it is the bounden duty of the board of trade to intervene and stop these agree ment until the whole question of policy has been thoroughly considered and a decision arrived at with eyes wide open
