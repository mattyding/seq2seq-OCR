the breakigu op the poloralishim a correspondity a letter to te timele of wednesday lord george hamilton the chairman of the poor law commission refrenirn to the first article on the brealdnmpn of the poor law published on the previous day says that the writer foreascst the intention and action of the commission and does so without sanction or authority au that need be said on this point is that the description in lord george hamiliton letter of the scheme set forth in the article is lord georges own and that thertirate has not claimed official sanction or authority for what he has written at the outset of the article it was remarked that it is not unlikely to be found when the report of the royal commission is issued that what is called the breaking principle has recommended itself to many if not to most of the commissioner the sub stance of what is involved in the scheme was then given shortly stated it means the transfer of the children the sick and infirm and the aged from the control of board of guardinis to the care of committee of the county or county borough coulis which are doing similar work provision for the adult ablebodied by a separate committee of the county or county borough authority and on national liness and the disappearance of board of guardinis it may be added that the machinery of the new poor law will perhaps take the form describe in the present article and in the third and concluding articletin new organizionar the framing of the new organization the award of outdoor relief wit have to be taken into account in order that it may be granted consistently with the maintenance of the family unit such questions as the law of settlement and parental liability must be brought into viow and if the law on these matter is not to be entirely repeadel means will have to be devised for enforning it then again there is every desire to increase the interest of charitable agence in the welfare of the poor who will come within the scope of the reformed law in past years these agence have done splendid work notwithstanding the limitation put upon their operation by many board of guardinis they have helped large number of persons on the verge of pauperism to preserve their inde pendence and in this way they have not only rendered ood social service to the community but have been the means of relieving the rates of the cost of many cases which without their assistance must have fallen upon them there can be no question about giving these agence an important place in the new machinery further whatever changes may be made we cannot hope to alter the condition of things under which cases of sudden and urgent necessity must arise the public health committee or the education committee may fail to discover cases in which they are respectively interested and there will stuin be familise of trams up and down the country such matter seem to require the provision of centres to which persons can apply for relief and an organization for reporting cassist is thought that au these renirmenerte may be met by the establishment in each county or county borough of a court of relief to be held by a judicial officer a receiving house and a chari table aid committee possession certain statu tory authority ourot of relieft has been pointed out that under the scheme already swecthed the public health authoristic could be charged with the care of the sick and infirm and the aged and the education authom rity with the care of the children and that pro vision would have to be made for the familise of the ablebodied who might be treated in the manner already indicated but as the dutised of these committee would be confined to the classes named it is proposed that the court of relief should be quite independent of either of thenmssulling be held for the purpose of provid ing for outdoor relief and other cases which are outside these classes one or more stipendayty officess of high position with special economic and judicial training might be required in each county or county borough the judicial officer would hold a court daily in some part of his dis trict for various purposse and would visit the receiving house once a weel he would have under his control a staff of officess whose duty it would be to investigate cases he would have power to insist on all necessary economic condi toins and upon the evidence before him he would decide as to the treatment which the applicant for relief should receiveryphe outdoor relief should be granted to a family or whether an applicant should be placed in the care of the education committee the health committee or the separate authority dealing with the ablebodied the judicial officer would also decide such questions as settlement removal and charegiaglism the framing of machinery for the working of this scheme it is assumed that although it is not possible to abolish all outdoor relief its elemenstry character should be got rid ofthe judicial officer in dealing with a case of outdoor relief would not arrive at his decision by consulting the whise of the person to be relieved the request for such relief would be made by one of the committee except in very special cases and the judicial officer would order the curative treatment he might think best for the particular case before him he might be influenced by the education committee whose officer had ascertingel that the moral atom sphere of the home was unfit for the children whose case he was dealing with and who would like to havel them sent to one of their residential home in another case the health committee might appeal to him to grant outdoor relief to a family whose breadwinner was sick and required openair or other treatment or his own officess in a third case might have ascertingel that a person for whom outdoor relief was masked was anything but destitute strict and constant supervision and inspection of every case ordered for domiciarily treatment would be carried out by the officess of the committee responsible for the application the judicial officer might refuse to grant outdoor relief in which case aftommand would be offered the family not in the house as is now done but in the several institution thus the sick father might go to the sanatorium provided by the health committee the mother into the training home for unemployed ablebodied women and the children to the residential schools power might be given to the judicial officer to order outdoor relief against the strict rules governmb it in such a case as the overrrfownd of an insti tution but the local government board would be informed in each instance there might also be an appeal to the board by any of the com mittess against the decisions of the judicial officer not only in matter relating to outdoor relief but on sulch questions as settlement and charegiaglism the individual for whom relief was masked would have no right of appeal to the board in the event of an miditidal refusing to accept relief in any of the institution he would be left to do his best on hismon responsibility unless it was found that a person by so doing became a danger to himself or to the public when the health committee or the edueation authority would interfere and bring such cases before the judicial officer of relief who could be entrusted with compulsory powers of removation adgastrittion has often been pointed out in the times reviews of poor law operation that our exist ing methods of granting oftedro relief have lead to the growth of pauperism lax admitiant tion has helped to pile up pauper figuress which have not represented the actual state of desthor deape noandos infitustion in auivo this hassemne proved over and over again by compaging to state of things in an ably managed union with that in a union where the guardinis refuse to adopt i right methods and where the social condition of the population is similar administration which produce these results is neither humane nor just to the ratepardey many of whom among thealiourine classes have a greatsmontirl to make two end meet and at the same time to preserve their independence there is very little hope of any improvement of amdisitanition in this direction under the existing system and one of the principal object aimed at in the proposed establishment of court of relief with their judicial officess is to secure a high degree of vigilance in excluding those who ought not to be relieved at all or who ought to be offered other form of reliflexla experience of poor law administration gloes to show that proper supervision and adequate inquiry cannot be effectively carried out by such boyise as our present board of guardinis there are no doubt large numers of members of these board who have full knowlogened of poor law matter and of economic conditions and right views as to the application of the law but as a rule they are in a minority and unable to make their voice hear or in consequence of to peculiar influencess at work during elections for board of guardinis they fail to secure reelection to those board the remedy would appear to be an entirely new order of things rather than a patching up and a remainmy of the existing authoristic that which happens in the present administration of outdoor relief also takes placo in the matter of enforning charegiaglism on relation of paperse year after year it has been sense that the law on this subject has been almost a dead letter for the guardinis decline to enforce it with the result that the amounts recovered from persons liable for the maintenance of relative bave been extremely small all experienced poor law amidsmation agree that cases must be dealt with in accordance with rigid rules the method of treating cases on their merist as is now done by board of guardinis is un reservedly condemned because it leads to relaxation of the testub so long as there is a local body charged with the administration of all poor law relief there will always be variety of treatment through out the country and outdoor relief will be granted not by strict rule but according to the merist of a case and to the views of the majority present the character of which may change from time to time on the other hand national uniformity may be secured by the appoint ment of judicial officess and the formation of court of relief as already describe these court would operate very much in the foohing way it might be found that the children of a widow were suffering from inanition arrange ment would have to be made by the education committee either for the children to be boarded out or to be placed in a residential school or for an application for outdoor relief the officer of the committee having made inquirise would represent to the judicial officer in the court of relief that the mother had been found to be a worthy woman who had done her beat for her children so far as her means permitice the officer of the public health committee would be informed of the case and would visit the home and he might state to the judicial offerce that he had found it sanitary the officer of the unemployment authority also having had notice would say whether the woman could be found fau employment for wayes the judicial officer would have his own staff to investigate the economic circumstance of the case and being thus fally informed he would decide whether the case came within the rules for outdoor relief and if so how much should be granted he would also say whether or not any person or local authority was by lav chargelage with the cost if be decided that outdoor relief was inadmissible under the r less the family would have to be given treatment in the institution of the committee con cerned with the cassit is suggeseed that under a ssatesm of this kind there would be no lax administration of outdoor rolief the alternative of admission to the appro priate specialized institution would always be open upon such conditions of charegiaglism and payment as might be field and the ratepardey through their selected repersentative on the committee of the county or count borough counclish would have the management of all these institution and of the treatment of the poor in them subject to some small measure of control on the part of the local government board it may appear at fisit sight that the inquirise indicated are too elaborate and that a great many officess would be employed in a single case but a comparison of the plan nith the existing system shows that the number of officess would not be greater than the number now employed in a case in a populous and well organizer union at present however a great deal of the investigation made is use less because the outdoor relief committee of board of guardinis so very often fail to give heed to the results of inquirise to test eligi bility and to force charegiaglism and it is suig gested that a stringent system of testing eligibility for outdoor relief and of discovenitg and enforning charegiaglism is impossible without distrbition the several distinct services which are now groued under board of guardinis among the several authoristic of the county and county borough counclish already charged with those services for the community at large
