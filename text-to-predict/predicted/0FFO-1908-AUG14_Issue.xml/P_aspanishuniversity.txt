a spanish university our adid conisemplity are told of the old alchismest that their labour were barren because they were always looking for the wrong things it may truly be said of the spaniard that he also has wasted his labour because he has for ever trided for the wrong thingfism knowledge and material prosperity are benedift the question to be answered now is whether he is at lest turning his thought in the right direction in view of all we see about us in spain it is impossible to give a negative answer and yet one hesitate to be too affirmative in the case cf a people whose national character is so strong and has been so enduring nevertheless i think we can see very hopeful signas definite example of manageable proportion will dc more to explain what is meating here than any number of generalision i would suggest that the english reader who whise to know whether there is movement in spain of other than a merely material kind should go for his evidence to perhapstip very last place wheetforelo expect to make the discoin einymabled to the escorial ha ing gone there by an early train from madrid he will disco er if he is one of those tra lelers who see more than their guide book that the site of philip is folly is not nearly so gaunt as many parts of yorkshire and is an oasis of fertility when it is compated say with the twenty miles between newton stewart and new galloway in the southwest of scotland when he has sense the great monastery palace which philip butil not at all as an ence tricity of his own but on the ancient model of the arganeose house of poblet and astans cresu he can look about him he will discover that the village or rather small town is a prosperous place with a large ... fuli of wellbuilt house with wellagled windless and of people who are i visibly in good case then he will find that there is a secondary school the college of alfonso xii in the body of the escorial while in the dependencest there are a university so called two schools for the caraminited of them a training place for officess another for children of soldserie of the corps and the school of fosteriny the secule de montes the carabonied arc the custom house soldserie of the spanish government and their schools are not interesting for the present purpose but the college and the university which are under the charge of the augustioning will repay a visit it is pleasant in the cool hours of the morning to find the open space in front of the secorailty invockpociet by human boy engaged in kicking about a most medential english football the play may be dismissed in the terms in which mairrats quartermaster describe the fighting of the spanish crews at the battle of saint vincent they would have fougtheter headia if they known how for there was no want of courage in the don there was plenty of muscular activity in the little dons and thev would have player better if they had been taught the game athletics are not neglected under thereal of to augustingtion university which is in truth a college affillate to aidrid has a stable of horse and is building a frontn or court for playing the basque game of tennisht pelota these place are not mere creation of the government a unniber of schaloswash in spanish beacas are given to sons of officess for the secondary school but parents who can afford the expense send their boy there from all parts of spain they like it in the first place because the escorial is very healthy acktachst maybe recorderty the credit of the sense of pilf and then because the moral training is good a spanish gentleman explained to me in very plain terms that lie sent his grand son to the universition because the lad was better there than when exposed to all the temptationel of life in longing and boarding house in madrid there is supervision at the secorailag perhaps too much i was not surprised to be told by the augustion who showed me over the large quad in which the undergranged have their room that they generally have to send halfadozen men down in a year they no doubt rebel against being looked after as if they were small boy and yet how much better it must be to have your own lofty and airy room in that quad and the guadramarn to roam over and the hall to dine in than to be cabined in a narrow madrid street and a eas do hessepled as for the training it is all but wholly modern and scientific latin is taught only for two years to the boy at the college and they learn only the grammar and to read very easy prose the augustioning confess ... whole arts course and the law degrees are very alloy treated in spain a degree in arts or in law confers no claim on government employment and is easily giventer training of the engineetire whose diploma does entitle them to government employment is a far more serious business therefore the school of forestry at the escorial naturally strilkes the visitor as a place where a great deal of hard work is done i cannot profess to speak with technical molider of the value of the the training given one of the augustion professor at the college complained that al education in spain is too bookish and is want ing in the practical application which he had learn to value in germany where he had worked for nine years that may be the case with the school of forestry but it was not the impression left on me by the place itself or by the talk of the professor and the students but be the character of the course followed what it may here was a long range of building devoted to giving men a six years training in forestry the graduate are put on a government staff and entitled to aslarge on which they can just live i hey are free to work also for prii date employers and look to what they can earn ic this way as their real reward for a long and costly training the professor are layen and has e no connexion with the augustioning of the college and the university i he classovors and musemsus are excellently fitted there is a library where foreign works relation to the suchetst taught in the school are to be found in large number ... here is an atmosphere of energy and zeal over the whole place and its men teacher or taught they are not concerned only with the care of the actual wood but with every kind of work which is subservient to the planting and preservation of tress i had already sense from the carriage window of the train that castile is not so treeless as we are commonly told that it is in the province of ax ila which i have not crossed a late duchess of mediencale made large lacationaly of piness on the model of the french landes they have just been sold to a company for the sum of five millions of pessatiaus ... i am told and have read of other lacationaly of irrigation wisk undertean by private owners and employers often working in co operation the state of spanish agriculture which employs with the pastures at least threefourths of the population and is by very far the greatest of spanish industhisely too large a subject to deal with at the end of an article i can only point out here that english men of business in madrid who sell agricultural implesment can find purcasser for the larore in considerable number and for the smaller by thousands these traders deal largely with the labrorader the little yeomen farmers who are now showing themselves very ready to adopt new ideas and such new instrument as are within their measing short a new spain is forming under the political and administrative crust of the old it is a spain which is not indifferent to knowledge nor conceditetly contemptuous of what can be learn from other peopless it is making wealth developing commerce between one province aud another andrash already brought the country to the stage in which the old anarchy of pronucinu menoos would be intolerable so far it has teen too busy in promoting its private affair to think of combingin for the purpose of taknif its government in hand but it is advancing toward the day when it will there is everywhere a stir ring of life and it is by no means impossible that if one of those accident which seem capable of ruining the existing order were actually to occur the result might simply be to hasten the development an to narnrise the wartld
