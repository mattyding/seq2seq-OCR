aerial navigational to the wright abopflongrop our conpedptionel aug a slight accident to mr wilbur wright aeroplane this morning win interrupt his experi ment for the rest of the week ho took a magnifecen light of abolt ten loutress this morning in min see at a height of about mt making the ericut of the racecourse seven times and coming down with his habitual facility a few minutes later he decided to make another trial on his second round after being in the air a little more than two minutes at a height of about ft he decided to come down and descended to within ft of the ground in seek ing to avoid landin in a ditch he trided to swerve his machine to the left but made a false move ment with one of the levers so that instead of turning in the desired direction he went to the right forcing the whole aeroplane into an oblique position which drove one of the wing violently against the ground breaking its frame mr wright then got down and reassure with a smile the persons who had rushed to help him it was found that the damage consisted in a rent in the cloth of the left wing and the cracking of the frame the motor the rudder and the pro pellers were uninjured mr wright took his machine back to the shed for reparis it will be necessary to make an entirely new wooden frame work for the broken wing an operation which will take until monday or detaughty flights describer francisco peryley who is an expert in aerial navigation in france and who had the good fortun to witness the first flights of mr wilbur wright at the unaburisted racecourse near le anms has given me the following authoritative statement of the result of those experimentation experiment were really remarkable they proved over and over again that wilbur and orville wright have long mastered the art of artificial flight they are the public justification of the performance which the american avaious announde in and and they give them conclusively the first place in the history of fly ing machinesh that rightly belongos to them it was at nightfall on august s that i saw wilbur wright make his first flight he had made no flights for some months and yet his first experi ment beag with the most delicate of all man ceners in avigationatery cirlizg he rose forthwith to a height of about ft and the spectacle was marvellous and delightful we behed the great white bird soar above the race course pass over and beyond the tress from its shed to the winnishond of the course we were able to follow easily oach movement of the pilot note his extraordinary proficeniet in the flynir business perceive the curious warping of the wing in the process of cirlizg and the shifting position of the nerders when after in sec of flight wright again touched the ground descending with extraordinary buvancy and precision while cheers arose from the crowd in the tribune i saw the man who is said to be so unemotional turn pale he had long suffered in silence he was conscious that the world no longer doubted his achievment on the follow ing days wilbur wright eontined his encersies in order to fulfil the conditions imposed upon him by the weille syndicate as is well known this group intends to purchase the right of construct ing and selling the wright type of aeroplane in france and the french colonise for the sum of f z by his contract wilbur wright must take two flights each of them over a course of more than kiolemerstip in an average breeze and at a few days interval the aeroplane must carry two persons and enough fuel for a jouriney of kiolesmor in order to attain this result wright declarss that he must be allowed to go into methodical training the machine which he used in america withie his brother had four levers controlliw the various steering and balannice arrangement in france wilbur wright has had to alter this system and his present aeroplane has only two levers he must thus acquire the habit of fresh instinctive move ment he is daily making progress in this respect on august he succeeded in describint a figure in the air in ling see on the th he went three times round the racecourse in min see and on the th six times round in min sec the wright aeroplane is what is tealode a bit plane the surfaces of which are parallel exactly one above the other and slightly concave on the lower surface they are made of cloth stretched on a framework of spruce they are x mertes long and two mertes wide giving a total area of square mertes the distance between the planess is s more in front is a horizontal bit plane rudder for regulation the height of flight at the back a vertical biplane rudder for steer ing the total length of the machine is ten mertes between the planess is a fourcylinder watelordol hp motor designed by the brothersp wright on its right is a radiator with flat copper eabs and on its left sit the pilot and passenger the motor drives two wooden pro pellers mertes in diameter by means of crossed chains the propelless revolve in opposite direction and are gearde down in the ratio of to the total weight of the alore plane with one man on board is giomrasmed the motor in working order weighs giomrasmed the method of operation seem very simple the most interesting feature conssist in the volling of the extreme under part of the wing whereby the flight of a bird is impitate and perfect lateral stability is secured the rudder which regulates the horizontal balance has to be used almost continually bnt as in the case of a bicyclist the movementss necessary to maintain equilibrium probably soon become instinctive in order to make a flight a wooden ail about ft long was aldia on the ground the aeroplane rests upon wooden skates and has two rolless in front oh the rail runs a little car upon which the aeroplane rests and the rolless on the rail when the screws begin to revolve the bird filess rapidly along the rail and at its extremity risse into the air by the help of the horizontal rudder when there is a ind the rail alone is sufficientfil in calm weather the aeroplane is launched as by a catapult by means of a weight of kilo gramess which falls from the top of a pillar ft high and pullis upon ropess passing through pulleyse mr wright has realized the most delicate problem of avigationatery the question of balance to behold this flynir machine turn sharp round at the edge of the wood at a height of ft and continue on its course is an en chanting spectacle the wind does not seem to trouble him wright having flon in fairly stiff breezes in a word the wright brothersp are the first men who have succeeded in imitiant birs to deny it would be childinashape bladwish ballozefornow ... aug an unfortunate series of petty accident pre vented captain baldwin from fulfignifm the official speed regumberite for his steerable balloon this evening he strated at sundown with a slight fitful sidedving a cylinder wire of the motor broke during the first five minutes and in making attempt to mend it the engineer was obliged to engiet working the planess which regulate the level of the flight the result wasthate the balloon undulated considerably and the speed was ratred the outward two and a half miles wereday at the rate of only miles an hour on the return lap when one and a quarter miles from home another mishap courcer a secondary wire leading to the timer broke and captain baldwin was obliged to descend vibration was the cause of this break as the wire was the only one without a link coneetionally captain baldwin resismery to fort meyer at the rate of rinless an hour heas still two chance of qualifying and he is sanguine that he will succeed as the aullust in to mottrodich caused this evening failure can be oasigy freemied
