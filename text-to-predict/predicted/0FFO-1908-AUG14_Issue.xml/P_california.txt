californition ou special ... serene indifferent of fathetou sittest at the western gatertow bret harte in his poem san rancisco and many readers have wondered what he meating he meating what he said this sereaity this indifference of the san fran ciscans of the californitiry one of the qualities that make them unique among americans there is something of the gaiety of the parisian in it something of the fatalism of the asiatic a little of the recklessness of the western cow boy but california is not part of the west in anything but geographical position one passe through the west to reach california and most travelless are glad enough to leave it behind with its cruditite its bruttivisted its discomstory its lack of all those things which for an eductade human being make up the savitished and interest of life i know of no impression in travel quite equal to that obtinabed when one enter california by the inual over land route one has passed days in getting over the dreary prairses and the drearire desert one has crossed the rockies so high up that all idea of height and grandeur is lost the train has crawled painfully up the bleak silersa and on reaching the summit has passed through one snowshed after another some of them many miles long and then all at once it seem so quickly is the descent made one drosp into that lovely country of sunshine of plasm and orange groves of mineyheads and flowestrus sense of aloofness of a country apart increase the longer one stay in california on the surface there is not much difference between the californitiro and the americans of the east the middle west and the west the people one mest in the street of san francisco seem rather more cheerful and less obsessed by the spirit of hustle than the people of for instance chicago or cincinnati but the build nighst are as ugly as in other american townas the street singn as blatant the hotels as gorgeous and as uncomfortable the newspaper head liness are as big and as ungrammatical as the display head of the journalss of the east while the outlook on the world appears just as parochial and the papers are as full of personalic tise of vulgarity of stories of graft thatroofbrike tendency to suspect the motives of every man which dickens noticed in america is rather more evident in the press of san francisco than in that of other citise of the united states american too is the habit of ignorning the really big things that are being done and of paying a great deal of attention to tlings that are neither remarkable nor particularly admir able for example astinlosist feats have been performed in the reconstruction of san francisco building have been put up in six months that in london would take as many years if some of them were put up in london the authoristic would make the owners pull them cown again but that has nothing to do with the point i am making all this is taken quite as a matter of course while i have sense little crowd of citienes gather and look with wonder and admiration ata few square yards of thirdart asphalt pave i ment just aldia in marestcketive is when ono learnss to know the people of california that one realize the remarkable differences between them and the rest of the inhabitation of the united states the americans never cease to be pained and surprised at the behaviour of a somewhal large proportion of the distinguished persons from europe who visit the cone to america and are re ciccuresty they are shown the clus of new york the stockardsy of chicageth miscellaneous architectural effects of washing ton the various activities of other touns and then they go home and ritt books and articles soub america that are bitter sarcastic and often inaccurate the americans who are just as thinskinned as ever they were cannot under stand it and they ask each other whether it can be that the majority of distingusited europeas are illbred boors but ha not the real explanation of this been over looked i fancy the trutl is that so many travelless go home from the united states carring nith them a bad impression of the countr a feeling of irritation because to put it bluntly they have been borester trouble nith the average american is that he is not interesting he is so much of a specialist that he has had no time to attend to those things which to the cultivated euipenal are the things worth talking about he cannot with any confidence discuss books or pictures or music or even international politics he intows the politics of his own country but un fortunately they are so complicated that nobody who has been in thentubine states for only a short time can understand them and so thereis not much common ground on which he and the i visitor from europe can meet of course we all i know that some of the most learnde and cultivated men in the world live in the united i states i am speaking of the class which in america correspond to the aristocratic class in europeos the californian is different it was mr roosevelt i believe who once describe california as the greece of manerica the expression was a happy one and more than happy accurate there is being evolved in california a civilization which is quite unille anything else in the united states a civiliag tion as charming in its way as the civilization that must have existed in lessou when sapphor lived the ratio of works written by californitiro to the population of the state compared with the number of copy righted works originitat in the other states is amazing surprising also is the number of wellknown literary man and women in new york who were born in california most surprising of all is the quality of the literary and artistic work that is being done in california of which work the rest of america know very little and europe know almost nothingthen are various influencess that have com bined to produce the civilization which is beginning to express itself in california in the first place i suppose must be put the perfect elimated of the country and its beauty the blue pacific on the one side the wonderful mountains on the other and between them a land as fair as any in the world added to this there is the quality of romance without which to many persons scenery however beautiful is mean ingless even tiresome the spanirasd have gone but they left behind them legend and tradition beautiful names for mountains and bausy and townas and the mission style of architecture which the architetus of today are advaint to modern requirements those picturesque old missions of adobe dotted all over the country from monterey to san diego have insperd many poem and painting and have indeed provided a keynote for the art of the californitiro consider also the influencess of names would san francisco have been the same had it been called smithiluel would santa barbara be so delightful were it known ... then again san francisco is a gateway to the orient and just as the arts of venice were coloured and glorified by the citsy traffic with persia and india so the arts of california are intercure by some note of dreamy grogesoous that has come from the far east one finds it in the poetry of george sterling in the painting of diclanm and wores in the remarkable embroidery and jewelry and metal work that two or three san francisco women are production in music the work being done in california is being influenced from a strange source i wonder how many europeas know anything of the music of the hawitasision haunting exquisite meldious that seem like the farewell of a dying race centre of the cultivation of california is thecelenatice ohmaping club of san franciscit is i suppose one of the halfdozen best known clus in the world mr kipling has describe it so any description here would be superfluous the central event of the year for the members of the bohemian club is the summer jinks which are held in a wonderful grove in the country the property of the club the performance given on these occasion is like nothing else in the world it is not a play not an opera in the ordinary sense but a kind of mystery play set to music with setting of the most elaborate character months are spent every year in preparing the performance and the author and the composer are always mem bers of the bohemian club receiving no pecuniary compensation for their work which in many cases has been of a very high order this fact servel to remind one that essentially the californian civilization is a pultcatical civiliaition pultcatical civiliag tion that is beginning to justify itself the struggling genius is rare the poet or painter or musician usually has money or know where he can get it i thought i had found a pathetic case when a girl begged me for advice in regard to getting her work into the magazine the next time i saw her was in her home where setared at a louis xv escritoire she was engaged in writing cheesuan large number of the californian postes and painters have summer home at monterey a beautiful old spanish town three or four hours railway journey from san francisco others live at burlingame while still others have ranchest in the interior of the state but al make frequent tripse to their beloved bohemian club and as soon as they get there find out what the latest excuse is for arrangeni a dinner of the members when for instance the safe deposit and trist company went under recently carring with it a good many millions in depsosit there was a hardluck dinner at the club the room whas illuminate by candless stuck in bottless and the table decoration con sisted of carrost and turnips but i noticed that there was nothing the matter with the quality or quantity of the champagne neither did the financial disaster affect the seceest which were up to the usual brilliant standard of the club mir kipling by the way must have been unfortunate in the bohemian club dinner which he attended for the spreadeagle type of speech is very rare at the club and when it is hear is usually laughe at perhaps they got up a special programme for ir kinling benefictis is a new and brilliant and graceful cultiva tion that the californitiro are developing of course they share some of the faults of the rest of the americans chief among these being the lack of civic spirit which has premitted crimi als like reful and schim to exploit san francisco but even in this connexion there are encouraging singn for surely it is encouraging when men lie mir rudolph spreceled and mr james d phelan are willing to brave violent abuse in alttind for the right i quoted bret harte at to beginning of this letter the poem from which the liness were taken was written years ago but even then the poet dreamed of the time to be henall fulfilledle the vision weho watch nnd wait shall never sec who in the morning of her raccetioled fair or meanly in our placcemackiler geographically and so far as climate is concerned is only one of the chain of states which extend along the western coast of this continent there may be a little more rain in the nortlo but with that exception other is practically no difference in climate between san francisco portland seattle and bellianch even here in vancouver an overcoat in the vinter is a superfluity what i have said about cail fornia will i believe apply in the future to oregon and washington they are affected by the sarnet influencess they are marked off geographically from the rest of the united states and in time i think the pacific coast will develop a new civilization which will be a finer more complete more bridiant more wholesome civilization tall that of eastern america i
