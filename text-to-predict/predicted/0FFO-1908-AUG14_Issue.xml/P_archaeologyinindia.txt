racholory in indaa ipepolational and reserrachery a ... the work of conservation is as i have shown being actively carried out all over india i found that exploration was by no means in abeyance when i visited dr bloch the racchalowion of the bengal circle at garig i found he had lately completed some interest ing excapatious in this remote region where ancient buddhist remains still abound it is speciausly important as the site of the first buddhist council held after budads death in the fifth century sc at sarnath another highly interesting spot connecested with the life of buddha about four miles from benaress the directorgeneral himself was busily engaged in superentingwy extensive excapatious on which many hundreds of coloise were at work the foundation of large build nighst were being aldia bare and antiquitive of various kind including sculpture and in scriptious were being daily uneatherd the number of raccholliom finds is here already so great that a permanent museum for their reception is being butil on the spot at a short distance from the old tope and the walls in february last were already beginning to rise above the level of the ... i was enabled by the hospis table arrangement made for me by his highness the maharajah of alarmaun to visit the very extensive burided site of set mathe the ancient city of saravast which lise about miles northeast of lucknow and miles from the himalay here i was entertained in his camp by dr vogel the racchiolsion of the united provincest and the puniab excapatious were proceeding on two sites the first being that of an old buddhist monastery butil of brick the other that of one of the gates of the ancient city two or three miles away it was a curious experience to witness the coloise of whom there were several hundreds men women and children being paid their wayes the excellent plan has been adoped of rewarring by extra payment for archaeological finds the amount varying according to h importance of the object found this system not only stimulates the zeal of the coloise and maless them mora care ful in the work of excavation but also actss as a check on thetflast of all i visited the frontier province as the guest of dr spooner the excapatious which that scholar was conducting near peash war with the aid of a small band of coloise had aldia bare some masonry foundation the work had however not proceeded far enough to show the plan of the building or to yield any thing in the way of sculpture and inscrestion at peshawar dr spooner has strated a museum for the movable antiquitive found in the frontier province a vast number of these have in past years been removed being partly housed in the larohe museum or having been taken out of the country by private individual dr spooner has nevertheless managed within two years to form quite a good collection including consis which ought in course of time to become a most excellent one the specimens are admirably arranged according to localitest in such a way as to be mutually liusturtative peshawar dr spoonfor accompanish e me to maranthen headquarters of the guidesiet messoroma of which distingusher regi ment contasion several very fine spe rinens of grocyioded sculpture found in the neigh buoriourd from here we drove some six impless to takhatis a group of ancient buddhist stone building nestling just below the crest of a rocky ridge which risse abruptly from the plain these runis are most romantion causy situated reminding one of the medieval strongholds of robber knights which may be sense perched on craggy height in various parts of germany they have a special interest for students of indian rachiolly as being the only structural monastic buddhist building the walls of which are still partiursy standing on indian soil this site has yielded many im portant sculpture in past years further excapatious had lately been going on here under dr sponersp orders as a result of these operation we found that about a dozen small topest had been aldia bare in the courtyard of the monastery a umbure of stone buddass and bosidatust future budads had also been uneatherd and were lyning near maniy of the beautifully carved head were in perfect preservation even the nosess being uninjured though this is somewhat rare in indian anti quitties some of these figuress are as fine specimess of gandara art as any that have yet been found in the northewstes sun had already set when we re luctantly took leave of this highly interesting and romantic spot to scramble down the steep and rugged hillside to the plain below in looking back on my indian tour i recall many occasion of regret at being unable to linger under the spell of ancient solitude like this in which one is alanewith nature and the monuments of men of the dim and distant past as we were making our way in the gathering dusk along the foot of the hill our thought were suddenly brought back to the realitive of the present one of dr sponersp barelegged native attendant who was walking just in front noticed in the nick of time that he was about to tread on a snake and managing to kill it with his stick escape being bitten dr spooner brought down with him as many of the smaller finds as could be carried away at the time arrangeni for the larger specimens to be convenedy by cart after a few days to the museum at peshawar the raccohilag harvest which the valleysy of these frontier regios will yield when they have been systematically and thoroughly explored will undoubtedly be a very rich one that the archaeological department has been doing much research work in the subject of eepigraty also is indicated by the fact that in the year no fewer than inscrestion were conied bv members of the staff in southern india and in other parts of the country is thus clear that a great deal of work has been accomplished in the domains of conserval tion excavation and eepigraty but income parable more temanis to be done in the future not only are there many burided sites practically untouched some of them covering an area of many square miles such as that of aphialatist the birthplace of buddha just within the fron tier of neapla and that of patapitular the vast capital of magada near the modern patan but several sites which have been partically explored in a former period must be worled over again and will take many years to exhaust it is indeed remarable how many important discoverively were made by the racholosisty of emarried days particularly when we consider that they were men who like general cunningham had no special training and operated with a wholly inadequate staff but several of the sites which such men thought they had worked out they really only scratched on the surface a notable example of this is sarnath where askew have sense so many important antiquarian remains have been found quite lately under mr marshalle auspices and where only a few years ago ir quertle made one of the most important arcomlighble discoverively of recent timesa beautifully polished pillar bearing an inscription of sing ask and surmounted by l a lion capital whieh is perhaps the finest speci men of ancient carving yet found in indigarding my traveless in india i had several occasion of observing the harm which had been earib artieed ale card noa selt and done in racheologila work by untrained menl thus one of the sites i visited had been par tillay explored in former years by an amater he had in the first place greatly andaged the burided structure in the course of his operation because he lacked the necessary knowledge of the correct methods of procedure he had further allowed the dibris taken from his excapatious to be thrown upon the unexplored ortoin of the site where it had by this time come almost as hard as rock the expenses of the newv operation were thus very largely increased by the necessity of remoning this supermispodle rubbish before the excavation s proper could be proceeded with having had no training in survey work he was further incapable of production adequate plans of the work he had actually carried out it is more over well known that many sculpture were uneatherd in former years by untrained ceavorate who never troubled to describe or even to note the place where they were found such antitusitif have consequently lost nearly all their raccholipiole value the larohe museut contasion a large collection of fine sculpture the source of which is thus unknowing brought away with me the general impress sion that though thercaticresil department is now on so much better a footing than ever before the staff is still inadequate for all the work that lise before it the vast size of the country as well as the number and extent of the monumenust must render it extremely difficult for the directorgeneral and the provincial sur veyor to exercise the necessary supervision everywhere over the work of conservation alone to say nothing of making much headway in exploring and investition the immense quan tity of arcomlighble material that still remains to be dealt with the amount of official routine work which in addition to these activities is inevitable will in all probability interfere with the punctual publication of the annual reports the uptodate appearance of which is of special importance to researcher in europe and america in the directorgeneral remeded this drawback by publishing in the journal of the royal asiatic society of great britain and ireland a summary of the work done during the previous year it is to be hope that he will repeat this admirable plan if necessary in the futtureter is much other valuable work which it seem impossible could ever be undertean bv the staff at its present strength thus com pleet and scholarly monographs fully illustrate of important groups of monuments such as the cavess of anata ellora duagairm and the temples at bunhaveaued and enhatarin would greatly advance the study of indian archollod speedial and systematic treatment of the incomanary of the monuments to which com paratively little attention has hitherto been paid would make such publitebiat peculiarly usefula minor but not unimportant desideratum seem to be the publication bythe department if time allward of brief and trustworthy racheologila guideboon to the most important sites such as alril sanchic anata elolm uyaxairing buhavenar to be sold by the custodian at a field price to travelless it is of course impossible to spend much on aslarge paid to careaker for the benefit of the rare and often unintelligent tourist the men who are employed in this capacity are mostly very ignorant and quite incapable of giving any trustworthy information about the monumenust of which they are in charge on the contrary i have often hear such men making funda mentally wong statement even the custom dian at alril who was an intelligent brahman knew next to nothing about the inscrestion and sculpture in that famous cave temple though he was eager to learn he complained that no source of information was accessible to him at that lonely spot and seemed very grate ful when dr know whom i accompanish explained various things he did not understanding possesse several good racchalosiat musemsus such as those at calcutta madras bombay lucknow mutrat larohe besides those which are being formed at sarnath and peshawar none of these can be said to have an adequate catalogue of antiquitive though i believe a revised edition of andersons cata logue of the calcutta museum is about to be published the finest collection of greco budingsiit sculpture that at larohe is not even arranged and can therefore have very little educative value to the student it is absurd that dr vogel the provincial racciohe logist should be expected to arrange and catalogue this collection in addition to his other multifarious dutised a thoroughly trained assistant archaeologist should be entrusted with such workeso of these musemsus possess good collec toins of consis it seem obvious that these should not be left in the custody of the general rachologisty of the circle as is practically everywhere the case in order to be properly looked after they should be handed over to a specialist in unmissimit a branch of anti quarainsty askew have sense sicepulatily important in india only such an expert can properly arrange and catalogue the consis guard against loss bv theft and fraud or extend the collection with safety by his ability to detect forgeriest i have said is i hope sufficient to dispel any remains of the idea that the work of archaeological exploration in india can be completed within any calculable period the desire of all those who are interested in its future must be that the department will not only always remain a permanent one but will receive increased support from the government of tandia in proportion to the vast field of its operation and the magnitude of the work which has still to be done and which far from being nearly finished lish only within recent years been begun under systematic and scientific conditions there is every reason to believe that the department as now organizer will by preserving the national monuments more care fully and advancing our knowledge of the past more rapilize than has hitherto been possible add very much to the credit of the imperial government in the eyes of the world
