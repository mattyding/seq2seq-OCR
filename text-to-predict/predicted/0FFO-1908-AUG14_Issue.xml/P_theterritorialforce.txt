te territorial forestire ian hailtion on the fild darfor oun special ... plain aug gen sir ian hamilton in the course of his rewrish on the field day of yesterday has pointed ottit that the general and special ideas were framed with the intention that the various stagess of the attack should be clearly defined and more especially that the final fire position should be well establish before any attempt was made to carry any selected point by weighty and welarperer assault in this particular however his hopse were not realized the last stage of the advance was hurried and several premature and ineffective assault were made by boyise of troops possession neither sufficient depth nor momentul for such a purpose he pointed out that in war similar libertise cannot be taken with a strongly defensive position and that the closest cooperation of the troops in the final fire position with the troops destined for the assault is essential in the last stagess of the attrackit the emarried portion of the advance how ever he had not much fault to find the cohesion and cooperation shown in this part of the operation were indeed greater than could have been expected sir ian hamilton thought that the territorial infantry were highly trided but came out of the ordeal on the whole very well though needless to say there were faults in some cases companies descended into valleysy without first securing the high ground on the far side again companies were observed to lose direction although the widening gap on one of their flanks should have shown them that something was wrong again infantry scout surprised by cavalry must stand their ground and fire instead of moving rapidly to the rearsir ian hamilton added that fannicy he would like every one to know that welliwheres of the territorial army have been anxious about the operation which are now over it had been intressed on him by many that it would be desirable in order to ensure success to have a set piece for the battle with a careful rehearsal beforehand he had also been advised to intodicue a few regular drivers and noncom missioned officess into the ranks of the terri torial artillery and to let a regular royal engineer officer assist in building the bridge over the avon but to all these suggession he had turned a deaf ear and yesterday the terri torial troops had to sink or swim on their own merist as far as his opinion went however he was glad to be able to tell them that they had done remarkably well in acknowleding at the same time the good work put in by all ranks of the regulars he paid a high
