in miness and ebolidesril he brought the subject under the attention of the house in great detail and proposed that in scotland any unmarried woman above the age of should be premitted to work under groundlersow asuacy the author of the act which mr c bucc sought to alter objected to his motion con tending that in scotland as well as in eugnald the legislature ought to adhere to its original object of keeping the women exempt from this description of labour and leaving it wholly to men and boy the law was now working wel for the morality and happiness of the people and he entreated the house not to frustrate it the pettiois which had been prevented to the legislature from women praying permission to work in miness and colleriver were not voluntary those petitioner had been obliged to sign themm hurse supported the motion he would not yield to lord assully in his desire to make his fellorcerache happy but he saw no objection against allowing women of mature age to accept labour at their own potisondit j gran while he desired to do the fullet justice to the motives of mr c bruce must resist his proposal experience was uniform in favour of the exemption of women you could not degrade the women without demoralizing and brutlizizy the men the experiment of amelioration had hi therto been most successfal cubtisi said he would vote with lord ans ley and added some sentencess upon the corn laws the application of which was not clearly discerent by the housedlord f gertiton thought the movers speech proved too much for it really went to show the la bour in miness and colleriver was among the most eligible modes of female employment he testified to the success of the exemption of women in lanca shire and would concur with lord asmy in op possing the motion ebounce admitate that legislation might be properly applied to the labour of children but he did think that adlust whether men or women were better judgess than parliament of the way in which their own labour should be employed his sympathite indeed were with the law that exclude women from underground work but he could not agree to legislate for the regulation of any labour ex cept of those who were not competent to exercise a discretion for themselvesily dangonior though not without hesitation resolved to give his vote in concurrence with lard ashlroum p strant in respect of the present distress in scotland which rendered this particular time a very inconvenient one for the closing of any channel of employment was content to vote for the intor duction of the bill although as to the general prin ciple he concrured with lord aslemy foncass was understond as being favourable to the introduction of the billmr bonrorout considering the elais of persons in quession and the influencess exercised upon the could see no more objection to legitality for thenthin to legitality for children and he hope the house would not undo themserap of lori asiairm lockitur supported the motion of mr c bist and indicated the motives of the scotch owners by whom the object was promotmerd inexald opposed the motion and contended that the house had a perfect right to legislate against any nuisance whether physical or moralre alderman thromp believed that in south wales great as was the present distress the men would endure ten times ai much rather than let their wive or daughter undertake this kind of employ ment it was in its own nature unfit for women and he would resist this motion c bruce ipledied had no wish to inter feer with the gearal principle of lord alsoms bill that the labour of women should evertly cease but he desired to mitigate the evil of too sudden a cessation the ground therefore on which ho put kis motion was not the doctrine advanced by mr renufuce tbat it is unfit to legislate at all for regulation the labour of adultste house divided for the montion against it majority against it sir c nixpir then brught under the considera tion of the house the subject of the naval lisset he eulgoized the character of our naval officess and their services both in war and in peace and complained that a canaul officer was not placed at the head of the admiralty lord st pricencer a distinguished admiral had held that star tion and his administration had been worthy of all praise he should like to see a naval commander incief at the head of the admiralty responsible for everything aud under him an admiral in each department acting under a warrant if minister would not do that let them make a lord high aa miral in the person of prince alder according to the precedent in aiente aless time he anyalled the lisset of persons emeloyed in the dockardsy and other civil department of the naval service and complained that the proportion of naval men on each bore too small a proportion to the number of the civiliasion the true policy would be to re ward naval services by this kind of civil appoint ment which would involve the additional advantage of saving the present pensions on the subject of a retider list he was much disappointed to learn that minister were not preparde to do anything he recommended that captains who had reachehed years of age and were within from the top of the list should bo premitted to retire on an increase of pay that room might be made for younger and more active men otherwist if a war should break out you would be placed in the alternative of employing men too old for their work or of utting their unirous over their head there was not the same urgent necessity in the case of commanders but here also the maasure would be both useful and just he believed that all which was necessary might be done for a year which was no great sum upon a naval esti mate of he moved an address to heratacy praying that she would give direction for a list on which captains might retire with an in crease of palyord ingenest seconded the motion adverting to the evils of want of practice he recomment ded that all opportunitive should be taken in time of peace for exercising our flest in various velotious he thanked the government for having restored the efficiency of our hiss of war by filing up their complesmentsil r pacax could not agree that the first lord of the admiralty remold necessarily be a naval man although he fully admittde that a naval man might often be advantageously appointed to that ofiefe acknowleding as he did the justice of the praise bestond by sir c n pait on the existing officess of our navy he could not think that system a very bad one which had produced a body of officess de serving such a panery as to the present proposal he hope the house would enable him to resist it with success each of the department of the state was always represention that the particular sum required for its wen purposse was a trifle in the total of the estimate here however the expense of which he had a calculation made would be larger than sir c narial seemed to have calougatel nor would it produe the advan tage he anticipated for the lodest captains on the list the men whose retirement it was an object to induce would be the most likely to held out knowing that the first brevet must give them their flag the only men likely to take the interease of pay and retire were the younger officess whom it was desirable to retain a report had been made only a few years ago by sir g concyxur sir c adk and sir t hadiy unain mosuly recommending it to the crown not to extend the principle of a retider listord j russul doubted whether the house of commons ought to address the crown at all for the purpose of directing the course of the executive government in such a matter as the conduct of the navy it was on that account that the late minis try when they desired to revise the naval and mili tary services had advised the crown to issue a com mission of its own on which the duke of yzvow to had cousented to act for the purpose of fur nishign such practical advice as the executive go versment might safely adopt with respect to this particular proposal would leave it to the considera tion of the admiralty and the decision of the go vernment and hope sir c napien would not press it to a diviscinitian benrx concrured in this hope believe ing that the discussion would meanwhile have had a beneficial exefceatclati pill clarged the admiralty with having paid more regard to services on the hustings than to services on the quarterdeck he gaue credit to government for having now manned the navy but they had been in former days the first to un man itapatian pluxp complained of the slowness of naval promotion s hrreet indicated the impartiality with which naval patronage had been distribute by the present first lord of the admiralty as to the civiliasion employed in the dockardsy they were chiefly artisfasit suesh as assonst carenters and so on and consequently their place could not have been filled by seamen he refreder to the testimony which sir c narron himself
