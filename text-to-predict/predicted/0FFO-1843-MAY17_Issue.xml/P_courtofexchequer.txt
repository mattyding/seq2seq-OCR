scantomash as landin waiter in i cant recollect to date of my appointment i was put in the irish costagnas and then went into the english coastguard in the year or i was appointed landin waiter ina london i knew homerasm well he was i landin waiter i met him at mr andys house in the upper part of this bine book for jally is my writing the heading i mean candy and co tis enabless tue to ay that it was in july i bad known mr candy some trom previously aud dined frequent ly with him my impression is that when i worte this i was dining at andys with hunt and ho embras candy was present part of the time this and several other bleaskiow were produced thin book was pro duced in the state in while it formerly was i am familiar with the use of the bluebook in the customs and i know it is not in the state in which it ought to be mr homsermap prodecnd thin bleekoon he having on that or the day before made the examination of two cases of mer chandies partically unknown for mr candy i think they had been examined that morning but em not sure the original heading was in the hand of one of the regiteturle i dont intipt have en rim colle there ere bestsclank bleasoon prodaced simili lir to this this leaf the first was selected from one of the blank books i cant say whether candy wes thereat moment but be was in and out of the groom he saw us taknif ouler will and desired aus to bave thoe beat port homeramed exected this leaf from the blank baok and at tempted to trace the original heading at the window on to it he was in liquor and could not succeed ho spoil the leaf and seleted another and masked me to trace it for him i did so and this is many writing sight charles candy and co d july two cake particularly unknown the entry gallegy is in homer shams hand according to the course of business that ought tobave been inhis hand as the examining offi cread the words i case p no and case no are also in his and ought to be so the orgitial leaf was then destroy the quant titise put down in the substitute sheet were considerably less than those destredied in the original i never knew what the original quantitise were hut i should think those substis tuted were not a fifth of what they ought to haveeent the leaf was then put into the hook and the seal put on it the seal was made by a friend for me at homsewrash request he brought me an impression of the real seal that wave some time before not for tis particular occasion mr hunt and homserman settled the aloumnt of the tares together the first leaf of this bluebook is genuins the second not it is the august book it was altered in the sate way as the other it was done in mr andys drawingroom the clers kee ding was not traced the first leat was left be cause it was not necessary the content of the first seet there are correct as far as i know the two next leave were substitute and the qualtative there recorded are defi cient and much leseam than those in the original leaf i cant say how much less but the sum of money paid for doing it leads me to say it was touch lessat least onefifth i wont swear to the excit entry i dont know how much lomermar got but it was a great deal hatd ul of noteshipat hunt gaue him i myself have got some money myself from candy between and it was considered a gials at various times and i had also some loans i gaue him an i u for hetmresscusly by sir t wildes had

whom there were now two charges of vercy peln leg the existence of snach charges was doubtless no ground for the abandonment of this information bust surely it wee highly indtancet end wyne in the

ever the factss relatis to the fraudulest alteration of these hosk as he ha given other there is yet a degree of mystery about them which is inexplicable there is moreover it deficiency in the rest of the cake which be it resensarble is not one between a and it bat one between the crowso andas subject who is accused of serious offecen against the law rofer is the attorney gestrat for the crown whosest whole duty ought to be the elucidation of she truth whose object ought to he justione alone hie ougha in the pursuit of that object to lay before the jury every uttill of evidence within his reach yet he astisn front provingrasmy fate relative to these hook which he an doubledy might prove where is the registrar to prove that they were returned every night ask it is proved they ought to have been i if they wersol retinued when were birty altered l if they had not been returned he rotation book would price it for each missing book is itcide fowerew is the book i theam factss are not cleared up though the doumenist and witness neceasary are even nowin court if the alteration was made before the books were returnly how was it that it was no discovered i all the leeres now say it is quite palablengaim yet no one seem to have su pected it when the bo s wred in use accorning to the o disrny course of the office the absence of proof oat this point is surprising and so are the princlers whirl the attorneygeneral aldia downt in his address to the jury it was then stated thalt the defendant had committed an ir rogalistal which would be called in aid to convict himan if to did not explain the charge agains him that irregularity turn cut to be one title in ancion with the practice of thu customs for alt their officess admittde that it was every days practice for merhaust to take goods out without paying ar once the atimes theresa this was proved and yet the at torenyenarty called it an irregularity for which he has the power of scatching a verdict and penaltive against the defendant if he doese netch anstrew fully another and different charge which is founded on air bubusfy testisstion the customs have themselves adoped this course of rirgaig larity and now they turn raid and seek to make as ins proper a use of it as has been stulded to by the atternonery is not that a flimsy veil wherewith to camicate the weakness of the real case i is not that gnich ans attempt to catch penaltive as was never before made against a merchantly sulch conduct was surprising nor was it lest o to hear the atternoneated say that the defendanct w bound to disprove his guilt was t here ever so gross a direliction of all the best princiless of britis law l and in such a case is to defendant to he called en to disprove guilt attached to him by ouch a miscreant as burmen i the attorneygeneral has both prosecuted and defended in his timen as all eosoiel of eminence have done i ask him to place himself in my situation and to act am he would then i ask him to refrain from such a course as that he have proproded and i call upon him to desist from secking for an answer to subsciois engendered solely by the oath of suct a mamac so burbusky it can ot however be denide that there has been gross and endensarcy neglect of duty and precaution by those to whom the affair of the castoms have been istiratyel it is admittde noa alt hands hut is that any reason why the character of men hitherto respected should be assagle by suchecharged as these i do the commissioners expect to yin dialtone thomsewves for their past negligence by a newhros zeal and activity while is display in digging up every mis creant who may trump up sisch charges and bringnif themi into court i bad they discharged their duty three years ago mn a proper and efficient manureus a degraid exhibition as this of today ouldoud have been averted here however the case it and it most he dealt with adcordingly whater th at setting aside for a moment the evidence of buy ere it is masked is the testimony by which the de fendant vission to be implicated there is nothing sub s to winch to fix by way of anewre the books are raid to hare been altered with the defensnditt connituance and for his benefit but where la the proof or even the sive dence of the time when that alteration took place i if the alteration had been made on the day of the searty thought the calm ih escape attention in the hurry of business how mamestigh that forged stamps were not deterted i it may be answered oh they were not examined in the hurry of business if so then i will ask why were they put on at all if they are not to be examined l what are they for if not to test the legality of the leave yet they escape detection in the orcide and what is more extraordinary still it appears that all the leave en which the case turnisi actually hear the singater of another officer who must have had the very page under his eye when he singed his name aud when the fraud was complete and yet he is not called to say how the book were when he saw them on that ocheosel this is most singular it may however he all true these books may have been altered ausd they may he irregular but whysh is the defendant to be called upon now at the lapse of three yearn t explain mand account for that alteration ansi that mirrugarity when the book hare beno always under the con trol and custody of the commissioner or their servants and these connecested with them at that time are net all called to give that account which they ought to he able to supply to the jurly it may ho that theo whole suctoushemp ia aa nest of thies but what haa the defendant to do with that setting aside always for the present mr bearuisur evidence i no allusion is now made to that wretch gasping for breati under the pressure of an old batile indictment for perjury whibe his been removed by the crown to gain tune no at lusion is made to him hut taking the case without him whyth aboitly the importer now be called upon to explain an papk rent rirligality in the cestomanion which weat noted tested by the clers in i it is very hard that he sheld be expected to do so and yet the atternoneated would rest his case upoin th e absence of such an explanation why mard knox a man of most irreproachable character the our veyor of landulagelt himself raw these books and tha cesses on the day after or the very day on which the false entry bears date lhe saw them together and took the tares so as to calculate the gross and net content of the caness and he approves of the entrise for his aiganlensly on to very pages which are charged with having been altered with sonble a case it is that the defendant is calded on t grappled in or der to eke it out the crown hab castle merchnst to grive their opinion as to the capacity of such casesman who dealing in english goods alone are not ceniveratt with french sillus and little willing perhape to faluri a merchant while deals sirgety astedcuslitery frence sillus surely there must be same honest foreignt

that wretch bury the cawe has signaly faillyeatiag mr candy withoul that man there is nothing at il to answer and as to him the defendant will cer tainly adduce evidence of a chastarce wholly conclusive and irreconcilable with his credibility it wil be remera barder that he sore to mr andys having been pre sent in july when the first bockvasw wheet now it will be proved that air candy was
