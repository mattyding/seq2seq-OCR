from yradis to ito but whats was the real state of the case i it was this that the dissianare did not exceed aine yards thus everything went an as if the whole purpose was to arcommashom the evidence to a procectioned set of antion amongst the gross error put forth by mr franks was that the people who worked in the miness wear not allowed time fr dinner while the evidence which thent lay before him showed that they his an hour for dinner one for breakfast and half occussically in the course of the day malarger heaps to whoss evidence frequent reference had beenin made distinctly deposed

noble lord brought in had been hurried through with indecent has e and now he would ask the house was it fitting to maintain a law which woold drive many of the por collires to destitu tion at a moment when they themselves were earnestly pro testing against the measure the noble lord maight say that the pettiois against the measure orginiegat with the owners of miness and not with the collires or that if the working men and women did sign them they were dargondore into doing so by the owners of mincess h ut then he would ask was there any one preparde to say that the minister leders andeadian men osflcuntan pereato beargoanted intismack ng any pettiois contrary to their settled conscientious feel nighst l hewsapsure thenouse would agree with him in think img that he had produced sufficient evidence to show that the whole of the complainst against ti measwer arose solely from the workingeptine themselves he declared distinctly that he bad never been in communication with alny coal owner on the sublect of the present proceeding he warm himself a coal owner but be could very sincerely assure the house that key had no interest in the resalt of the preatint proceeding for th miness in which he wan concerned were let at a field rent payable to him by a company so it mattered nothing whether they realised large or mall pro fist with respect to the operation of the bill itself he would lay confidently that its effect had been not only to throw women but men also out of employ mestin n ot long since he had been waited on by a depul tation of women indeed he had repeatedly received deptuta tnoin who set forth the stale of extreme distress to which they were reduced by the opemation of the bill to take from the poor the means of employment and susmeticate asmal to degrade them mutch mere than they could posslibly be low ered in the scale of existence by permiting the former elate of things to contisuse to him nothing appeard more oh viows and indisputable than this that the commissioner were men under the influence of very strong prejudice mand in fact the extrans from the reports would leave no doubt on the minds of any one that they had been betate into flagrant and palpable misrepresentation thook andaglate gentlemant then quoted largely from the report made by mir franks mr franks said in his re port s in the enumeration
