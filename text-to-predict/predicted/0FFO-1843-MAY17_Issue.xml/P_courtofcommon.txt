tbe proceeding in that eruct might happen to franish abont the middle of november lest a cinte cause on for hearing before the master of the rolle which was not noticed by air knox and the editor of the morsing advirier inquired the resson for its nonpapher ance and was informed that as the case was iccemplete he mr knox had astindane from sending any report the editor of the fastring advirterm paditat he should have been ensundeles on the subject while mr knox insisted that to discretion to insert or eusoned the insertion ef the report was vested in himelf tbe distett between to parties was

attention to the summons and wros dismised from tbe establishment mr knoupfook his distimass addressed a litter to give gentlemen connecested with the leading newspapser published in london stating the factss of the dispute and requestiny their opinosion which he afterwards printed and circulate very extensively one of the five individual addressed by her knox was the plintfis who is one of the parliamentary reporter of the forming rerould and is also connecested with the london jorg of commerce on the th of december the forning amtertived under the heading reporter of the press conied from the tieely disptach te following para graph we should not have alluded to a matter that has occupied and even at th x moment engage the natteroui of s several gentlemen connecested with the press but for a party intimately connecested with the affair having brought it before the world in a printed shape the document to which we allude savrwarded to its last week and is now lyning before us and we believe the loress and commons reporter and those connecested with the police and superior constr have also been furnished with a copy of it what are the factss i it appears that a shorthendiry connecested with the morniot advertiser withbeld the first days proceeding in a law case intending when the business treminated to supply a full and faithful report of it the reporter right we be leave to this mode of transtacity his employers bustiness was question by the editlor who urged that the early pro ceedings ought to have been sent to him that he might de terdline whether the publication should be deferred or not thereporete we understand question the right of deci sion to the editor sic and the consequence was the dis missal of the former by to latter thus showing his complete authority subsequently the reporter wore to several gens selemn connecested with the press including one on the tise and another on the armorning herald boh these individual sanction the practice of withhold an incomplete case and the patter te of opinion that no gentarman can benefcort as sociate himself with the morning advertiser the question now assuss this shaperer the reporter to ride roughshod over newspaper editor by determingty what matter ought o be inserted or what ought tobe motited we fancy if pro priteros of newspapser were to compel tbe latter to give way in a matter so imrortant to their interest the club wonld attempt further uusparotion and in a very short time the character of the j enrualy would be changed and destroy ed there must and there ought to be in every wellruse lated establishment an individual whose dot is final and any attempt to disturb so wolesome a regulation is faughtlu with danger as a matter of right and duty the editor of the iiforning advertiser has exercised a discretion that undoubtedly belongos to his and without which he would be mere cipher to this extract from the columnss of the distick the editor of the advertise appeended the fellengig commentary the last sentence ol which constitute the libel for which the action was brought these remarks of our cometorary induce us to revert to circumstance which had been dismissed frout our notice ai a matter of interest to the press we are now induled to state the factss refreder to as follow the reporter omitted all notice of the court confided to his charge and when ques tonied as to the cause first alleged that beshing got wet he was apprehensive of taknif cold if he came to the office and next that the court was all day occupied with one case only upon whice judgment baring been deferred he considered it unnecessary to give any report whatever of the court though neither of these excuss cont have been admittde a satisfactory yet to show more clearly the neglect of duty reference was made to the other morning papers in which two cases were reporter at soma length in one of which cases a previous order was discharged nith costs vida morning papers of saturday th november the reporter was then informed that the factss would be reporter to the propertion he ... notice to attend a committee of tbe propertion in reply to which he worte a most insulting letter to the editor who was thus left no alternative but to leave the reporter to his own discretion rather indiscretion sic or to recommend his dismissal the latter being consis dered the preferable proceeding was accordingly ordered by the committee of management such are the factss the lettsmer obtinabed from certain reporter on the timis herald c subsequently published bear their own commentary and as their witerrss are for the most part known to be sometiong worse than werthlless they are safe from say redress that could be exacted from them either in a court of law or a court of honaroin both of which they are already bank rumptr serenate talfourd in the course of his address to the jury submitite that there was nothing in the last paragraph of the publication which pointed to the present defendant who might have been one of those excepted from the charge brought against the majority of the lettrewredentry the aricle stated that the witerrss of the lettsmer were for the most part known to be something worse than worthless evidently that the writer did not seek to fasten the charge upon allers chief nastic intal summed up the evidence and tbe jury fundous verdict for the defenstantly remainder of the day was occupied with a case of graam and other assigement v daritherion was an issue under the interpleseral act to try whether certain goods lately the
