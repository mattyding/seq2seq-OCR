to considerable fortune the daughter of mr and mrs dunen gardner the parties lived together bult for a very short time a coldness almost immediately arose and they occupied different room and ia two or three week they lived in different house about a eartarredline inflamy t lady chartley withdrew from the residence in gloceteratly which she occupied with the knowledge of her husband and went to reside in lower greentorverde where her father and mother lived takiag weith her the furmatirn without her husbands privity end con sent and there was good evidence to show that these t two par tise never afterwards had any commulticable with each other on after this a suit was instituted in by lady chartory the purpose of disalving the marriage on the ground of impotency exhibition a libel to this effect by pott to this libel an answer was given is which lord carrily tought fit to deary the allegation but abfor the isse was tid it appaured that lady chartley formed an attacumet which entle in a criminal cenoncovil with a testomanl of the name of mertstes she was thou living with her father and sheter but it appeard that some objection was quane on their partt to the connidaon and lady chart lony and mr magretst went frees the house together and afterwards returned but they had previously gene to live together for the greater part of the year near finoble and she very sense after became pregnant lady chartley con tinued living with mard magretst there as man and wife and the parties to whom the house where they lodged belonged treated them as man and wife and it was only after

from that house in july air waretta accompanying the lady in a carriage and during the whole of the time they were living at finoble the lando lady of the house never saw lord chartley there it appeard that alr pisagratel and lady chartley subsequently went to the house of the lays father and there four covers were aldia on the dinentrablestic for lir and mrs duna gardner and two for air and mrs magretious lady chartley then went by the name of magretate a name which she prisond highly disregardy and despisiing that of her husbard she never allowed het self to be called by any other name than mrs magretst objection to be called lady leiceter or lady chantle observing that she did siot desirt be called by tht odious or disgsuist name the scruples therefore of mare and mrs dann garner to this connequenc were by this time cott over whether by the performance of a marriage ceremony or not their lorssthes were left to con jestore but this was proved by one witness an elderly sly that airs magretst said she wished to have the marriage ceremony performed ino england and their lorsish had therefore only to conrectute whether or not it had been per formed in any other place this lady performent the sem blance of the marriage ceremony end mir and bint magretst repeated the response in the month of july mirs digartite as she was calledie becale pregnant while living in her fathest

and shie shortly afterwards removed to no hunterestent and she continue to live in that street until r mengrtss death thus that mr magretia and this lady lived together for a number of years as man
