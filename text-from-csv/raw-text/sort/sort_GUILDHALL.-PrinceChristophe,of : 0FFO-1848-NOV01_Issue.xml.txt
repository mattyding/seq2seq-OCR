 - Prince Christophe, of Hayti, who a few months back was sentenced to two months' imprisonment as a rogue and vagabond from this court by the sitting alderman, was again placed at the bar, in conjunction with a companion named Seymour, on the charge of swindling another hotel-keeper
 It appeared that for some time past he has been going about London, hiring apartments at the various hotels, representing himself as Prince Christophe, of Hayti, and living (himself and family) in a sumptuous manner
 After having run up a long bill in a very short time the owners found they had been taken in, he not having a farthing to pay
 He was always in the habit of boasting of his banker and high character, and when accused of deception looked most indignant
 In the present instance he hired apartments at the George and Vulture, Cornhill, on Sunday afternoon, where he and his wife and family took up their quarters; and, as usual, they in a short time ran up a hill to the amount of 4l
 The landlord, Mr
 Whitmarsh, from information he received on Monday, thought proper to make a few inquiries, which resulted in his presenting his bill to the prisoner, who could not pay it, but referred to a banker to speak to his respectability
 That person, however, said he was a great blackguard, and would have nothing to do with him, in consequence of which the landlord gave him into custody
 He had taken him in without luggage or reference, because he said his luggage was coming
 After a few remarks, Sir P
 LAURIE said he should remand the prisoner until Thursday, for the purpose of giving an opportunity to others of coming forward and identifying the prisoner
