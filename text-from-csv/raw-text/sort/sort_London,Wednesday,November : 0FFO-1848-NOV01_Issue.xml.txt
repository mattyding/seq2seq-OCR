LONDON, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 1848
 It will be news to anybody in this kingdom to be told that he pays no taxes
 If there is one thing necessary to the idea of an Englishman - if there is one point of fellow feeling between all classes of the community, it is that, in some form or other, or rather in a thousand forms, and a thousand others besides, they all contribute to HER MAJESTY'S Exchequer
 SIDNEY SMITH ran through the career of an Englishman from the cradle to the grave, and found that the tax-gatherer had been everywhere before him
 If the bright oasis could be found in these isles safe from the intrusion of the universal scourge, all men would rush into it
 The only thing that makes us bear the evil is its universal and inevitable character
 There is a certain proportion appointed to us all
 The knave, who in the good old days of justice and decorum was whipped through the town at the cart's tail, tried in vain to procure a more comfortable distribution of his fifty lashes
 Whether the operator aimed high or low, or on this side or on that, it was impossible to please the fastidious gentleman
 We are inclined to think, too, that the broader the back the greater breadth of chastisement does it receive
 Notwithstanding what the poet says, we suspect that in the matter of taxes the giant suffers more than the beetle
 At least we never knew a wealthy man who did not talk ruefully of taxes
 It is, then, with extreme astonishment that we find in a tract, or rather a handbill, by the Financial Reform Association, the following passage: - "On a careful examination of the sources whence the public income is derived, the Association are astonished to find how completely the taxation is laid on the trade and industry of the country
 Contrasted with the amounts of the expenditure, it divides the community into two distinct classes, one, those who pay - the other, those who spend, the taxes
 The former comprises the great mass of the population, all who labour and produce the wealth of the nation; the other, the favoured few, who from accident of birth or connexions, are exempt from the necessity of toil; and who seem, on that account (for no other reason can be discovered in the examination of these documents but the fact that such is the exemption) to be relieved from the duty of contributing their fair and proportionate amount to the pecuniary requirements of the State
" If we could see the subject through the optics of the writer some of us might live and die under the pleasing illusion that we pay no taxes
 Unfortunately, however, experience would supply a painful contradiction
 But the writer, it seems, does not mean what he says
 Having put his best leg foremost in the shape of a bouncing assertion, he proceeds to explain that trade and industry pay all the indirect taxes, and property all the direct; which latter, he says, are only a trifle
 That there may be no mistake on this point, he enumerates all the items of taxation which he considers indirect, and assigns them to industry and trade, leaving a small remainder to be borne by property
 The result of this classification is that the man of property pays no customs, no probate and legacy duties, no duty on insurance, no duty on bank notes, no newspaper or advertisement duty, no duty on coaches, posting, hired carriages, or railroads, no postage, and not a farthing of the casual and supplemental expenditure which taxation brings on the country
 He not only does not contribute to these taxes personally and formally, but not even virtually or effectually
 He does not pay one single penny postage, or one farthing on his claret, his coffee, or his tea
 This blessed invulnerability to the shafts of taxation he owes to the simple fact of his possessing "property
" He is one of "the favoured few who from accident of "birth or connexions are exempt from the necessity "of toil
" Customs and Excise reach not this consecrated caste
 Like the deities of EPICURUS, they dwell in an atmosphere of their own, independent and careless
 To them the earth is free, and its fruits are cheap
 The East and West Indies vie for the honour of supplying their wants at cost price
 China pours her grateful products into their lap
 Ocean casts his wealth at their feet
 For them the ground yields her produce without a second curse
 But for a few trifling honoraria which the State ventures to ask in an easy and dignified form, it might be supposed they were some higher order of beings who vouchsafed to walk the earth and talk with men, and from whom we felt a pride in concealing the chief burdens of our condition
 Such men must be worth knowing
 We should like to see one
 Will the financial reformers of Liverpool introduce us to an individual of the species? Hitherto our own lot has been cast in so different a sphere that we have never yet seen or heard of such a being, nor even read of him, till this moment
 We know a gentleman of 10,000l
 a-year from land and collieries, not only free from incumbrances but pleasingly associated with the savings of a long minority
 Unfortunately he perspires at every pore with indirect taxation
 He drinks wine, spirits, ale, porter, tea, coffee, and sugar
 So do his servants
 So do the labourers on his farms, and so do the colliers in his pits
 He has just built a house and several farmhouses
 His bricks are taxed, and so is his timber
 He complains of his tradesmen's bills
 They answer that they are so heavily taxed that they cannot afford to charge him less
 He has furnished his house
 His paper, his carpet, his mahogany and rosewood tables and chairs, his new service of plate, have all contributed to the revenue
 Knowing the expense of building, he is careful to insure his house, and pays a cent
 duty on the insurance
 His joint-stock bank charges a 1/4 per cent
 on every farthing of his that passes through their hands
 He thinks it too high, and they plead the heavy duty on their notes, besides other expenses
 His lawyer's bill contains heavy items for stamps
 He takes in a London paper and half-a-dozen country ones
 On every one he sees the red imprint of the exciseman
 He advertises his farms, his pits, and his coals, and pays eighteen-pence to the Crown for every advertisement
 He goes about a good deal on the rail, and often tells the station-clerks how much lower fares are on the Continent
 The station-clerks answer with an allusion to taxes
 He comes up to London and falls out with the cabmen
 They give the same answer
 He makes every tradesman give him a receipt
 They take it out in one shape or another
 He writes and receives many letters, some of them with heavy enclosures; his wife has a hundred correspondents, and thinks the penny post a convenient thing for small parcels; in fact a pound's worth of stamps goes in no time
 Besides all this he pays on French clocks, bronzes, and furniture, on foreign velvets and silks, on writing paper, and innumerable etceteras
 But wherever he goes he finds the social atmosphere thick with taxation
 His men strike, his tenants fall into arrears, his customers get into the Gazette, his tradesmen are extortionate, his wife expensive - all on the plea of taxation
 There is nothing to be done without paying in this country
