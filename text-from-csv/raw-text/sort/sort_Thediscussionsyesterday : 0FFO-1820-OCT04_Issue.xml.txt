The discussions yesterday in the House of Lords began with some explanations and letters on the affair of the Marjettis at Milan, and the threat denounced, or said to be denounced, by that Colonel Browne, against the younger of those bankers resident in London, if he meddled in the Queen's affair. So far as Lord Liverpool's explanation went, which was of an ex parte nature, it might appear satisfactory; but we are enabled this day to supply an hiatus in the correspondence, which entirely alters the complexion of the business, puts Browne's conduct in a more striking point of view, and shows more strongly than can be conceived the terror created abroad by that anti-social Act, the Alien Bill. We would now point general attention to the whole of this correspondence. The facts are undeniably before the public, and the chief of them are these - that Browne actually obliged the father to explain away the threat that had been denounced against the son by Browne. This the father (a most respectable man, as Lord Liverpool stated him to be) did. But we now lay before the nation, which has almost ceased to be astonished at any new iniquity in this most iniquitous affair, a subsequent letter written by the father, and explaining the new terror or threat under which he was obliged to disavow the application of the old one!! Browne, we suppose, must now be given up.
