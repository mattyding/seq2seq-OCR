COURT OF KING'S BENCH, GUILDHALL, TUESDAY, OCT
 THE KING V
 This was an indictment for perjury
 The name of the defendant has already in so many shapes appeared before the public, that a very brief sketch of the circumstances will suffice to recall the case to the recollection of our readers
 At the Summer Assizes for the county of Dorset, in the year 1817, James Bowditch and others were tried for forcibly carrying off from her uncle, Mr
 Tuckett, Maria Glenn, a young lady of some fortune, and of extremely tender age
 The defence set up was, that the lady voluntarily eloped, and an infinite number of circumstances were sworn to which tended to show a previous familiar intercourse between the parties
 The defendants were, however, principally upon the evidence of Miss Glenn herself, found guilty
 In the ensuing term application for a new trial was made to the Court of King's Bench; and, upon the affidavits of William Turl, Ann Sutton, Frances Sutton, Elizabeth Sutton, and other persons, swearing to their positive knowledge of such acts of familiarity on the part of Miss Glenn towards James Bowditch as negatived all probability of a forcible abduction, a rule to show cause was granted
 On the argument for making the rule absolute, Miss Glenn, by her affidavits, absolutely denied the statements contained in the affidavits against her; and the rule being in consequence discharged, the defendants were brought up for judgement, and sentenced to different terms of imprisonment
 Upon the affidavits made by Miss Glenn against the rule for a new trial the present indictment was founded; and perjury was assigned upon upwards of forty statements
 The assignments, however, upon which the case turned were three in number
 First, upon Miss Glenn's statement - that she did not stand as godmother at the christening of Mrs
 Mulraine's child; nor wore upon that occasion a spencer and bonnet belonging to Susannah Bowditch, the sister of James Bowditch; secondly, that she did not dance at a certain festival on the same evening at the house of Mrs
 Joan Bowditch; and that she was not upon that occasion kissed as one of the godmothers; thirdly, that she never walked in the streets of Taunton, nor in a certain place called the French Weir-field, with James Bowditch
 Scarlett, having very temperately stated the case, proceeded to call his witnesses; their evidence, however, was little else than a repetition of that which they had given on the preceding day, in the case of Miss Glenn's servant, Mary Whitby
 Mary Priest swore to the presence of Miss Glenn at the christening of Mrs
 Mulraine's child; to her standing godmother; and to her being dressed in the bonnet and spencer of Susannah Bowditch
 William Turl, a music-master, swore to Miss Glenn's having danced at the christening festival, in the house of Mrs
 Bowditch; to her having played upon the harp, accompanied by him (witness) upon the pianoforte; and to her having been kissed by him and by Wm
 Bowditch, as one of the godmothers of the child
 Ann Turl, the wife of the last witness, corroborated the evidence of her husband; and swore to a declaration on the part of Miss Glenn, that she had stood godmother to the child
 Charles Puddy, a farmer, was present at the festival; saw Miss Glenn dance, and saw her kissed
 Frances Sutton corroborated the evidence of Ann Turl
 Sarah Bowditch swore that Miss Glenn went to the christening in the bonnet and spencer of her sister, Susannah Bowditch; and to her dancing and being kissed in the evening
