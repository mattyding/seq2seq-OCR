PARLIAMENTARY INTELLIGENCEHOUSE OF LORDS, TUESDAY, OCT
This day tbe house re-assembled, pursuant to adjournment
 The peers began to take their places soon after nine o'clock, and at about seven minutes before ten the Lord-Chancellor entered, and seated himself on the woolsack
Prayers were then read, and the house called over
 Apologies were made for the non-attendance of several peers, in consequence of intdisposition, or other causes
 Among those absent were Lord Sheffield, the Bishop of Bangor, the Earl of Chichester, and the Duke of Newcastle
 Lords Gambier, Harewood, and  Hillsborough, did not answer, on the call
The Earl of LIVERPOOL, before their lordships proceeded to thc business of thc day, wished to say a few words on a transaction which had been madc the subject of conversation previouisly to the adjournment
 He alluded to what had passed respecting a letter written by M
 Marietti, of Milan, to his son in this country, with reference to the alien bill
 In consequence of what was stated in that letter, he had felt it to be his duty to write to Colonel Browne for an explanation of his conduct
 Having received his answer, he would, with their lordships' permission, lay on the table the corre-spondence which had passed on the subject,and he was persuaded that the explanation would be found perfectly satisfactory
 [A peer expressed a wish to hear the correspondence read] He had no objection to state the contents of the papers
 [ Here the noble earl read several extracts, which were not distinctly heard throguhout
j The first,as we understood it, was a letter from Colonel Browne, in which he referrel to a conversation he had had with a clerk of M
Marietti : He had written a letter to M
Marietti,a copy of which (No
 1)  he enclosed with the original answer (No
 He trusted that, when these-papers were examined, he would be found fully acquitted of the charge which had been made against him
 It had:been his wish to fulfil the instructions he had received but he 'hoped he should never act inconsistent with justice
 [For these letters, see another part of our paper
]The Earl of LlVERPOOL, having laid theletters on the table; had not the slightest objection to their being printed, if such should ae the pleasure of the house
 If any further doubt shouldl be entertained on this subject by any of their lordships, it would still be  open to inquiry
 It was Colonel Browne's wish that it should be probed to the bottom, and he was therefore most desirous that the fullest explanaton should be given
Lord Holland thought it necessary to observe, that thouighi its hould be perfectly true that the alien bill had never been mentioned by name to M
 Marrietti,' that fact would be no answer to the general objections which existed to the alien bill on- account of its nature, and of thc effect it might have on this inquiry
 On the contrary, what had passed served to confirm the apprehensions entertained of of its affect, for the correspondence showed that that bill was looked to with alarm
 Hie must also declare that the statement wvhich the noble earl had rnade was not conviincing
to hi inindm; nor coul(i any cx-partc xtatement be convincing to their lordships
 of Colonel Brewne lie knew nothing; but the noblelord had concluded withl expressing kis wilingniess to afford further exiplanations from that gentlemaLn, ii aby toubi shoutd renmain
 For hMs owh vnart he inust say, that'in bis mtind no satisfactory explanation could be given ithhout a full investigation of all that had passed bv the ex- amination o
 Laying the papers on the table ivas not suf- ficient for this purpose
 The alien act,'it was said, had not been mentioned but their iordships must be aware that it was very possiblc to convey to men's minids thc apprehension of ttle pe- nalty of that act without naiming it, and it could hot escapc their abservation thiat it was atdmitted thete thd l bedn zi donVersation be- tween a clerk and Colonel Browne relative to Al
Ilatietti
 If, therefore, it was wished that tbe suspicion should be effectually done tway, there inust be a farther investigation
 lie would, therefore, reserve to himself the right of again calling their lordships' attention to this subject wvhen theprinted papers should beon the table
The Earl of LIVERPOOL said a word or two which we did not hear
The tlarl of LAUDERDALE suggested, tbat,
bedoreany #fdthel piroceeding could with propriety take placc, it would be necessary (o ret the letter which i
 Alarietti had written to his sn
 That letter, he supposed, could be easXiily obtaine^d; and it appeared to hinm indis- pensable, if a foundation was to be laid for tuture investigation
 Thils first step, he thought, wvouhl be but Justice to Colonel Browne, as *vell as to the tDarties in the present cAse

 'In this situatioin, with alUthe time which their lordshipa harlafforded him for r
llection, it wasrdificult for hin to compose his mind to the proper discharge of his professional dut; for he was stil weighed down with tbe sense of the,
heavyyresponsib lity of the task he had undertaken
 [le must also obuerve, that it was nolighit adiipn to the anx
iety of tbis feeling to foresee that, before thce'procecdings closed, it might be hiis unex- ampled lot to act in a wiy'which miglt appeir inconsistent with the dluty of a good sobject-to state what mlght makcc some call in qur - tion his loyalty, thouglh that was-not what heanticipited from-their lordsblps
 He would now zernind their lordships th
t his illustrious client, thein Carolineof Branswick, arrived in ts country in the year 1795; she was the niece of the Sovereij,;, and the intended consort ot the heir-;ipparent, and was berself not far'emoved from the succession to the ,own, Bat he now went back to that period solely for the ojirpose bf passing over all that had elapsed from her arrival until her departure in 18144; and he rejoiced that the most faithful dis- charge of his duty permittel him to take this course
 LBat he could not do this without paiusingforamtbment to vindicate liimself against an imputation to which he might not unnaturally be exposed in con- sequence of
the course which lie pursued, and to assure their lord- ship
s that the cause of the QCueen, as it appearCd in cvidence, did not require recrimination at present
 The evidence against herBlajesty, he felt, did not now call pt)on him to utter one whisper against the conduct of her illustrious consort, and he soleninly assured their lordships that but for that conviction his lips would not at that tine he closed
icretionary exercise of' hii duty, in postponing the case whicb lie possessed, their lordships must know that he was waving a riglht which belonged to hirp, and abstaining from the use of m'arerials wvlinch were Qoqurtestionably his own
 If, however, he, should hereafter thitk it advisable to exercise this right-_iflie slhould think it necessary-to avail hjinself of mieann which he at present de- clined using-let it not be vainly supposed that he,or even the young- cstlemiberftithe'B0ofes4iot,wo 1
hesitttefito retorttosych -a toWtrse, and fearlessly peroru his dutg
' le had before stated io theIr- lord- ships-but surcly of that it waa sear&el-y - liecessary to remmid thlem -that an advocate, in tbe discharge of his duty, knows but one per- soin in all the world, and that person is
 To save that client by all means 'and epcdieit, 'anid at all hazafds anrdcosts to other persons, and, aniong theim, to himse)f, is his first and onl) duty; and in performing this duty-he must not regard the alarm, the torments, the destruction which he may bring upon
 Separating the duty of a patriot from that of an advocate, he must go on reckless of consequences, thoughi it should be his unhappy fate to involve ,iscounitryin confusion
 Hfe felt, however, that, were he now to enter on the branch of his cise to which he had alludeAl, he should seem to quit thc highier grounid of innocenice on which he wvas proud to stand
 He ivould seem to seek to justify, not to resist thc charges, and plead not guilty- to acknowledge and extentare of- fences,
 levities, and indiscreons, thie verv least of which hIe came therc to deny
 For it was foul and fial5e tO say 35 se,me nt those wYho, under pretence e,f their *Itnty to Godt, forgot their duty to their fellow-creatures, had dared to sav, and they knew it to be false and foul when they asserted itthat any inmpro
 ptoprieties were adinitted to havebeen proved againsb the Queen
 He denied that any indiscretions were admitted
 He contended not only that the evidence did not prove them, but that it disproved them
 One admission he did malkc; and let thelearned counsel who supported the bill talie it, andl make the most thev could of it, for it was the only admission that would be made to ihem
 He granted that ler Majesty had left this country for Italy ; he grantewl that while abroad -,he had mnoved in snciety chiefly foreign, in- terior probably to that wthich, under happier circumnstances, she had ktnown-and very diihrent, certainly, from that whicil she had pre- viously ecijoyed In this country
 Iie admitted, that when the Qaeen was here, and happy, not, indleed, in the protection of her own fi- muilg', but in the frierls:ip of their lordships and their families, that she moved in more choice and dignified societv than any in which she hassince Sad the goot forttine to be placed
 I'lie charge against her was-that she went to Italy, aid that, instead of associ- ating with the peeTs and peeresses of England, she took to her ssciety only foreigners
 He fullv ad(nitted that her Majesty had been under the necessity of associatimg with Italian nobility, and sometimes with the comrrsonalty of that country
 But *ho are they that bring this cluarFe ? Othiers might blame her Majesty fox going abroad-others might saylthat she lhad experienced the conse- quences of leaving this country and associating with foreigners; but it was not for their lordships to make this ciarge
 They were the very last persons 'who should fling this at the Queen; for they who nowv presumed to sit as her judges were the very witnesses she must call to acquit lher of this charge
 They were, in fact, rot only the wib,essss to acquit-but haid been the cause of this single ad-rtmtted tact
 herMlajesty resided in this country she courteously threw opcn
 her doors to the peers of England and their families
 She graciously condescended to court their society, and, as long as it suitel certain purposes which were not hers-as long as it served interests in which she hadl no concern-as long as she could be made subservient to the ambitious views of others- stc (lid not court its vain
 But when a change took place-when those interests were to be retained wlihl she had been -made the in- strument of grasping-when that lust of power and place to which she was doomed to fall a victim lhad been sattisfied-then in vain did shc open her doors to their lorlships an(d their families ; then it was that those whom she hal hitherto condescended to court- and it- was no humiliation to -court the first society in the WOrTld- abaingoned her
 l'tr Mtajesty vas then reduced to the alternative of begwiig society in this
 country as a favour, or of leaving it
 Slhe coui'd not, by humblinig herself, have obtained the society of British peeresses, ar
d muhst have sought that of other classes, or gone abroad
 Sucb,then,beingr the CiretmstanlceS, it was not in the presence of their lordships that he expected to hear the Queen reproached for going nbroad, It was not here that he had thought any one would have dared to lift up his voice, and make it a topic of censure that the Princess of Wales had associated viith foreigners-with some whom,perhaps, she might say she would ndti and ought not have chosen un- der other and happier circumstanCes
 tVp to this period her Ma- jesty had still one pleasure left
 She enjoyed1 not indeed the so- ciety, but the affection and grateful respect of her beloved (laughter
 An event, of all things most gratefil to a mother's feelings,soon atler took place -thc marriage of her beloved daughter
 Ofthis event her MIajesty received no announcemnent
 Though all England was lookirng Wwards the approaching event with the deep in- terest it was so well calculated to excite-thouIh all3 urope-was look- ing at it with the liveliest feelings, ind with all the knowledge of the intereAstiig event wvhich was about to takle place-still there was one person, and one only, lcft in ignorance of the whole proceeding, and that solitary indiridu,al was the mother of the bride
 All that she had done up to that timd to deservn
,his treatment was, that she had been charged, and afterwards acquittcd,
 of an alleged crime, and her perjured persecutors rendered infamous; and this treat
 ment she received trom his Mlajesty's servants, some of whom had risen in power by having maade her a tool to promote their own interests; The Queen heard of the event of the approaching mar
 riage of her only child accidentally; she heard it from a courier,who was going fiom itis country charged with a notification of it to his Holiness the Pope-zthat anclent, intimate, and much-valued ally of the Protestant Crown of England
 The marfiage of her daughter took place; It xctited the sensations which it was so well calculated to produce, as tlle Promi,sed source of so nmuch hlappiness to the Royal Family and the nationi
 The whole of that periodl passed withloult the slightest commlunication being made to the Qneen
