LONDON, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 4, 1820. The Paris journals overflow with rejoicings on the birth of the young Prince. There is, indeed, nothing to be found in the Moniteur but a list of declarations by the Duc d' Albufera, and sixteen other individuals, authenticating the fact and circumstances of the accouchement, together with the sex of the child, who has been called Henry Charles Ferdinand Marie, Dieu Donne d'Artois, Duc de Bordeaux. In this long succession of names, that of Louis, it is observable, has been omitted.
