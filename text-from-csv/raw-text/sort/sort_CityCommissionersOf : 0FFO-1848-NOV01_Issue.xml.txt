 Yesterday the Commissioners assembled in Guildhall, Deputy Peacock in the chair
 A report was made on the subject of the construction of several new sewers, and contracts were formally entered into for making 30 new sewers in various confined parts of the city
 It was stated by the surveyor that in almost every case in which a sewer was required to be constructed, the inhabitants had expressed their determination to have their houses drained into it
 Some complaints were made from the neighbourhood of Aldergate-street of a nuisance arising from gas refuse, and directions were given to the inspectors, whose exertions are stated to be now very great, to report upon the case
 SANITARY STATE OF THE CITY
 A list of deaths within the city of London for the week ending Saturday, October 28, from the Registration-office, was given in
 It contained 53 instances of mortality, but not one case of cholera
 The CHAIRMAN, in congratulating the committee upon the incessant efforts made for the preservation of the health of their fellow citizens, took occasion to state that there had occured no instance in his memory in which the sanitary state of the city of London was more complete than it was acknowledged to be at the present moment
 SIMON, the Officer of Health to the city of London, transmitted to the commissioners a paper containing general suggestions on preliminary arrangements in the sanitary affairs of the city; which was read by the clerk
 The document stated that the first care of the medical officer must be to ensure as early and accurate information as possible of every considerable alteration in the health of the city, and it would be impossible for him to ascertain at any one moment how many in so vast a population were sick or dying, or how many had died within a week, without deriving from others the details of his information
 As respected the physical conditions which attended individual cases of disease, it was evident that he could at the time acquire no personal knowledge as an eye-witness, for all such cases of illness were, it might be presumed, under proper medical treatment, and he could not, for obvious reasons, seek admission into houses already placed under the charge of authorised medical practitioners
 As so large an amount of information would be indispensably necessary for his office, and as it would be impossible for him to collect the small details as well as generalize the large results, he had endeavoured to organize a scheme of correspondence calculated to enable him to receive all the details he alluded to through various channels of communication; and he thought his proposition would be the more likely to receive the sanction of the commissioners, as it did not call any new machinery into existence, but confined itself to the application of resources which were already actively employed
 The Officer of Health then recommended to the commissioners that they should invite the assistance of the various medical officers employed under the Poor Law for the several city unions, which officers must naturally be well informed of the sanitary condition of the districts, and be peculiarly familiar with those localities which, although seldom visited by other practitioners, were of much interest to the sanitary legislator on account of their tendency to breed and to retain various forms of epidemic disease
 He recommended, in case the commissioners approved of his views, that each of the 10 district surgeons should be directed to furnish a weekly report of the state of his neighbourhood, a matter which he considered to be of firstrate importance
 He had already been able to make arrangements for obtaining the earliest knowledge of the deaths within the city, which would be a valuable addition to the parochial returns in many respects
 It would also be desirable to procure accurate returns of sickness and mortality from the workhouses and prisons of the city
 With such information as he had alluded to before him he should make general reports from time to time to the commissioners on variations in the health of the city, especially as regarded epidemic and other predominant disorders, and direct their attention to measures of local improvement
 The communication concluded with stating that as in a great variety of cases the district reports would render personal inspection of the locality necessary it would be expedient that every inquiry should be conducted in company with the surveyor of the commissioners
 After some conversation upon various points in the communication by the medical officer, whose views were met with very general approval, the paper was submitted to a sub-committee
