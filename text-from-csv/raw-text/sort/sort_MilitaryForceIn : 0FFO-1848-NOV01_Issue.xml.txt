 - The augmentation of the constabulary from 22,000 to 30,000 rank and file will enable the Government to withdraw ten regiments from Ireland for colonial and other service, and to concentrate at head-quarters these many detachments now frequently employed upon duty which is the legitimate province of a police force
 It is also intended to attach to the head-quarters of the constabulary in each province a flying park of artillery for field service
 THE "PARSONAGE
" - A translation from the original work of Rodolph Topffer, under this title, by a lady, has just been published, and forms the 19th and 20th volumes of the Parlour Library, a monthly serial publication, which for smallness of price and judgment in selection is amongst the best of its class in these times of cheap literature
 The original is tolerably well known to readers of such productions even in this country, and though not partaking of the features by which English novels are characterized, it contains a good deal that will please English readers, without, however, ever becoming very popular
 The great fault of the book is that it wants compression; it is too long, and though not absolutely tedious, it creates indifference, and, consequently, the reader either gives up the task of perusal altogether, or skips a vast many pages, in which it may be that the best passages are contained
 The book being a series of letters, and not a continuous narrative, is not in accordance with the taste of novel readers
 The moral is good, and the events are interesting without being exaggerated or too highly romantic
 The lady has executed her task as a translator in a most creditable manner, and is entitled to great praise
 Her style is easy and purely English, and by the translation she has produced she has enabled the English reader to become acquainted with an author from whose work much profit may be derived and much pleasure afforded
