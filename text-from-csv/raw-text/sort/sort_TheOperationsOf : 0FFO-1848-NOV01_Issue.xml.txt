THE OPERATIONS OF THE BANK OF FRANCE
 (From the Journal des Debats
) When we read the long report of the Bank of France, published in Saturday's Moniteur, we cannot help asking ourselves when this long movement of decline which the revolution of Frebruary has impressed on the commercial and financial condition of our country will stop
 We have new to register a further decline of 3,340,000f
 in the portfolio of the Bank or the branches
 it has fallen to 67,873,684f
, and in the branches from 111,390,609f
 Last week the decline was 6,600,000f
, and the week before 3,500,000f
 It hence follows that there is a deficiency of 13,000,000f
 in the mass of the bills (effets) discounted during the last three weeks
 The amount of specie has not varied in Paris, and in the branches exhibits a slight increase
 The total amount of this metallic reserve is 229,735,402f
 The amount of the bills in arrear is between 384,123f
, and that of the bills en souffrance, both in Paris and the branches, exhibits a decrease of about 200,000f
, and remains at 23,239,000f
 The circulation of the Bank has increased by 3,000,000f
, and amounts to 392,605,275f
, including the circulation of the branches
 It will be seen that it every day approaches the limit assigned by the Provisional Government by the decree which gave its notes a forced circulation
 The "account-current" of the Treasury has fallen to 10,301,203f
 This amounts to a decrease, in one week, of more than 6,000,000f
, which is, besides, explained by the operations respecting the arrears of the Rentes
 The accounts-current of private individuals have experienced an increase of 1,350,000f
, and amount to 101,310,000f
, including those of the branches, which amount to nearly 25,000,000f
 If it be wished to ascertain the situation of the Bank in the event of its thinking proper to resume the payment of its notes in specie in accordance with the advice given by the Minister of Finance at a recent sitting of our National Assembly, the calculation may easily be made
 The amount of its circulation is 392,000,000f
 Let us add thereto the amount of the deposits, in that we may have the entire amount of its positive liabilities, and we shall have a sum of 504,000,000f
 The metallic reserve amounts to 230,000,000f
 - equivalent to 40 per cent of the debts for which it is liable
 It is seldom that the banks possess in their coffers a metallic capital proportionably so abundant, nor is it always - far from it - a sign of prosperity
 It is only right to add, that the Bank has granted, for the advantage of the State, a loan of 150,000,000f
, of which only 25,000,000f
 It is therefore exposed to a more or less immediate demand of 125,000,000f
 must be added for the complement of the loan of 10,000,000f
 advanced to the city of Paris
 It will be seen that the liabilities of the Bank may hereby be increased to the extent of 131,500,000f
; they would, in that case, amount to 635,000,000f
 Supposing the metallic reserve should remain in statu quo, it would amount to about 30 per cent
 It is not uninteresting to glance at the corresponding state of the Bank of England
 The last account published in London (on Sunday last) furnishes us with the following results: - The amount of the notes issued by the Issue Department is 26,823,635l
