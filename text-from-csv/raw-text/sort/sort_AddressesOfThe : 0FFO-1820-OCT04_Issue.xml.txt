ADDRESSES OF THE LIGHTERMEN AND WATERMEN, AND OF THE PARISH OF ST
 It having been announced, that at 10 o'clock yesterday morning, the Addresses to be presented to her Majesty, from the Lightermen and Watermen, and from the Churchwardens, Overseers, and others, Inhabitants of St
 Saviour, Southwark, were appointed to be carried up to the Queen, immense numbers of persons assembled at a very early hour, at the Southwark bridge-stairs
 The number of the boats, which it was absolutely impossible to estimate; their general appearance and decorations, more especially the assemblage of beautiful females who were in waiting to celebrate and to enliven by their presence the affectionate homage of such large and respectable classes of the community; the unusual fineness of the weather at this period of the year, and the enthusiastical expression of public feeling which was exultingly manifested upon every side, all combined to render the scene at once vast, joyous, and magnificent
 The great object of general attention were the steam yachts, and one of the City barges (we believe the Fishmongers) which conveyed the members of the two deputations
 These were extremely crowded, and well furnished with bands of music
 At about a quarter past 10 o'clock the signal-gun was fired, and these yachts getting under weigh, many individuals who possessed tickets were necessarily left behind, owing to the extraordinary denseness of the crowd which lined the quays and stairs upon either side of the river
 On no occasion whatever - not even upon that melancholy one of the funeral of the immortal Nelson - was such a prodigious concourse ever witnessed upon the Thames
 Age and manhood - youth and infancy - the feeble and the strong; every description, every class of society, were collected in one immense mass, occupying the whole of the banks of the river, from Southwark and the opposite shore, to Brandenburgh-house
 If the multitude was of a motley description, the same character was eminently applicable to the prodigious fleet of boats of every possible denomination, which, by its magnitude and diversity, gave life, spirit, and beauty to the moving picture which was presented to the eye
 The barge which contained the deputation charged with the Address of the Watermen and Lightermen was distinguished by the large and glowing ensign that she bore, the sailor-like and orderly appearance of her crew, and the respectability of her passengers
 The several steam-yachts, on board of which were the deputations from St
 Saviour's, were entirely filled with gentlemen, the most opulent and of the highest consideration in that populous and wealthy parish, which contains nearly 19,000 inhabitants
 The bridges presented an aspect truly singular; it was absolutely difficult to discern the smallest appearance of parapet on any of them, so entirely were they occupied by innumerable spectators, who testified their sympathy and enthusiasm by reiterated shouts, which were re-echoed from the boats and from the neighbouring shores, scarcely less thronged than they
 Wherever a vacant space presented "standing room," as it is well termed, it may safely be said such vacant spaces, whether causeways, public quays, or private property, were entirely occupied by groups of well-dressed persons, from Southwark to Vauxhall bridge
 Meanwhile, the immense collection of boats and pinnaces of every size and every denomination - their crews and companies animated by one steadfast purpose and one general feeling - to all appearance as unalloyed and unmixed in their nature as they were universal in their influence - pursued their course to Hammersmith
 The spectacle was splendid and imposing, beyond anything of which mere description can convey an idea
 It was an assemblage continually increasing, every creek and landing-place sent out fresh numbers to swell the augmenting procession
 If any thing could add to the picturesque activity and variety which were manifested on the river, it was the beautiful display we observed upon Wandsworth-common, Battersea, and Putney bridges, and other places, where pedestrians and equestrians were mingled together in friendly and not unpleasing disorder
 But the concluding scene was also the most beautiful: the lawn before, and the grounds in the vicinity of Brandenburgh-house, were thronged beyond expression: all that the inconvenience of heat and pressure could inflict upon those who were stationed there, were evidently more than compensated by the full enjoyment of those feelings unde which they had ventured to undergo that inconvenience
 The place was only accessible over what might be termed a bridge of boats; such was the closeness and density of the position in which they were accidentally placed
 It was not without severe exertion and struggle, and after the lapse of a considerable time, that the deputation with the Southwark address could approach near to her Majesty's residence
 Her Majesty showed herself several times in the balcony of the principal window, and was hailed with the warmest and most enthusiastic greetings
 The deputation being at length admitted, her Majesty, preceded by Mr
 Alderman Wood, accompanied by Lady A
 Hamilton, and followed by Sir W
 Hownam, Mr
P
, and others, entered the chamber in which she is accustomed to receive addresses
 She was magnificently attired in a robe of muslin, richly embroidered with silver: upon her head she wore a superb diamond aigrette; and displayed about her person several valuable jewels
 The mover of the addresses and the seconder, followed by the gentlemen of the deputation, were then directed to approach, and the former read the following address in a distinct and impressive manner: - "To Her Most Gracious Majesty, Caroline Amelia Elizabeth, Consort of His Majesty King George the Fourth
 "May it please your Majesty, "We, the Churchwardens, Overseers, and others, dutiful and loyal inhabitants of the parish of St
 Saviour, in the Borough of Southwark, most humbly beg leave to approach your Majesty with our loyal congratulations on your Majesty's accession to the throne of these kingdoms, as Queen Consort of George the Fourth
 Happy, indeed, should we be, if these our hearty congratulations were unalloyed with almost overwhelming sympathy for the manifold afflictions it has pleased the Almighty to pour upon your illustrious family by the demise of his late most gracious Majesty King George III
, always your Majesty's firmest stay and protection; ghter, the Princess Charlotte of Wales, (than whom this nation never had a more promising or a brighter hope); and of his Royal Highness the Duke of Kent
 Saviour has always been unwilling to interfere in the affairs of state; yet, Madam, not to lay at your Majesty's feet an expression of our abhorrence and detestation of the vile persecutions your Majesty has suffered, almost from the moment of your landing in this country, (under a well-founded hope of a reception, and of a lasting treatment, truly noble and British,) would be a stain upon our loyal and dutiful attachment
 We therefore beg to assure your Majesty that there is not, in any portion of his Majesty's subjects, a people more sincerely disgusted with the vile slanders sent forth against your Majesty's character and honour, nor more inimical to the proceedings now pending in parliament to deprive your Majesty of your legal rights and privileges
 We can never too much deplore the seizure of the first moment of his late Majesty's demise to erase your Majesty's name from the formula of our holy religion: thereby holding you up to the world as unworthy to receive the prayers of a pious people, notwithstanding that it is alleged the conduct which your Majesty is so basely charged with was known for a year preceding
 Neither can we too much admire your firmness and wisdom in refusing the bribe so shamefully offered to you at St
 Omer's, whereby your Majesty was insidiously invited to follow an alleged impious life; or your courage in treating with contempt the accompanying threat of bringing your Majesty to trial, if you did not remain abroad; thus giving to your admiring people a presumptive proof of your innocence, and by that very step proving that your Majesty is entitled to the attachment and loyalty of your affectionate people
 The Bill of Pains and Penalties we deprecate on your Majesty's account particularly, as not being the legal mode whereby the charges alleged against your Majesty should be investigated; but we deprecate it also as a dangerous precedent, whereby a base ministry, assisted by a corrupt parliament, may at any future period depose a sovereign upon alleged charges of licentiousness and immorality, if they should have the means of hiring spies and of paying informers and foreign witnesses to swear to evidence that may appear to support such charges
 But, Madam, it is with pride we congratulate your Majesty, that in your cause a British people are uncontaminated with the odium of forming any part of the criminatory witnesses against your Majesty
 We feel great gratification that the foreign evidence produced against your Majesty has been of a description to defeat itself; and we trust that your Majesty has yet many happy years in store, to compensate you for the severe trials you have undergone; and we beg to assure your Majesty that the parish of St
 Saviour, Southwark, will at all times be ready to contribute by every means in its power to show its duty, loyalty, and affectionate attachment
" This address was signed by more than 800 inhahitant householders, and her Majesty made to it the following most gracious reply, which was read by Mr
 Alderman Wood: - "I feel peculiar satisfaction in receiving this loyal and affectionate address from the Churchwardens, Overseers, and other Inhabitants of the Parish of St
 Saviour, in the Borough of Southwark
 "Though I have no regard for any interest that is separated from the public welfare, and consequently disdain all connexion with any faction, yet it has been said that faction has marked me for its own
 It might have been affirmed with much more truth, that persecution has marked me for its own
 Persecution has harassed me with every species of malevolent vexation and of inquialtorial torture for near a quarter of a century
 If my honour and my life have been preserved amidst so many perils as those to which I have been exposed from spies, traitors, and perfidious emissaries of every description, the cause must be ascribed, not to the defect of vigilance, or to any relaxion of effort in my enemies, but to the inherent strength of integrity, and to the invisible protection of the Almighty
 His gracious Providence has perpetually attended me in all my wanderings, has watched over my pillow in all my sorrows and care, and been my constant shield in all my perils and adversities
 "It will never be forgotten, that on the very day on which the remains of his late revered Majesty, my guardian and my friend, were committed to the slient tomb, perjury, in the hideous form of a discarded servant, passed those precincts where the sceptre of righteousness ought to have been raised for the protection of truth
 About the same time my name was omitted in the Liturgy, and I was held up to the country as an object of abomination for fictitious crimes
 "It is gratifying to me, and it is a proud reflection to the country, that of all the numerous witnesses who have deposed any thing prejudicial to my character, not one has been an Englishman
 When, in the history of these proceedings, the character of the country is hereafter the object of impartial scrutiny, this circumstance will form a bright incident in the annals of England
 "All the falsehood which has been produced against me has been of foreign extraction
 It is a species of commodity in which I trust that the English will never trade; and I feel assured that they will ever consider truth as too precious to be sold, and perjury as too detestable to be purchased
" Afterwards the gentlemen of the deputation had the honour of kissing her Majesty's hand, and retired
 Among the company present at the ceremony, we observed Sir Gerard Noel, Bart
 Keppel Craven, &c
 Continued discharges of artillery and small arms were made from the banks of the river
 On our return, the coup d'ail of this memorable scene was not less imposing and superb than it was in the morning: the innumerable boats extended in a line stretching entirely over the river, and which was only momentarily interrupted by the interposition of the bridges
 The evening closed in with a fineness corresponding with the beauty of the day
