 MANSION-HOUSE
 - Henry Bramall, alias Henry Edward Bramall, alias Henry Beaumont, was brought before the LORD MAYOR for final examination, charged with having married several young women, all of whom are now living
 Alexander Fletcher stated, that in the year 1839 he married Henry Bramall to Rebecca Coach, at Prince's-street Chapel, Devonport
 He believed the prisoner to be the man he married upon the occasion
 The certificate of the marriage, which stated that it had taken place on the 18th of August, was produced and authenticated
 Elizabeth Tinley stated, that she was married to the prisoner on the 25th of March, 1843
 He stated to her that his name was Henry Edward Beaumont, and five months after the marriage he went to sea
 Emily Georgina Rose, whose affections the prisoner had gained on the passage to India in the vessel in which he was acting as surgeon and she was a passenger, was the next witness called
 The poor young creature was an object of great and general commiseration
 She has not yet attained her 16th year, and upon being called upon according to the customary form to say whether she knew the prisoner, she was quite overpowered by her feelings, and sobbed and wept bitterly
 It was well that she had but to answer a question or two
 She stated that she was now in Sussex, living with her friends, and that she had been married to the prisoner at the Old Church in Fort William, Bengal, on the 30th of October, 1847, and had lived with him afterwards as his wife
 Anna Amelia Bland, who was supported to the chair in the witness-box, and appeared to be in extreme affliction, gave evidence as to her marriage with the prisoner on the 30th of September, 1843, and stated that she had lived with him till the Saturday on which he was apprehended
 Coach, a gentleman of well-known respectability in the city, stated that he was brother to Rebecca Coach, the prisoner's first wife
 She was now living with her parents at Liskeard
 The prisoner left her in April, 1842
 The witness here produced the letter which the prisoner had written to his wife upon his departure, excusing himself for the absence of a day or two
 - Could it have been easily ascertained that your sister was alive and at Liskeard? Witness
 A letter from the prisoner to his wife, dated New York, 1842, was also produced, but was not read
 The writing was compared with the writing in the prisoner's "log," in which the prisoner had recorded his marriage, in India, to Emily Georgina Rose, as a matter of fact which he had no intention of concealing
 W
 Medland, medical and drug agent in Upper Thames-street, stated that he was married to the prisoner's first wife's sister, and knew him well
 He believed the writing produced to be that of the prisoner
 He had been at the prisoner's house at St
 Blasey, in Cornwall, where the prisoner carried on the business of a druggist
 "I met the prisoner," said the witness, "one day in Bishopsgate-street, and he told me he was a surgeon to a ship
 I expressed some surprise at the circumstance, knowing his want of qualification, and he assured me that he had got his certificate from Apothecaries'-hall
 Inquiry was subsequently made at Apothecaries'-hall upon the subject, when it was found that there was no entry of the name
