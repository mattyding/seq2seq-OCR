 - This admired singer was the star of attention at a concert which took place at Brighton yesterday
 The large room at the Town-hall not being large enough to accommodate the whole of the applicants for tickets, the orchestra was half-filled, and, in addition, a greater number of persons were obliged to content themselves with listening from an adjoining room, from no part of which was the orchestra visible
 After the overture of Der Freischu'z, and a duet between Roger and Beletti, Jenny Lind was led on by Balfe, and commenced her labours by singing the "Dove sono" of Mozart
 This was followed by "La ci darem" and "Casta Diva," in the latter of which she astonished her most ardent admirers
 Many good judges pronounced her execution in this piece to be matchless
 She was greeted with an encore, but, as she appeared to be much fatigued with her exertions in once singing it, her bowed acknowledgement of the compliment was allowed as a substitution for its repetition
 Next she gave the "Quando Lasciai," from Roberto il Diavolo, and the popular "Ah, non Giunge," from La Sonnambula, obtaining in the latter, as well as in a trio for the voice and two flutes of most difficult execution, rapturous encores
 This evening (Wednesday) she appears at the theatre in La Sonnambula, and on Friday evening, at the same place, in La Figlia del Reggimento
