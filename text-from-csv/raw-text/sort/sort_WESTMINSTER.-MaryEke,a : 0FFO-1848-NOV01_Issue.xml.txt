 - Mary Eke, a woman of the town, was charged with being concerned, with others not in custody, in stealing a silver watch from the person of Allen Hembrow, a respectable-looking young man
 The prosecutor and a friend named Tripleat were inveigled by a woman into an infamous house in Duck-lane on Monday night, where they were immediately joined by the prisoner, who locked the door, and declared that neither of the men should leave until they treated her with drink
 As the prosecutor and his friend were very desirous of getting away, the latter consented to fetch some liquor, and while he was gone to procure it some fellow, as usual at these dens of iniquity in Westminster, made his appearance and demanded money
 The prisoner then suddenly seized the prosecutor, and exclaimed to her male companion, "Here, Tom, here's his watch in his coat pocket
" Prosecutor struggled to retain possession of his watch, but was overpowered by the prisoner and the man, and it was taken from him, so much force being used that the watch was broken from the chain and seals
 The prisoner, who is a very powerful woman, then threw the prosecutor down and held him while the man escaped with his booty
