(From the Delki G=ette of September 16
)our anticipationa regarding the danger at Peshawur have beea verified, but we are happy to say, only partially, and without any serious result
 A letter of the 5th inst
, which has unfortunately not come to band, appears to havo described what actually took placo, but we gather from one dated the 6th that a conspiracy had been organized, the chief object of whi
h was to seize the guns It appears, however, to have been defeated, and to have been anything but general, as the greater part of he troops of each caste are said to have been much disgusted at the ringleaders of the conspiracy
 Gwards' were placed over the guns and kept on, according to the latest advices, to prevent accident, and no fears seem to have been entertained of their being rescued before the announcement of the faU of Mool- tan, which is naturally looked for with much anxiety
 Major Lawrence appears to have at one time entertainod the idea of sending Mrs
 Lawrence to KohUt, but everything waiso quiet on the6th that he hadgiven it up
 The regular dak communication had been interrupted, but it is clear by the receipt of our letter that the Assistant at Peshawur had s eediy opened another means of conveying intelligence
