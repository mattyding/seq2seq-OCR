SANITARY STATE OF THE CITY
A list of deaths within the city of London for the week ending Saturday, Octo-er 28, from the Registration-office, was given in
 It contained S3 instances of mortality, but not one case of cholera
The CruIRMAN, in congratulating the committee upon thq incessant efforts made for the preservation of the health of their feUow citizens, took occa8ion to state that there had occurred no instance in his memory in which the sani- tary state of the city of London was more complete than it was acknowledged to be at the present moment
 SixSoN, the Officer of liealth to the city of London, transmitted to the commissioners a paper containing general suggestions on preliminary arrangements in the sanitary affairs of the city; which was read by the clerk
The document stated that the first care of the medical officer must be to ensure as early and accurate information as possible of every considerable alteration in the health of the city, and it would be impossible for him to ascertain at any one moment how mnany in so vast a population were sick or dying, or howr many had died wlithin a wreek, without de- rivingfromothers the details of his information
 spectod the physical conditions vhich attended individLal casea of disease, it was evident that he could at the time acquire no personal knowledge as an eyewitness, for all such cases of illness were, it might be presumed, uader proper medical treatment, and he could not, for obvious reasons, week admission into houses already placed under the charge of authorised medical practitioners
 As so large an amount of informatioa would bo indispens- ably necessary for his office, and as it would be impossible for him to collect the smad details as well as generalize the large results, he had endeavoured to organize a scheme of correspondeace calculated to enable him to receive all ths details he alluded to through various channels of oommuni- cation; and he thought his proposition would be the more lik;ely to receive the sanction of the commissioners,- as it didiot call any new machinery into esistnce, but confined itself to the application
 of resources which were already actively employed The Officer of Health then recommended to the commissioners that they should imvite the assistance of the various medical officers employed under the Poor Lawfor the several city unions, which officers must naturally be well informed of the Eanfitary condition of the districts, and be peculiarly familiar with those localities which, although seldom visited by other practitioners, were of much interest to the sanitary legislator on account of their tendency to breed and tog retain various forms of epidemic disease
 commissioners approved of his views, that each of the 10 district, surgeons should be directed to furnish a,weekly rep'ort of the state of his neigh- bourhood, a, matter which be considered to be of iirstrate importance
 He had already been able to make arrange- ments for obtaining the earliest knowledge of the deaths wvithin the city, which would be a valuablo addition to the parochial returns in many respects
 It would also be lesirable to procure accurate returns of sickness and mor- ltality from theworkhouses and prisons of tho city
 With such information, as hb had allded to beforo him he should make general reports from time to time to the commissioners on variations in the health of the city, espe- cially as regarded epidemic and other predominant disorders, and direct their attention to measures of local improvement
 The comnunication concluded with stating that as in a great variety of cases the district reports would render per- sonal inspection of the locality necessary it woull be expe- dient that every inquiry 'should be conducted in company *with the turveyor of the commissioners
After come conversation upon various points in the com- niunication by the medical officer, whose views met with very general ap ro0aL the paner was submitted to a sub-C O U
