ADDRrSSES OF TIHE LIGHTER MEN AND WA TER- MEN, AND OF TIHE PARISH OF ST
It having been announced, that at 10 o'clock yesterday morning, the Addresses to be presented to her Mlajesty, from the Lightermen and Watermen, and from the Churchwardens, Overseers, and Kothers, Inhabitants of St
 Saviour, Southwark, were appointed to be carriet Pup to the Queenr immense numbers of persons assembled at a very early hour, at the Sonthwark bridge-stairs
 The number of the boats, whichlit was absolutely impossible to' estimate; their general appearance and decorations, more especially the assemblage of beautiful females who were in waiting to celebrate and to enliven by their presence the affectioinate homage of such large and respect- able classes of thecommunity; the unusual fineness of the weather at thisperiod of theyear, and the entbusiastical expressionof,public feeling' whlich was exultingly mnanifcstcd upon every side, all com- bined to refider tiie scene at opee vast, joyous, anid magnificent
 The great object of general attentiori were thesteam yachts, and or,c of Lthe City barges (we beficvdthi6 Fishrnongers') which conveyed the members of thc two deputations
 These were extremely crowded,andwellfurnishe withlbands ofmusic
 Ataboutaquarterpastl1 o'clock [the signal-gun was fired, ant] these yachts getting under weigh, many individuals; who possessed tidets were necessarily left behind, owing to the extraordinary denseness of the crowd trhich lined the quays and stairs upon either side of the river
 On nooecasion whatever_not even upon that ralaiucholy one of the funeral of the immortal Nelson_was such a prodigious conceurse ever witnessed upon the Thames
 Age and manhood-youth and infancy-the feeble and the strong; every description, every class of society, were collected in one immense mass, occupying the whole of the banks of the river, from Southawark and the opposite shore, to Branden- burgh
house If the multitude was of a motley description, the same character was eminently applicable to the prodigious fleet of boats of every possible denomination, vhich, by its magnitude and diversity, gave life, spirit, and beauty to the moving picture which was presented to the eye
 The barge whieh contained the deputation charged with the Address of the Watermnen andl Ligh-termen was distinguishled by the large and glowing ensign that bhe bore, the sailor
like and orderly appearance of her crew, and the respectability of her passengers The several steamn-vachts, on board of which -were the dleputations from St
 tiely filled with gentlemen, the most opulent and of the highest cotl- sideration in that populousandwealthy parish, which contains nearly 19,000 inhabitants
 The bridges presented an aspect truly singular; it was absolutely difficult to discern the smallest aspearance of ParaueP un any or tnem, so entirejy were they occupied by innumerable spectators, who testified their sympathyand enthusiasm by reiterated shoats,which were re-echoed from the boatsand from theneighbour- ing shores, scarcely less thronged than tley
 Wherever a vacant space presented "standing room," as it is well termed, it may safely be said such vacant spaces, whether causeways, -public qunys, or private property, were entirely occupied by groups ef well
dressed persons, from Southwark to Vauxhall bridge 2Weanvhile, the im- mense collection of boats ana pinraces of everysize and evcry deno- r ination-their crewn and compunies animated byonesteadfitst pur- pose and one general feeling-to al alppemance as unalloyed and tunmixed in their niature as they were universzl in their influence-pursued their course to Hamnernmitlt
 The spec- tacle was splendid and imposing, Ibeyond anything of which mere description can convey an idea
-t 'twa an assemblage continually increasing, every creek and landingplace sent out fresh numbers to swell tlte augmenting procession
 If any thting could add to the picturesque activity and variety which were manifested on the river, it was the beautiful display we observed upon WVandsworth-conmn,n Battersea, and Putney bridges, and other piaces, where pedestrians and equestriams were mingled together in friendly and not unpleasing disorder
 But the concludingscene was also the most beautiful: the lawn beibre, and the grounds in the vicinity of Brandenburghhouae, were thronged beyond expression: all that theinconvenience of heatand pressure could inflictupon those who were stationed there, were evidentlymore than compensated by the full enjoyment of thoe fveIings unde which they had ventured to undergo that inconvenience
 The -alaceI Iwas only accessible over what might be termed a bridge of boats; such wus the closeness and density of -the position in which they were accidentally placed
 It was not without severe exertion and struggle, and after the lapse of a considerable time, that the de- putation with the Southxark aidress could-approach near to her Ma- jesty's residence
 Her Mlajesry showed herself severel times in the balcony of the prindpal window, and was hailed with the warmest and most enthusiastic greetings
 The deputation being at length admitted, her 'Majesty, preceded by Mr
 Aldennan Woo, accom- panied by Lady A
 Hamilton, and fol7owed bySir WV
 Hownam, Mr
P
, and others, entered thc chamkr ia which sheis accustomedto receiveaddzeases
 She wasnagniB'cently attired in a robe of muslin, richly einbroidered Pith silver: upon her head she wore a superb diamond aigrette; arnd displayed about her person several valuable je-wels
 The mover of the addre,s abi the seconder, followed by the gentlemen of the deptonj were then directed to approach, and the former read the following address in a distinct and impressive manner :_"To Her Mlost Gracious MaIesty, Caroline Amelia Elizebet,Consort ofHis Mlajesty King George the Fourth
 May it please your Mlajesty,W re, the Churchwardens, Overseers, and others au�iflA1 analoyal inlhabitants of the parish of Str Saviour, in the Borough of Soutliwark, amost humbly begleave to approach your ;1ajesty Iith our loyal congratulations on your MIajesty's accession to the throne of these kingdoms, as Queen Consort of George -the Fourth
 Happy, indeed, should we be, if these our hearty congratulatious were unalloyed with almost overwhelming synm- pathy for the manifold afflictions it has pleased the Almighty to pour upon your illustrious family by the demise of his late most gracious M1ajesty King George IIl
, always your M1ajesty's firmest stay and pretection; your lateillustrious daugh- ter, the Princess Charlotte of Wales, (than whom this natien-never liad a more promising or a brighter hope); and of his Royal High ness the Duke of Kent
 Saviour has Arays been unwilling to interfere in the affairs of state; yet, 3iadam, not to lay at your Majesty's feet an expression ofourabbotrerce anda d,
 testation of the vile persecutions your illajesty has suffered, almost from the moment of your landing in this country, (under a well founded hope of a reception, and of a lasting treatment, truly noble andBritish,) would be a stain upon our loyal and duriful attachmcnt
 We therefore beg to assure your 5ajesty that there is not, in any portion of his Majesty's subjects, a people muore sincerely disgusted with the vile slanders sent forth against your AMajesty's charectea and honour,nor more inimical to the proceadings now pending in par
 liament to deprive your Majesty of your legal rightsand privileges ltre can never too much deplore the seizure of the first niomeni of his late Majesty's demise to erase your MlajeEtys iasne fromw the formula of our holy religion: thereby holding you up to the woild as unworthv to receive the prayers of a pious people, notwith- standing that it is alleged the conduct which your M�aiesty is so basely charged with was known for a year preceding
Z can we too much admire your firmness and wisdom in refusing thiwbribe so shamefully offered to you at St
 Omer's, whereby you,> Majestywts ins-,woutuy: nvitea to o11ow an alleged impiog$ life; or yoi;r courage in treatirg with contempt the accompanyingthreat of bpging your Majesty to trial, if you did not remain abroad; thusgiving to your admiring people a presumptive proof of-vour innoence, and by that very step proving that vour1lhJesty is entiled to the attach- ment and loyalty ef your affectionate people
 The Bll of Pamns =u Penalties we deprecate on your Majesty's account particularby, as not being the legal mlode whereby the charges alleged agaTist youqillajesty should be investigated; but we deprecatQ it 4go as a dangereus precedent, whereby a base ministry, assisted by a corrupt parliament, may at any future period depose a sove reign upon alleged charges of licentiousness and immora-,tiif they should have the means of hiring spies and of PIViDg informers and ioreign witnesses to swear to evidence tlJk roay appear tosupport such charges
 But, Aladam, it is with pride we congratulate your Majesty, that in your cause a British poople are uncontaminated with the odiam of forming any part of the crixi
 natory witnesses against your Majesty We fial greakt gratifcatia that the foreign evidence produced against yesr Majesty has been of a description to defeat itself; and we trust that your Majesty hrtA yet many happv years in store, to oopensate you for the saW trials you have undergone, and we beg t=r ass-4 your Majesty

 Among the company present at the ceremony, we observed Sir Gerard Noel, tart

 Co-ntinued dis- charges of artillery and small arms were made from the banks of the river
 On our return, the corip d'ail of this mcmorable scene was noS less imposing and superb than it Wiis in- the zoraing: the innumerable boats extended in a line stretching entirely over the river, and whicb was only momentarily interupted by the interpo- sition of tlhe bridges
