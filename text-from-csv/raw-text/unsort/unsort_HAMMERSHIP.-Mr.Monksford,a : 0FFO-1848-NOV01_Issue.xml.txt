-Mr
 Monksford, a respectablo grocer aad teadealer in Highstreet, Nottihg-hill, applied to Mr
 BEADCeh, the, mitting magistrate, for his advice and assistanceder te following circumstancea:-Mr
 Ntonkaford stated, that on the 7th of September last he was-called upon by a person of gentlemanly appearance who announced himself to be tho " celebrated Captain Pid ding," the wrel-knovnw importer of the famous Howqua tea, and said, he called on applicant, on the recommendation of Mr
street, who had succeeded bim (Mr
 Mlonkssord) in busincss there, to offer him the agency for the sale of his tea for NottingHhill
 He stated, that the ad wantages of the agency would be very considerable; that a Sale of 300l
 worth of tea might be effected in such a popn Ious diUtrict as that in the course of a year; that he would send down a number of Chinese ornaments to put into his window, one of which would he a b'ttle
; that he would also send dove some Chinese ornaments and Dome printed cards, the lattor co be presented to each of tho purchnsers of a quarter of a pound or a larger quantity of Howqua tea, which card, on being shown on the next visit totke shop, was to entitle the purchaser to one of the images
 He also promised that he would advertiso his (Mr
 Monksford's) namo amongst his list of agents in four of the daily papera and in all the weekly journals, as veU as most of the periodicals
 He wpuld also, lor tho purpose of making in ex- traordinary sensation in the neighbourhood, send down some nen with printed handbills to distribute outside the shop, bywhich course a crowd would be caused to collect and public notice drawn to the teas
 He further stated his re sidence to be at Assam-hall, SydeDbam, Kent; that he bad also an estate at Dartmouth, and was a merchant of the city of London
 By these and other representations of Captain 2idding applicant was induced to accept the agency, when the captain told him, in order to secure himself (Captain Piddina) from loss by appl;cant resigning his agency, that shortly after the distribution of the Printed bills it would be re- quired that applicant should sign an agreement to undertake the azency for a year, and pay down the sum of 101
, which would be allowed him in the payment of the fiTst order for M0t
 Applicant accordingly signed the agree- ment, and gave the captain a check for 101
 Nearly two months having elapsed without having received any tea, although the captain promised to send him 1001
 worth down that wveek, he began to suspect that be had been duped, and accordingly wvent and made inquiries about Captain Pidding, and found that he did net live at Assam- hall, Sydenham, thae he had no estate at Daxrtmouth, and upon going to the captain's brother in the city he was told that uo order had been received from the captain to send applicant any tea, but that if ho gave an order it would be supplied to him on its being paid for
 Since then he had teen Mr
 Hobler, the solicitor, who advised him to go to the Lord Mayor at the Mansion-house, and there publicly state his case, but, on applying there, Mr
 Goodman, the chief clerk, informed him that he didnot think the Lord Mayor would entertain his application, it not being within his Lordship's jurisdiction, and that he had better lay his complaint before the magistrato of the police-court of the district in which he resided, which had caused him to come to that court
 BEADON said he did not see horw he could help him
 He thought that the applicant's only xemedy would be by action in the County Court for the recovery of the 101
 Monksford said, Mr
 Hobler had considered that a charge of obtaining money under false pretences might be sustained under the circumstances
 BnADoN reminded the applicant that there were many cases in which money was improperly obtained where the pretence was not a false one
 As the applicaut's object was that the members of his trade and the public generally should be cautioned on the subject, he had no doubt that the present application would fully answer the end desired
The applicant then thanked the magistrate for his atten tiou and kindness, and quitted the court
