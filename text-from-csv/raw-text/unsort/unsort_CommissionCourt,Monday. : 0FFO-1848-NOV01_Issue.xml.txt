- N "VV A/V4%7V VUV, 'Y -WUV U14uuwrs ox 15e II-maTriTZtC_ aevp r was ggai pceat the bar to stand his ttial under the Crown and Government Security Act,havzng been already twice tried at the last commission, on i both of which occasions the jury disagreed
The Attorney-General, tbo Solicitor-General, Sergeant Q'Brien, tho Hon Plunket, Q, MessrsC J
 Pennefather, and Perrin, were of counsel for the Crovn; and MessrsC
, and John O'Hagan acted For the prisoner, with Mr
;ThelClerk of the Peace, having called over the panel, pro- ceeded to swear a jury
Edvward Xilliken, the first who answered, wvas desired to s$and by by the Crown Solicitor
 B_'rr ovhjected to Mr Kemmis telling a juror to stand bz, as it was tho Attorney
General who had that exclusive power-I see no necessity for the Attorney- General objecting to n juror in person It is not the prac-htr-There is one that arises under the statuto, which says-I Judge CaAMPTON
-This is a moro mat'er of form It is no matter who desires the party to stand by on behalf of the Crown
 SMYLY-Tho words of the statute are, "as heretofore were accustomed," and the pTactico was for the Crown Soli- citor to act
 BUTT read a section of the statute, to show that the Attornoy-General should object in person-Thcn we should make you challenge for the prisoner
-I would have no objection; but it is the pri- soner himself who should do so strictly
 My reason for this objection is, that so great a power shound be exercised by an irresponsible party-For the reason you have assigned, I *ill not depart from the ordinary course
 There are some light differences between the practice in England and rolan
 In England, if the book is in the hand of the per- son, it i8 too late to challenge; here you can challenge any time before the beginning of the oath is administered
GERNETAL-Any time before the Clerk of the Crown says, " You shall well and truly try-Wo refuse the annlicationAfter several challenges, both on the part of the Crown and the prisoner,Edward Evans was called
 BUTT-I live in Nassau-street, and am fruiterer to the Lord-Lioutenant
-That won't prevent you challenging him pererhptorily, Mr BUTT
-WO challenge for cause
-That is no cauEe The effect would be, if allowed, that every tradesman of the Lord-Lieutenant would be disqualified, and he could not deal with the shop- keepers of Dub'in
 Put in your chaUenge, if you like BUTT, atter a very short delay, put in a formal chal- nge upon the ground stated
-This chalenge would make the prose- cution appear a private one at the suit of the Lord-Lieu- :tenar
TI,e ATToRa'EY-GENERAL having demurred,Mr
 BUTr proceeded to contend that  Evans could not e3xercise his office of juror conscientiously, owing to the pressure his official capacity mnight have upon him-We would not wraste time on such a point but for the bad attendance of jurors; however, I will not pres5to have ldr
Judge CnAawroN-Very well;- and your acqulescence is not to be considered as a precedentThe challenge was thes withdrawn, and Mr
 Evans was deslrod t3 stand by-We chaUenge this gentleman for cause Triers having been sworn,Charles Barber was examined, and swore, that on the first occasion the prisoner was tried he heard Mr
 Austin say outside the court-house (alluding to one of the jurors, a Mr Birmingham), that he would find no verdict, and get absolu- tion for 13d)The SoLcxCoITIIENxaRA-The witness overheard, he says, ono gentleman speaking to another
Mr-I suppose I cannot make any observatioit? Judge ToRRErs-You had better not at present-There is no evidence, my Lord, to support the chaUleDge
-I will tell the triers, &c
, there is nothing to show that Mr Austin will not give a just and proner verdictRFr BuTT contended that what Mr
 Austin said (which Was not denied) was certainly evidence to ehow his feelings towards the prisoner
-If the case is to go to the triers I will examine Mr Austin
George Austin sworn
-I heard Barber's evidence, and I can't charge my recolection as to having used the senti- ments he imputes to me; but I have no ill feeling to Mr
 O'Doherty, and, even if I said it, it would have no influenceThe ATTorNEY-GENRAL
 Austin is in doubt whother he used these words or not, I will let him stand by
The following are the names of the jary as swornThomas Clarendon, Great Brunswick-street; Thomas Read Milhiken, 4, Parliiament-street; George Bowles, 1, Lower Ormond-quay; Isaac Farrell, 210, Great Brunswick-street; Joseph Kirk, 22, Jervis

The prisoRer was then given in charge of the jury, for having, after the passing of the Crowu and
Government Se- curity Act, viz, on the 1st of July last, devised and intended to deprivo the Queen of her Royal style, title, honour, &c
, and did express such intentions by publishing numerous articles in the tiisl& Tribunne newvspaper, of which he was the registered proprietor, entitled, "Our HIarvest Pros- pects," " Courage," &c
UsNERAL men rose to stame tee case tor the presecution, which bas been published fully on the two former* trials
 It was but right, observed the learned gentleman) that he should inform the jury that the prisoner had already been tried by two juries of his countrymen, and that on both occasions the juries had disagreed as to his guilt
 He should remark that the evidence gven upon the first of these two trials was not precisoly the same as was given on the second; but the evidence adducedfor the Crown on the second trial was substantially similar to that which wouild be given in the present investigation
 Now, no one could entertain a more sincere respect than he did for the opinions of a jury; and if he found, when en gaged in the dis- charge of his official duty, that one, two, or three jurors only had come to a conclusion that the rmlsoner was guilty, he would certainly not have put him ori his trial a second time; but uch, he bad reason to believe, was not the case; and his present impression was, that they had then an opportunity of considering with greater care than before a new doctrine, which was propounded at tho last commission, and, if pos- sible, effect a final settlement of the law which related to the responsibility of -newspaper proprietors
cumstances, he felt it to be his duty to submit the case of Mr
 O'Doherty to a third jury, in order to asertain whether,under the direction-of the Court, they could have any doubt
 wbatever that he was not only legally but moraUy guilty of the offence withlwhich he was charged
 The learned gentleman thean defined at some length the state of the law as a pp licable to the proprietors of newspapers, audconteBded *that tprisoner, as onoofthe proprictora of tbeIriehT
riolneshould eld respo,nsible for overy article pubshed i that paper
 On this subject, however, he called on them to re- ceive the law as it would be stated to them by the Court, aardto
place no reliance upon any legal definition thatmiguLa oe gtven to them Dy nimsel or the counsel for the prisoner, except it waa in perfect conformity with the opinion of thaoCourt
 Of matters of fact, however, he should at the same
time inform them, they (the jury) were the iole judges, and they aloio were eompetent to draw inferences from the facts proved in evidence
 Thelearned counsel then stated that the publications for which the prisoner had been indicted consisted of five distinct articles, which ap eared in two consec4tave numbers of the Irisih Tn une, pulished onx te 1st anda'
8bh of Faly, entitica as ?ollow :-L" Our Uarvest Prospects," "Courage," "-A Lesson-from- tke J sarrectibn 
oif Paris," and two-othor article8, eae1-ceaTed, *t Our -lWar Departmnent
" Having read through all these articles, and having commented upo2i various passages contained in them, the Attorney
4leneral, in conclusion, proceeded to observe,DV- - a a -Gmu Wu- -- u yu,Liu$ MU aterrea ne opersonal feeling of hostlity towards the prisoner, and that, whatever any ortion of the public might think to the con, trary, he was resolved to discharge the duty he oved to his Sovereign to the satisfaction of his own conscience

 With everydeferoc toIt was impoasible for him to say why the jury on the last trial had disagre:d; but the learned coutisel who defended the prisoner commented upon the circumstance that only one gentleman had been produced to swear to the handwriting of the prisoner
 He (the Attorney-General) did not say that the prisoner was bound to produce his friends and relatives to dbprove that the document was in his handwriting, butthe identity of bandwriting was a matter f opinion
 TTke viisoner wnsa member of the medical profeasion, he served lais time to hir, Donova, the chymist Clare and inthat establishment a Mr That gentleman vrould be produced to identify the handwriting of tho prisoner Upon the last trial that gentleman deposed to his bandtrihing
 He was the only person that would bo produced to p rove the handwriting in the manuscript ascribed to the prisoner; and he (the Attorney-General) said, unfeignedly and truly, that if a single witness conscientiously toldhim that he believed the document was not in the handwriting of the prisoner he should feel it to be his duty to produce him
 Observations were made on the last trial in reference to the non-produc Donovan If he (tho Attorney-Goneral) had believed that Mr
 Donovan would be able to swear that the handlwriting was not that of the prisoner he would have brought bhim forward as a witness, and he should not be taunted with the non-production of persons who might have bee i produced by the prisoner's counsel, if their evidence conld ?orva }hinCharles Vernon examined by twe SoLICETon-GENt

 BUTT Donovan's-e3- tablishment about eight days ago Thought he would re- turn to it Saw no reason tosaythat he wouldnotreturn His reason for leaving Mr Donovan's was to keep out of the way from being examined
 Slept in the Brazen Head Hotel, and during tho day went to the country Connor for 6l to leave town, but told him that he had not money to go away, otherwise he would go to Carrick-on- Sair
 Connor in his yard by appointment, and he oave him 61 to go out-of town, and, as he already stated, he did go to the country ereryday, and slept in the hotel each night Connor that he would go to Carrick Suir, but as the money was not sufficient he did not go, but remained in the hotel, and went to the country in the day- time, as described
 Could not tell what was Mr Connor's impression as to whether he had or had not gone to Carrick- on Never told Mr Connor that the way he proved the handwriting was by comparing it with the writing in the shop book Did not expeet to gain auything by giving evi- dence against the prisoner
Mr BUTT produced a letter which was written by witness to Mr Connor, to whom it was addressedWitness acknowledged that the letter was in his hand- writing, andMr Burr read the letter, which was as follows:-Brazen Head Hotel, Sunday Evening,Oct
