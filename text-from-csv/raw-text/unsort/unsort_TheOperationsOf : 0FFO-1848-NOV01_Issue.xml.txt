R4ATIONS OF THE BA2AK OP FRANCz
1:)w nen we rcaa tne long report of the Bank of France, published in Saturday's Jonila r, wo cannot help asking ourselves when this long movement of decline which the re- volution of February has impressed on the commercial and financial condition of our country will stop
 We have now to register a further decline of 3,340,000f in the portfolio of the Bank or the branches it has fallen to 67,873,684E
, and in the branches from 111,39f!,609f Last week the decline w, and the week before 36500,000
 It hence foUows that there is a deficiency of 13:000,000f
 in the mass of the bills (effes) discounted during the last three weeka
The amount of specie has not varied in Paris, and in the branches exhibits a slight increase
 The total amount of this metallic reserve is 229,7B5,402f
The amount of the bills in arrear is between 304,123f
, and that of the bills cn mouffranc4e, both in Paris and the branches, exhibits a decrease of about 200,000f
, and remains at 23,239 The circulation of the Bank has increased by 3,000,000f, and amounts to 392,6U5,275f,, includiug the ciroulation of the branches
 It will be seen that it every day approaches the limit assigned by the Provisional Government by the decree which gave its notes a forced circulation
The "1 account-current" of the Treasury has fallen to 10,301,203f
 This amounts to a decrease, ia one week, of more than 6 000
 besides exnlained bv theoperations reapeoting the arrears of tho RentesThe accounts-current of private individuals have expe- rienced an increase of 1,350,000f
, and amonnt to 101,310
000f, including those of the branches, which amourt to nearly 25,000,000f
If it be wished to ascertain the situation of the Bank in the event of its thinking proper to resume the payment of its Rotes in specie in accordance with the advice given by the Minister of Finance at a recent sitting of our National Assembly, the calculation may easily be made
The amount of its circulation is 392,000,000f
 Let us add thereto the amount of the deposits, in that we may have the entire amount of its poritive liabilities, and we shall have a sum of 504,000,000f The metallic reserve amounts to 230,000,00Gf-equivalent to 40 per cent of the debts for which it is liable It is seldom that the banks possess in their coffers a metallic capital proportionably so abundant, nor is it always-far fronm ita sign of prosperity
 It is only right to add, that the Bank has g ranted, for the advan- tage of the State, a loan of 150,000,0t0f
, of which oily 25;000,000f It is therefore expoEed to a more or less6immediate demand of 125, to which 6,500,000f
 must be added for the complement of the loen of 10,000,000f
 advanced to the city of Paris It will be seen that the liabilicies of the Bank may hereby be increased to the extent of 131,500,000f
; they would, in that case, amoant to 635,000,000f
000,000f Sapposing the metallic re- Eerve should remain in stata quo, it would amount to about 
20 w-r nrnt nn thn liahilitiPIt is not uninteresting to glanmc at the corresponding state of the Bank of England The last account published in London (on Sunday last) ftrnishes us vith the following re- 6iults:-The amount of the notes issued by the Issue ï¿½Department is 26823,6351, but there remains 9,348,1601 in the vaults of the banking d rtment, whence it follows that its Cir-c ffon is  
 ,  17,41o The amoant of public deposits is 6,9e2,466 The amount of private deposits
 8 6S9 104 The notes of several days' sight    83,519,216 Or 738,000,000 francs
To meet this demand the BSank has a metaUlc capital of 13,417,2311
 Thyis is nearly 45 per cent During the whole of the year which preceded the great commotion that broke out in the month of Febra- ary last, the proportion of the reserve of the liabilities fluc- tuated between 23 and 28 per cent
 It i true that the year 1847 was one of financial crisis; and it is well-known that the English CabEiet thought proper to suspend the restric- tive clauso of PeePs Bank Act, in order to provide against the scarcity of specie
We have already obsenved that a great accumulation of speciein the coffers of the Bank is not always a sign of prosperity This is proved at the present moment by the fisanncis state of things in London as well as in Paris
 If the money accumulates in the cellars of the issue depart- ment, it is partly because England refuges the orders of the Continent when they aro for time
 She w,ill not give credit to thc trade of Franoc or Germany, and, for our own parts, we cannot find fult with thia determination
 This is one of the causes that explain the enormous difference exkibited by the last returns of the English Custom-house between the imports and the exports
 She has sold us but libtle foe the last six months-first, because we were hardly in a situation to buy, and, secondly, because she would only seU for ready mr^uey
 If she has imported more, there is a reason for this fact also-viz
, the depreciation of all articles of mer- chandise in the markets of France and Germaij : it appears to us that it would be incorrect to attribute this result solely to tho premiums on exportation
We have heard much talk lately of mutual dependence
 Behold the mutual dependence that revolutions inflict upon nations They dry up the sources of credit and labour at home and abroatd
 The revolution of February has not only ruined our credit at home, as is proved by the const4ntly decreasing amount of the portfolio of the Bank, but it hab ruined it in the foreign market, as the sterile accunlulatiou of gold in the celars of the Bank of England is a too evident sign
