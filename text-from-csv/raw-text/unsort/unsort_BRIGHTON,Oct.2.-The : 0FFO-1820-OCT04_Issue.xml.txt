OnSaturday thebuke and Duchess DcCazes had a view of the Pavilion, an exception having been made fronm the es- tablished rile, of not showing it while his lajesty is here, ini favour of his Excellency. After their visit they returned to IVorthing.- Eveningpaper.Yesterday morning the Countess Oldi, Colonel Oliveria; and ten or eleven other persons, above the middling class of life, arrived at Dover, from Boulog6ne, to give evidence in favour of theQueen.'Tlie death of hIr. Nelson, the Secretary to the Navy Board, was but slightly mentioned in this and-other jour-i nals. If it is inot in thte power of the daily press to conferpermanent fame,; it ought at least to notice public losses, and � makethe existing generation acquainted with tlosc talents and vir. tues wlicih have been dedicated to its advantage. There never was a more zealous and upright servant of his King and country, and of that service upon which the security of the throne and the grandeur of the country rest, thanMIr. Nclson. In him every man in the navy, whose situation, or the accidents of whose life, might reduce hirm to need assistance. has lost a friend. No station connected vith that service was below his attention; and the motives for kindness Wvere but increased by the distress of the object. It was on Sun- day, the 17th of last month, that he fel} gown suddenly in a fit of apoplexy, at North-Corner, Plynmouth-dock, where he was on a visit: he was immediately conveyed to a small house oni the Quay. Medical aid was no less instantly applied, but in vain ; he lingered till Tuesday, the 19th-not unconscious, it is hoped, of the srim- pathy and attentions of those by whom he was surrounded, but without the povwer of returning them thanks. He then expired at 3 o clock in the afternoon, without a high or groan. Mlr. Nelson had been in the Navy-office nearly 36 years, during 24 of which ho had filled te a station of Secretary.On Saturday evening, Vin. Fielding, Esq., the senior Magistrate at the Police-office, Queen-square, departed this life, at his house, where he had been confined for several weeks past in consequence of a severe attack of. the dropsy. Dlr. Fielding had been Police AMa- gistrate for about 12 years, and was about 80 years of age. He was the eldest son of leinry Fielding, the celehrated novelist.
