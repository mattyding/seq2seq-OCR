The discussions yesterday in the House of Lords began with some explanations and letters on the affair of the MARJTETiIS at Milan, aii(t the threat denounced,or said tobe denounced, by that Colonel BRow-;r, against the younger of those bankers resident in London, if he meddled in the QUEEN'S affair
 So far as Lord LIVERroOT's explanation went, which was of an ex p,arte nature, it might appear sa- tisfactorv; but We are enabled this day to supply an hiat us in the corresponidence, which entirely alters the complexion of the business, puts BitowNVE's conduct in a more striking point of view, and shows more strongly than can be conceived the terror created abroad by that anti-social Act, the Alien Bill
 We would now point general attention to the whole of this correspondence
 The facts are unde- niably before the public, and the chief of 'them are these- that BROWNE actually obliged the father to explain away the threat that bad been denounced against the soni by BROWNE
 This the fathet (a most respectable man, as Lord LIvERPOOL stated hir to be) did
 But ve now lay before the nation, whlich has almost ceased to be astonished at any new iniquity in this most iniquitous alfair, a subse- quent letter written by the father, and explaining the new terror or threat under which he -was obliged to disavow the application of the old one! ! BROWNE,we suppose, must now be given up
