THE WAR IN MOOLTAN
We have received by express from Marseilles our advices and papers from India in anticipation of the overland mail of the 3d of Ootober from -Bombay
 The dates thus received are from Cal- cutta to the 22d of September, Madras to the 25th, and Bombay to the 3d of Ootober
Frontier affairs have k%sumed a much more serious aspect
 The intelligence is unsatisfactory alike re- epecting the operations before Mooltan and the gene- ral state of the Punjab
 Our forces in that direc- tion have suffered a check in consequence of the -defection of the auxiliary Sikh troops
 Just as the operations of General Whish's Brigade had commenced in the most brilliant manner, Shere Singh, with the force of nearly 5,000 men under his command, went over to the Dewan, evi- dently upon a pre-arranged plot-an event which compelled General Whish instantly, to change his tactics, to raise the siege, and having made a retro- grade movement,to unite his forces in an entrenched -camp at some 15 miles from the citadel, there to await in a more favourable position the junc- tion of the reinforcements from Ferozepore and &Scinde
 Two engineer officers had since, it appears, fallen
 into the hands of the enemy roolraj, by Shere Singh's defection, had aug- nented his adherents to about 20,000 men, with the probability of a further accession of nearly as many more
 Chutter Singh, the rebel leader in the Hazareh, was marching with -sbout 10,000 men to join the Dewan; and although Gholab Singh had not more positiVely thau heretofore gone over to the conspiracy, two of ,his regiments, with stores and baggage, had left to join the Hazareh Sikhs
 At Lahore the features of this frontier rebellion were not less pronounced, although happily from our excellent measures of -defence there the circumstance occasions no ground for ultimate apprehension as to our hold upon the capital
 We find, however, that several other S3irdars of the Durbar had been found to be mplicated, and that in consequence of this fact the Resident, on receipt of the intelligence from Mooltan, had at once secured under a guard the per- zsonxd Dhuleep Singh, as a hostage, to iufluence those who wavered, as well as to frustrate attempts made ty the Sikhs in arms to get possession of the Maha- rajah's person
 The Resident had also, wo are told, laid hands on the famous Koh-i-noor diamond, as a measure of similar precaution
xroops were being poured into Scinde by sea from tombay, to occupy the line of the middle Indus, and to maroh, should their services be required, upon
 The Bombay force when united would amount to about 10,000 men
 Some of the bladras regiments would reinforce the Bombay &tations, at the same time that a general advance was preparing from the Bengal frontier
 From the latter direction a well-apportioned force, amounting to about 20,000 men, would march upon Mooltan, under General Gilbert
 No troops -could, it appears, be spared from Lahore, but it was considered the cavalry regiments still left in Ferozepore would be quite sufficient to keep -open the line of communication with the camp of General Whish; in other words, to frustrate any *'ising between him and the capital
 Under these -circmanstances, the position of the British force in the field, strongly entrenched, with a park of ar- tillery of 70 guns, and their flank on the river, at -some 15 miles from Mooltan, may be regarded as Eecure under any contingency
On the whole, happily, there appears every ground for belief that- the preparations announced from all sides of India to retrieve the check we have de- scribed are on a scale of magnitude probably commen- 
 with the extent of past supineness in its exaggerated reaction than the actual degree of ,danger Such at least is the opinion of parties who from the first were urgent for the adoption of active tneasures, and who at present are the least alarmed by the ultimate features the outbreak has assumed, {or inclined to doubt of a speedy and successful ter- mnination
 Mooltan would now be attacked by Eepa- cate armies from the south and from the north, when,it has been afiLrmed, mere detachments in the Iearlier months would have sufficed, but it is added that there now appears every probability that long before the Bombay army shall have reached the seat of war the few regiments that have already arrived vithout orders from head-quarters-namely, the 3lifie Brigade from Scinde, and the European ca- valry from Ferozepore, will supply what is wanting to our troops who are in the presence of the enemy, And that General Whish, with a body of picked in- *antry, European and native, and some 3,000 ca- valry (an arm hitherto deficient), which will have teached him, with a park of field and siege artillery, and under the pr)si7ge of recent success, wiU certainly rcap the honours of the campaign, should the temerity of the Dewan, or the precipitancy of Lib forces tempt them, as is not unlikely, to an attack
 This opinion seems borne out by other de- tails which have reached us as to the recent conduct of our troops, who, in the siege operations, stormed the outworks, forestalling the work of regular ap- proaches, and up to the hour when breaching dis- tance had thereby been attained-an hour marked by the instant defection of the Sikh Chief-every reo2coz2re, without exception, told the same lesson of superiority in strategy as in conflict that Edwardes and his Pathans before taught the insurgents under earlier and still more desperate circamstances
The following officers had fallen in the siege operations during an attack on an outpost unrivalUed for desperate gallantry in the annals of the army, namely, Colonel Pattonu, Major Montizambert, Quarter-Master Taylor, Lieutenant Cubitt, and En- uigsL Lloyd
