			TriTZtC_ aevp r was ggai pceat the bar to stand his ttial under the Crown and Government Security Act,
			havzng been already twice tried at the last commission, on i both of which occasions the jury disagreed.
			The Attorney-General, tbo Solicitor-General, Sergeant Q'Brien, tho Hon. J. Plunket, Q.C., Messrs. Baldwin, Q.C., Sxnyly. J. Pennefather, and Perrin, were of counsel for the Crovn; and Messrs. Butt, Q.C., and John O'Hagan acted For the prisoner, with Mr. O(Rorke as attorney.
			;ThelClerk of the Peace, having called over the panel, pro- ceeded to swear a jury.
			Edvward Xilliken, the first who answered, wvas desired to s$and by by the Crown Solicitor.
			_mhr. B_'rr ovhjected to Mr. Kemmis telling a juror to stand bz, as it was tho Attorney.General who had that exclusive power.
			Judge ORAIPTON.-I see no necessity for the Attorney- General objecting to n juror in person. It is not the prac-
			htr. BUTT.-There is one that arises under the statuto, which says-
			I Judge CaAMPTON.-This is a moro mat'er of form. It is no matter who desires the party to stand by on behalf of the Crown.
			' Mr. SMYLY.-Tho words of the statute are, ""as heretofore were accustomed,"" and the pTactico was for the Crown Soli- citor to act.
			, Mr. BUTT read a section of the statute, to show that the Attornoy-General should object in person.
			! Judge CRAXPToN.-Thcn we should make you challenge for the prisoner.
			Mr. BUTT.-I would have no objection; but it is the pri- soner himself who should do so strictly. My reason for this objection is, that so great a power shound be exercised by an irresponsible party.
			Judge CRAMPTON.-For the reason you have assigned, I *ill not depart from the ordinary course. There are some light differences between the practice in England and rolan. In England, if the book is in the hand of the per- son, it i8 too late to challenge; here you can challenge any time before the beginning of the oath is administered.
			The ATTORNEY.GERNETAL.-Any time before the Clerk of the Crown says, "" You shall well and truly try.""
			Judge CRAMPTON.-Wo refuse the annlication.
			After several challenges, both on the part of the Crown and the prisoner,
			Edward Evans was called.
			By &r. BUTT.-I live in Nassau-street, and am fruiterer to the Lord-Lioutenant.
			Judge CuAMPToN.-That won't prevent you challenging him pererhptorily, Mr. Butt.
			Mr. BUTT.-WO challenge for cause.
			Judge CRAMPTON.-That is no cauEe. The effect would be, if allowed, that every tradesman of the Lord-Lieutenant would be disqualified, and he could not deal with the shop- keepers of Dub'in. Put in your chaUenge, if you like.
			Mr. BUTT, atter a very short delay, put in a formal chal- nge upon the ground stated. e l
			Judge CRAmPTOn.-This chalenge would make the prose- cution appear a private one at the suit of the Lord-Lieu- :tenar.t.
			TI,e ATToRa'EY-GENERAL having demurred,
			Mr. BUTr proceeded to contend that .r. Evans could not e3xercise his office of juror conscientiously, owing to the pressure his official capacity mnight have upon him.
			The A'r'ORN1ne-GaNaERAn.-We would not wraste time on such a point but for the bad attendance of jurors; however, I will not pres5to have ldr. Elvars sworn.
			Judge CnAawroN.-Very well;- and your acqulescence is not to be considered as a precedent.
			The challenge was thes withdrawn, and Mr. Evans was deslrod t3 stand by.
			f3eorge Austin called.
			Mr. BUVTT.-We chaUenge this gentleman for cause. Triers having been sworn,
			Charles Barber was examined, and swore, that on the first occasion the prisoner was tried he heard Mr. Austin say outside the court-house (alluding to one of the jurors, a Mr. Birmingham), that he would find no verdict, and get absolu- tion for 13d. (Laughter.)
			The SoLcxCoITIIENxaRA.-The witness overheard, he says, ono gentleman speaking to another.
			Mr. Austin.-I suppose I cannot make any observatioit? Judge ToRRErs.-You had better not at present.
			The ATroTRNEY-GrazELL.-There is no evidence, my Lord, to support the chaUleDge.
			Judge CRAMPTON.-I will tell the triers, &c., there is nothing to show that Mr. Austin will not give a just and proner verdict
			RFr BuTT contended that what Mr. Austin said (which Was not denied) was certainly evidence to ehow his feelings towards the prisoner.
			The ATTOrNXY-GBNRRAL.-If the case is to go to the triers I will examine Mr. Austin.
			George Austin sworn.-I heard Barber's evidence, and I can't charge my recolection as to having used the senti- ments he imputes to me; but I have no ill feeling to Mr. O'Doherty, and, even if I said it, it would have no influence
			The ATTorNEY-GENRAL.-As MIr. Austin is in doubt whother he used these words or not, I will let him stand by.
			The following are the names of the jary as sworn
			Thomas Clarendon, Great Brunswick-street; Thomas Read Milhiken, 4, Parliiament-street; George Bowles, 1, Lower Ormond-quay; Isaac Farrell, 210, Great Brunswick-street; Joseph Kirk, 22, Jervis.6treet; Thomas Figgis, 22, Abbey. street; Mauricoe Brooks, 70, Mfiddle Abbey-street; Wiliam Frazer, 37, Arran-quay; James Charles, 61, Mary-street; Wiliam Dunbar, 1, Dawson-street; David Foster, 24, Or- mond-quay; Richard Connell, 54, Anne-street.
			The prisoRer was then given in charge of the jury, for having, after the passing of the Crowu and.Government Se- curity Act, viz., on the 1st of July last, devised and intended to deprivo the Queen of her Royal style, title, honour, &c., and did express such intentions by publishing numerous articles in the tiisl& Tribunne newvspaper, of which he was the registered proprietor, entitled, ""Our HIarvest Pros- pects,"" "" Courage,"" &c.
			tte ATTORNXY.UsNERAL men rose to stame tee case tor the presecution, which bas been published fully on the two former* trials. It was but right, observed the learned gentleman) that he should inform the jury that the prisoner had already been tried by two juries of his countrymen, and that on both occasions the juries had disagreed as to his guilt. He should remark that the evidence gven upon the first of these two trials was not precisoly the same as was given on the second; but the evidence adducedfor the Crown on the second trial was substantially similar to that which wouild be given in the present investigation. Now, no one could entertain a more sincere respect than he did for the opinions of a jury; and if he found, when en gaged in the dis- charge of his official duty, that one, two, or three jurors only had come to a conclusion that the rmlsoner was guilty, he would certainly not have put him ori his trial a second time; but uch, he bad reason to believe, was not the case; and his present impression was, that they had then an opportunity of considering with greater care than before a new doctrine, which was propounded at tho last commission, and, if pos- sible, effect a final settlement of the law which related to the responsibility of -newspaper proprietors. Under these cir.
			cumstances, he felt it to be his duty to submit the case of Mr. O'Doherty to a third jury, in order to asertain whether,
			under the direction-of the Court, they could have any doubt. wbatever that he was not only legally but moraUy guilty of the offence withlwhich he was charged. The learned gentleman thean defined at some length the state of the law as a pp licable to the proprietors of newspapers, audconteBded *that tprisoner, as onoofthe proprictora of tbeIriehT.riolne
			should eld respo,nsible for overy article pubshed i that paper.. On this subject, however, he called on them to re- ceive the law as it would be stated to them by the Court, aardto.place no reliance upon any legal definition that
			miguLa oe gtven to them Dy nimsel or the counsel for the prisoner, except it waa in perfect conformity with the opinion of thaoCourt. Of matters of fact, however, he should at the same.time inform them, they (the jury) were the iole judges, and they aloio were eompetent to draw inferences from the facts proved in evidence. Thelearned counsel then stated that the publications for which the prisoner had been indicted consisted of five distinct articles, which ap eared in two consec4tave numbers of the Irisih Tn une, pulished onx te 1st anda'.8bh of Faly, entitica as ?ollow :-L"" Our Uarvest Prospects,"" ""Courage,"" ""-A Lesson-from- tke J sarrectibn .oif Paris,"" and two-othor article8, eae1-ceaTed, *t Our -lWar Departmnent."" Having read through all these articles, and having commented upo2i various passages contained in them, the Attorney.4leneral, in conclusion, proceeded to observe,

			personal feeling of hostlity towards the prisoner, and that, whatever any ortion of the public might think to the con, trary, he was resolved to discharge the duty he oved to his Sovereign to the satisfaction of his own conscience. With respect to any expressions that might be used towards him for the nart he had taken in any of the state prosecutions *wrhich Ito ha found it necessary to institute, he could onlg:J tt :hs~re existed In his oown m}in no feeling oF hostility to the writers, of any newspapers, and he looked forwaxd.with confdence to the good sense of the jpqb11:o_tojvqH hixun. in ever step he had taken in the

			It was impoasible for him to say why the jury on the last trial had disagre:d; but the learned coutisel who defended the prisoner commented upon the circumstance that only one gentleman had been produced to swear to the handwriting of the prisoner. He (the Attorney-General) did not say that the prisoner was bound to produce his friends and relatives to dbprove that the document was in his handwriting, but
			the identity of bandwriting was a matter f opinion. TTke viisoner wnsa member of the medical profeasion, he served lais time to hir, Donova, the chymist Clare.street. and in
			that establishment a Mr. M'Keever also did busines3. That gentleman vrould be produced to identify the handwriting of tho prisoner. Upon the last trial that gentleman deposed to his bandtrihing. He was the only person that would bo produced to p rove the handwriting in the manuscript ascribed to the prisoner; and he (the Attorney-General) said, unfeignedly and truly, that if a single witness conscientiously toldhim that he believed the document was not in the handwriting of the prisoner he should feel it to be his duty to produce him. Observations were made on the last trial in reference to the non-produc. tion of iMr. Donovan. If he (tho Attorney-Goneral) had believed that Mr. Donovan would be able to swear that the handlwriting was not that of the prisoner he would have brought bhim forward as a witness, and he should not be taunted with the non-production of persons who might have bee i produced by the prisoner's counsel, if their evidence conld ?orva }hin

			Cross-examined by Mr. BUTT.-Left Mr. Donovan's-e3- tablishment about eight days ago. Thought he would re- turn to it. Saw no reason tosaythat he wouldnotreturn. His reason for leaving Mr. Donovan's was to keep out of the way from being examined. Slept in the Brazen Head Hotel, and during tho day went to the country. Did not ask Mr. Connor for 6l. to leave town, but told him that he had not money to go away, otherwise he would go to Carrick-on- Sair. Met Mr. Connor in his yard by appointment, and he oave him 61 to go out-of town, and, as he already stated, he did go to the country ereryday, and slept in the hotel each night. Did tell MIr. Connor that he would go to Carrick.on. Suir, but as the money was not sufficient he did not go, but remained in the hotel, and went to the country in the day- time, as described. Could not tell what was Mr. Connor's impression as to whether he had or had not gone to Carrick- on.Suir. Never told Mr. Connor that the way he proved the handwriting was by comparing it with the writing in the shop book. Did not expeet to gain auything by giving evi- dence against the prisoner.
			Mr. BUTT produced a letter which was written by witness to Mr. Connor, to whom it was addressed.
			Witness acknowledged that the letter was in his hand- writing, and
			Mr. Burr read the letter, which was as follows:-
			Brazen Head Hotel, Sunday Evening,

			My dear Mr. Connor -Xot wishing to make my appoaraneo in yonLrneighbourhood, aa there Is a close look-out for me. I Intend to
			leave tov nln the evening till after the trial. I write to say that I shall feel particularly obliged to yon if you take the trouble of. either di- rectly or indirectly, as you may think prudent, suggesting to Mr. O'Doherty's counsel or agent the propriety of abstaining from making any reference to me, tending to attaint my haacter. Ibavearight to claim this protection; for In adopting the conrse I have dono, I assure you that I 'have consulted more my own feelings than my interest.

			Mr. BUTT (to witness).-Do you cxpect anything for giving evidence against the prisoner?
			Witness.-No.
			Do you think you had damaged yourself by going away? -No..
			What do you mean, then, by saying that you consulted your feelings more than your interest ?-On the last trial there was a 8trong feeling against me, and it was very difficult for me to get a situation.
			Did you think you were losing a situation by going away ? -I thought I did.
			Did you not mean that it was your interest to come here ? -It was not my interest. I did not mean to say that it was. Mr. Batt produced another letter, which had been writ- ten by the witness to hr. Connor, and which was as fol- lows8:

STATE PROSECUTION. The Judges sat this morning at 10 o'clock. THE QUEEN Y. O'DOHERTY. Kevin Izod O'Doherty, one of the proprietors of the Irish Tribune newspaper, was again placed at the bar to stand his trial under the Crown and Government Security Act, having been already twice tried at the last commission, on both of which occasions the jury disagreed. The Attorney-General, the Solicitor-General, Sergeant O'Brien, the Hon. J. Plunket, Q.C., Messrs. Baldwin, Q.C., Smyly, J. Pennefather, and Perrin, were of counsel for the Crown; and Messrs. Butt, Q.C., and John O'Hagan acted for the prisoner, with Mr. O'Rorke as attorney. The Clerk of the Peace, having called over the panel, proceeded to swear a jury. Edward Milliken, the first who answered, was desired to stand by by the Crown Solicitor. Mr. BUTT objected to Mr. Kemmis telling a juror to stand by, as it was the Attorney-General who had that exclusive power. Judge CRAMPTON. - I see no necessity for the Attorney-General objecting to a juror in person. It is not the practice. Mr. BUTT. - There is one that arises under the statute, which says - Judge CRAMPTON. - This is a mere matter of form. It is no matter who desires the party to stand by on behalf of the Crown. Mr. SMYLY. - The words of the statute are, ""as heretofore were accustomed,"" and the practice was for the Crown Solicitor to act. Mr. BUTT read a section of the statute, to show that the Attorney-General should object in person. Judge CRAMPTON. - Then we should make you challenge for the prisoner. Mr. BUTT. - I would have no objection; but it is the prisoner himself who should do so strictly. My reason for this objection is, that so great a power should be exercised by an irresponsible party. Judge CRAMPTON. - For the reason you have assigned, I will not depart from the ordinary course. There are some slight differences between the practice in England and Ireland. In England, if the book is in the hand of the person, it is too late to challenge; here you can challenge any time before the beginning of the oath is administered. The ATTORNEY GENERAL. - Any time before the Clerk of the Crown says, ""You shall well and truly try."" Judge CRAMPTON. - We refuse the application. After several challenges, both on the part of the Crown and the prisoner, Edward Evans was called. By Mr. BUTT. - I live in Nassau-street, and am fruiterer to the Lord-Lieutenant. Judge CRAMPTON. - That won't prevent you challenging him peremptorily, Mr. Butt. Mr. BUTT. - We challenge for cause. Judge CRAMPTON. - That is no cause. The effect would be, if allowed, that every tradesman of the Lord-Lieutenant would be disqualified, and he could not deal with the shopkeepers of Dublin. Put in your challenge, if you like. Mr. BUTT, after a very short delay, put in a formal challenge upon the ground stated. Judge CRAMPTON. - This challenge would make the prosecution appear a private one at the suit of the Lord-Lieutenant. The ATTORNEY-GENERAL having demurred, Mr. BUTT proceeded to contend that Mr. Evans could not exercise his office of juror conscientiously, owing to the pressure his official capacity might have upon him. The ATTORNEY-GENERAL. - We would not waste time on such a point but for the bad attendance of jurors; however, I will not press to have Mr. Evans sworn. Judge CRAMPTON. - Very well; and your acquiescence is not to be considered as a precedent. The challenge was then withdrawn, and Mr. Evans was desired to stand by. George Austin called. Mr. BUTT. - We challenge this gentleman for cause. Triers having been sworn, Charles Barber was examined, and swore, that on the first occasion the prisoner was tried he heard Mr. Austin say outside the court-house (alluding to one of the jurors, a Mr. Birmingham), that he would find no verdict, and get absolution for 13d. (Laughter.) The SOLICITOR-GENERAL. - The witness overheard, he says, one gentleman speaking to another. Mr. Austin. - I suppose I cannot make any observation? Judge TORRENS. - You had better not at present. The ATTORNEY-GENERAL. - There is no evidence, my Lord, to support the challenge. Judge CRAMPTON. - I will tell the triers, &c., there is nothing to show that Mr. Austin will not give a just and proper verdict. Mr. BUTT contended that what Mr. Austin said (which was not denied) was certainly evidence to show his feelings towards the prisoner. The ATTORNEY-GENERAL. - If the case is to go to the triers I will examine Mr. Austin. George Austin sworn. - I heard Barber's evidence, and I can't charge my recollection as to having used the sentiments he imputes to me; but I have no ill feeling to Mr. O'Doherty, and, even if I said it, it would have no influence on me as a juror The ATTORNEY-GENERAL. - As Mr. Austin is in doubt whether he used these words or not, I will let him stand by. The following are the names of the jury as sworn: - Thomas Clarendon, Great Brunswick-street; Thomas Read Milliken, 4, Parliament-street; George Bowles, 1, Lower Ormond-quay; Isaac Farrell, 210, Great Brunswick-street; Joseph Kirk, 22, Jervis-street; Thomas Figgis, 22, Abbey-street; Maurice Brooks, 70, Middle Abbey-street; William Frazer, 37, Arran-quay; James Charles, 61, Mary-street; William Dunbar, 1, Dawson-street; David Foster, 24, Ormond-quay; Richard Connell, 54, Anne-street. The prisoner was then given in charge of the jury, for having, after the passing of the Crown and Government Security Act, viz., on the 1st of July last, devised and intended to deprive the Queen of her Royal style, title, honour, &c., and did express such intentions by publishing numerous articles in the Irish Tribune newspaper, of which he was the registered proprietor, entitled, ""Our Harvest Prospects,"" ""Courage,"" &c. The ATTORNEY-GENERAL then rose to state the case for the prosecution, which has been published fully on the two former trials. It was but right, observed the learned gentleman) that he should inform the jury that the prisoner had already been tried by two juries of his countrymen, and that on both occasions the juries had disagreed as to his guilt. He should remark that the evidence given upon the first of these two trials was not precisely the same as was given on the second; but the evidence adduced for the Crown on the second trial was substantially similar to that which would be given in the present investigation. Now, no one could entertain a more sincere respect than he did for the opinions of a jury; and if he found, when engaged in the discharge of his official duty, that one, two, or three jurors only had come to a conclusion that the prisoner was guilty, he would certainly not have put him on his trial a second time; but such, he had reason to believe, was not the case; and his present impression was, that they had then an opportunity of considering with greater care than before a new doctrine, which was propounded at the last commission, and, if possible, effect a final settlement of the law which related to the responsibility of newspaper proprietors. Under these circumstances, he felt it to be his duty to submit the case of Mr. O'Doherty to a third jury, in order to ascertain whether, under the direction of the Court, they could have any doubt whatever that he was not only legally but morally guilty of the offence with which he was charged. The learned gentleman then defined at some length the state of the law as applicable to the proprietors of newspapers, and contended that the prisoner, as one of the proprietors of the Irish Tribune, should be held responsible for every article published in that paper. On this subject, however, he called on them to receive the law as it would be stated to them by the Court, and to place no reliance upon any legal definition that might be given to them by himself or the counsel for the prisoner, except it was in perfect conformity with the opinion of the Court. Of matters of fact, however, he should at the same time inform them, they (the jury) were the sole judges, and they alone were competent to draw inferences from the facts proved in evidence. The learned counsel then stated that the publications for which the prisoner had been indicted consisted of five distinct articles, which appeared in two consecutive numbers of the Irish Tribune, published on the 1st and 8th of July, entitled as follows: - ""Our Harvest Prospects,"" ""Courage,"" ""A Lesson from the Insurrection of Paris,"" and two other articles, each headed, ""Our War Department."" Having read through all these articles, and having commented upon various passages contained in them, the Attorney-General, in conclusion, proceeded to observe, that so far as himself was concerned, he entertained no personal feelings of hostility towards the prisoner, and that, whatever any portion of the public might think to the contrary, he was resolved to discharge the duty he owed to his Sovereign to the satisfaction of his own conscience. With respect to any expressions that might be used towards him for the part he had taken in any of the state prosecutions which he had found it necessary to institute, he could only say that there existed in his own mind no feeling of hostility to the writers of any newspapers, and he looked forward with confidence to the good sense of the public to justify him in every step he had taken in the discharge of the duties of his office. It was necessary, also, to mention that when the case was tried for the first time before the Lord Chief Baron at the last commission, the only evidence given upon the part of the Crown consisted of the mere publication of the newspapers themselves by the prisoner, as a responsible proprietor of the Tribune, and that under such circumstances it was quite impossible for the prisoner to prove that he was not, both in law and in fact, responsible for their contents. At that trial the Lord Chief Baron charged the jury and told them that the act of publication was to be regarded as prima facie evidence against the prisoner to show his intentions, unless it was rebutted or explained, but never laid it down that it was necessary to give proof that he was the actual writer or author of the articles in question. With every deference to the opinion of the Chief Baron, he (the Attorney-General) submitted that the offence charged against the prisoner was not the composition, but the publication of the documents given in evidence. He was charged with having compassed the deposition of the Queen, and with having intended to levy war against her; and the allegation made upon the part of the Crown was, that he evidenced these two intentions by publishing, not writing, certain articles. The learned gentleman, in support of his proposition, cited the cases of ""the King v. Walter,"" the proprietor of The Times newspaper, and ""the King v. Gutch, Fisher, and Alexander,"" with a view to satisfy the Court that the proprietor of a newspaper was both civilly and criminally answerable for the conduct of the servants or agents whom he employed to conduct his paper. The Attorney-General then referred to the manuscript of the article entitled ""Our Harvest Prospects,"" which he alleged to be in the prisoner's own handwriting, and drew the attention of the jury to the fact, with which the public are already acquainted, of the loss of one of the pages of the document. Having, in the next place, compared the imperfect manuscript with the printed article in the Tribune, the Attorney-General proceeded to remark, that the jury would themselves see the document, and would have an opportunity of examining it. It was impossible for him to say why the jury on the last trial had disagreed; but the learned counsel who defended the prisoner commented upon the circumstance that only one gentleman had been produced to swear to the handwriting of the prisoner. He (the Attorney-General) did not say that the prisoner was bound to produce his friends and relatives to disprove that the document was in his handwriting, but the identity of handwriting was a matter of opinion. The prisoner was a member of the medical profession; he served his time to Mr. Donovan, the chymist, Clare-street, and in that establishment a Mr. M'Keever also did business. That gentleman would be produced to identify the handwriting of the prisoner. Upon the last trial that gentleman deposed to his handwriting. He was the only person that would be produced to prove the handwriting in the manuscript ascribed to the prisoner; and he (the Attorney-General) said, unfeignedly and truly, that if a single witness conscientiously told him that he believed the document was not in the handwriting of the prisoner he should feel it to be his duty to produce him. Observations were made on the last trial in reference to the non-production of Mr. Donovan. If he (the Attorney-General) had believed that Mr. Donovan would be able to swear that the handwriting was not that of the prisoner he would have brought him forward as a witness, and he should not be taunted with the non-production of persons who might have been produced by the prisoner's counsel, if their evidence could serve him. Charles Vernon examined by the SOLICITOR-GENERAL. - Was registrar of newspapers in the Stamp-office. Knew the prisoner. Produced the certified copy of the certificate of the prisoner's proprietorship of the Tribune newspaper, and proved the signature of the prisoner to two publications of the paper (the 1st and 8th of July). Cross-examined. - Had no doubt about the handwriting. Luke Prender examined by Mr. O'BRIEN. - Was a sergeant of police. On the 8th of July went to the establishment of Mr. Purdon, on Bachelors'-walk; went there to apprehend Hoban, the registered printer of the Tribune. Made a search for papers. Got a great quantity of manuscripts and conveyed them to the Lower Castle Yard. Witness proved his signature to the articles ""Our Harvest Prospects"" - ""A Lesson from the Insurrection of Paris"" - ""Courage"" - and ""Our War Department."" These were portions of the papers which he found at the establishment on Bachelors'-walk. Cross-examined by Mr. O'HAGAN. - The warrant against Mr. Hoban did not authorize him to seize the papers. As to the law of the matter, he knew nothing, but howsomever he done it. (A laugh.) Michael M'Glinn, police-constable, 12 C, examined by the Hon. Mr. PLUNKET. - Proved having purchased a paper at the Tribune-office. Francis M'Keever examined. - Was in the employment of Mr. Donovan, chymist, Clare-street. The prisoner was serving his apprenticeship at the time that he was there. (Manuscript produced.) To the best of his opinion it was all in the handwriting of the prisoner. Cross-examined by Mr. BUTT. - Left Mr. Donovan's establishment about eight days ago. Thought he would return to it. Saw no reason to say that he would not return. His reason for leaving Mr. Donovan's was to keep out of the way from being examined. Slept in the Brazen Head Hotel, and during the day went to the country. Did not ask Mr. Connor for 5l. to leave town, but told him that he had not money to go away, otherwise he would go to Carrick-on-Suir. Met Mr. Connor in his yard by appointment, and he gave him 5l. to go out of town, and, as he already stated, he did go to the country every day, and slept in the hotel each night. Did tell Mr. Connor that he would go to Carrick-on-Suir, but as the money was not sufficient he did not go, but remained in the hotel, and went to the country in the daytime, as described. Could not tell what was Mr. Connor's impression as to whether he had or had not gone to Carrick-on-Suir. Never told Mr. Connor that the way he proved the handwriting was by comparing it with the writing in the shop book. Did not expect to gain anything by giving evidence against the prisoner. Mr. BUTT produced a letter which was written by witness to Mr. Connor, to whom it was addressed. Witness acknowledged that the letter was in his handwriting, and Mr. BUTT read the letter, which was as follows: - ""Brazen Head Hotel, Sunday Evening, Oct. 22, 1848. ""My dear Mr. Connor, - Not wishing to make my appearance in your neighbourhood, as there is a close look out for me, I intend to leave town in the evening till after the trial. I write to say that I shall feel particularly obliged to you if you take the trouble of, either directly or indirectly, as you may think prident, suggesting to Mr. O'Doherty's counsel or agent the propriety of abstaining from making any reference to me, tending to attaint my character. I have a right to claim this protection; for in adopting the course I have done, I assure you that I have consulted more my own feelings than my interest. Sincerely hoping that poor Mr. Doherty may be able to extricate himself from the fangs of the Attorney-General, I am, dear Mr. Connor. ""F. M'Keever."" Mr. BUTT (to witness). - Do you expect anything for giving evidence against the prisoner? Witness. - No. Do you think you had damaged yourself by going away? - No. What do you mean, then, by saying that you consulted your feelings more than your interest? - On the last trial there was a strong feeling against me, and it was very difficult for me to get a situation. Did you think you were losing a situation by going away? - I thought I did. Did you mean that it was your interest to come here? - It was not my interest. I did not mean to say that it was. Mr. Butt produced another letter, which had been written by the witness to Mr. Connor, and which was as follows: - ""Brazen Head, 2 o'clock, Oct. 27, 1848. ""Dear Mr. O'Connor. - I have just been released from the surveillance o' the police by the interference of a friend. I am here now, and will be the entire evening. I would be glad to see you; but if you had an objection to coming here, I would meet you at any time or place you would name. I am anxious to disabuse your mind from any unfavourable impression which the event of last night naturally may have made. I thought I used every precaution possible; but circumstances arose which rendered my return advisable, and I considered I could not locate myself in a more retired place than I at present occupy. I will be anxious to hear from you in the course of this evening; but rest assured that I have not acted in the transaction in any way that could with reason or justice be construed into duplicity. I entertain, I assure you, the same friendly feelings towards the party warned that I have always expressed to yourself. ""Yours very truly, ""F. M'KEEVER."" Mr. BUTT (to witness). - Did you not mean to convey to Mr. Connor that you had gone to Carrick-on-Suir, and circumstances had occurred which made your return advisable? Witness. - No. Cross-examination continued. - Heard that the prisoner was with Dr. Wilde after he left Dr. Donovan's. To Mr. BALDWIN. - Knew Mr. Connor 15 or 16 years; he was a builder. Charles Pemberton examined by the ATTORNEY-GENERAL. - I know the Policeman Prender. I am employed by the Commissioners of Police. Prender brought to me a quantity of papers, which he said he found in the Tribune-office. I delivered them to the Crown Solicitor. Cross-examined by Mr. BUTT. - (Manuscript papers of ""Our Harvest Prospects,"" and ""Our War Department,"" handed to witness.) - These are the papers given me by the Policeman Prender; some of the papers which I did not consider material I rejected, and did not forward to Mr. Kemmis; they were never out of my custody from the time I got them from Prender until I handed them to Mr. Kemmis. I cannot swear that they are in the same state now as when they were in my possession. I cannot swear that there was not another page of the document headed ""Our Harvest Prospects"" when it was in my possession. I cannot say the page was wanting when I first got the document. The Attorney-General then gave in evidence the following documents: - ""An attested copy of the declaration of proprietorship of 'The Tribune' newspaper, which was signed by Mr. O'Doherty, in the presence of Mr. Vernon, of the Stamp-office; the two copies of the 'Irish Tribune,' of the 1st and 8th July, containing the indicted articles, and signed by the prisoner; and the imperfect manuscript of the article entitled 'Our Harvest Prospects.'"" The case for the Crown closed here, and the Court adjourned to 10 o'clock this morning.",0FFO-1848-NOV01_Issue.xml

			*The CirAXmIAIf said he felt tome difficulty as to tho terms in which he ought to address them on this occasion. He would not cill them "" ladies and gentlemen ;"" he would not even address them by the kinder term "" friends "" but, fol- lowing the practice of a religious society with which he was connected, he would call them "" brethren and sisters."" (Hear, hear.) The objects of the society by which this meet. inz was convened were based on the Scriptural principle, "" Peace on earth and good-will to man."" Let those laugh who would, he was quite certain this principle wouild
			revail, and, while the laughers and scoffers would hereafter ba in derision, the friends of peace would be triumphant. (Cheers.) They were aware that, a ewy months 8go, it was thought desirable that a congress of the friends of peace should be held at Brussels. It was with great regret he stated that, although President of the Peace Society, he had been unible to attend that Congress; but he rejoiced to learn, even from the reports of the enemies of the cause, that that Congress had been a most decided movement in favour of the princiDles of peace. They were now assembled to receive the President and Vice. Presidents of the Brussels Congress, and to hear from them a report of its proceedings. Before those gentlemen ad- dressed them, however, Mlr. Scoble would give the meeting some information as to the arrangements and proceedings of the Congress.
			.iur. OCOBLE sald that. in complying with the request of the chairman, he would not dwell on the various pre. liminary arrangements which were made previously to the Brussels Congress. The original intention had been to hold the Congress at Paris, but circumstances to which it was unnecessary for him further to allude prevented that inten- tion from being carried out. An application was then made to the Belgian Government to allow the Ccngreso to be held in Bruassels. The reply of the Belgian Minister was, "" It is vwritten in the constitution of Belgium that public meetings are open not only to its citizens but to foreigners;"" and the Belgian Government afforded every facility in their power to promoto the comfort and conve- nionce of the members of the Congress. There were present at the Congress 130 gentlemen from England, who were ac- companied by about 40 English ladies; and 170 gentlemen from Belgium, France, Germany, and Italy. The Congress sat for two days, and held four sittings, at which resolutions were-with one or two exceptions-nnani- mouslg adopted, expressing their opinion that an appeal to arms for the purpose of deciding disputes among nations was a custom condemned alike by religion, justice, reason, and the best interests of the people; that the Governments of Europe and America should bo urged to introduce provisions into their treaties for settling national disputes byarbitration; and thatit was most important that a general national congress should be held for tho purpose of framing a well-digested and authoritative national code, as the unanimous adoption of such a code would be an effectual means of premoting universal peace. The Congress also urged the necessity of a general and simul'aneous disarmament, as a means of greatly diminishing the financial burdens which pressed upon this and other countries, and of promoting an inter- change of mutual good offices. Two important addresses were agreed upon by the ConRress-one to the Governments of the civilized Powers of Europe and America, and another to tho People of those continents. The address to the British Government vws presented yesterday to Lord John RusseU, b a deputation comprising M. Visschers, Ilr. Ewart, M.P.., Mr. E. Burritt, and M1r. Richards, who represented M. Bouvet. The noble lord received the deputation most courteously, and expressed himself in terms of the deepest interest in reference to movements of this kind, stating that he considered the great gathering at Brussels to be a means of promoting moderation and mutual kindness arong the people of Europe. (Hear, hear.) The noble lord also expressed himselrl in general terms, anxious to pre- mqte the peace of the world. ("" Hear,"" and cheers.) Sub- sequently to the Congress at Brussels letters hal been re- ceived from men distinguished for their ability and for their posiion in society in Italy, Germany, France, Denmark, Schles-ig-Holstein.. and other parts of Europe, expreasiang their anxiety to co-operate with t,he friends of peace in this country to promnote the settlement of national disputes

There was, in the neighbourhood in which he lived an Evangelical clergyman, who, iR speaking the other day on the question of peace and war, adrmitted that the prindiples of Christianity were destined ultimately to establish universal peace in the world. But how did this gentleman practically carry out his principles ? One of his sons vwas educated for the army and another for the navy. (Laughter and cheers.} If it was said 'that the objects of the Peace Sodety were im- practicable, he would remind the meeting that the diminu- tion of capital punishments, the abolition of slavery, and the proress of the temperance cause, had aU been declared impossile without great consequent evils; but wvith regard to all those subjects great Wrtmphs had bean achieved. and he had yet to learn that -iny inconvenience had resulted. (Hear.) He believed thb,t if there were more teetotaUers there would be fewer. soldiers. Mlilitary service had been called an honourMble -profession. Why the very mode that was resorted to in ori er to get a man into the profession was a most dishonours);le trick. A poor country fellow, when in a state of intox ation. was led to take a shillinee. and was thus
			ll;wuu TO uomo a servant of this wretched system; *and he was th4m required to take an oath, binding himself to do whleN,er his commanding oficer directed him to do, no MAatJerhow repugnant the duty mightbe tohisownconscien. t'Ycus feeling. (Hear.) There was a great delusion in the public miind as to the value of the possessions and territories which had been conquered or acquired by thia country. He would like to know what was the value of the Cape of Good Hope to this country? ("" Hear,"" and cheers.) Why, it cost us 1,000,000 . not long ago to put down the Caifres by war. (Cheers.) They were told it was for the interest of the in- habitants of the territories this country had aequired that they should retain those possessions. Now, suppose Louis Philippe had conquered this country a few years ago, who know but that the people might have been better off than they were now ? (Cheers and laughter.) It did not follow that people were always the worse og for be'g conquered. Bven savage nations would not murder in cold blood those who would not fight; and he thought they might be prettv well convinced that their neighbours on tho other side of the Channel would not take their lives in cold blood. (Hear, hear.) It might be said, however, ""Well, but they will set up a government over us and tax us."" He (Mir. Rowly) would just ask the meeting whether there was any other country in the world that was ever taxed so hilbly as England ? (Loud cheers.) Supposing a Governiment was set up which the people did not like, there was a very easy way of
			gerang ra or 1i. tA laugg.) Their neighbours on the other side the Channel had got rid of their own Government, though they had made a sad mistake in resorting to physical force to gain their liberty; and he believed that the people of this country might easily get rid of any Government that did not auit them by exerting moral instead of physical force. (Heao, hear.) The great point to which they should look in order to advance their objects was to influencing public opinion. It was useless to find fault with the Go- vernmment ; the Government could not keep up an immense standing army if the people did not find the money. (Loud cheers.) To necomplish the objects of the Peace Society they must have recourse to that Christian inslruction which subdued the passions, and brought into subjection the pride and animosity of the human heart. He placed his cou- fidence upon Christianprinciple alone, and if the Clhljt^
			church in this country would consistently do itS dutv. if

			Dr. BQWLII-(, tI seconding the motion. observed, that it wa, n'. long since this isle was frighted from its propriety by the apprehension of an armed invasion. (A laugb.)
			ithin the last few days this metropolis had been invaded by hundreds of armed men. (Cheors and laughter.) But the English people had stretched out to them the hand of friend- ship, whioh had been cordidy received, and instead of ene- mies they had been recognized as brethren. (Cheers.) Only the day before yesterday he had met with some of the French National Guard, who were about to quit this country after theirvisit, and they said, "" We are delighted with'the wel- come Wehrok6 received;. we have skein what truebrotherhood is; France and Eingland are now allied for ever."" (Loud cheers.)' He (Dr. Bowring) was glad that the feeling of the English people had been so strongly manifested vhen a scoundrel called a soldier had the other day ventured to -commit a robbery- upon a member of the Na- tional Guard (hear, hear) - and he was sure that the indignation which had teen excited by that outrage was general throughout this country. He had been much struck by-the- circumstance that whilo they disarmed their owvn soldiery when not on duty, such was their confidence in tbeir French brethren that they had been allowed to walk the streets of the metropolis with their swords and bayonets, andnot a: word of reproach had been uttered against them.

			-M!.VYsscnsvwas then introduced to the meeting,aws re6eliVdwith loud cheerng.. He delivered a brief address in tEieFrenchlanguage, which was interpreted byDr. Bow-
			rn.After expressing his'regret at the absence of M. Bouvet (who was'unable to ittend in consequence of serious illness) and of the Baron Suringar he' observed that, al- tlhough a stranger inihat hall, he felt himself surrounded by friends.. He consioemed it, a privilege to be the repre. sentative on that occaaion of the 'Congress over which ha- presided %t- J;rpels; .'andd h beggedT also to ,express his- great. 'ati.fction at the kindness and courtesg. ith uhi.ch he, and the deputation whom ihe accompanied, Jhad been re,ei~ed yesterday by the Prime 'Minister of England. (EHeit; hear.) He- tHighit be allowed' to remind the meeting of a great maxim, that no man could do justice to hirnself-tbat no man ought to be the avenger of ni3 onnu wrongs; ana ho wished to see that x im,
			iuougua tua ;juswce naa never neen done to thepress of this countryr - lIe hoped to see the gentlemen of th pre?s rising
			h,gher and higher in the gocial scale (bear, hear); but in no way could that result be secured more than by their advanc- ing every noble course, anLd doing all in their power to ele- vate and purify the masa of mankind. (Hear.) He hoped to find the sympathy which had been experienced from the press of the continent supported by the sympathy of the press here. (Hear, hear.) He trusted that this appeal would be responded to by the people of this countrv. (Hear.) They had delighted to honour, even in uniform, the pacific invader (hear, bear). who seemed to constitute a sort of gentle caricature of that invasion which was predicted some monthg ago (hear, hear), when our illustrious Duke was re- presented to us eyeing the opposite ceast with a glass of sin- gular power. (A laugh.) Let the heart of England be set on universal peace; let us hold forth the arms of universal brotherhood, and set a bright example, which the rest of the nations would finally follow. (Cheers.)
			Mr. B. BuurrTT, who was received with much cheering, said that there seemed to be a sentiment ab:oad, a latent thought permeating slowly the minds of the most depressed of the world's population, whispering its bright promise in the ear of dejected labour, and sometimes even giving to the slave a song in the burning hours of his unrequited toil-a thought that was helping millions of the poor to bear the pressure of their poverty-"" There's a good time coming."" (Cheera ) There was in every Christian community an im- presaion that we were approachine one of the grand realitiea in the destiny of humanity predicted by the ancient pro- phets artd poets: the youngest of the listening thousands present might not live to enter upon the fruition of that reality, but when it should come. they who should see it would attest that it was not a fortuitous condition into which humanity stumbled in tho progress of its genius, but a condition prenared for mankind before the foundation of the world. (Hear, hear.) Whatever that glorious day might bring to the future ages of the race, they who should possess its goodly realities would confess that they -were all embraced in the condition described by the prophets, ""Noation should not lift up saword against nation,"" when ""their officers should bo peace and their exacters righteous- i ness."" (Hear, he ir.) The advent of that day w.s not a new.born illuion of modern fancy; it was secured to the world by the unwavering verities of the word of God, and there were before us principles which secured it-principlesof great antiquity, principles that had lasted the years of God- 'If thine enemy hunger, feed him ;"" ""'resist not evil,"" but
			""overcomne evil with good ;"" ""love your enemies ""' ""they that take the sword, shall perish by the sword."" (Rlear, hear.) These principles, though long ""foolishness to the Greek,""were mighty, and would prevail: the principalities of earth should yet bow to the power of those princinles. The truth that "" God hath made of one blood all nationis of men,"" should yet be written upon all the standards of pe. pular progress, and before it the bestial emblems of nationality sbould hang their heads for shame. (Cheers.) Was it, in the middle of the 19th cen- tury. too early to issue from the verge of Waterloo, as the Congress did, an appeal to mankind to raise from the dust tha?t principle which had been trampled down by the demon of war? What fitter place could be chosen than the neigbhourhood of that spot on which was perpetrated the most stupendous fratricide that ever fillei the world with lamentation and woe ? (Hear, hear.) One could almost fancy, when the congress wats deliberating, that there were plaintive voices coming up from that field as from a world of
			moaning spirits, sighing in the midst, "" God hath made of 1 one: blood all nations of men,"" and pleading trumpet- tongued to have that great truth preached abroad over the

			The Rev. J. BURaNXT, of Camberwell. in seconding the resolution, alluded to the visit of the French National Guards, who had come among us, and were heartily wel- come; they came with their swords at their sides-it was an old habit-and we redeived them without any. (Hear, hear.) It was pretended that the French were our natural enemies. Did the worthy gentleman on the platform (M. Jousselin) look like a natural enemy? (Laughter.) A nation just at our elbow-one would say it was rather our natural friend. (Hear, hear.) Were we always readv to say that the owner of the next shop to our own was our natural enemy? What a curious place Cheapside must be, then, fuU of natural enemies! (A laugh.) There might be fair and honourable rivalry, but surely not natural enmity. (Hear, hear.) France, the nearest of nations, was naturally our first cousin; the others were cousins more removed. ("" Hear, hear,"" and a laugh.) Nations would learn by-and-by never to employ the logic of kings, the sword or the cannon. He (Rev. Mr. Burnet) expectea the time when nations would tell sovereigns, if they spoke of war,-"" We don't want to fight for ourselves, and we won't fight for you (hear, hear); and if the people you are raising against us should come to us and aive ug s-nth-r Rnvorei9n
			You will have yourselves to blame for the change."" (Laujbh. tet and cheers.)
			The resolution was carried unanimously.
			M. JoussEAnni then rose, and was greetea with loud cheers, and a cry of ""1Vive la P7rance.""1 He begged, for hiimself, and on behalf of his companions, to return his thanks to the English people for the kind reception they had
			exeonced. "" You.' ""said M. Joussselin, ""are capital good fellow._ (Loud laughter.) If I were not a Frenchman, I woud be an Englishman (renewed laughter, and cheers); and I can assure you that Frenchmaen will love you like brothers."" (""Hear, hear,"" and cheers.) He hoped the effect of the recent intercourse which had taken place be- tween the people of the two countries would be tia establish an enduringunion between England and France. (Cheers.)

(Hear, hear.) ADmong his earliest testimonies in favour-of-the pacific principle, he bad published a work against individual duelling, and he felt himself now called to a higher mission, and to do what he could to prevent the duel3 of nations.

(HIear, bear.) If the congress had been as. aUed by that species oF attack which (it had been said) not even the philosopher could scorn, it was a laugh which the Chriatian would not only forgive, but hope to see converted into sympathy.

(Hear.) He hadi been sorry to see so many fresh militqry honours heaped upon Prince Albert, and he thought that, in the course of time, they might very modestly, but with very great pro. priety, express a national wish that the Queen, her Royal Consort, and all the Royal Family, should array themseves on the side of peace, aud not upon that of war. (Hear.)
			Mr, J. STURGE, wyho seconded the motion, announced that at a meeting of ""Friends of Peace"" that moning, it had been resolved to have, if possible, a far more effective conference next year at some place on the continent, and, if their French friends would' allow them, they would meet next August in PAris.

A public meeting of the ""Friends of Peace"" was held last night in Exeter-hall, to receive the President and Vice Presidents of the late Peace Congress at Brussels, and to hear a report of the proceedings at that Congress. The hall, galleries, and platform were crowded, and a very large proportion of the audience were of the male sex. The chair was taken at 6 o'clock by Mr. C. Hindley, M.P., and we observed upon the platform M. Visschers, Councillor to the Belgian Government, and President of the late Peace Congress at Brussels; Dr. Bowring, M.P.; Mr. W. Ewart, M.P.; Mr. E. Burritt, Lord Beresford, and Sir W. Lawson, Bart. M. F. Bouvet, Member of the French National Assembly, and Baron Suringar, of Holland, who had taken part in the proceedings at Brussels, and whose presence had been expected at this meeting, were unable to attend. Shortly before the commencement of the proceedings a gentleman in the uniform of the French National Guard, fully accoutred, and wearing side-arms, who stood at the back of the platform, was observed by the audience in the hall, and was greeted with loud cheering. He was invited to come forward, and took his seat in the first row on the platform, amid renewed applause. He was announced to the meeting as M. Jousselin, deputy of the Procureur of the French Republic. The CHAIRMAN said he felt some difficulty as to the terms in which he ought to address them on this occasion. He would not call them ""ladies and gentlemen;"" he would not even address them by the kinder term ""friends;"" but, following the practice of a religious society with which he was connected, he would call them ""brethren and sisters."" (Hear, hear.) The objects of the society by which this meeting was convened were based on the Scriptural principle, ""Peace on earth and good will to man."" Let those laugh who would, he was quite certain this principle would prevail, and, while the laughers and scoffers would hereafter be in derision, the friends of peace would be triumphant. (Cheers.) They were aware that, a few months ago, it was thought desirable that a congress of the friends of peace should be held at Brussels. It was with great regret he stated that, although President of the Peace Society, he had been unable to attend that Congress; but he rejoiced to learn, even from the reports of the enemies of the cause, that that Congress had been a most decided movement in favour of the principles of peace. They were now assembled to receive the President and Vice-Presidents of the Brussels Congress, and to hear from them a report of its proceedings. Before those gentlemen addressed them, however, Mr. Scoble would give the meeting some information as to the arrangements and proceedings of the Congress. Mr. Scoble said that, in complying with the request of the chairman, he would not dwell on the various preliminary arrangements which were made previously to the Brussels Congress. The original intention had been to hold the Congress at Paris, but circumstances to which it was unnecessary for him further to allude prevented that intention from being carried out. An application was then made to the Belgian Government to allow the Congress to be held in Brussels. The reply of the Belgian Minister was, ""It is written in the constitution of Belgium that public meetings are open not only to its citizens but to foreigners;"" and the Belgian Government afforded every facility in their power to promote the comfort and convenience of the members of the Congress. There were present at the Congress 130 gentlemen from England, who were accompanied by about 40 English ladies; and 170 gentlemen from Belgium, France, Germany, and Italy. The Congress sat for two days, and held four sittings, at which resolutions were - with one or two exceptions - unanimously adopted, expressing their opinion that an appeal to arms for the purpose of deciding disputes among nations was a custom condemned alike by religion, justice, reason, and the best interests of the people; that the Governments of Europe and America should be urged to introduce provisions into their treaties for settling national disputes by arbitration; and that it was most important that a general national congress should be held for the purpose of framing a well-digested and authoritative national code, as the unanimous adoption of such a code would be an effectual means of promoting universal peace. The Congress also urged the necessity of a general and simultaneous disarmament, as a means of greatly diminishing the financial burdens which pressed upon this and other countries, and of promoting an interchange of mutual good offices. Two important addresses were agreed upon by the Congress - one to the Governments of the civilized Powers of Europe and America, and another to the people of those continents. The address to the British Government was presented yesterday to Lord John Russell, by a deputation comprising M. Visschers, Mr. Ewart, M.P., Mr. E. Burritt, and Mr. Richards, who represented M. Bouvet. The noble lord received the deputation most courteously, and expressed himself in terms of the deepest interest in reference to movements of this kind, stating that he considered the great gathering at Brussels to be a means of promoting moderation and mutual kindness among the people of Europe. (Hear, hear.) The noble lord also expressed himself, in general terms, anxious to promote the peace of the world. (""Hear,"" and cheers.) Subsequently to the Congress at Brussels letters had been received from men distinguished for their ability and for their position in society in Italy, German, France, Denmark, Schleswig-Holstein, and other parts of Europe, expressing their anxiety to co-operate with the friends of peace in this country to promote the settlement of national disputes by arbitration.",0FFO-1848-NOV01_Issue.xml

RECTORY OF BISHOP WEARMOUTH.-It is generally,News,",RECrORY OF BISHOP WnAaMOUTIr.-It is generally reported at Sunderland that the Rev. John Patrick Eder', N.A., Perpetual Curate of Bishop Auckland (son-in-lavw te Lord Brougham), will be preferred by the Bishop of Durhara, the patront, to the Tery important and valuable reetory of Bishop Wearmouth, now vacant by the diath of the IHon. ani Rev. Dr. Wellesley. It is expected that this very extensive and wealthy rectory, which is of the gross yearly value of at least 4,2001., will be constitated into several district rectories, among wbich will pe the present curacies of S,. Thomas, Bishop Weanmouth, Deptford, Hylton, and Rynope, with an augmentstion of income to the respective incum- benb. It is likewise thought that the rectory of Suan- dqrland_vUlb. augmented in value from the funds of '13 shop Wearmoith rectory-a. proceeding which will b!$ only ukict!jus8ce, for when Sunderland was separated 1rW armoqth, ahd made. an independent rectory, in 1701, it obtained thd.heav!est portion of the parochial duties, with-; cit any income to support the rector except the fees. In tl,is case the just claim of Sunderland cannot well be over- lopked. . To promote this arrangement a meeting of the ancient vestry of Sunderland was held on WVednesday, at wpich it was agreed to memorialize the bishop of the diocese td take a'vatiage of the present vacancy in the rectory of B|shop Wemoth to mrke, either from that orfrom some otpher source, addid onal provision for the spiritual require-. m,entsof The>siater parish. The memorial referred to em- bqdies the feelings of the entire town and di trict, aud ex- ptesses a hope that his Lordship will be able to attend to its L1DAY.-Great improvements are Idkg at the OuUdhal, to increase the convenienee of the c mpany at the approaching Lo,rd Mayor's Day, it being in- teaded to open a new entrauce through the courts to afford a etter access to the hall, gnd also to give greater accom- * dation and *protection from -any coil wind while waiting

For several successive market days manufacturers showed an increasing desire to do business at lower rates. The feeling has, however, become general that the depression has spent itself, and higher rates are now everywhere demanded. Buyers are freely offering the prices which last week they refused. Most low goods are a little advanced, and others may be quoted as firm. Cloths are selling at higher prices than last week. Yarns are firmer, but not much improved in price. There is a considerable business being done for the Levant and the Italian states. The market yesterday was considerably influenced by the firmer tone at Liverpool on Saturday and Monday last. The prospects of trade generally were decidedly better yesterday than for some weeks past. THE MURDER NEAR SEVENOAKS. - On Monday the woman who was found murdered on the 8th ult. in a field near Halstead, in Kent, was identified as Sarah Freeman, wife of Richard Freeman, who formerly kept the Royal Exchange public-house, at Dover, and who was subsequently employed on the Eastern Counties Railway as a taskmaster, and at the Bank of England as a carpenter. The deceased had been separated from her husband several years, and during that time has travelled the country with a man with whom she cohabited. Mr. Carter adjourned the inquest, opened at the Cook Inn, Halstead, till Friday. - Sun.",0FFO-1848-NOV01_Issue.xml

The official journals contain a decree calling toge- ther the electoral colleges for the 13th of November, to fill up-42 vacancies which. at present exist in the Chamber of Deputies, preparatory-to the opening of Parliament on the 30th. The same papers continue to display great bitterness at the position taken by the French and English Ade7irals, and atothe fact that the mediation undertaken by thetu, and formally refused by the Neapolitan Governmentb ghould be allowed to continue an obstacle to the war. The news of the insurrection at Vienna reached Naples on the 19th, and produced a strong sensationj the funds having immediately gone to 83k, which was a decline of 2 per cent. At the departure of these advices all was quiet, and nothing new had occurred with regard to
			The Vienna news reached Palermo on the 21st of October, and was received with the most exciting in- terest, in the hope that it would have considerable inflaence in leading to an adjustment of their own cause, and of the general affairs of Italy.
			Subjoined are the fluctuations in Consols and Railway shares during the past month. It will be observed that North-lVestern, after having declined 10 per cent., are now at an advance of 8 per cent. upon the quotation at the commencement. The effect of the recent rally upon other descriptions seems to have been on the average to place them slightly in advance of the prices at which they stood on the 1st of the month:-
			The following are the railway cals for November, amounting to 1,176,8621. Ill the corresponding month of last year the total was 2,042,7181.:-
			A further dividend,which will probably amount to about 4d. in the pound,was declared to-day at the Court of Bankruptcy under the joint estate of Whit- more, Wells, and Co., bankers.
			The Dutch papers, referring to the financial mea- sures under the consideration of the Government, mention that a project of law was to be biought for- ward authorizing a transfer of 500,000 forins to the budget of 1849, voted, but not employed, in 1848 for the amelioration of the monetary system. Advices from Java to the 26th of August had reached the Hague. The inhabitants were suffering from the late severe inundations. A resolution had been passed by the Netherland Indian authorities, impos- ing a duty of 24 per cent. upon all articles of per- fumery introduced into Java, Madura, and the ports on the coast of Surinam; except those of Netherland origin, and imported byNetherland vessels, in Wvhich case tke. duty will be only 12 per cent.

Shipping continued over-abundant, and freights for the Channel had further declined. The latest rate of exohange was 23 , firm, with a ten- dency to advance. Coffee was quoted from 2$000 to 2$600, according to quality. ates from Londoa had been received down to the 13th of July.

They, however, contain a favour- able recommendation on the part of the committee appointed to investigate the question of the railway sy6tem in connexion with the colony, awnd various suggestions for promoting the construction of a line.

The ordinary roads have been rendered impassable. On the branch lines of the Eastern Counties, from Ely to Peterborough and beyond, the arable and meadow lands are two and three feet under water for six and seven miles around, so that viewed from a train in transit, the country presents nothing but a vast sheet of water, from which neither the canals nor the rivers can be distinguished. The farmers alongside the railway are to be seeing ferrying themselves in boats from field to field and farm to farm. Many acres of oats and barley, mowed and umowed, are surrounded with water, and this in Cambridgshire and Lincolnshire is expected to render the crops below the average. An ingenious method has been resorted to on the Eastern Counties to mitigate the effect of the mass of water, by placing little breakwaters of wood at the bottom of embankments, but in spite of these precautions, the line between Swavesy and St. Ives has been overflowed and the traffic temporarily suspended. Although the Great Northern runs parallel with the Witham Navigation, and almost on a level, it has not suffered from the overflowing. The line affected most has been the Northampton and Peterborough branch of the London and North-Western, where a bridge or two has been washed down and the mail trains detained. The rails of the South-Eastern have been covered by the overflowings of the Stour, near Canterbury; and those of the Great Western, a short way above Reading.",0FFO-1848-NOV01_Issue.xml

"London, Wednesday, November 1, 1848.",Editorial,"LOYDON, WEDArBSDAY, NOVETEMBER 1, 1848.
			It will be news to anybody in this kingdom to be told that he pays no taxes. If there is one thing necessary to the idea of an Englishman- it there is one point of feUow feeling between all classes of the community, it is that, in some form or other, or rather in a thousand forms, and a thousand others besides, they all contribute to HER M&jsry's Exchequer. SIDNEY SMITH ran through the career of an Englishman from the cradle to the grave, and found that the tax-gatherer had been -everywhere before him. If the bright oasis could be found in these isles safe from the intrusion of the universal scourge, all men would rush into it. The *nly thing that makes us bear the evil is its universal and inevitable character. There is a certain propor- Lion appointedto us all. Theknave,who in the goodold days of justice and decorum was whipped through the town at the cart's tail, tried in vain to procure a more comfortable distribution of his fifty lashes. Whether the operator aimed high or low, or on this side or on that, it was impossible to please the fastidious gentleman. Nothing would satisfy him. We are inclined to think, too, that the broader the back the greater breadth of chastisement does it receive. Notwithstanding what the poet says, we suspect that in the matter of taxes the giant suffers more than the beetle. At least we never knew a wealthy man who did not talk ruefully of taxes.
			It is, then, with extreme astonishment that we findin a tract, or rather a handbil, by the Financial Reform Association, the following passage:-
			""On a careful examination of the sources whence tho public in-ome is derived, the Association aro astonished to find how completely the taxation is laid on the trade and industry of the ceuntry. Contrasted with tho amounts of the expendi- ture, it divides the commnunity into two diltinct classes, one, those who pay-the other, thosc ?wlho srpot, the tacmes. The jorter comprises the grcat mass of the popnt&ation, all who Ub.our a?d pronete the wealth of the nation7; the other, the fatwored few, wcho from accident of birth or con.texions, arc
			cempt from the necessity of toil; and wvho seem, on that acqount (for no other reason can be discovered in the exami- nation of these documents but tho fact that such is the exEmption) to be rliOeved from the duty of contributing their fair and proportionate amount to the pecuniary require. ments of the State.""
			Uwe could, see the subject through the optics of qS writer some of us might live and die under the Veii%ig illusion that we pay no taxes. Unfortu- Ipwy, -however, experience would supply a painful c0di~t~otion, But the writer, it seems, does not tnie , wlit he says. Having put his best leg fore- float jii the shape of a bouncinog assertion, he pro- ceeds to explain that trade and industry pay all te iadirect taxes, and property all the direct; vhich latter, he says, are only a trifle.
			That there may be no mistake on this point, he eaumerates aU the items of taxation which he con- silers indirect, and assigns them to industry and ?traie, leaving a small remainder to be borne *t- ptoperty. * The result of this classification is -bt the man' of property pays no customs, no pro J31te and legacy dutios, nQ dgty on insurance, no d0t on bRk ntoles, UQ newspaper or, advertse-ment
			duty, no duty on coaches posting, hired carriages, or railroads,no postage, and not a farthing of the casual and supplemental expenditure which taxation brings on the country. He not only does not con- tribute to these taxes personally and formally, but not even virtually or effectually. He does not pay one single penny postage, or one farthing on Iis claret, his coffee, or his tea. This blessed invulnerability to the shafts of taxation he owes to the simple faot of his possessing I property.,
			He is one of "" the favoured few who from accident of ""birth or connezions are exempt from the necessity
			of toil.' Customs and Excise reach not this con- seorated caste. Like the deities of EPICURUS, they dwell in an atmosphere of their own, independent and careless. To them the earth is free, and its fruits are cheap. The East and West Indies vie for the honour of supplying their wants at cost price. China pours her grateful products into their lap; Ocean casts his wealth at their feet. For them the ground yields her pro- duce without a second curse. But for a few tri- fling honoraria which the State ventures to ask in an easy and dignified form, it might be supposed they were some higher order of beings who vouchsafed to walk the earth and talk with men, and from whom we felt a pride in concealing the chief burdens of our condition. Such men must be worth knowing. We should like to see one. Will the financial re- formers of Liverpool introduce us to an individuat of the species?
			Hitherto our own lot-has been cast in so different a sphere that we have never yet seen or heard of such a being, nor even read of him, till this moment. We know a gentleman of 1o,0001. a-year from land and collieries, not only free from incumbrances but pleasingly associated with the savings of a long minority. Unfortunately he perspires at every pore with indirect taxation. He drinks wine, spirits, ale, porter, tea, coffee, and sugar. So do his friends. So do his servants. So do his tenants. So do the labourers on his farms, and so do the colliers in his pits. He has just built a house and several farmhouses. His bricks are taxed, and so is his timber. He complains of his tradesmen's biUs. They answer that they are so heavily taxed that they cannot afford to charge him less. He has fur- nished his house. His paper, his carpet, his nm3hogany and rosewood tables and chairs, his new service of plate, have all contributed to the revenue. Knowing the expense of building, he is careful to insure his house, and pays a cent. per cent. duty on the insurance. His joint-stock bank charges a - percent. on every farthing of his that passes through their hands. He thinks it too high, and they plead the heavy duty on their notes, besides other ex- penses. His lawyer's bill contains heavy items for stamps. He takes in a London paper and half-a dozen country ones. On every one he sees the red imprint of the exciseman. He advertises his farms, his pits, and his coals, and pays eighteen- pence to the Crown for every advertisement. lHe goes about a good deal on the rail, and often
			u:ua -v; b1,1uL-uu:r& Linow muon iower iares are on the Continent. The station-olerks answer with'an allasion to taxes. He comes up to London and falls out with the cabmen. They give the same answer. He makes every tradesman give him a receipt. They take it out in one shape or another. He writes and receives many letters, some of them with heavy enclosures; his wife has a hundred cor- respondents, and thinks the penny post a conve- nient thing for small parcels ; in fact a pound's worth of stamps goes in no time. Besides al this he pays on French clocks, bronzes, and furniture, on foreign velvets and silks, on writing paper, and in- numerable etceteras. But wherever he goes he finds the social atmosphere thick with taxation. His men strike, his tenants fall into arrears, his oustomers get into the Gazette, his tradesmen are extortionate, his wife expensive-all on the plea of taxation. Everything is so high. There is nothing to be done without paying in this -country. ""Live and let ""live."" That is if you wish to make your way in a taxed country you must pay everybody's taxes in addition to vlinr nwrn.
			Now, of course we do not for a moment suppose that our friend belongs to the class described by the Liverpool reformers as possessing property and pay- ing only a few direct taxes. It is true that he is a landlord, and exercises no industry nor trade, except when his farms or his pits happen to be thrown on his hands; and it is also true that he pays direct taxes. He pays, for example, 3001. a-year property tax. He pays 1,0001. a-year to the poor rates, chiefly for the relief of manufacturers out of wofic and Irishmen on the tramp. He pays highway rate, church rate, police rate-the first and last to some extent. His architect being a man of taste has saddled him and his heirs with a hundred windows of all sizes; so his window tax is no trifle. His carriages, horses, and servants pay accumulated duties. His dogs pay their quota. He also pays a modicum of "" land tax,"" not quite so burdensome as if his property lay further south. He spends part of the season in London, and pays handsomely for the use of a furnished house, but is told that the proprietor of the house is still out of pocket through the quantity of rates and taxes he has to pay on al sides. The poor's rate alone is annually 2s. 8d. in the pound. We had almost forgotten some trifles. Our friend took a University degree and paid several heavy stamps. He pays something, also, for the privilege of sealing his letters with the figure of apole- cat. So there can be no doubt that he pays direct taxes to a fearful extent. But, as we have shown above,he also pays indirect taxes to an equally fearful extent. Thus at any rate it is quite impossible he can be of the class of persons alluded to by the Liverpool reformers. What renders it still more impossible is, that he does not owe his position at all to birth or connexions, having no more acquaintance with a Lord than he has with the Great Turk, and is a man of honest mercantile parentage. But what seems the oddest thing of all, is that so far from sticking up for the immunities of property he is a financial reformer, he has joined the League, and at this moment is fully persuaded that he would be a much richer man if indirect taxation were abolished altogether and a well regulated property tax imposed in its stead.
			The finanoial reformers of Liverpool will perceive our quandary. We cannot for the life of us imagine the class they describe-at least we can imagine it, just as we can a sea serpent; but we have never yet had the pleasure of seeing it. In a toler- ably wide experience of Fngland we do not know a single person who comes near to the description which they assume to be one of the commonest and most prominent types in our social system. There is the Marquis of WEsT- MsnsR. He is a public man. Let's instance him. He has a large estate near Chester, and another in the metropolis. He, and his father before him, have paid 100,0001. duty on brioks, if they have paid a penny; and other indirect taxes in propottion.

It will be news to anybody in this kingdom to be told that he pays no taxes. If there is one thing necessary to the idea of an Englishman - if there is one point of fellow feeling between all classes of the community, it is that, in some form or other, or rather in a thousand forms, and a thousand others besides, they all contribute to HER MAJESTY'S Exchequer. SIDNEY SMITH ran through the career of an Englishman from the cradle to the grave, and found that the tax-gatherer had been everywhere before him. If the bright oasis could be found in these isles safe from the intrusion of the universal scourge, all men would rush into it. The only thing that makes us bear the evil is its universal and inevitable character. There is a certain proportion appointed to us all. The knave, who in the good old days of justice and decorum was whipped through the town at the cart's tail, tried in vain to procure a more comfortable distribution of his fifty lashes. Whether the operator aimed high or low, or on this side or on that, it was impossible to please the fastidious gentleman. Nothing would satisfy him. We are inclined to think, too, that the broader the back the greater breadth of chastisement does it receive. Notwithstanding what the poet says, we suspect that in the matter of taxes the giant suffers more than the beetle. At least we never knew a wealthy man who did not talk ruefully of taxes. It is, then, with extreme astonishment that we find in a tract, or rather a handbill, by the Financial Reform Association, the following passage: - ""On a careful examination of the sources whence the public income is derived, the Association are astonished to find how completely the taxation is laid on the trade and industry of the country. Contrasted with the amounts of the expenditure, it divides the community into two distinct classes, one, those who pay - the other, those who spend, the taxes. The former comprises the great mass of the population, all who labour and produce the wealth of the nation; the other, the favoured few, who from accident of birth or connexions, are exempt from the necessity of toil; and who seem, on that account (for no other reason can be discovered in the examination of these documents but the fact that such is the exemption) to be relieved from the duty of contributing their fair and proportionate amount to the pecuniary requirements of the State."" If we could see the subject through the optics of the writer some of us might live and die under the pleasing illusion that we pay no taxes. Unfortunately, however, experience would supply a painful contradiction. But the writer, it seems, does not mean what he says. Having put his best leg foremost in the shape of a bouncing assertion, he proceeds to explain that trade and industry pay all the indirect taxes, and property all the direct; which latter, he says, are only a trifle. That there may be no mistake on this point, he enumerates all the items of taxation which he considers indirect, and assigns them to industry and trade, leaving a small remainder to be borne by property. The result of this classification is that the man of property pays no customs, no probate and legacy duties, no duty on insurance, no duty on bank notes, no newspaper or advertisement duty, no duty on coaches, posting, hired carriages, or railroads, no postage, and not a farthing of the casual and supplemental expenditure which taxation brings on the country. He not only does not contribute to these taxes personally and formally, but not even virtually or effectually. He does not pay one single penny postage, or one farthing on his claret, his coffee, or his tea. This blessed invulnerability to the shafts of taxation he owes to the simple fact of his possessing ""property."" He is one of ""the favoured few who from accident of ""birth or connexions are exempt from the necessity ""of toil."" Customs and Excise reach not this consecrated caste. Like the deities of EPICURUS, they dwell in an atmosphere of their own, independent and careless. To them the earth is free, and its fruits are cheap. The East and West Indies vie for the honour of supplying their wants at cost price. China pours her grateful products into their lap. Ocean casts his wealth at their feet. For them the ground yields her produce without a second curse. But for a few trifling honoraria which the State ventures to ask in an easy and dignified form, it might be supposed they were some higher order of beings who vouchsafed to walk the earth and talk with men, and from whom we felt a pride in concealing the chief burdens of our condition. Such men must be worth knowing. We should like to see one. Will the financial reformers of Liverpool introduce us to an individual of the species? Hitherto our own lot has been cast in so different a sphere that we have never yet seen or heard of such a being, nor even read of him, till this moment. We know a gentleman of 10,000l. a-year from land and collieries, not only free from incumbrances but pleasingly associated with the savings of a long minority. Unfortunately he perspires at every pore with indirect taxation. He drinks wine, spirits, ale, porter, tea, coffee, and sugar. So do his friends. So do his servants. So do his tenants. So do the labourers on his farms, and so do the colliers in his pits. He has just built a house and several farmhouses. His bricks are taxed, and so is his timber. He complains of his tradesmen's bills. They answer that they are so heavily taxed that they cannot afford to charge him less. He has furnished his house. His paper, his carpet, his mahogany and rosewood tables and chairs, his new service of plate, have all contributed to the revenue. Knowing the expense of building, he is careful to insure his house, and pays a cent. per cent. duty on the insurance. His joint-stock bank charges a 1/4 per cent. on every farthing of his that passes through their hands. He thinks it too high, and they plead the heavy duty on their notes, besides other expenses. His lawyer's bill contains heavy items for stamps. He takes in a London paper and half-a-dozen country ones. On every one he sees the red imprint of the exciseman. He advertises his farms, his pits, and his coals, and pays eighteen-pence to the Crown for every advertisement. He goes about a good deal on the rail, and often tells the station-clerks how much lower fares are on the Continent. The station-clerks answer with an allusion to taxes. He comes up to London and falls out with the cabmen. They give the same answer. He makes every tradesman give him a receipt. They take it out in one shape or another. He writes and receives many letters, some of them with heavy enclosures; his wife has a hundred correspondents, and thinks the penny post a convenient thing for small parcels; in fact a pound's worth of stamps goes in no time. Besides all this he pays on French clocks, bronzes, and furniture, on foreign velvets and silks, on writing paper, and innumerable etceteras. But wherever he goes he finds the social atmosphere thick with taxation. His men strike, his tenants fall into arrears, his customers get into the Gazette, his tradesmen are extortionate, his wife expensive - all on the plea of taxation. Everything is so high. There is nothing to be done without paying in this country. ""Live and let ""live."" That is if you wish to make your way in a taxed country you must pay everybody's taxes in addition to your own. Now, of course we do not for a moment suppose that our friend belongs to the class described by the Liverpool reformers as possessing property and paying only a few direct taxes. It is true that he is a landlord, and exercises no industry nor trade, except when his farms or his pits happen to be thrown on his hands; and it is also true that he pays direct taxes. He pays, for example, 300l. a-year property tax. He pays 1,000l. a-year to the poor rates, chiefly for the relief of manufacturers out of work and Irishmen on the tramp. He pays highway rate, church rate, police rate - the first and last to some extent. His architect being a man of taste has saddled him and his heirs with a hundred windows of all sizes; so his window tax is no trifle. His carriages, horses, and servants pay accumulated duties. His dogs pay their quota. He also pays a modicum of ""land tax,"" not quite so burdensome as if his property lay further south. He spends part of the season in London, and pays handsomely for the use of a furnished house, but is told that the proprietor of the house is still out of pocket through the quantity of rates and taxes he has to pay on all sides. The poor's rate alone is annually 2s. 3d. in the pound. We had almost forgotten some trifles. Our friend took a University degree and paid several heavy stamps. He pays something, also, for the privilege of sealing his letters with the figure of a pole-cat. So there can be no doubt that he pays direct taxes to a fearful extent. But, as we have shown above, he also pays indirect taxes to an equally fearful extent. Thus at any rate it is quite impossible he can be of the class of persons alluded to by the Liverpool reformers. What renders it still more impossible is, that he does not owe his position at all to birth or connexions, having no more acquaintance with a Lord than he has with the Great Turk, and is a man of honest mercantile parentage. But what seems the oddest thing of all, is that so far from sticking up for the immunities of property he is a financial reformer, he has joined the League, and at this moment is fully persuaded that he would be a much richer man if indirect taxation were abolished altogether and a well regulated property tax imposed in its stead. The financial reformers of Liverpool will perceive our quandary. We cannot for the life of us imagine the class they describe - at least we can imagine it, just as we can a sea serpent; but we have never yet had the pleasure of seeing it. In a tolerably wide experience of England we do not know a single person who comes near to the description which they assume to be one of the commonest and most prominent types in our social system. There is the Marquis of WESTMINSTER. He is a public man. Let's instance him. He has a large estate near Chester, and another in the metropolis. He, and his father before him, have paid 10,000l. duty on bricks, if they have paid a penny; and other indirect taxes in proportion. It is clear, therefore, that he cannot be the financial hippogriffin, or rather than unicorn, described by the Liverpool financiers as possessing property and paying a few direct taxes, but exercising no industry or trade, and entirely exempt from indirect taxation. We entreat them to satisfy an excusable curiosity. When they come further south, we hope and trust they will bring a specimen with them. We have a taste for curiosities. We saw the ""Sea Lioness"" the only day it was exhibited alive, and hope for rather better entertainment with the Liverpool monster.",0FFO-1848-NOV01_Issue.xml
The report of the REGISTRAR-GENERAL for the,Editorial,"The report of the RHGiSTRAR-GzNE:AL for the week ending the 28th of Ootober, although insuffi- cient tojustify alarm with regard to the condition of the public health, is essentiaUy suggestive of pre- cautions. The mortality for the week is below the average; but still its tendency, taking it together with that reoorded in the returns for the last few weeks, is to show that disease in the metropolis is on the increase, not on the decline. The causes of death in the return of the REGISTRAR-GiENERAL are referred to seventeen categories, and in sixteen out of these the weekly record furnishes us with the most satisfactory result. The average mortality for the past week, calculated on the basis of the corre- sponding period during the last five years, stands at 1,154; during the past week there have occurred but 1,007 deaths in the metropolis from all causes.
			The diseases which have tended to raise the average to this point are four in number. Scarlatina has caused the deaths of 182 persons (of whom all but 3 are children under 15 years of age), against 47 in preceding years. Typhus has slain 74, in place of 50, its average prey. The deaths from smallpox are 47 (of whom 39 are children under 15 years of age), against 19; and, finally, from cholera 34 deaths are reported, in place of the unit which represents the average mortality from the disease at the present season of the year. The increase in the deaths from illnesses of a kindred character to cholera is so slight as not to justify anything like alarm. Diarrh""a stands for 38 against 21; dysentery for 8 against 5. On the whole, if we deduct from the total deaths for this week the increase upon those which have arisen from diseases peculiarly incidental to childhood-smaUpox and scarlatina-we obtain, as the comparative result of the week, 927 against 1,154. There is, no doubt, this degree of injustice in such a proportion-that the periods with which the comparison is made had their peculiar diseases as well as the pre- sent, and it is unfair to make a deduction in the one instance and not in the other. By such a com- parison we simply mean to enunciate a very obvious inference from the figures quoted,-that, but for the
			increased mortality amongst children, the compara- tive average is very satisfactory. The attention of the public is, of course, fixed but upon one disease, and it would be in vainto deny the presence of cholera in the metropolis. Concurrently, however, with this fact we find that other causes of death, those, for example, arising from tubercular iUness, diseases affecting the organs of respiration, &c., have re- ceived a severe check. Influenza has totaUy dis- appeared. There is then, we trust, if common precautions be ta.ken, no reason for alarm. AU, or nearly all, the facts yet known with regard to the presence of the cholera have a tendency to show that we are stronger than the disease if we will but avail ourselves of the means actually at our disposal. The fetid drain, the cesspool, the crowded convict-hulk,the damp, ill-ventilated abodes in which too many of the population pass their lives, the no- thoroughfare, the blind alley, and the dark, noisome cellar-these are the spots from which the cholera will start on its rounds. Grosvenor-square must care for Bermondsey; Belgravia can no longer think slightingly of Bethnal-green. We cannot take it upon ourselves to say what the sanitary condition of the town may become if the diease is once allowed to fix itself firraly in its seat. The filthy spots we have named, if they be allowed to generate and spread abroad their noisome miasmata, under favourable atmospheric influences, may gradually infect other quarters of the town which but for their evil neigh- bourhood would have escaped scot-free. The pro-
			visions, then, of the Aealth of Towns BiLI must now'
			be enforced with all possible despatch. Diligence and solicitude in this matter have become every man's business. As each inhabitant of thisgreat city tenders his own safety, and that of others whose well-being may be incalculably deaser to him, he will use every exertion to detect and remove such causes of disease and death as those we have indi- cated above. It is now abundantly certain that the vicious or tainted condition of the atmosphere is the predisposing cause of cholera. Many of its mys- terious properties are beyond the reach of man, but we can greatly deprive it of noxious influence by sweeping away every substance which would assist in increasing and evolving its evil effects. The sky is beyond our power, but the earth within our control.
			We findit statedin a notification from the Board of Health, published in last night's Gazette, that Indian experience entirely concurs with our own as to the influences which assist in promoting the spread of cholera. ""T The disease,"" says Mr. S-nvETL ROGERS, 8urgeon, of the Madras Army, "" commits its greatest "" ravages in crowded ill-ventilated barracks, bazaars, "" densely-populated towns, particularly such as are
			surrounded by walls preventing the ingression of ""pure air, and in that portion of them where car- ""bonic acid gas is, by the decompositiou of animal and ""vegetable refuse matter, being evolved, crowded ""school-rooms, the inhabitants of a portion of a bar- ""rack in the vicinity of an open drain, native huts ""into which there is but one opening, and that "" closed at night,-whole families are frequently ""swept away from their exposure to this exciting C ""cause."" Would it not be easy to enumerate locali- ties in Bcrmondsey, in Rotherhithe, in Bethnal- green, in Westminster, in Lambeth, and in various other districts of London, to the full as noxious as those cited by Mr. ROGEnS from his Indian expe- rience 1 The wonder is, not that the cholera should be present, but that it should ever be absent from such spots in damp conditions of the atmosphere. The various reports of the Sanitary Oommis- sioners, upon which the recent act has been founded, afford numerous instanceS of the foul and noxious condition of the streets and alleys inhabited by the poor, of hovels and
			cellars from which light and air are carefally exoltided, where the bare earth is covered with straw, and where all comers who can afford to pay a penny for their accommodation drop down promis- cuously, until not a square inch is left unoccupied. The sexes, the old and the young, the well and the ailing, sometimes the dead and the living, in these dismal and fetid abodes, are strewed pell-mell, and yet we expect that cholera should spare our city, when the atmosphere is poisoned to its hand. Let all look to these things in time. There is an old proverb about Heaven helping those who help them- selves.
			One of the main methods for guarding the popu- lation from the attacks of the disease, should it un- fortunately become epidemic, and where circum- stances do not admit of any material improvement in a house or locality, is the temporary removal of such indigent peTsons as may be in imminent danger, but yet not attacked. Instead of the indiscriminate re- movat of the sick, it is suggested in the notification from the Board of Health, to which we again refer our readers, that a more effectual, as well as less ex- rpenslve method, would be to rem ove temporarily f0vnx-t l9Q4fY.i t1ese wM would probably be the
			next viotims of the disease. Provision is made on the spot for those aotu ally attacked, while others of the same family, and perhaps the immediate neigh- bours, are removed to another and a healthier spot. We are induced to recur to this suggestion from the testimony we see borne to its efficaoy by Dr. AIso0, who practised in Edinburgh daring the prevaIeuce of the oholera in 1832. "" The system,"" says that gentleman, "" was to take the inmates of the houses ""not attacked, and, in cases of much crowding, the ""next-door neighbours of cholera patients, into 'houses prepared for their reception, caUed Houses ' of Refuge, and to keep them there in comfort and ""under observation, at least until their rooms had ""been thoroughly fumigated and cleansed."" The system, according to the testimony of Dr. Amso;, worked well. It is evidently one which could only be generally acted upon before the disease prevails to any great extent. As a precautionary measure in the present sanitary condition of the me- tropolis, it is in accordance with common sense. In the cases reported last week, three deaths occurred in one house, in one court chiefly occupied by Irish, in St. Olave's, Southwark. Had the other occupants of the house been at once removed when the presence of cholera was clearly established in the case of one patient, the chances are the two other lives might have been saved, and an inlet of* the disease have been stopped up. We must keep out the cholera as the Dutch do the sea, by the most anxious attention to the minutestcraickor flaw in our defences.",-,0FFO-1848-NOV01_Issue.xml
The schemes which have been propounded for the,Editorial,"The schemes whioh have been propounded for the regeneration of the German Empire are so numerous, so conflicting, and still so incomplete, that we have abstained from a close examination of the fleeting shapes which the fancy of German legislators or the accidents of the time have assigned to the Imperial Constitution. Our attention is, however, recalled to the subject by the progress actually made by the Frankfort Assembly in its momentous task; and as that body has wisely resolved to abstain from set- tling by way of preliminaries the axioms of political scieace and the precise limits of the fundamental rights of man, there is more reason to hope that they will proceed to handle the practical and essential parts of government. One of the most important contributions which we have seen to this great ob- ject is a second pamphlet or address from the pen of Chevalier BUNSEN, the Prussian Minister in London, in which he has pointed out several of the prin- ciples which are most essential to the construction of this vast and complicated structure.
			If it be desirable in the government of a well- regulated commonwealth to erect any checks or bar- riers to the absolute power of the multitude, and to trust no class with unlimited means of exercising a predominant authority, it is clear that the distinc- tion between federal power and separate sovereignty affords a natural and permanent means of accom- plishing this object. We have seen the attempt to create a second Chamber on the principle of the British Houae of Peers fail in a variety of instances, because the materials of such an Assembly were wanting, and it was impossible suddenly to invest
			individuals with the traditions, the independence, the wealth, and the influence attached to hereditary rank. But in a Confederation, the several members of the nation and their representatives in the Senate may be regarded without a metaphor as peers of the realm, and their natural opposition to the cen- tral or predominant power of any one State, or even of a popular majority, raises a barrier and applies a check not dissimilar in its 'effects to that whioh is supplied by an aristocratic Assembly. In the present state of Germany, where the aris- tocracy has suffered even a greater diminution of power than the Sovereigns, this expedient seemts to be the only effectual means of opposing the uncon- trolled force of a democratio Assembly. Chevalier BuNSEw therefore insists on the creation of an Upper House of States, not very unlike the late
			Diet of the Confederation or the Senate bf the United States. The American Senate;. however, discharges two distinct functions-the first legisla- tive, in concert with the House of Representatives; the second executive, in concert with the President alone. This latter power Chevalier BUNSEN- pro- poses to place in the hands, not of the Senate of Germany, but of a Council of the Empire, composed of the reigning Sovereigns of the larger States or their proxies, who would thus have a veto and an influence on questions of peace and war, on the conclusion of treaties, and on the patronage of the central Government. As the number of German States and the inequality between them is ex- treme, he recommends the revival of a division of Germany into Circles of the Empire, based cn the existing military divisions of the Federal army. These circles would be so distributed that without any alteration of the territorial rights of each State, three or four of them would fall to the share of Austria and Prussia respectively, two to Bavaria, &c., whilst several of the minor States would be united in one circle, and represented accordingly in the Upper Chamber of the Empire. The plan is, as it appears to us, extremely ingenious and equitable, and it combines several of the happiest parts of the American constitution with the historical idiosyn- crasies of Germany; but though it might well de- serve the consideration of a congress of Sovereigns and statesmen, it will probably tend to defeat rather than to promote the real designs of a considerable portion of the Frankfort Assembly.
			It cannot have escaped our readers that when the extreme Radical party in Germany so loudly took up the ory of German unity and a revival of the Empire, their first object was to subvert and trample on the dignity and power of all existing Sovereigns and Governments, from the obvious calculation that if they crushed the independence and the resistance of established institutions, the central Power, scarcely raised upon a tottering soil, wvould infal- libly be at their mercy. Hence the insults which have been offered to the most glorious symbols of the Prussian nation in the heaTt of its capital- hence the participation of the German faction of the extreme Left in the rebellion of Vienna.
			In every Federal Government the balance of power inclines either to one side or the other: either the federal authority is decidedly and constantly superior to that of the States, as in America, or the States are comparatively independent of any supreme control, except in certain instances, and this was the case with the late Swiss and Germanic constitu- tions. These bodies were not so much confedera- tions as-leagues. The Swiss and the Germans are now resolved to throw the balance decidedly to the centre, and to form a real confederation at the ex- pcnse of an equal amount of state-independence. But in the case of Germany there is this peculiarity- that the proposed union is a confederation of Kings, to be combined with, and under the authority of, nnother Sovereign. That is the novelty of the expe- riment, and the German Republicans may certainly be pardoned for anticipating that the princip'e of monarchy can ill support so severe a trial. Sove- reignty is one of those ideas which admits of no sub- traction. It is either complete or nothing; and if the German Sovereigns assent to the conditions of the Frankfort constitutions, they pass at once into the condition of subjects; there is no intermediate .Thgea: dfRglff9 oQf priAoiplo a44 theory have
			been greatly increased by the decision just tken by a large majority in the Frankdort Assembly to the effect that no non-German possession is to be united iu one State with German territories. This article of the Federal Oonstitution of course implies the ex- clusion or dismemberment of all the mixed States of which part belongs to the Germanic body and part does not, as, for instance, Holland, 'Denmark, and especially the empire of Austria. The last intelligence we received from Copenhagen clearly intimates the resolution of the Danish Diet to maintain the rights of that Crown in Schles- wig. Limburg forms a province of Holland, and some of the non-German possessions of Austria are an essential part of her power. The rulers of these States, and above all of Austria, can never consent to reduce their nationat svRtnm
			of government and defence to a mere pera3onal union of their respective titles, for the sole purpose of reducing their German provinces to a dependenoy of another central Power. Whatever be the amount of territory and force retained by Austria after the present convulsion has subsided, her possessions must form one distinct and undivided State. As Baron GAGERN ably pointed out, her independence and unity are essential to Germany as well as to herself; and although his amendment was de- feated at Frankfort, we have no doubt that the Austrian Government will reject a condition wffich' is inconsistent with the united gover-iment of the Imperial dominions. We inay, therefore, an- ticipate that at-no distant period Austria will with- draw altogether from the scheme of Germanic unity, and confne herself to a league of amity and com- merce with the purely German States.","The schemes which have been propounded for the regeneration of the German Empire are so numerous, so conflicting, and still so incomplete, that we have abstained from a close examination of the fleeting shapes which the fancy of German legislators or the accidents of the time have assigned to the Imperial Constitution.

Sovereignty is one of those ideas which admits of no subtraction. It is either complete or nothing; and if the German Sovereigns assent to the conditions of the Frankfort constitutions, they pass at once into the condition of subjects; there is no intermediate stage.

We may, therefore, anticipate that at no distant period Austria will withdraw altogether from the scheme of Germanic unity, and confine herself to a league of amity and commerce with the purely German States.",0FFO-1848-NOV01_Issue.xml

The War In Mooltan.,News,"INDIA.
			THE WAR IN MOOLTAN.
			We have received by express from Marseilles our advices and papers from India in anticipation of the overland mail of the 3d of Ootober from -Bombay. The dates thus received are from Cal- cutta to the 22d of September, Madras to the 25th, and Bombay to the 3d of Ootober.
			Frontier affairs have k%sumed a much more serious aspect. The intelligence is unsatisfactory alike re- epecting the operations before Mooltan and the gene- ral state of the Punjab. Our forces in that direc- tion have suffered a check in consequence of the -defection of the auxiliary Sikh troops. Just as the operations of General Whish's Brigade had commenced in the most brilliant manner, Shere Singh, with the force of nearly 5,000 men under his command, went over to the Dewan, evi- .dently upon a pre-arranged plot-an event which compelled General Whish instantly, to change his tactics, to raise the siege, and having made a retro- grade movement,to unite his forces in an entrenched -camp at some 15 miles from the citadel, there to await in a more favourable position the junc- tion of the reinforcements from Ferozepore and &Scinde. Two engineer officers had since, it appears, fallen. into the hands of the enemy. roolraj, by Shere Singh's defection, had aug- nented his adherents to about 20,000 men, with the probability of a further accession of nearly as many more. Chutter Singh, the rebel leader in the Hazareh, was marching with -sbout 10,000 men to join the Dewan; and although Gholab Singh had not more positiVely thau heretofore gone over to the conspiracy, two of ,his regiments, with stores and baggage, had left to join the Hazareh Sikhs. At Lahore the features of this frontier rebellion were not less pronounced, although happily from our excellent measures of -defence there the circumstance occasions no ground for ultimate apprehension as to our hold upon the capital. We find, however, that several other S3irdars of the Durbar had been found to be mplicated, and that in consequence of this fact the Resident, on receipt of the intelligence from Mooltan, had at once secured under a guard the per- zsonxd Dhuleep Singh, as a hostage, to iufluence those who wavered, as well as to frustrate attempts made ty the Sikhs in arms to get possession of the Maha- rajah's person. The Resident had also, wo are told, laid hands on the famous Koh-i-noor diamond, as a measure of similar precaution.

The Bombay force when united would amount to about 10,000 men. Some of the bladras regiments would reinforce the Bombay .&tations, at the same time that a general advance was preparing from the Bengal frontier. From the latter direction a well-apportioned force, amounting to about 20,000 men, would march upon Mooltan, under General Gilbert. No troops -could, it appears, be spared from Lahore, but it was considered the cavalry regiments still left in Ferozepore would be quite sufficient to keep -open the line of communication with the camp of General Whish; in other words, to frustrate any *'ising between him and the capital. Under these -circmanstances, the position of the British force in the field, strongly entrenched, with a park of ar- tillery of 70 guns, and their flank on the river, at -some 15 miles from Mooltan, may be regarded as Eecure under any contingency.

We have received by express from Marseilles our advices and papers from India in anticipation of the overland mail of the 3d of October from Bombay. The dates thus received are from Calcutta to the 22d of September, Madras to the 25th, and Bombay to the 3d of October. Frontier affairs have assumed a much more serious aspect. The intelligence is unsatisfactory alike respecting the operations before Mooltan and the general state of the Punjab. Our forces in that direction have suffered a check in consequence of the defection of the auxiliary Sikh troops. Just as the operations of General Whish's Brigade had commenced in the most brilliant manner, Shere Singh, with the force of nearly 5,000 men under his command, went over to the Dewan, evidently upon a pre-arranged plot - an event which compelled General Whish instantly to change his tactics, to raise the siege, and having made a retrograde movement, to unite his forces in an entrenched camp at some 15 miles from the citadel, there to await in a more favourable position the junction of the reinforcements from Ferozepore and Scinde. Two engineer officers had since, it appears, fallen into the hands of the enemy. Moolraj, by Shere Singh's defection, had augmented his adherents to about 20,000 men, with the probability of a further accession of nearly as many more. Chutter Singh, the rebel leader in the Hazareh, was marching with about 10,000 men to join the Dewan; and although Gholab Singh had not more positively than heretofore gone over to the conspiracy, two of the regiments, with stores and baggage, had left to join the Hazareh Sikhs. At Lahore the features of this frontier rebellion were not less pronounced, although happily from our excellent measures of defence there the circumstance occasions no ground for ultimate apprehension as to our hold upon the capital. We find, however, that several other Sirdars of the Durbar had been found to be implicated, and that in consequence of this fact the Resident, on receipt of the intelligence from Mooltan, had at once secured under a guard the person of Dhuleep Singh, as a hostage, to influence those who wavered, as well as to frustrate attempts made by the Sikhs in arms to get possession of the Maharajah's person. The Resident had also, we are told, laid hands on the famous Koh-i-noor diamond, as a measure of similar precaution. Troops were being poured into Scinde by sea from Bombay, to occupy the line of the middle Indus, and to march, should their services be required, upon the Punjab. The Bombay force when united would amount to about 10,000 men. Some of the Madras regiments would reinforce the Bombay stations, at the same time that a general advance was preparing from the Bengal frontier. From the latter direction a well-apportioned force, amounting to about 20,000 men, would march upon Mooltan, under General Gilbert. No troops could, it appears, be spared from Lahore, but it was considered the cavalry regiments still left in Ferozepore would be quite sufficient to keep open the line of communication with the camp of General Whish; in other words, to frustrate any rising between him and the capital. Under these circumstances, the position of the British force in the field, strongly entrenched, with a park of artillery of 70 guns, and their flank on the river, at some 15 miles from Mooltan, may be regarded as secure under any contingency. On the whole, happily, there appears every ground for belief that the preparations announced from all sides of India to retrieve the check we have described are on a scale of magnitude probably commensurate rather with the extent of past supineness in its exaggerated reaction than the actual degree of danger. Such at least is the opinion of parties who from the first were urgent for the adoption of active measures, and who at present are the least alarmed by the ultimate features the outbreak has assumed, or inclined to doubt of a speedy and successful termination. Mooltan would now be attacked by separate armies from the south and from the north, when, it has been affirmed, mere detachments in the earlier months would have sufficed, but it is added that there now appears every probability that long before the Bombay army shall have reached the seat of war the few regiments that have already arrived without orders from head-quarters - namely, the Rifle Brigade from Scinde, and the European cavalry from Ferozepore, will supply what is wanting to our troops who are in the presence of the enemy, and that General Whish, with a body of picked infantry, European and native, and some 3,000 cavalry (an arm hitherto deficient), which will have reached him, with a park of field and siege artillery, and under the prestige of recent success, will certainly reap the honours of the campaign, should the temerity of the Dewan, or the precipitancy of his forces tempt them, as is not unlikely, to an attack. This opinion seems borne out by other details which have reached us as to the recent conduct of our troops, who, in the siege operations, stormed the outworks, forestalling the work of regular approaches, and up to the hour when breaching distance had thereby been attained - an hour marked by the instant defection of the Sikh Chief - every rencontre, without exception, told the same lesson of superiority in strategy as in conflict that Edwardes and his Pathaus before taught the insurgents under earlier and still more desperate circumstances. The following officers had fallen in the siege operations during an attack on an outpost unrivalled for desperate gallantry in the annals of the army, namely, Colonel Pattonu, Major Montizambert, Quarter-Master Taylor, Lieutenant Cubitt, and Ensign Lloyd.

Mooltan.,News,"MOOLTAN.
			(From tbe Bombay Tim#z.)
			ELRIe intewLgenco from Mooltan given in our last overland summary came down to the 21th of August. At thia time the columns from Lahore by the Raveo and Chonaub, and from Ferozepore by tho Sutlo;, had joined cloEe to the *cqno of futuro operations. The battering train was about .to proceea from opposite Bahawulporo, where it had landed on the 18isnd remained tiUl the 28th preparing for the �arclk; two*omapaifies of Her MIajesty's 32d, for which ,boats could niot 'at first be procured, wore on their way dowt fhe rivor.

			in camp, and had lost 18 men on the way. Onk their arrival they speedily began to recover, and are now, like the other troops around MIooltan, mu the highest health and spirits. The insurgonts continued indefatigable in their exertions, and were every now and thea able to s- duce a few Sikhs from our aide, anid to capture c6nsiderabte nunbers of baggago, camels, and bullocks. The Dewan Moolraj tried to corrupt our Sepoya by an offer of a shilling a day of pay to them, with leave of absence onceo evory three years, and a suitable pension; and a couple of deserters did on one occasion cross over to him, and were seen next day, and recognized by their accoutrements. On the 29th, the whole force moved forward a few hundred yards nearer the fort, and encamped in a Une. Meanwhile the party engaged in cutting off the supplies of the water- courses from the Chenaub were activoly engaged some 17 milea from Mooltan, protected by the steamers in the river, and by 1,000 Sikhs under Mallea Singh, who were defended by heavy guns and entrenchments. The river rapidly rose, and twice were bunds of wood, stone, and mud they had thrown up burst through, when, the waters once more subsiding, every. thing was get complete. These works were placed under the charge of MaUee Singh, with a powerful detachment of Sikhs; they were defended by strong entrenchments and heavy guns. The working party was next directed to cat down jungle and brushwood for fascines and gabions, ten boat loads of which were ordered to be sent down for the use of the besiegers. On the 1st of September the General and Staff, with a body of engineer officers, reconnoitred the fort, and Lieut. Edwardes, with Lieut. Lake, Colonel Cortlandt, and Emam.ood.deen, with nearly the whole of the origiaal attacking force, were sent Found to the opposite side to make a feigned attack, and distrmct the attention;of. tho enemy. They proceeded -to take possession of a garden, where a picket of the enemy, which fired on them and then retired, was stationed. The troops now drew up in line. Tlhe Dowan hearing the firiug, made immediate arrangements to rein- force the outposts, and sent orders to them to maintain their ground as long as possiblo. Some sharp skirmishing appears to have ensued, when tho Mooltanees were driven back at aU points, and obliged to seek shelter in a ravine close to the town. The Daudpootras were at one time hardly pressed, but, being reinforced, rapidly recovered their ground. The artiUery force for a short time occupied the position they had forced, when, as evening drew on, the object of their mission having been accomDlished, they returned to camp unmolested. The recomiunt. lng officers consisted of Gene- ral Whish, commanding the Forces; Colonel Franks, Her Majesty's 10th; Colonel MIarkham, Her Majesty's 32d; Major Napier, Engineers, with a number of amateurs. The escorting party was a strong one; it consisted of Her Ka- jesty's 10th, two companies of Her Majesty's 82d, winga of tho 8th and 52d Nativo Infantry, six guns, a troop of the 11th
			cavalry, and 1i troopers of Wheoler's horse. They made their way to the temple whero Mr. Agnowand Lieutenant Anderson were murdered, at about 800 yards from the ramparts. So effectually had the garrison beea occupied by the skirmish on the opposite side, that it was some time before the recon- rIoitring party were observed. So soon as they were per- ceived a number of guns were brought to bear on them; the practice was beautiful, and the shot fell close beside them. One struck the temple, another struck the waU under the feet of Dr. Thorp, of the Irregular Horse, and passed just over the head of the General; another fell amongst the Sappers, but luckily did no harm. Major Na. pier ascended the minaret, and had a fine view of aU the works and of the ground immediately around. The fire becoaning disagroeable, the party returned by a detour some 1,100 yards from the ramparts, the guns firing on them. aU the way, the distance being such thtt the shot nearly aU feU short. It was now apparent that the place was much stronger than has been imagined. The fort is about a mile, the city two miles, in circumference. The former is aurrounded by a ditch 20 feet wide at bottom, and the defences are regularly constructed. Tne wall of the 'own joins that of the fort. The approaches are difficult in consequence of the groves of large trees, the enclosed gardens, and mounds formed by old brick-kilns, which everywhere abound. The latter furnished exceUent positions for the guns of the defenders, and will probably require to be taken in detail. The number of watercourses cutting the country in all directions was incredible-scarcely could a rider stir without faling in with some of them, in. dicating the extreme care bestowed on cultivatioa and the great capabilities of the country. It was free of marsh, and mostly well adapted for encamping ground. At this date head.quarters were about two miles from the east corner of the fortress; Edwardes, Lake, and the Bahawulpore troops, about three-quarters of a 'mile south-east of the town, and the Sikhs under Shere Singh immediately to the west. The besieging force, as may be remembered, now stood pretty nearly as folowa :-Hler Majesty's 10th from Lahore, and 32d from Ferozepore, or in all about 2,000*; the 8th, 49th 51st, 52d, and 72d Native Infantry, 3,700 Native Infantry-5,7000 in all; *the 11th Light Cavalry, and 7th and 11th Irregular Horse. The artillery portion of the forco conaiated of the siege train of 34 guns, two troops of horse and a company of foot artillery, with sappers and minera, and a full engineer corps-the whole British portion amounting nearly to 7,000 men. The strength of the force near Mooltan, before the arrival of that under General Whish, seems to have stool as follows-but here we are far from being assured of tho accuracy of our facts: the troops of the Blhawul Khan are estimated at 6,000 or 7,000; those accompanying Colonel Cortlandt and Captain Edwardes from the Derajat at from 4,000 to 5,000-probably 12,000 in all, with 20 guns, though some estimates bring them up to 10,008 before the junction of 9irdar Uttur.Singh, with 6,000 men, 10 guns, aud two mortars, on the 14th of July. Theso may be guessed in all, therefore, at probably not under 23,000 men with 30 guns. Besides these, Shere Singh, the Durbar leader, sent out in May from Lahore.
			had 3,000 men under his command; so that the total num- ber, regular and itregular, can scarcely fall much short of 32,000 men, with some 75 pieces of ordnance of one sort or another at their disposal. If we are uncertain of the strength of our own army, we are wholly in the dark as to that of the enemy; latest accounts reckon it at from 7,000 to 12,000, with 52 guns. From the determined atti- tude of defiance now assumed by him, with a force so overwhelming as that already enumerated before him, we are led to suspoct the accuracy of much ef the informa- tion formerly received in reference to his fears. It is suffi. ciently apparent, from the state of matters on both sides, that both he and we are under the conviction that tho friends of his cause throughout the Punjaub are numerous and powerful. On the morning of the 4th the siege traia arrived and took up its positioa in the open space reserved for it. It consisted of 34 pieces of heavy ordnance. It was accompanied by an escort of the 11th Irregular Horse and 49th Native Infantry. Two hundred and eighty bullock carts and 3,600 camels were required to carry their stores, and such was the length of the train that the head of it had arrived at Mooltan before the' other extremity had got out of camp eight miles be- hind. On the 5th a grand parade of aU the troops was ordered, and a Royal salute was fired in honour of the occa- sion. Prize agents were at this time appointed by the General-rather prematurely, as will presently appear. This was returned by a continued discharge from the ramparts-which proved harmless, the shot having fallen short. A proclamation was now made and distri. buted about the town, intimating that for the next 24 hours such of the inhabitants as desired it would find protection in camp; after this no one could be suffered to pass the gates. Onthe evenimg of the 6th the mortar batteries opened, and a large number of shells wvere thrown into the town, doing considerable injury and occasioning the utmostalarm. Run. gram Singh, kismsDan and principal officer of the Dewan, badbeendetectedcommunicating withthe LahoreDurbar, and was in consequence thrown into prison by his master. Six 18-pounders and four 8-inch mortars were ordered to be advanced towards the town in the course of the night. The howitzers and morta were to be put in position about 1,200 yards from thesouth-east angle of the town, and when the suburbs and intervening grounds were cleared of the enemy by their fire the 18-pounders were to be moved up within 400 or 500 yards of the walls, and battering to be commenced. A breach was expected to bo established in the course of the day, when the town was to be carried by assault; the storming party to consist of Her Majesty's 32d, the 49th and a1st Native Intaxtry, to be accompanied as far as pos- sible by M'Kenzie's Horso Artillery. It was expected that the storm would be attemptei late in the afternoon of the 7th or at daybreak on the 8th. Further consideration induced the General to alter the whole plan of his opera. tione, and on consideration of the extreme determination of the enemy, the strength of the place, and the severity of the conflict likely to be carried on in the streets while the c.tadel continued in the hands of the insurgents, it was

			resolved to aTd so heavy and so superfluous a saorifice of life as this was likely to occasion and to proceed by regular approaches. It turned out afterwards that tho enemy had improved their time, and very skilfully entrenched or fortifiod every tenable point betwixt oar camp and the waaUs. On the evening of the 6th we had begun to tbrow shells into the towvn. The troops were ordered to assemble at 3 o'clock on the morning of the 7th, and the Quartermasters of regiments to meet the Quartermaster. General at daybreak to take up new ground for the force. Some time before daybreak the 72d Native Infantry, three guns under Captain Anderson, and the greater part of the 11th Irregular Horse, proceeded to take possession of a hamlet and mound where a gun had been placed from which the enemy used to fire on our pickets. So soon as daylight allowed them the 72A threw out its skirmishers, and the artillery got into a position weU sheltered from the guns both of the fort and city. After some sharp firing, in which the Rifles played a conspicuous part, the
			enemy, at least five times as numerous as their assailants, were driven from their position. They took shelter in a village right under the guns of the city and fort; from this they were quickly driven at tho bayonet's point by our troops,-nor did they slacken their speed tiUl fairly within the town. The Dewan continued to play his guns unceas. ingly from the walls; the shots passed over the heads of the parties for whom they were intended, and came rolling down towards the camp. The sappers and miners Co4ti. nued incessantly at wvork in the trenches, 800 Europeans taking the place overnight of a corresponding number of seapoys kept at work throughout the day. On the morning of the 8th the 52d Native Infantry made an attack upon another outpost; they fired a heavy volley into the village, and then drove the ;enemy before them at the bayonet's point; scarcely any injury was sustained by them; Throughout the day it was held by three compa. nies of the 52d. On the following morning the 52d was relieved by the 49th, and the post previously held by the three companies of the former was now occupied by a like number of the latter corps amounting to 120, under a cap. tain and a subaltern. The enemy were in possession of a strong post about 100 yards in front-from this they main. tained a dropping matchlock firo on us, so welU directed that the moment a man showed himself he was sure to be hit. It afterwards appeared that they had here strongly en- trenched themselves, and as soon as night drew on, and the European soldiers of the 10th began to excavate a new paraUel, a furious and deadly fire was opened upon them. This they immediately returRed, but with smatl effect, in consequence of the denseness of the thicket and the shelter around. The officer commanding in the trenches at length attacked the garden and village from which the enemy were annoying us. Some companies of the 72d here joined in the fray, and at first the enemy were driven out of their cover. The post in the garden was a strong one; in the village one large house fuU of men was loopholed; and though the donr was forced by Lieutenant Richardson the troops failed to effect an entrance. So hot meanwhile was the fire of the enemy that the European soldiers were compelled to seek shelter and ultimately to retire. The enemy pressed on them until they had faUen back on the entrenchments; they then moved off in line to reoccupy the garden from which they had at first been driven. The fire was not, it is said, surpassed in fury at Moodkee or 9abraon. Out of 90 men engaged Her i'ajesty's 10th had 40 wounded-almost al of them severely; the 49th Native Infantry 28. Brigadier Markham, Lieutenants Holinsworth Richardson, and Irwin, were aU wounded. The post assailed was about 600 yards from sur outworks; the assault was boldly made, but the place was much [too strong for capture. Tho detachment of the 49th was now strengthened by one company of Her Majesty's 10th, and the Rifle company of the 72d. All night long the enemy continued to cannonade them, but luckily without doing much mischief. At day- break on the 10th some guns were got into position, and a tremendous discharge of round shot, grape, and shrapnell, was maintained for three hours-to all appearance, how. ever, without effect; the enemy were well protected from danger, and seemed not to suffer from alarm. In the course of the forenoon a battery was goc advanced to within a very short distance of the post, and a heavy fire recommenced, but without better results than that which had preceded. During the whole of the 11th a virtutl armistice was maintained on both sides, but the insurgents were now aware of the strength and importance of their
			position, and of the effect of night attack3 upon us, and began to establish a regular battery in the garden. Aa order was now issued by General Whish directing an attack to be made on them about 7 o'clock on the morning of the 12th; the attacking force to consist of a troop of horse artillery, a squadron of cavalry from each of the three regiments, 12 companies of European and two regi
			ments bf Native Infantry, above 2,500 in all. About't 7 in the morning they began to prepare batteries near the building from which they had on the 9th repulsed us. They were attacked by oae Enropean and two native re- giments. The Europeanw, remembering how their com. rades had been foiled, and how they had suffered, fought like furies. They found 400 men in a narrow square, and shot or bayoneted every one of them. A mine had been blown up by them, and hundreds of scorched and shattered bodies were found piled over 'the ground. Sixty of those who had cut down Ensign Lloyd when parleying with them were destroyed by lIer Majesty's 10th-only five of the party escaping. The artillery destroyed 100 in one mass. Colonel Pattoun and Quartermaster Tarlor, of his Highnesses 32d; Major Montizambert, of Her Majesty's 10th, Ensign Lloyd, of the 8th Native Infautry, Lieutenant Cubitt, 49th Native Infantry, are said to have falen. Wounded: Captain Balfour, Her Mfajesty's 32d Foot, slightly; Lieu- tenant King, ditto, slightly; Lieutenant Swinburne, ditto, slightly; Lieutenant Birtwhistle, ditto, slightly; Captain M'Gregor, Her Majesty's 10th Foot, slightly; Colonel Franks, ditto, slightly; Lieutenant Herbert, ditto, ditto; Major Napier, Engineors, ditto; Lieutenant Lake, ditto, Lieutenant Binney, Horse Artilery, ditto; Captain Christo. pher, Indian Navy, badly; Captain Wroughton, 8th Native Infantry, slightly; Lieutenant Turnbull, ditto, ditto; Ensign Frederick Kennedy, ditto, ditto ; Lieutenant Vibart, 11th Light Cavalry, ditto. Major-General
			Whish had a horse shot under him. A troop of Horsa. Artillery, a squadron of the 11th Cavalry, the 7th and 11th Irregular Horse, five companies of Her Majesty's 10th, with as many of Her Majesty's 82d, the 8th and 49th Native Infantry, were the troops engaged. Colonel Franks commanded one column of five companies of Europeans and a native corps, Colonel Pattoun another- the whole under Brigadier Hervey. The success, though dearly purchased, was of much importance. It plaead all the defensible points on this side the. city in our hands, and enabled the battering guns to be advanced within 600 yards of the wall--a position they could not have. at- tained by regular approaches in less than a week. About 2 o'clock in the morning of the 13th a furi- ous attack was made on Edwardes' amnp, fortunately with. out effect. On the 14th the British troops carried the Hummund Ghurree or outwork, having previously occu. pied a position c!ose beside it. From this new post the batteries were supposed likely to be able to fire into the fort and town without impediment, and everything now seemed drawing to an auspicious close. It was hoped that breaching might be begun almost at once, and, considering that we were withIh almost point blank distance of the wals, it was supposed that in 30 or 40 hours at the outside the assault might be commenced-when a sadden act of treachery on the part of our alhies blighted aU our prospects, and compeled us to raise the siege and convert the be. sieging army into one of observation. It has been repeatedly stated that Shore Singh, a Sikh officer and nobleman of dis- tinction, was despatched early in May by the Durbar, with a force of 3,000 men, with a view, it was said, of keeping the Moolraj in check. We know little of his proceedings
			until we find him in company with Colonel Cortlandt and Lieutenant Edwardos before Mooltan. It does not appear that he took any active share in military operations, and his fidelity was said to be held more than questionable. Early in July his father, Chuttur Singh, Governor in the Hazareh province at the other extremity of the Punjaub, headed an insurrection still in progress, and said to have been pro. moted with a view of taking advantage of the absence of our troops from Lahore. About T o'clock on the morning of the 14th information was brought to Lieutenant Edwardes that the Rajah Shere Singh had gone over to the enemy, taking with him above 5,000 Sikhs with 12 guns and howitzers, and 80 of the lighter pieces called zumboorucks. The movement appeared to have taken both parties equally by surprise; latterlywe had in some measure ceased to sus. pect; and so dubious was the Dewvan of the trustworthi. ness of his new allies that he for a time assigned them quarters beyond the walls, but under the batteries of the town. With so formidable a defection from our strength -so largo an accession to that of the enemy-it be. carae at once obvious that it would be imnprudent for the presont to continue the siege. We had already seen vith what desperation our opponents were. deter. mnined to resist us: and with 5,000 added to their numbere-men bvlgpQing to tho Ol1 Siklk ir3y vi> wlho
			Such are the bitter fruits of vacillation and hesitation: I while we were debating onthe size of the army to be sent and tho most fitting time for sending them-calculating how much cost or inconvenience might be incurred, or probable sickness occasioned by a march one month compared with that by another -we were tempting traitkrs into the field and holding out a bribe for insurrection. A strong brigade half the size of the army of observation under General Whish would, if despatched in May, have settled the matter in a week's time. By delay and vacillation, a chance explo. sion of anger and haphazard attack, accompanied bymurder, where the deed was hardly done when the actorswere horror- strnck at their position, has waxed into a widely-ramified and deep -rooted treason-fast rooted to the spot whence it sprung, and extending itself throughout every part of the Sikh dominions. The saughter that may now be looked for as the denog-nieat is tremendous. We have to. contend with brave, highly disciplined, and perfectly desperate men, fighting under the joint influence of religious zeal and the knowledge thattheir lives are forfeited. We cati under such circumstances neither expect nor exhibit mercy-on both sides it must be war to the knife-and after the victory, if ours, our artiUery inust complete the carnage which other. wise would devolve on the bands of the executioner.
			knew that now they fought with haiters round their neck and could not even look for quarter-it was- vain to proceed until. reinforcements arrived. General Whish, therefore, had bis camp removed to v safe distanco from their batteriea, while the gun5 and all the working parties were called in, and our force was transformed into an army of observation occupying a fortified camp. Our rear was annoyed but not much damaged by tho enemy. We had been but a short time in our new position when it became evident that wo should find ourselves much more agreeably situated a considerable way further from the town; we accordingly once more decamped, and on the l7th took up a podt 18 miles from Mooltan in tho direction of Bahawvulpore. Particulars of is movement have not hitherto reached us farther than this-that the material prepared for the siege, a large quantity of ammunitien, and a month's supply of biscuits had fallen into the hands of the enemy. Animadversions on the aTrangements of General WYhish are very severe; we are said to have per. mitted the enemy to strengthen himself at every point most strongly and elaborately in the suburbs, and then to have proceeded as if there were no obstruction in our way. A considerable portion of the troops which 'went over with Shere Singh seem disposed to quit MIooltan with' as little delay as possible.
			The moenint the tidings of this unfortunate affair reached head.quarters, preparations began to be made to rein- force tho besieging army. The Bombay Government was written to by express, and orders immediately issued for assembling an army of 9,000 men at Roree under command of Brigadier Dundas, of Her Maesty's Rifles. Of these, 2,000 are Europeans. It is not likely they will be required to do.more than perform the duties of an army of reserve or observation-perhaps they. may afterwards be caUed on to occupy the. city after the siege is over should the Bengal troops be needed eleewhere. They can hardly reach Mooltan before Christmas, and if the town is not ours early in November, it fill be strange indeed. At Ferozopore there are about 4,000, at Lahore about 8,000 men, and these wiU be reinforced immediately to 7,000 and 12,000 respectively. The siege train from Suklckur is said to have been ordered up; this, in addition to 31 pieces of hoavy, and as,many of light, ordnance, now in camp, will make the artiUery arm of the force very powerful indeed. A force of 10,000 men, of which details have not as yet been supplied, is meanwhile being formed on the Lahore side under the command of General Gilbert; and this will, without loss of time, move on Mooltan, so that the army before the place will shortly be as strong as that which fought at Moodkee, or that with which in April, 1842, General Pollocl; forced his way to Cabul. The Dellhi ac-ette states, that the army to be formed at Ferozepore will consist of five European regiments (5,000), witlh 16 corps of Native Infantry (say 750 each) (12,000), and six regiments of cavalry (2,000), nine troops of horse artilery, and five field batteries (1,500)-in all, above 29,000 men. Whether this includes the force now at Fe. rozepore, or whether the whole is meant for service, does not appear. It certainly is a strange display of tactics to send 7,000 men to take a town which, on the desertion of a de- tachment whose faithfulness from the first was doubtful, re- quires a reinforcement of 25,000. Our latest news from Mlool- tan is brought bysteamer aad comes dovwn to the 18th. This is two days later than that received by the Delhi route, the in- tercourse in this direction appearing for the present to ba in. terrupted. At present the accounts which reach us from many quarters bear the impress of such excessive exagge- ration that we are compeUed very carefully to sift them- omitting aU that seema improbable or transparently untrue. We think the correctness of the greater part of what has been stated may be relied upon. We muat caution the European reader against believing much more than has been set down. The statements of the alarmists may prove cor- rect-we have hitherto for the most part found them to be the contrary, and at present most assuredly we entirely dis- believe them.",-,0FFO-1848-NOV01_Issue.xml
The Punjaub.,News,"THE PUNJAUB.
			Having given particulars of Iooltan affairs under a sopa- rate head, Sikh matters elsewhere are so mixed up to. gether that one division will suffice for them. The state of the Punjaub throughout is at present most unsatisfictory- though to us it appears that the alarms regarding it are greatly in excess of the occasion. Commencing with the extreme north-west corner of the country, we take up the notice of affairs in the Peshawar and Hazareh pro- vinces. In the latter of these a mutiny occurred some weeks back amongst the Sikh aTtillery, by whom their commanding officer was wounded. For a time this was thought lightly of, when it turned out that the malcontents were headed by Chuttur Singh, a Sikh nobleman of distinc. tion and governor of the province, and as it was feared countenanced or encouraged by Gholab Singh, the Maha- rajah of Jamoo and Cashmere. The BritiEh officers in the province at the time of the outbreak were Captain Abbott, Mr. Ingram, and Lieut enant.tobinson. TheforceatPeshawur consisted of six regim ents of ii fantry, four of cavalry, and36 guns-about6,000menin all-all in the service oftheDarbar. About a third of these are Mahomedans, and well affected to the British; the loyaltyof the other two-thirds is some. what questionable. When the Hazareh troubles began, the fidelity of the garrison at Attok seemed somewhat dubious, and a detachment of 450 trustwuorthy Mahomedans was sent to reinforce it. It now contains 1,000 Affghans, whose faithfulness may be entirely depended on. Chuttur Singh having managed to collect airound him some 1,500 of the country people, in addition to the original mutineers, directed his 6teps against Captain Abbott, who, being without guns and with a very small number of troops at his disposal, found it necessary to fall back. On the 31st of August, Lieut. Nicolson, then in the fort of Attolr, applied to Major

			Lawrence for further reinforcemens's- frbm Pesbawar ; and accordingly Osman Khan, wi* a small but determined de. tachment, immediately procesded to, his rliief. Ee was afterwards joined by Lieutenant Herb&rt, with sorne addi- tional men. Chuttur Singh was at this time 26 miles from Attok, advancing in full expectation of gaining andmission into the fort. Finding Attok provisioned for three months, and maintained by above 1,000 sturdy Affghans, he paused to deliberate what he should do next-when LienteRant Nicolson resolved to quit the fortress and proceed to join the levies 10 miles off that had formerly attended him. It was now the turn of the insurgents to retire, and they fell back accordingly to Rawul Pindee. On the 5th of Sep- tember Lieutenant Nicolson determined to attack the de. tachment of insurgents posted in the MIargtlUa Pass, with a view of occupying the attention of the rebels and preventing them from assisting the troops in the Hazareh country, where an insurgent brigade was blockaded by Captain Abbot and his levies. He did not succeed in obtaining possession of the hold which commands the pass, but after a severe struggle, in which he himself was wounded, was able to take up such a position as completely to interrupt the movements of the enemy. Two Sikh regiments were now despatched at our desire by Gholab Singh to attack
			the insurgents; instead of this, they are reported to have gone over and joined them. A strong force was on the 22d of September moved from the JuUun. dhur Doab into the 1Iazareh country, consisting of Her Ma- jesty's 61st Foot, a wing of the 7th Regular and the 2d Ir- regular Cavalry, the 3d troop 1st Brigade Horse, and 4th company 6th Brigade Foot Artillery, and the 3d and 53d Native Infantry-above 3,000 in all. We have not as yet had time to hear further of their proceedings. Returning to Peshawur we find that on the 4th of September -Major L-awreiice was informed that, the Ce3idency was to be at- tacked by the Sikh regiments at that stationLin the course of the night. Having set spies in the camp it was conal. dered prudent, from what was observed by them, to secure all the artillery; over one party companies of trustworthy infantry were placed; the Mahomedan cora- mander of the other gave his men to understand that the first sign of misconduct he saw amongst them he would ealute them with a few rounds of grape; the assurance proved sufficient to keep them at peace. Beyond this nothing- has- occurred at PBshawur to occasion annoy- ance, though there is little doubt but that the Sikh part of the garrison are watching with intense anxiety the suc- cess of the insurgents, and that they are ready to turn on us so soon as the auspicious moment arrives. We must at present, while taking all the care we can employ to protect ourselves, watch them, for so soon as our success becomes known, and our poweronce more shows itself irre- sistible, our doubtful friends will endeavour to veil all their treason. On the mountain frontier of the Doab to the north-west of Jullundhur the Chief of Noorpore began to take the opportunity of giving us annoyance. Ram Singh, son of the Vizier of the Noorpore Rajah, having been somewhat summarily removed from office by the Commis sioner, betook himself to the hills and collected around him a band of freebooters, who began immediately to plunder and assail all around them. A strong force, consisting of four companies of the nst, one company of the 29th, 250 men of Hodgeson's Sikh corps, with strong parties of the 15th and 16th Irregulars, and 150 of the bill Sihh regiment, were sent against him. On the evening of the 18th of Sep- tember they arrived ia camp outside Noorpore, The llsar. gent force was encamped on a low spur covered with thick jungle, surrounded on three sides by the dry bed of a rive-.- It was accessible only by rude paths traversabla by one man at a time. On the fourth side it was connected with the hills by a narrow ridge of jungly broken ground, with thick coppice and brushwoodoneitherside. The attackwas1lanaed
			by Major Fisher and most gallantly carried out by the troopa. Parties forced their way up the steep on all sides, and met on its summit. The insr7rgents were met in with: they fought with the utmost courage and coolness, loading and firing as they retired. They wvere completely routed and defeated, leaving, out of 250, between 50 and 60 killed and wounded behind them. Fifteen prisoners were taken, the leader escaped. We had one man killed and eight or ten wounded. The news of the defection of Shere Singh on the 14th reached Lahore on the 16th; and though it might have been supposed that the chiefs at the capital were corresponding with the malcontents in the provinces, up to that date everything was quiet and peaceful. About 10 o'clock at night, just after the iU-omenel tidings reached the Residency, orders were sent to Her Majesty's 53d Foot to hold themselves in readiness. They occupied the Huzooree Bagh-a gardea connected vita the palace by a vaulted entrance long since blocked up The passage was immediately opened up, and a Durbar assembled in the citadel. It sat from 4 till 9 in the morning of the 17th, during all which time the entranca to the citadel was guarded by our troops. All the commanders of regiments were in attendance, ready to receive instrua- tions, at the Quartermaster-General's; till the meeting was over the troops were ordered not to quit their lines. The Sirdar Gholab Singh, son of the insurgent Chuttur Singh, and brother of the traitor Shere Singh, was arrested ia the Durbar, and all his papers seized. The Maharajah Dhulleep Singh had been betrothed to his sister, and Gholab had, in
			consequence, au intiaential post in the palace. It had been said some time before, that in consequenco of the appearance of a planet, English influence was nearly over in the Punjaub, and the family-three members of which have not been named-proposed to carry off the young Maha- rajah, expel ue, and reseat him without trammels on the throne. Four other arrests took place during the 18th, European sentries being placed over the arrested parties. The impression had gone forth that the Maharajah had actually been made away with, and to counteract this h;s Highness took a ride in public in the evening. Near the large Sikh city of Umritzir stands the strong fortress of Govindghur-a palace, a fortress, and a prison. The faith- fulness of the garrison of this stronghold having become doubtful, it was resolved to occupy it with lBritish troops, and accordingly a regiment of infantry and Skinner's Irregular Horse were despatched to capture it. A party of 50 of the Guide Corps first obtained admission on pre- tence of escorting prisoners. The cavalry followed, when the garrison were made aware that their services wero no longer required. Govindghur is now com- manded by Colonel M'Sheery; the cavalry have left; the infantry remain behind. It will be seen, on taking a summary viewv of the whole, that Mooltan is the only ouarter where the enemy has as yet appeared in force, or threatened to make head againse us. The Maharajah of Jamoo, thou,,h suspected, has not been convicted of treason, and all the evidence of his guilt we as yet appear to possess is founded ox the presumption a life of treachery affords, that when traitors are in the feld he will soon be found in the midst of them. He is at present in the province of Cashmere. The report that Chuttur Singh has a force of 10,000 men attendant on him, seems so monstrously improbable as to be unworthy of belief. Even of those wno followed Shere Singh into the camp of the enemy, a balf at least seem to repent of what they have done, and to be desirous to return. Our omn gross mis- management it has been that has tempted the Sikhs to treason. In all likelihood none of al this would have hap. pened had Colonel Lawrence been here.",-,0FFO-1848-NOV01_Issue.xml

The National Assembly Of France.,News,"THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY OF FRANCE.
			MINDAY, OCT. 30.
			At 2 o'clock, x Pagnerre, Vice-President, took the chair. The President informed the Assembly that he had re- ceived letters from about 30 members demanding leave of absence. This communication excited loud murmurs, but after some opposition, leave was granted.
			Mhe Assembly subsequently voted a sum of 12,500f. for converting to the publio use the libraries belonging to the former civi list.
			The Assembly next commonced the discussion. on the cor- sected budget of 1,8.
			M. Trouv4 Chauvel, the new Vinister of Finance, having ascended the tribune, began by proclaiming himself a zealous partisan of order. of property, ofthe inviolability of contracets, of fidelity to all engagements, and of the maintenance of existing rights. He theo stated that the republic onght not to be satisfied with a mere progress. The monarchy, he said, had stopped at no sacriice to pay the debts of the country. The republic shoul4 imitate its example, and he announced the immediate presentatian of a project of decree for the integral payment of the Trea- sury bonds and tho deposits in the savings'Banks. The financial difficultiee of the country originated, in his opinion, iu the too great development imparted by the former Go- vernment to public works, and the simultancous constructior of teo many railroad lines. He, however, considered it an im- perative dutyforthe Government to open new means of com- murication, which, independently of theirbeneficialresults for the country, woulu enable it to employ a greater number of unempleoyed workmen. The ordinary resources of the country, he hoped, if wisely appropriated, would amply suffice for aU the wants of the treasury. The Minister then reeapit*lated aU the resources, and, comparing them with the probable expenditure, estimated the deficit on the 31st of-December, 1848, at271,000,000fE, to cover which the trea- sury would have at its disposal the nmount of the two leans (250,000,000f.) and other resources. In 1849, however, the stricktt eoononyvwould bo necessary,for the extraordinary resources of 1848 would Lot be available; but he thought that the situation, already much improved, woald still further improve by the restoration of confidence, the in- crease in the receipts, and the decrease in the expenditure. To attain that end the Government should pursue a firm policy.Ribroad, and an energetic but conciliatory sysem of admiistration at home; but no ehange should be introduced into the present mode of taxation, aud the Assembly should carefully reject all the reforms propeBod, at least for tho pre. sent. Tho Minister next read a project of decree relative to the payment of the sums lodged in the sasinga' banks and the Treasury bonds, due on the 24th Februry last. The decree of the 3d of July, ef which his predecessor had de- plored the paieful necessity, had llot he said, anrsered the purpose. for which, it was intended-that is, the satisfac- tion of engaements, sinco the amount of the capital invested had nt been repaid. The object of the newf project was to repair that iujsstice, b:y reimbursin,g the whole amount of the investments. - -
			�. Sauvaire Bartheaemi, who followred, presented some observations on tho system ef finance, an4 recommended certain reforus and reductions in the expenditure, which, he thought, could be easily realized without any eetriment to the public service.
			M. Billault, the next speaker, contended, that the budget for 1848 really amounted to 1,900,000,OOOf., and that the endeavours of the Finance Committee to reduce it to 1,798,000,000f. would prove unavailable. The latter had cal- culated the receipts at 1,375,000,000, but he thought that they would not escceed 1,300,000.000. Theformer Minister of Finance had estimated at 70,000,000 the deficit for1849, and the new Minister hoped to balance the receipts and ex- penditures. He thought they were both mistaken. M. Billault then examined the different reductions that could be safely introduced into the expenditure. He disapproved the reductions effected in the salaries of public officers. This was a contemptible resource-men badly paid laboured badly, and the Republic could not expect good services from such functionaries. He then recommended the suppression of the Sinking Fund, and considerable reductions in the estimates-of thc departments of war, navy, and public works.
			M. Julien Laoroix was next heard, and was succeeded by M. Portalis, who develoned a new. system of taxation amidst the laughter of the Assembly. He supposed that France was capable of producinrg 1,200,000,000 of francs. One-third ofthat sum was to be supplied by atax on property, anotber by a tas 6n inheritance, and the last was to be real- ized by a voluntary tax. He demanded the suppression of the tax on landed property, so ruinous to agriculture; on doors and windows, the most vexatious of all taxes ; and on articles of consumption. These branches of revenuo should be replaced byatax on property, which wouldbe pro- gressive in a certain degree and just in all cases. The tax on successions might be rendered most produc- tive by the system be would recommend, and the 400 remaining millions would be furnished by the voluntary tax, that isa 'tax on6 tobacco, on celibacy, on manufactured articles, &c. He then recommended a revision of all the pensiote, condemned the Vepotism Qf merr in office, and pro- posed to-reduce the number of ministries from nine to Eve, -that is, a ministry Of agriculture and public securitY, a .xinistry of commerc9 and foreign affairs, of religious worehip and progress, of national defence on sea and land, *and a- xninissry.fori thcy -collection- of - the'laxes.

			Similar accounts have reached Paris. But there is nothing from either quarter beyond what we pub- lished in our first impression yesterday.
			The late editions of the Vienna papers, however, although of the same date, state that the reported b.mbardment had not then commenced, and ac- cording to the Anmsrian LloydR the confidence of the besieged had not materially abated. We are told by this journal that the ranks of the defenders in Vienna receive fresh accessions every day, both from the provinces and the camp of Auersperg, in which great agitation, aggravated by scarcity of provisions and sickness, is said to prevail. Even the Croats are, it is said, suffering from inter- mittent fever and cholera morbus to la most dreadful extent, whereas the inhabitants of Vienna enjoy good health and are still well supplied with provisions. In its 'latest intelligence"" tlhe Austrian Lloyd mentions a report that a collisionhad occurred at Grosshiflein (w&cn it does not state) between the Croatiau and Hungarian troops. Messengers from Nussdorf announced at noon on the 24th the desertion of a strong division of the Kheven- hiiller infantry. The remainder of the de- tachment fired upon the deserters, and re- ceived ia return a volley from the National Guard, wbich at first led to the diffusion of a (false) report that an attack had been made upon the Latter corps.
			In spite, however, of the favourable circumstances above-mentioned, the Austrian Lloyd does not be- lieve that the statvs quo in Vienna can be maintained another week unless an auxiliary army advances to its relief.
			The Oberpostamnts Zeitung contains the following important intelligence from Vienna:-
			On the 24th ult, information by telegraph was received from Vienna at Olmutz, that the Imperial troops on that day had taken the Tabor bridge after a short cannonade, and had advanced into the Leopoldstadt. FIarther advices were expected very shortlv.
			- ,The same paper also publishes the following pro- clamation of the Emperor
			""The events so painful to our heart which have happened in the capital of the Monarchy, and the state of anarchy continuEng there, bave, for the preservation of the Throne, and of the welfare of our peoplo, reduced us to the sad necessity of suppressing tho open revolt by force of arms, as we have announced to our people this our intention by the mnanifestoes of the 16th and 19th inst. The disturbed state of legal order in the capi- tal, and-the intended commencement of tiJitgry mea. sures, have rendered it impossible for the Diet there to pro. coed with its deliberations. We therefore thint fit to order the Diet immediately to adjourn its sittings, and convoke, it to meet in the city of Kremsier,on the 15th of November where it will be able, without disturbance and without in- terruption, to dedicate its activity entir-ly fo the great task
			of elaborating a constitution corresponding to the intereats of our sttes. Accordingly, aU representatives of the people, elected for the Constituent Diet, are summoned by these pre. sente definitively to meet in the city of Kremsior on the 15th of November, in order to proceed there with their interrupted deliberations on the constitu- tion, and to bring them, leaving aside all mat- ters of slighter importance, to a satisfactory end. We expect that all repreKentatives of the people elected for the Constituent Diet, mindful of their duties to their country, will.exert themselves to appear at the appointed time in the temporary seat of the Diet, in order to occupy themselvee zealously, and without delay, with the speedy solution of their great task.

			"" Dear companions and brethren !-Mfy conduct up to 6his day hes shown you what are my objeets and my wishes. As I am inspired with lovo for the Sclavonians, O [ am likewise convinced, in my inmost heart, that the Sclavonians are the chief support of Austria, and that, on the other hand, Aus- tria is an unavoidable condition for the Sclavonian interests, so tbat, 'if there were no Austria, we should be obliged to create it.' There certainly is i:ot one sensiblo man who does not know that the existence of Austria is most intimately conmected with that of Sdavism. It was therefore my duty, as a true and zealous Sclavonian, to humiliate and to anni- hilate at Pesth the anti-Austrian faction which rose hostile against the Sclavonians. But when I marched for Pesth, that stronghold of Magyar aristocracy, our common enemies rose, and had they conquered at Vienna my victory at Pesth would have been but half a victory, and Vienna would have been the chief support of our enemiet. Therefore I turned with my whole armr against Vienna. in order to chastise the enemies of the Sciavonians in the capital of Austria. My joy was immense when I saw laow my brethreninBohemia, ledby the sameconviction, still strength- ened by the departure of the delegates, carried their victory. laden banners before Vienna in order to join me and the fraternal armv, and there either to conquer as heroes or to fall with glory.

			The Breslauer Zciteung has again reports of travellers respecting the bombardment of Vienna. An Hungarian clergyman, who arrived at Breslau on the 26th ult., said, that since the afternoon of the 24th ult. Windischgartz, Auersp rg, and Jella- chich, alternately were bombarding the city. There was only an interruption on the night of the 25th. The following day, however, the firing was resurned and continued throughout the day, It was said that the Viennese had only provisions for five days.
			Another traveller, who arrived at Breslau on the 26th ult. at 10 o'clock, p.m., reported that the bem- bardment had been occasioned by four detachments of the Imperial troops attempting to go over to the Viennese, in order to prevent which Windiscbgratz opened a brisk fire.

			The Oesterreichische Zeitezng mentions some little outpost skirmishes which occurred in the course of the 23d ult. A combat, which threatened to be- come more serious and lasted for some hours, began on the Ntssdorfer line at half-past 4 o'clock p.m.

The Operations Of The Bank Of France.,News,"TIlE OP.R4ATIONS OF THE BA2AK OP FRANCz.
			(From the Jour7Mdes D6bat.1:.)
			w nen we rcaa tne long report of the Bank of France, published in Saturday's Jonila r, wo cannot help asking ourselves when this long movement of decline which the re- volution of February has impressed on the commercial and financial condition of our country will stop. We have now to register a further decline of 3,340,000f. in the portfolio of the Bank or the branches. In Paris from 69,157,129f. it has fallen to 67,873,684E., and in the branches from 111,39f!,609f. to 109,436,203f. Last week the decline w.'s 6,(000,000f., and the week before 36500,000. It hence foUows that there is a deficiency of 13:000,000f. in the mass of the bills (effes) discounted during the last three weeka.
			The amount of specie has not varied in Paris, and in the branches exhibits a slight increase. The total amount of this metallic reserve is 229,7B5,402f.
			The amount of the bills in arrear is between 304,123f. and 350,009f., and that of the bills cn mouffranc4e, both in Paris and the branches, exhibits a decrease of about 200,000f., and remains at 23,239.000f. The circulation of the Bank has increased by 3,000,000f., and amounts to 392,6U5,275f,, includiug the ciroulation of the branches. It will be seen that it every day approaches the limit assigned by the Provisional Government by the decree which gave its notes a forced circulation.
			The ""1 account-current"" of the Treasury has fallen to 10,301,203f. This amounts to a decrease, ia one week, of more than 6 000.000�.. which is. besides. exnlained bv the
			operations reapeoting the arrears of tho Rentes.
			The accounts-current of private individuals have expe- rienced an increase of 1,350,000f., and amonnt to 101,310.000f, including those of the branches, which amourt to nearly 25,000,000f.
			If it be wished to ascertain the situation of the Bank in the event of its thinking proper to resume the payment of its Rotes in specie in accordance with the advice given by the Minister of Finance at a recent sitting of our National Assembly, the calculation may easily be made.
			The amount of its circulation is 392,000,000f. Let us add thereto the amount of the deposits, in that we may have the entire amount of its poritive liabilities, and we shall have a sum of 504,000,000f. The metallic reserve amounts to 230,000,00Gf.-equivalent to 40 per cent. of the debts for which it is liable. It is seldom that the banks possess in their coffers a metallic capital proportionably so abundant, nor is it always-far fronm ita sign of prosperity. It is only right to add, that the Bank has g ranted, for the advan- tage of the State, a loan of 150,000,0t0f., of which oily 25;000,000f. havebeen paid. It is therefore expoEed to a more or less6immediate demand of 125.000,000C., to which 6,500,000f. must be added for the complement of the loen of 10,000,000f. advanced to the city of Paris. It will be seen that the liabilicies of the Bank may hereby be increased to the extent of 131,500,000f.; they would, in that case, amoant to 635,000,000f. or 636.000,000f. Sapposing the metallic re- Eerve should remain in stata quo, it would amount to about .20 w-r nrnt nn thn liahilitiP
			It is not uninteresting to glanmc at the corresponding state of the Bank of England. The last account published in London (on Sunday last) ftrnishes us vith the following re- 6iults:-
			The amount of the notes issued by the Issue �

			To meet this demand the BSank has a metaUlc capital of 13,417,2311., or 335, 500,OOOf. Thyis is nearly 45 per cent. on the liability. During the whole of the year which preceded the great commotion that broke out in the month of Febra- ary last, the proportion of the reserve of the liabilities fluc- tuated between 23 and 28 per cent. It i true that the year 1847 was one of financial crisis; and it is well-known that the English CabEiet thought proper to suspend the restric- tive clauso of PeePs Bank Act, in order to provide against the scarcity of specie.
			We have already obsenved that a great accumulation of speciein the coffers of the Bank is not always a sign of prosperity. This is proved at the present moment by the fisanncis state of things in London as well as in Paris. If the money accumulates in the cellars of the issue depart- ment, it is partly because England refuges the orders of the Continent when they aro for time. She w,ill not give credit to thc trade of Franoc or Germany, and, for our own parts, we cannot find fult with thia determination. This is one of the causes that explain the enormous difference exkibited by the last returns of the English Custom-house between the imports and the exports. She has sold us but libtle foe the last six months-first, because we were hardly in a situation to buy, and, secondly, because she would only seU for ready mr^uey. If she has imported more, there is a reason for this fact also-viz., the depreciation of all articles of mer- chandise in the markets of France and Germaij : it appears to us that it would be incorrect to attribute this result solely to tho premiums on exportation.
			We have heard much talk lately of mutual dependence. Behold the mutual dependence that revolutions inflict upon nations. They dry up the sources of credit and labour at home and abroatd. The revolution of February has not only ruined our credit at home, as is proved by the const4ntly decreasing amount of the portfolio of the Bank, but it hab ruined it in the foreign market, as the sterile accunlulatiou of gold in the celars of the Bank of England is a too evident sign.","THE OPERATIONS OF THE BANK OF FRANCE.

Supposing the metallic reserve should remain in statu quo, it would amount to about 30 per cent. on the liabilities. It is not uninteresting to glance at the corresponding state of the Bank of England.

As so large an amount of informatioa would bo indispens- ably necessary for his office, and as it would be impossible for him to collect the smad details as well as generalize the large results, he had endeavoured to organize a scheme of correspondeace calculated to enable him to receive all ths details he alluded to through various channels of oommuni- cation; and he thought his proposition would be the more lik;ely to receive the sanction of the commissioners,- as it did

As respected the physical conditions which attended individual cases of disease, it was evident that he could at the time acquire no personal knowledge as an eye-witness, for all such cases of illness were, it might be presumed, under proper medical treatment, and he could not, for obvious reasons, seek admission into houses already placed under the charge of authorised medical practitioners. As so large an amount of information would be indispensably necessary for his office, and as it would be impossible for him to collect the small details as well as generalize the large results, he had endeavoured to organize a scheme of correspondence calculated to enable him to receive all the details he alluded to through various channels of communication; and he thought his proposition would be the more likely to receive the sanction of the commissioners, as it did not call any new machinery into existence, but confined itself to the application of resources which were already actively employed. The Officer of Health then recommended to the commissioners that they should invite the assistance of the various medical officers employed under the Poor Law for the several city unions, which officers must naturally be well informed of the sanitary condition of the districts, and be peculiarly familiar with those localities which, although seldom visited by other practitioners, were of much interest to the sanitary legislator on account of their tendency to breed and to retain various forms of epidemic disease. He recommended, in case the commissioners approved of his views, that each of the 10 district surgeons should be directed to furnish a weekly report of the state of his neighbourhood, a matter which he considered to be of firstrate importance. He had already been able to make arrangements for obtaining the earliest knowledge of the deaths within the city, which would be a valuable addition to the parochial returns in many respects. It would also be desirable to procure accurate returns of sickness and mortality from the workhouses and prisons of the city. With such information as he had alluded to before him he should make general reports from time to time to the commissioners on variations in the health of the city, especially as regarded epidemic and other predominant disorders, and direct their attention to measures of local improvement.

(Before RECORDER.),News,"(Befor te RNcORDER.) i
			Adolphus Salita, a well-dressed, good-looking lad, rurrnn- dered to take his trial upon an indictment charging him -with the manslaughter *jf Robart Woodruff, by striking him un- lawfully with his fist.
			2dr. Platt prosecuted and Mir. Ballantine defende- the prisoner.
			The circumstances of this case were of rather nn unusual character, and the facts were involved in coneiderable obscu- rity. It appeared that the deceased was a lad about the samn age as tho prisoner, and he was in the service of a tradesman at Camberwell. He came home from his master'es on the 9th of September, and complained that on his way he had been struck on the head by a boy, 'but did not mention his name, and he pointed tobehind hisear, where there appeared to ba a lump the size of a nut, which he said was the consequence of the blow be had received. From this time the deceasedbecame graduallyin a very dangerous state. and about a fortnight after the day mentio-,ed he for the first time said that the prisoner was the boy wsho had struck him. He continued to sink, and shortly before his death Mr. Norton, the magistrate of the police court at Lam. beth, attended upon him for the purpose of takiig his deposition, and then, in the presence of the pri- aoner,, tho deceased boy said, that as he was going along the road to Cambervell, the prisoner, without any provocation or quarreUing, and, indeed, without a word being said, came up to him and struck him a blow behind the ear, and then raX away. The deceased lingered from the 9:h of September until the 6th of October, when he died; and, according to the evidence of two medical gentlemen named Cox and Flower, the death was attributabte to some extent, to the blow received upon the head; but, at the same time, it was stated that the deceased was in a very uuhealthy sondition, and the immediate cause of dissolution appeared to be dysentery and fever. When the prisoner was appre- hended he denied most positively having struck the decea6ed, urging that he had never auny quarrel or dispute with him, and therefore could have had no inducement to do so, and he rep-ated the statement when he was before the ma- gistrate.
			!dr. BArrANTINE, at the close of the case for the prosecu- tion. inquired of the Recorder it he thought there was suffi- cient evidence to go to:the jury ?
			The REoortmP said, it appeared to him that there was very great doubt in the case. In the first place the death was by no means satisfactorily shown to have been the re- sult of the blow, and even if that had been proved the evi- dence did not at aU prove that it was the hand of the pri. ower which inflicted that blow, but on the contrary that point was left in great doubt.
			,fr. BALL&NTINE said, that the only evidence upon that sabject was tho deposition of the deceased when in a dying condition; but it was very extraordinary, if he really knew who it was that struck him, that he should have told his aunt that he had been struck by a boy, and thac he did not mention the name of the prisoner until a considerable time afterwards.
			The REconRDn thought it was highly probable that his miind was wandering at the time, and that knowing the pri- soner he mentionel him as the boy who had struck bim. It appeared to him that there was so much doubt in the case tbatthe jury would not convict, and therefore he should relieve the learned counsel for the prisoner from addressing them.
			The jury said they entirely concurred in the observations of his Lordship, and they at once returned a verdict of Not

			hlr Ryland and Mr. Laurie conducted the prosecution on behalf of tho corporation of London. The prisoners were defended by Mr. Cooke Evans.
			From the evidence adduced it appeared that the prisoners are Irish people, and they occupied a room in the house of the husbanud or the prosecutrix in George-court, Snow- hilt They were in arrear of several weeks' rent, and the owners of the house were anxious to get rid of them; but according to their statement the prisoners would neither pay their rent nor go, and, in fact, set them at defiance. On the 18th of September a broker was employed to put in a distress, but the door of the prisoners' room was fastened, and he could not obtain admis- eion, and went away leaving his warrant in the bands of the prosecutrix. In the course of the same day the female pri- soner came dorn, and told the prosecutrix to go up to their room and her husband would pay her. The prosecutrix ac- cordingly went up-stairs, and the moment she entered the room she was attacked by both the prisoners and knocked down, and the male prisoner kielt upon her white his wife kicked her. She at length got up, when both the prisoners repeated their violence and struck her on the head with a shoemaker's hammer, both of the prisoners having a weapon of that description. Her screama for assistance brought up her husband, but directly he got into the room the female prisoner felled him to the ground by a blow of a hammer which instantly rendered him ineensible, and while he was in that state both the prisoners commenced kicking him- The prosecutriL was then enabled to get to the window, which she threw up and screamed "" Murder !"" The female prisoner immediately went to her, and after throwing some garden pots upon the people who had assembled in the street. she renewed her attacic upon the prosecutrix, and struck her again with the hammer. While this was goisg on the male prisoner commenced nailing up the door, exclaiming while he was doing so, "" Death or glory-we are sure to be hung, and we will kill every one who comes in,"" and the female prisoner joined in the exclamation. The polico arrived in i short time, but they were compelled to break open the door before they could obtaiu admission, and when they did so a most dreadful sight presented itself, the prosecutrix and her husband being covered with wounds and blood, and the room, according to the evidence of one
			of them, looking more like a slaughter-house than a human I habitation. The hammers with which the injuries had been inflicted were produced, and they appeared to be completely covered with blood. The prosecutrix was in the hospital for a fortnight, and she'was an out-patient to the present time, and was still suifering from the injuries she reseived on the occasion.
			The jury found both the prisoners Guilty upon that count of the indictment which charged the intention to do some grievous bodily harm.
			The RECORDER, in passing sentence, said that the pri- soners had been convicted of feloniously wounding the prosecutrix with intent to do her some grievous bodily harm; and every one who had heard the circUmstances of the case must see that they were of euch a character as ren. dered it impossible for the Coutt to refrain from passing a severo sentence upon persons convicted of such an offence, as anu eample to others. Persons of their country wvere, un- happily, too ready to resort to such proceedings, and it was high time that they aud all others should be taught that such atrocieus acts could not be per,oetrated in a civilized couatry without entaiing8severepunishment UpOn those who were convicted of them. He then sentenced the male prisoner to be trausported for 10 yeras, and the woman was ordered to be 2sept to hard labour for two years.
			The prisoners seemed oulte astounded at the sentence, and the w oman earnestly entreated mercy.
			The RECORDSn~ in reply to her entreaties, said, that be- fore she asked for mercy for herself she should have shown some to others.
			The RECORDER, after the prisoners had been removed, ob- served, that their offence was greatly on the increase. There were no less than 16 cases in the calendar of the present seg- sion, and this appeared session after session.
			William Wynn, 24, also an Irisheman, was indicted for felonionsly attempting to discharge a loaded pistol at Wil- liam Cornick with intent to maim and disable bica.

			Mr. Ryland and Mr. Robinson prosocuted.
			It appeared in this case that on the evening of the 28th of September the prosecutor, who is one of the City po. lice, obsorved the prisoner loitering about in the neighbour- hood of Brookes' wharf, and ordered him to go away. Ho found t.he prisoner again in the Eame place some time after- wards, and he then asked him what he wanted, and said he must give some account of himself; upon which the pri- soner immediately-presented a pistol at him,andexclaiming, "" You-, I've got it for you for last night,"" puUed the trigger, but the pistol fortunately did not go off. The prisoner then ran away, but was pursued by the prosecator and sslne other constables, when he turned round and pre- sented the pistol at them, and said, the first man who touched
			lrm was a dead man. He wfas at length secured, and on the 'pistol being exaained it was found to contain gunpowder and two buUets. The prisoner when questioned said, he bad only been three weeks from Ireland, but he refwsed to give any further account of himself, and, on his being asked why he carried the pistol about with him, Baid that he had been pulled about by a policeman on the previous night, and that he had provided himself wMthtbe pistol purpoe ytosoothita;hadwhen beforetheI

			The prisoner made no reply.
			The tECORDER having summed up,
			Thejury found the prisoner guilty of attempting to dis- chatsge the pistol at the prosacutor with intent to do him grievous bodily harm.
			The prisoner was then called up for judgment, and
			The RECORDtR, addressing him, said that a mystery hung over him, and also as to his object in coming to this country after having quitted Ireland at. a very critical period. It appeared; however, by his own showing, that he had pro. rided the pistol for the purpose of using it against the police; and that he bad endeavoured to carry out that object. What his purpose in coming to this country reaUy waF, seemed to be a mystery; he had not chosen to Eolvd that mystery, to state where he lived, or give any information -respecting his connexions; but still upon the facts that were before it the Court had no doubt as to the course which it ought to pursue. He thea sentenced the prisoner to be transported for 10 years.

Elizabeth Tinley stated, that she was married to the prisoner on the 25th of March, 1843. He stated to her that his name was Henry Edward Beaumont, and five months after the marriage he went to sea. Emily Georgina Rose, whose affections the prisoner had gained on the passage to India in the vessel in which he was acting as surgeon and she was a passenger, was the next witness called. The poor young creature was an object of great and general commiseration. She has not yet attained her 16th year, and upon being called upon according to the customary form to say whether she knew the prisoner, she was quite overpowered by her feelings, and sobbed and wept bitterly. It was well that she had but to answer a question or two. She stated that she was now in Sussex, living with her friends, and that she had been married to the prisoner at the Old Church in Fort William, Bengal, on the 30th of October, 1847, and had lived with him afterwards as his wife. Anna Amelia Bland, who was supported to the chair in the witness-box, and appeared to be in extreme affliction, gave evidence as to her marriage with the prisoner on the 30th of September, 1843, and stated that she had lived with him till the Saturday on which he was apprehended. Mr. Coach, a gentleman of well-known respectability in the city, stated that he was brother to Rebecca Coach, the prisoner's first wife. She was now living with her parents at Liskeard. The prisoner left her in April, 1842. The witness here produced the letter which the prisoner had written to his wife upon his departure, excusing himself for the absence of a day or two. The LORD MAYOR. - Could it have been easily ascertained that your sister was alive and at Liskeard? Witness. - Certainly. A letter from the prisoner to his wife, dated New York, 1842, was also produced, but was not read. The writing was compared with the writing in the prisoner's ""log,"" in which the prisoner had recorded his marriage, in India, to Emily Georgina Rose, as a matter of fact which he had no intention of concealing. Mr. W. Medland, medical and drug agent in Upper Thames-street, stated that he was married to the prisoner's first wife's sister, and knew him well. He believed the writing produced to be that of the prisoner. He had been at the prisoner's house at St. Blasey, in Cornwall, where the prisoner carried on the business of a druggist. ""I met the prisoner,"" said the witness, ""one day in Bishopsgate-street, and he told me he was a surgeon to a ship. I expressed some surprise at the circumstance, knowing his want of qualification, and he assured me that he had got his certificate from Apothecaries'-hall. Inquiry was subsequently made at Apothecaries'-hall upon the subject, when it was found that there was no entry of the name. It is supposed that the certificate which he became possessed of belonged to another person, whose name he erased by a chymical process for the purpose of substituting his own."" The LORD MAYOR. - Prisoner, do you wish to say anything? The prisoner, having retired for some minutes in order to communicate with his attorney, declined making any observations. Mr. Buchanan said, the prisoner wished him to state, that some of the women who came forward against him knew, when they were receiving his addresses, that he was a married man. The LORD MAYOR. - If such were the case it would be an aggravation of his crime, for in again marrying he was making those who were aware of the fact parties to the felony. The prisoner requested to be allowed to remain at the Giltspur-street Compter until the time of trial, for the convenience of consulting his solicitor upon the subject of his defence. The LORD MAYOR peremptorily refused to grant the favour, and said that Newgate presented adequate facilities. The prisoner, against whom many strong expressions of ill-suppressed indignation were uttered during the investigation, was then committed for trial. Between the first examination and the committal of the prisoner a gentleman of the medical profession to whom the prisoner had become accidentally known in India waited upon the Lord Mayor and made some details, which showed that the fellow had been long in the habit of imposing upon young women by a great variety of gross misrepresentations, and that he spoke of his marriages as forming examples of his genius in his plans of seduction. As the case at present stands, the heaviest punishment that can be inflicted upon the prisoner is transportation for seven years, but it is believed that the Apothecaries' Company may come forward to prosecute him for the forgery of the certificate. The LORD MAYOR stated to the friends of the poor young women who have been the victims of the prisoner, that as the case appeared to him to be one in which the interests and feelings of the public are essentially concerned, he should direct the City Solicitor to prosecute.",0FFO-1848-NOV01_Issue.xml

THE EXPECTED HIGH TIDES.-On Monday notices,Classified ads,"Tl{E ExPECTED HIGH TIDES.-Oni Monday notices were posted in various parts of Lambeth and other districts near the water side, cautioning the inhabitants against the high tides that aro expected to visit the Thames. The fol- lowing remarks concerming these tides may be read with some interest :-"" High tides may be expected on or about the 29th of October to the 1st of November, from the 10th of the same month to the 15tb, and from the 2tsh of November to the Ist of December ; also on the 9th of December, the 15th, 24th, to the 1st of January, 1849. The height of the tide will of coirse depend on the vind. If from the northern points, and blowing hard, the tUdes may be anticipated un- usuallg high, from the great quantity of rain which has fallen, and the amount of land wvater now about the locks on the river. ETvery precaution should, therefore, be taken by owners and tenants near the shores in sufficient time, as the destruction of property is likely to be most disastrous.""- Wnlobe.

We hav,e lkewlse chymnscaly ex- amined sampiles of the same varieties of coffee, roasted at the same timo In theusual way. and the result of this examination Is that in delicacy of flavour, odour, and as an article of diet,the coffee prepared by Messms. Dakhf's process Is. in our judgment, superior to that prepared in the ordinary way.
			"" We have also examined tbo apnatus used by MSessrs. Dakin for roasting coffee, and we find that all the surfaces with which the coffee comes in contact during the process aro of silver. We find also that geat ceaeis tazken so to resulate the degree of heat and the mode of its appii.alons as to render necessary a lnger time and lower temnperature to effect the roasting, whereby all rsk of charring the berry or of pro- duciag emopyrcumnatle oil is pretentod, the separation of add vapour is more gradeal and complete, and a larger portlout of aroma is retained than occurs ln the usual methods of coffee roasting.
